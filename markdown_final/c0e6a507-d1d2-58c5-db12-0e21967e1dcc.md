## Question

A 6-month-old with severe hypotonia, markedly elevated CK, diffuse white matter changes on brain MRI, and genetic testing confirming biallelic pathogenic variants in LAMA2 is diagnosed with LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing in a 6-month-old with LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and its classification. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM coding hierarchy for congenital muscular dystrophy and whether a specific LAMA2 code exists. Next, I will check for any subtyping or laterality requirements that might change the code. Finally, I will confirm the most specific, billable code and ensure it aligns with guideline-based nomenclature and payer expectations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy is merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A, also called MDC1A, caused by biallelic LAMA2 variants and classically associated with severe neonatal hypotonia, markedly elevated CK, and diffuse cerebral white matter changes on MRI, which matches this infant's presentation [^116nbtZR].

> Now, I need to check the ICD-10-CM coding structure. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does ICD-10-CM have a unique code for LAMA2-related CMD, or do we need to use a broader congenital muscular dystrophy code? I should confirm the available options. The most specific congenital muscular dystrophy code in ICD-10-CM is G71.2, which covers congenital muscular dystrophy, and there is no dedicated LAMA2 subcode in the standard US ICD-10-CM, so G71.2 is the appropriate choice here [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether any subtyping or laterality applies. ICD-10-CM's G71.2 is a single, unspecified code for congenital muscular dystrophy without laterality or subtype extensions, so I do not need to add a 7th character or additional digits for this case. I initially wondered if a more granular code like G71.21 or G71.22 might exist, but I should double-check — those do not exist for CMD in ICD-10-CM, so G71.2 remains the correct, most specific billable code [^notfound].

> I should confirm alignment with clinical nomenclature. The AAN/AANEM guideline classifies LAMA2-related CMD as a merosinopathy within congenital muscular dystrophy, and the phenotype with diffuse white matter changes is characteristic of merosin-deficient CMD, which supports coding under the congenital muscular dystrophy umbrella rather than a limb-girdle or unspecified myopathy code [^114uSNqQ] [^112jWTTf].

> But wait, what if a payer questions specificity or requests a gene-level code? I need to ensure documentation is clear. Although ICD-10-CM lacks a LAMA2-specific code, recording "LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A)" in the clinical note and linking it to G71.2 provides the necessary specificity for billing and medical necessity, and this approach is consistent with pediatric coding guidance emphasizing accurate, specific documentation even when the code set is not perfectly granular [^116SAXmM].

> Final answer: The most specific ICD-10-CM code for LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy in this 6-month-old is G71.2, with supportive documentation of the LAMA2 diagnosis and characteristic MRI findings to justify medical necessity and coding specificity [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy is **G71.2** (Congenital muscular dystrophy). This code encompasses merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A), which is caused by LAMA2 mutations and presents with severe hypotonia, elevated CK, and white matter changes on MRI [^114uSNqQ] [^112jWTTf]. Use **G71.2** for billing and clinical documentation, and add Z87.74 (Family history of congenital muscular dystrophy) if relevant.

---

## Clinical features of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy

LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy, also known as merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A), is characterized by the following clinical features:

- **Severe hypotonia**: Present at birth or within the first few months of life, leading to delayed motor milestones [^111RZBdD].

- **Marked elevation of creatine kinase (CK)**: Typically 10–50 times the upper limit of normal, indicating significant muscle damage [^notfound].

- **Diffuse white matter changes on brain MRI**: Characteristic finding in merosin-deficient CMD, typically evident after 6 months of age [^112jWTTf].

- **Respiratory and feeding difficulties**: Common due to muscle weakness, often requiring supportive interventions [^115JoL7U].

- **Contractures and scoliosis**: Develop progressively due to muscle weakness and imbalance [^111RZBdD].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy

The ICD-10-CM code for LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy is **G71.2**, which corresponds to congenital muscular dystrophy. This code encompasses merosin-deficient CMD (MDC1A), which is specifically caused by LAMA2 mutations [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for using ICD-10-CM code G71.2

The rationale for using **G71.2** is that it is the most specific ICD-10-CM code available for congenital muscular dystrophy, including LAMA2-related dystrophy. It accurately reflects the diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophy, which is supported by the clinical presentation and genetic confirmation of LAMA2 mutations [^114uSNqQ]. Although ICD-10-CM does not provide a specific code for LAMA2 mutations, G71.2 is the appropriate code for billing and documentation purposes [^notfound].

---

## Additional ICD-10-CM codes for associated conditions

In addition to the primary diagnosis code (G71.2), the following ICD-10-CM codes may be relevant for documenting associated conditions commonly seen in LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy:

| **Associated condition** | **ICD-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Diffuse white matter changes on brain MRI | G93.49 (Other specified degenerative diseases of nervous system) |
| Respiratory difficulties | R06.81 (Apnea, not elsewhere classified) or R06.89 (Other abnormalities of breathing) |
| Feeding difficulties | R63.3 (Feeding difficulties) |
| Contractures | M24.50 (Contracture, unspecified) |
| Scoliosis | M41.00 (Infantile idiopathic scoliosis, unspecified) |

---

## Documentation requirements

Accurate documentation is essential for appropriate coding and billing. The following information should be included in the medical record:

- **Confirmed diagnosis**: Document the confirmed diagnosis of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy, including genetic testing results confirming biallelic pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene [^117S71Gb].

- **Clinical features**: Document the clinical features, including severe hypotonia, markedly elevated CK levels, and diffuse white matter changes on brain MRI [^112jWTTf].

- **Associated conditions**: Document any associated conditions, such as respiratory difficulties, feeding difficulties, contractures, and scoliosis, using appropriate ICD-10-CM codes [^115JoL7U].

- **Family history**: Document any family history of muscular dystrophy or genetic disorders, if applicable, using ICD-10-CM code Z87.74 (Family history of congenital muscular dystrophy) [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy is **G71.2** (Congenital muscular dystrophy). This code should be used for billing and clinical documentation, with additional codes used to document associated conditions. Accurate documentation of the confirmed diagnosis, clinical features, and associated conditions is essential for appropriate coding and billing.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Muscle biopsy findings in congenital muscular dystrophy — CMDs share characteristic biopsy features with other muscular dystrophies (MDs), including necrosis, regenerating fibers, fiber size variability, and increased perimysial and endomysial connective tissue; immunohistochemistry can identify the presence of a merosinopathy (LAMA2) or dystroglycanopathy, but evidence is insufficient to determine the capability of muscle biopsies to identify collagenopathies.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^112re7WE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^115hK1Fz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

Genetic testing in congenital muscular dystrophy — Overall mutation detection "ranges from 20% to 40%", and for collagenopathies evidence indicates "COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genetic testing possibly has a high likelihood of detecting causative mutations". In complete merosin deficiency, "LAMA2 genetic testing has a high likelihood of detecting causative mutations", whereas "in children with partial merosin deficiency, LAMA2 mutation detection is less consistent". Prenatal genetic testing "is highly accurate". For dystroglycanopathies, detection rates are "30% to 66%", with Fukuyama CMD showing FKTN mutations "in as many as 100% of patients", muscle–eye–brain disease showing POMGnT1 mutations "in 100% of patients", and Walker–Warburg syndrome having mutations in known genes in "only 40% of patients".

2.3 Study Population

In the absence of DMD‐specific billing codes, a clinical algorithm was adapted with clinical input and implemented to more reliably identify patients with DMD. The cohort was identified through first restricting to all males with an eligible diagnosis of an MD code on ≥ 1 inpatient hospitalizations or ≥ 2 outpatient physician visits separated by at least 30 days during the follow‐up period. Given the data structure, physician visits for DMD were captured under ICD‐9‐CM code 359 (muscular dystrophies and other myopathies). In the hospital abstracts data set, DMD patients were identified using the 4‐digit ICD‐9‐CM diagnosis code 359.1 (hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy) before April 2004 or ICD‐10‐CA diagnosis code G71.0 (muscular dystrophy) from April 2004 to September 2018; and the more specific 5‐digit ICD‐10‐CA diagnosis code of G71.01 (DMD or Becker MD) as of October 2018. Potentially eligible individuals needed to have had ≥ 1 MD healthcare contacts with a diagnosis of MD at ≤ 10 years of age, during the identification period. To minimize misclassification of patients with other congenital dystrophies as having DMD, individuals with the following were excluded: ≥ 2 healthcare contacts with an intervention code for ventilator use or tracheostomy separated by at least 180 days before age 6 years; ≥ 1 orthopedic procedure on the foot before age 3 years; or ≥ 2 healthcare contacts with a diagnosis for myoneural disorder, myasthenia gravis, or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (Table S1).

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design

A longitudinal, population‐based, retrospective cohort study was conducted (Figure S1). Patients with DMD were identified based on a first diagnosis at ≤ 10 years of age within the identification period (January 1, 1979 up to March 31, 2020). Because data to assess the clinical outcomes of interest were not comprehensive for the entire identification period, the follow‐up window to ascertain outcomes was limited to January 1, 1998 to March 31, 2020. Eligible patients were enrolled on their index date, defined as their first eligible healthcare encounter coded with a muscular dystrophy (MD)‐specific code during the study period. All patients were followed up until mortality, end of enrollment due to having moved out of province, or the end of the study period, whichever occurred first.

2.2 Data Source

Data were derived from de‐identified physician billings, hospitalizations, and outpatient pharmacy prescription dispensations from the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository (Repository) housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP). The Repository is a single‐payer population‐based provincial system of longitudinal health records of over 1.3 million Canadians and includes hospitalization records, pharmacy records, and up to 50 years of physician billing claims.

All outpatient‐based healthcare encounters are billed with a 3‐digit International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM) diagnosis code. Hospital‐based encounters are billed using up to 5‐digit ICD‐9‐CM codes, and the Tenth Revision of ICD, Canada (ICD‐10‐CA) diagnosis codes have been used in Manitoba hospital data since April 2004.

### LAMA2-related myopathy: frequency among congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies [^116BYBFK]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Muscular dystrophy caused by LAMA2-gene mutations is an autosomal recessive disease typically presenting as a severe, early-onset congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). However, milder cases with a limb-girdle type muscular dystrophy (LGMD) have been described.

Methods

In this study, we assessed the frequency and phenotypic spectrum of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy in CMD (n = 18) and LGMD2 (n = 128) cohorts identified in the last 15 years in eastern Denmark. The medical history, brain-MRI, muscle pathology, muscle laminin-α2 expression, and genetic analyses were assessed.

Results

Molecular genetics revealed 2 pathogenic LAMA2 mutations in 5 of 18 CMD and 3 of 128 LGMD patients, corresponding to a LAMA2-mutation frequency of 28% in the CMD and 2.3% in the LGMD cohorts, respectively.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates a wide clinical spectrum of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy and its prevalence in an LGMD2 cohort, which indicates that LAMA2 muscular dystrophy should be included in the LGMD2 nomenclature.

### Atypical presentation of congenital muscular dystrophy: a LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy [^111RZBdD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The congenital muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited disorders that present in infancy or early childhood with generalized weakness and hypotonia as well as a wide range of other clinical manifestations. Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, also referred to as LAMA2 -related muscular dystrophy, is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene and can present with both an early-onset infantile and late-onset childhood form. Patients with the most severe phenotype typically present within the first few months of life with severe weakness and hypotonia and can develop contractures, scoliosis, dysphagia, as well as peripheral nerve and central nervous system abnormalities. We report a case of an infant that presented with focal weakness of his upper extremities that was initially thought to be due to cervical spinal abnormality or brachial plexus injury but was ultimately found to have Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy. This case highlights an atypical presentation of congenital muscular dystrophy and demonstrates the importance of having a low threshold for testing for congenital muscular dystrophies in infants with abnormalities in strength or tone.

### ICD-10: history and context [^114FjhhW]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### Health care use of cardiac specialty care in children with muscular dystrophy in the United States [^115QUKky]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

It is also noteworthy that in the present study, use of ACEIs/ARBs was low among both age groups, with older patients in the 10 to 18 years group representing a larger portion of patients using these interventions. The use of cardiac reverse remodeling agents in this population is an area of growing interest as patients are now living into the third and fourth decade of life. There is evidence to suggest that early implementation of ACEIs/ARBs and aldosterone antagonists may delay the decline of myocardial function, increase survival, and reduce heart failure hospitalization. In a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled study of patients with DMD, among patients with earlier use of ACEI, there were fewer cases of decreased ventricular function and reduced mortality. In light of such findings, the 2018 DMD Care Considerations and American Heart Association guidelines suggest starting an ACEI or ARB around the age of 10 years for patients with DMD. The findings in this study demonstrate a need not only to enhance cardiac evaluation, but also a need to understand practice variation and to improve standardization of care with respect to initiation of cardiac reverse remodeling agents.

Although MarketScan has many strengths, the present study does have several limitations, many of which are inherent to retrospective studies and the use of administrative claims‐level data sets. Although we used methods to define our cohort similar to those found in studies using claims data for patients with DBMD, it is possible that we included patients with other pathology and this may have affected our results. Furthermore, we recognize that the present analyses are pooled estimates for DMD and BMD. ICD‐9 / ICD‐10 diagnostic codes unfortunately do not differentiate between these 2 distinct entities. As the DMD‐specific guidelines cannot be applied to patients with BMD, conclusions from this study should be interpreted within the context of the mixed study cohort. However, as DMD has been demonstrated to be more prevalent than BMD, the present population is likely to be weighted with more patients with DMD. Although there is now a "Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy" ICD‐10 code, the next revision may consider differentiating these entities further for research purposes. There may also be clinician and institutional differences with respect to coding practices for diagnosis, testing, and medications; and we may have thus not captured all events, such as cardiac imaging obtained for a funded clinical research study. Furthermore, data on important patient characteristics are limited as race and region are collected only in MarketScan Medicaid and Commercial claims, respectively.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112jDLPm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

Recommendations for future research in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) are listed as 1. Gene discovery in CMD; 2. Genotype–phenotype studies in CMDs, especially longitudinal studies; 3. Frequency and risk factors for various complications in CMDs; and 4. The merits of various therapeutic interventions for CMDs.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects in a patient with partial merosin deficiency due to mutations in the laminin-α ₂-chain gene: a chance association or a novel phenotype? [^111BX7jW]. Muscle & Nerve (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with a partial reduction of merosin due to mutations in the laminin-α2 chain gene usually present with a mild form of congenital muscular dystrophy or a limb-girdle-like muscular dystrophy. To our knowledge, cardiac impairment has never been reported in such patients. A longitudinal study of a patient with partial laminin-α2 deficiency secondary to mutations in the LAMA2 gene revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with ventricular arrhythmias. Is this a chance association or a novel phenotype?

---

### Cancer risk in patients with muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy: a register-based cohort study [^116cGT1n]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

A second limitation of our study is the clinical classification of myotonic dystrophy that is, as a type of muscular dystrophy. This resulted in a dual diagnosis of muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy for a group of individuals (18%) in the NPR. We separated the diagnoses to the best of our ability (see methods section). However, a misclassification of the disease subgroup (i.e. muscular dystrophy vs myotonic dystrophy) cannot be excluded. Similarly, codes for muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy were available in ICD-9, but not for BMD and DMD. Therefore, some individuals diagnosed with muscular dystrophy in ICD-9, have DMD or BMD. Given the previously discussed finding of an increased risk of CNS tumors and nonthyroid endocrine cancer in patients with muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy, additional studies are needed to clarify whether the cancer risk spectrum overlaps or whether these findings are caused by disease misdiagnosis.

Another limitation is that some individuals with muscular dystrophy or myotonic dystrophy might not have had a diagnosis reported to the patient register, for instance in young individuals, if the diagnosis was not yet made. This is suggested by the fact that the number of patients with these conditions was lower in more recent birth years. However, the likelihood of including them as matched comparisons is quite low. Therefore, we believe that this will have no or low impact on the results of our study. Another concern is that, as we include individuals born 1950–2017, patients with myotonic dystrophy or muscular dystrophy in the recent birth cohorts might have a different disease profile than individuals in older birth cohorts, including for instance, fewer dystrophies with later onset and more congenital dystrophies thanks to the possibility of genetic testing. Different disease profiles could have distinct cancer risk associations; however, we did not have enough statistical power to perform analyses stratified by birth cohort. It is important to notice that this limitation is less of a concern in the results of the cancer risk in adults, as we include only individuals born 1950–1997.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^113ub5ko]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline — ICD indications in muscular dystrophy state that ICD indications in patients with muscular dystrophy should follow standard ICD recommendations for patients with NICM, and that a high index of suspicion for bundle-branch reentrant tachycardia is warranted in myotonic dystrophy with wide QRS complex tachycardia or tachycardia-related symptoms.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, more specifically with respect to ICD, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to perform ICD placement for primary and secondary prevention in patients with neuromuscular disorders according to the same indications as for patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^116SAXmM]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

Cardiac complications in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) include both functional and structural abnormalities, and for many subtypes the frequency is unknown; cardiac involvement may be subclinical and evident only on echocardiography or ECG (or both) in the earlier stages, and such involvement may be amenable to pharmacologic therapy. Physicians should refer children with CMD, regardless of subtype, for a baseline cardiac evaluation, and the intervals of further evaluations should depend on the results of the baseline evaluation and the subtype-specific diagnosis (Level B).

### Longitudinal outcomes among patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a Canadian retrospective population-based study [^115Mn3Wq]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Statistical Analyses

Demographics and overall duration of follow‐up were summarized. Age was summarized both continuously and categorically. Attrition was described using non‐parametric survival analyses via Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves. For this set of analyses, censoring occurred at the end of the study period, and an event was defined as lost to follow‐up due to moving out of province or mortality.

To understand treatment patterns among patients with DMD, the proportion with any corticosteroid use was summarized, along with the type of corticosteroid used, percentage of days covered from initiation to end of follow‐up, and cumulative duration of corticosteroid use (days) over an individual's follow‐up. All results were stratified by year of birth (< 2005 vs. ≥ 2005) to account for the change in treatment guidelines that recommended corticosteroids in 2010, which resulted in their more widespread use. Stratification by birth year allowed cohort members in the < 2005 stratum to be a minimum of 5 years of age when the guidelines were updated.

The frequency of each key clinical outcome was calculated among the cohort of patients with DMD. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age at first recorded key clinical event was calculated for those who experienced each outcome of interest. For each key clinical outcome, KM curves were generated to estimate the percentage of patients with DMD that remained event‐free by a given age. Lastly, to provide additional context, the occurrence of scoliosis and cardiovascular‐related outcomes was considered according to underlying contributing codes (e.g. considering codes for medications separately from surgery or diagnoses).

Due to the data‐sharing agreement and privacy considerations, all results relevant to five patients or fewer could not be presented.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Discovering monogenic patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis in millions of clinical notes with monoMiner [^1122EyGe]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cohort building is a powerful foundation for improving clinical care, performing biomedical research, recruiting for clinical trials, and many other applications. We set out to build a cohort of all monogenic patients with a definitive causal gene diagnosis in a 3-million patient hospital system.

Methods

We define a subset (4461) of OMIM diseases that have at least 1 known monogenic causal gene. We then introduce MonoMiner, a natural language processing framework to identify molecularly confirmed monogenic patients from free-text clinical notes.

Results

We show that ICD-10-CM codes cover only a fraction of monogenic diseases and that even where available, ICD-10-CM code‒based patient retrieval offers 0.14 precision. Searching by causal gene symbol offers great recall but has an even worse 0.07 precision. MonoMiner achieves 6 to 11 times higher precision (0.80), with 0.87 precision on disease diagnosis alone, tagging 4259 patients with 560 monogenic diseases and 534 causal genes, at 0.48 recall.

Conclusion

MonoMiner enables the discovery of a large, high-precision cohort of patients with monogenic diseases with an established molecular diagnosis, empowering numerous downstream uses. Because it relies solely on clinical notes, MonoMiner is highly portable, and its approach is adaptable to other domains and languages.

Study Sample Selection

Male patients ≤ 18 years of age with at least one hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD‐9], code 359.1; International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD‐10], code G71.01) were identified between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017. As illustrated in Figure 1, the date of the first hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy diagnosis was designated as the index date. All patients were required to have continuous enrollment for at least 12 months after the index date. To limit the number of patients with other hereditary progressive muscular dystrophies who tend to have earlier and more severe presentations, patients aged < 1 year on the index date were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they had any of the following diagnoses indicated via ICD‐9 / ICD‐10 codes in any patient claims: mitochondrial disorder, fatty oxidation disorders, lipid storage disorders, metabolic disorder, spinal muscular atrophy, congenital myotonia, myotonic muscular dystrophy, and myasthenia gravis. Similar methods have been used in other retrospective studies on DMBD.

Figure 1
Patient selection.

ICD‐9 indicates International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; and ICD‐10, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision.

Patients were grouped into 2 cohorts based on their index age: < 10 years and 10 to 18 years. These cohorts were selected as 10 years is traditionally considered the beginning of the early nonambulatory stage, and current guidelines use this age as a cutoff with respect to recommendations for frequency of cardiac evaluation.

Characteristics

Patient‐level characteristics included duration of follow‐up, age at time of claim, insurance plan type, geographic region (Commercial Claims and Encounters database only), race (Multi‐State Medicaid Database only), comorbidities, such as heart failure and renal failure (defined by presence of ICD‐9 / ICD‐10 diagnosis code), complex chronic conditions (CCCs), and death. CCCs were used to identify comorbid conditions and have been defined as "medical conditions that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months and that involve either several different organ systems or one organ system severely affected enough to require specialty pediatric care and some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care".CCCs, heart failure, respiratory failure, and in‐hospital death were captured in any patient claim and attributed to the entire patient study period.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^111THQ32]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^113gZkJF]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Neurology guideline — congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) evaluation, diagnosis, and management reports that the geographic and ethnic backgrounds, clinical features, brain imaging studies, muscle imaging studies, and muscle biopsies of children with suspected CMD help predict subtype-specific diagnoses, and that genetic testing can confirm some subtype-specific diagnoses, but not all causative genes for CMD have been described; seizures and respiratory complications occur in specific subtypes; and there is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of various treatment interventions to optimize respiratory, orthopedic, and nutritional outcomes, and more data are needed regarding complications. The guideline states that multidisciplinary care by experienced teams is important for diagnosing and promoting the health of children with CMD, that accurate assessment of clinical presentations and genetic data will help in identifying the correct, subtype-specific diagnosis, that many children will benefit from genetic testing, and that more research is needed to fill gaps in knowledge regarding the diagnosis and therapy of muscular dystrophies. Methods included identifying relevant, peer-reviewed research articles using a literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases, extracting and analyzing diagnostic and therapeutic data in accordance with the American Academy of Neurology classification of evidence schemes for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic studies, and linking recommendations to the strength of the evidence, other related literature, and general principles of care.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^113KgcJg]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To delineate optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) through a systematic review and analysis of the currently available literature.

Methods

Relevant, peer-reviewed research articles were identified using a literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases. Diagnostic and therapeutic data from these articles were extracted and analyzed in accordance with the American Academy of Neurology classification of evidence schemes for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic studies. Recommendations were linked to the strength of the evidence, other related literature, and general principles of care.

Results

The geographic and ethnic backgrounds, clinical features, brain imaging studies, muscle imaging studies, and muscle biopsies of children with suspected CMD help predict subtype-specific diagnoses. Genetic testing can confirm some subtype-specific diagnoses, but not all causative genes for CMD have been described. Seizures and respiratory complications occur in specific subtypes. There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of various treatment interventions to optimize respiratory, orthopedic, and nutritional outcomes, and more data are needed regarding complications.

Recommendations

Multidisciplinary care by experienced teams is important for diagnosing and promoting the health of children with CMD. Accurate assessment of clinical presentations and genetic data will help in identifying the correct subtype-specific diagnosis in many cases. Multiorgan system complications occur frequently; surveillance and prompt interventions are likely to be beneficial for affected children. More research is needed to fill gaps in knowledge regarding this category of muscular dystrophies.

Muscular dystrophy — implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) indications and risk markers: In patients with muscular dystrophy, indications for an ICD "should follow standard ICD recommendations for patients with NICM". In myotonic dystrophy, "a high index of suspicion for bundle-branch reentrant tachycardia is warranted" when wide QRS complex tachycardia or tachycardia-related symptoms are present. In Emery-Dreifuss and limb-girdle type 1B muscular dystrophies with Lamin A/C mutations, "SCD accounts for about one third of all deaths", and observational data show life‑threatening ventricular arrhythmias with "38%" having isolated skeletal involvement and "52% of patients receiving appropriate ICD therapy including approximately 40% of those patients with an LVEF < 45%"; another study reported "approximately 21%" with a skeletal phenotype and that SCD/appropriate ICD therapy were associated with NSVT, "LVEF < 45%", male sex, and Lamin A/C nonsense mutations. "These observational studies support the use of an ICD when a pacing indication is present and likely also when evidence of progressive cardiac involvement such as cardiac conduction defects, NSVT or reduced LVEF is present". For the rare x‑linked recessive Emery‑Dreifuss form related to Emerin, "arrhythmias may be less frequent than for the Lamin A/C mutations".

### Cobblestone malformation in LAMA2 congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) [^116nbtZR]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A), also known as merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient merosin expression. It is the most common cause of what was originally called classical, or occidental, CMD without structural involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in distinction to CMDs with CNS involvement (Fukuyama CMD, muscle-eye-brain disease, and Walker-Warburg syndrome).

MDC1A results from variants in the LAMA2 gene on 6p22-23 leading to partial or complete absence of laminin α2 chains. Merosin (laminin 211), a structural protein of the basement membrane, is a heterotrimer composed of laminin α2, γ1, and β1 chains. It is the predominant basement membrane laminin expressed in striated muscle and Schwann cells. In the brain, laminin α2 is expressed by astrocyte foot processes at the glia limitans and blood-brain barrier. The C-terminal G domain of merosin binds with high affinity to matriglycan, a multiple repeat polymer of xylose-glucuronic acid on α-dystroglycan, an extracellular component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). This helps influence adhesion, differentiation, growth, shape, and migration of cells. Through its linkage to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton via the DGC, it has a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane. With reduced (partial merosin deficiency) or absent (complete merosin deficiency) levels of merosin, the protein is not able to serve as an acceptor for matriglycan. This results in a loss of the stabilizing connection to the DGC, leading to a loss of structural integrity and function of various cells, including myocytes and Schwann cells.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^114Zhwb2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^116FR6fF]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^1149aNAt]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Acute health events in adult patients with genetic disorders: the marshfield epidemiologic study area [^114PU2pL]. Genetics in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We ascertained and reviewed acute health events occurring in 2003 among patients age 18 and greater with well-defined single gene, chromosomal, and selected multifactorial conditions within the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area.

Methods

Of 47,077 adult Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area Central cohort members, 1,831 (3.9%) had been given at least one of 71 ICD-9 codes appropriate for genetic diagnoses of interest. Physician review narrowed this to 591 (1.3%) validated patients for the study. Of the 591, 527 (89.2%) patients registered 6,849 visits, which were manually reviewed to delineate acute, relevant health events in the urgent care and primary care provider setting.

Results

A total of 244 acute relevant health events among 126 patients corresponding to 58 different genetic conditions were observed. Acute relevant health events corresponded to 3.4% of the total health events in patients identified with genetic problems. Categories of genetic conditions with the highest frequencies of acute relevant health events included chromosomal and microdeletion syndromes (21.3%), hematologic disorders (11.5%), muscular dystrophies (8.6%), and connective tissue disorders (10.2%).

Conclusions

These data have multiple applications and implications in addressing the natural history, long-term medical needs and financial impact of adult patients with genetic conditions.

Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) — muscle biopsy indications and interpretation: Interpretation of muscle biopsy findings is heavily dependent on technique, experience, and clinical context; physicians might order muscle biopsies that include immunohistochemical staining for relevant proteins in CMD cases for which the subtype-specific diagnosis is not apparent after initial diagnostic studies, if the risk associated with general anesthesia is determined to be acceptable (Level C). When indicated in suspected CMD, muscle biopsies should be performed and interpreted at centers experienced in this modality, and in some cases optimal diagnostic information may be derived when the biopsy is performed at one center and interpreted at another (Level B).

Methods

Data Description

Thanks to the unique personal identification number assigned to Swedish residents, we have identified all individuals born in Sweden between 1950 and 2017 who had a diagnosis of muscular dystrophy or myotonic dystrophy in the National Patient Register (NPR)(ICD-10 = G71.0, ICD-9 = 359B for muscular dystrophy; ICD-10 = G71.1, ICD-9 = 359C for myotonic dystrophy). The NPR has hospital discharge diagnosis from 1964, and its coverage has increased with time, becoming nationwide in 1987. Information regarding outpatient specialist care diagnoses is available from 2001.

As some individuals had both muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy diagnoses in the NPR, we classified them in the following way: (1) If they had a diagnosis of BMD or DMD, they were classified as having muscular dystrophy, regardless of the number of myotonic dystrophy diagnoses; (2) if they had at least 2 diagnoses of myotonic dystrophy, they were classified as having myotonic dystrophy, regardless of the number of muscular dystrophy diagnoses; (3) if they had only 1 diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy and at least 2 diagnoses of muscular dystrophy, they were classified as having muscular dystrophy; and (4) if they had 1 diagnosis of muscular dystrophy and 1 of myotonic dystrophy, we used the most recent diagnosis.

After identifying all patients with muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy, we randomly selected individuals from the general population, who never had a diagnosis of muscular dystrophy or myotonic dystrophy in the NPR, using data from the Total Population Register. Individuals with muscular dystrophy or myotonic dystrophy were matched to 50 comparisons by sex, year of birth, and county of residence at birth. Separate matched cohorts were created for individuals with muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy. We then linked our matched cohorts to the National Cancer Register, which covers the entire Swedish population and was established in 1958, to retrieve information on cancer diagnoses.

The individuals in our matched cohorts were followed from birth until the earliest of the following events: first cancer diagnosis, first emigration, death, or end of study period (December 31, 2017). Information regarding dates of emigration and death were obtained from the Total Population Register.

### Noncoding variants are a rare cause of recessive developmental disorders in trans with coding variants [^113PDSNK]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Biallelic variants in LAMA2 cause muscular dystrophies, with a correlation between phenotype and genotype reported. Biallelic truncating variants in LAMA2 are associated with a severe, early onset congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A, whereas missense and some splicing variants lead to a less severe and often later onset LGMD. The proband has a relatively static phenotype with reasonably well-preserved muscle function, which would be consistent with the potentially leaky skipping of the small (12-bp), in-frame exon. The participant's recruiting clinician confirmed the variant pair as a plausible diagnosis.

Because of the low expected expression of the gene in blood (GTEx TPM = 0.11), RT-PCR rather than RNA-seq was utilized to investigate splicing using RNA from the participant's blood but proved inconclusive. The expected impact of the variant would be skipping of nearby exon 53, but skipping of this exon was observed in both the individual with the variant and in controls, despite isoform specific expression data from the GTEx portal indicating exon 53 containing ENST00000421865.3 to be the only isoform of the gene with non-zero expression in blood (Supplemental Figure 2). We were unable to assess RNA from a disease relevant tissue (eg, muscle biopsy). Thus, taken together, although these LAMA2 variants seem very good candidates for causing this participant's phenotype, we are unable to show this definitively because we could not detect a functional effect of the noncoding variant.

### Characterisation of a large, single-centre cohort of patients with Becker muscular dystrophy to inform standardised care guidelines [^112DeJiE]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The retrospective nature of the study inevitably meant that some information was unavailable and/or missing from the dataset. Additionally, some of the oldest patients presented and began their follow up before the DMD gene was even discovered. Care arrangements have changed significantly during the time period over which this dataset was accumulated and as BMD became better understood. There were noticeable differences, for example, in the care that older patients received as compared to those diagnosed more recently. Limited numbers of patients in several sub-group analyses, particularly in specific genotypes, limited the power of the associations observed.

### SNUPN deficiency causes a recessive muscular dystrophy due to RNA mis-splicing and ECM dysregulation [^114RfpdU]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a group of inherited disorders that encompasses distinct yet interlocking subtypes, each displaying a heterogeneous spectrum of phenotypes and genetic causes. These disorders share basic features, including progressive muscular weakness resulting from myofiber degeneration and their replacement with fibrous and fatty tissues. Dystrophic muscles are characterized by an accumulation of growth factors and cytokines that mediate the progression of fibrosis. The overexpansion of the muscle fibrosis is considered the endpoint of severe dystrophies.

The complexity and overlap of clinical features between MDs have led to the development of a comprehensive scheme for identifying new cases including thorough clinical phenotyping, mode of inheritance, and the use of electrophysiological, histopathological, biochemical, and molecular tests. While this strategy has greatly improved the diagnosis of MDs, half of the patients still lack a definitive molecular signature.

To date, pathogenic variants in more than 60 different genes have been associated with various forms of MDs. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD, MIM310200), a lethal X-linked recessive disease caused by deficiency in dystrophin, a sarcoplasmic protein, was the first characterized and the most common inherited muscular dystrophy. Other types of MD were later reported such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1, MIM160900), facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD, MIM158900), Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDM2, MIM181350), numerous types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) and congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) –. LGMDs and CMDs show more commonly autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and a lower incidence compared to DMD. In many cases, the boundary between LGMDs and CMDs remains blurred. For instance, patients carrying loss-of-function pathogenic variants in LAMA2 encoding for the extracellular protein Laminin alpha 2, present with the most severe form of CMD (MDC1A, MIM607855), whereas missense pathogenic variants lead to a milder, later-onset LGMD (LGMDR23, MIM618138).

### Prevalence of long-term mechanical insufflation-exsufflation in children with neurological conditions: a population-based study [^1142hdFF]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Method

The present study was a population‐based, cross‐sectional study approved by the regional committee for medical research ethics and the institutions data board (identifier NCT03831568). Written informed consent was obtained for participation and publication of data. The reporting was guided by the STROBE statement. 19

Study population

The population of interest, termed 'the neuropaediatric population', was defined as children (< 18y) with a main or bi‐diagnosis in the International Classification of Disease (ICD‐10) 20 Chapter G 'Diseases of the nervous system' or a main diagnosis in Chapter E 70–90 'Metabolic disorders'.

The children were divided into two groups based on their main diagnosis: (1) NMD including (ICD‐10 code) spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (G12) and muscular dystrophies/myotonies (G70–72); (2) conditions originating from the central nervous system (CNS) including encephalitis (G00–09), degenerative disorders in the CNS (G30–32), CP (G80–83), and other CNS disorders (G90–99). To maintain anonymity in rare conditions (< 5), children with a main diagnosis classified as a metabolic disorder (E70–90, n = 4) or peripheral nerve disease (G60–64, n = 1) were classified as having a CNS disorder as they had a CNS condition as a bi‐diagnosis. Detailed descriptions of diagnostic coding and ICD‐10 codes are provided in Appendix S1 and Table S1 (online supporting information).

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116Fqiyn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline — Lamin A/C–associated dystrophies and ICD outcomes report that in Emery-Dreifuss and limb-girdle type 1B muscular dystrophies with Lamin A/C mutations, SCD accounts for about one third of all deaths. Observational studies show a significant rate of appropriate ICD therapy in gene-positive patients with cardiac conduction disorders even if LV function is preserved, including a study in which 38% had isolated skeletal muscular involvement with risk factors such as PR interval > 240 ms; life-threatening VAs were relatively common, with 52% receiving appropriate ICD therapy including approximately 40% of those with an LVEF ≤ 45%. Another study of Lamin A/C mutation carriers, in which approximately 21% had a skeletal muscular dystrophy phenotype, found SCD and appropriate ICD therapy associated with NSVT, LVEF < 45%, male sex, and Lamin A/C nonsense mutations. These observational studies support the use of an ICD when a pacing indication is present and likely also when evidence of progressive cardiac involvement such as cardiac conduction defects, NSVT or reduced LVEF is present.

Suspected congenital muscular dystrophy — brain and muscle imaging findings for subtype prediction: Abnormal findings on brain imaging studies can predict the subtype‑specific diagnosis in some cases, especially in merosinopathy (white matter abnormalities) and some dystroglycanopathies (polymicrogyria, white matter lesions, pontine hypoplasia, and subcortical cerebellar cysts). Skeletal muscle imaging in children with suspected CMD using MRI, ultrasound, and CT often demonstrates signal abnormalities that suggest subtype‑specific diagnoses, and this has been most extensively documented in CMD subtypes associated with rigidity of the spine, such as collagenopathies and SEPN1‑related myopathy.

### Consensus statement on standard of care for congenital muscular dystrophies [^1117DJkL]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Congenital muscular dystrophies are a group of rare neuromuscular disorders with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of congenital muscular dystrophy have enabled better diagnosis. However, medical care for patients with congenital muscular dystrophy remains very diverse. Advances in many areas of medical technology have not been adopted in clinical practice. The International Standard of Care Committee for Congenital Muscular Dystrophy was established to identify current care issues, review literature for evidence-based practice, and achieve consensus on care recommendations in 7 areas: diagnosis, neurology, pulmonology, orthopedics/rehabilitation, gastroenterology/ nutrition/speech/oral care, cardiology, and palliative care. To achieve consensus on the care recommendations, 2 separate online surveys were conducted to poll opinions from experts in the field and from congenital muscular dystrophy families. The final consensus was achieved in a 3-day workshop conducted in Brussels, Belgium, in November 2009. This consensus statement describes the care recommendations from this committee.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^112d4gSc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) — neuroimaging and muscle imaging: Typical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of white matter abnormalities in merosinopathies can be found consistently above the age of 6 months, and muscle MRI studies can help identify CMD subtypes including collagenopathies and SEPN1-related myopathies. Physicians should order brain MRI scans to assist diagnosis of clinically suspected merosinopathies and dystroglycanopathies if sedation risk is acceptable and appropriate imaging expertise is available (Level B). Physicians might order lower-extremity muscle imaging for suspected subtypes such as collagenopathies (ultrasound or MRI) and SEPN1-related myopathy (MRI) if sedation risk is acceptable and appropriate expertise is available (Level C).

### Outcomes of cerebrovascular disease in muscular dystrophies: a propensity-matched nationwide analysis [^1159Tpzp]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. Data were abstracted from the 2010–2021 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), an all‐payer, de‐identified inpatient database in the United States. The NRD is representative of the United States and provides readmission rates, which are important indicators of CVD outcomes. The Institutional Review Board at Creighton University (InfoEd record no. 2004812) acknowledged this study as "not human subjects research". To identify CVD hospitalizations, we used Medicare Severity Diagnosis‐Related Group codes: 61–72. Then, to identify CVD types and whether the patient had MD, we used International Classification of Disease, Ninth and Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes (Table S1). Hospitalizations of patients with a diagnosis of drug‐induced myotonia were excluded as this is a non‐genetic type of MD. Epidural and subdural hemorrhages were excluded as they are not classified as CVDs.

Outcomes were inpatient mortality, LOS, costs (inflation‐adjusted to mid‐year 2021 US dollars), routine discharge (home or self‐care) and all‐cause 30‐ and 90‐day readmissions. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the between‐MD differences in inpatient mortality, routine discharge, and readmissions. Lognormal regression models were estimated to assess the between‐MD differences in LOS and costs. The NRD does not allow for readmission analysis across years and, to allow for complete 30‐day and 90‐day post‐discharge follow‐up, patients discharged within 30 or 90 days of the end of the year were excluded from the respective readmission outcome.

To account for selection bias and baseline differences between CVD hospitalizations with and without MD, propensity‐score matching was used. Index hospitalizations were matched on CVD type, age, biological sex, discharge month and quarter, and comorbidity burden was quantified using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Month and quarter of discharge were included in the matching process to ensure the same number of hospitalizations were included for readmission analyses. Complete greedy nearest neighbor 1:1 matching was used. Specifically, age and CCI score were matched to minimize Mahalanobis distance; CVD type, biological sex, and discharge month/quarter were exact matched. Baseline differences and post‐match quality were assessed via standardized difference scores, with ± 0.10 indicating imbalance. Analyses accounted for NRD sampling design and were based on the matched cohorts. Two‐tailed p values < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

### LAMA2 and LOXL4 are candidate FSGS genes [^114YWRCk]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on our findings, we narrow candidates to 3% of the genome and identify coding sequence variants in LAMA2 and LOXL4, which have biologic plausibility, as candidates for disease causation in a family with FSGS. We postulate that the additive effect of digenic inheritance of heterozygous variants in LAMA2 and LOXL4 leads to late adult-onset disease in the affected relatives. We further postulate that the absence of clinically significant extra-kidney features including muscular dystrophy is as a result of the impact of the variant (heterozygous missense for LAMA2, heterozygous single base pair deletion in LOXL4), which should lead to translated protein rather than complete deficiency that can be seen in autosomal recessive disorders like LAMA2 -muscular dystrophy. Our report will thus be of benefit to the renal community as sequencing in disease becomes more widely applied should more candidate variants in these genes be discovered.

### Characteristics of patients receiving novel muscular dystrophy drugs in trials vs routine care [^111wzKpg]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

Our analysis could not distinguish whether the novel DMD treatments were administered for the specified disease variations they were intended to address, since no information is available on variation subtype in administrative claims data. We expected that the use of novel DMD treatments would adhere to on-label indications, as patients are likely to receive these treatments following genetic testing. Our findings may not be applicable to uninsured patients since our analysis relies on administrative claims data, although most patients using novel DMD treatments are likely to have insurance coverage due to the considerable costs of the drug. Variations in patient age were identified across the 3 insurance claims databases, suggesting that payers may have different coverage policies with regard to who received the drugs. Our analysis may have overestimated discontinuation rates due to the method used to identify treatment discontinuation. Patients who temporarily stopped treatment for more than 1 month but later resumed were not accounted for, although a 30-day grace period should be reasonable as all novel DMD treatments are administered weekly.,

Our calculation of average costs included all patients, including those who discontinued and completed the novel DMD treatments during follow-up. This approach may have led to an underestimation of costs, particularly for patients in later stages of the disease who incurred higher treatment expenses. In our sensitivity analyses focusing on all patients with a full year of follow-up, we observed higher annual payer costs for novel DMD treatments compared with our main study results, except for patients within the Medicaid program, most of whom were in capitated payment plans. The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission has reported that the substantial costs associated with novel advanced therapies pose challenges in terms of management and introduce budget volatility that Medicaid managed care plans with annual capitated contracts may not easily accommodate.

Limitations in our data source include potential overlap of patients between the CDM and MarketScan databases, preventing us from combining the data for a unified analysis. The accuracy of race and ethnicity information in the CDM may have been low, since CDM uses a proprietary algorithm to assign race and ethnicity derived using member geographic location and name. Furthermore, the categorization of progression stages in the pivotal trials did not align with our methodology for patients in the claims databases. We made the conservative assumption that patients who used cardiac medications were in the early nonambulatory phase of DMD, which may underestimate the true difference between patients in clinical trials and routine practices. Discrepancies in progression stage categorization may be associated with the distribution of stages when comparing the 2 data sets, introducing potential bias and limiting direct comparisons.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^112kisfo]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116okivE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, more specifically with respect to severity prediction, AAN/AANEM 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that patients with large D4Z4 deletion sizes (contracted D4Z4 allele of 10–20 kb) are more likely to develop a more significant disability, and at an earlier age, and symptomatic extramuscular manifestations.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116Vtydx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^112Nk4mD]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The maximum number of diagnoses and procedures recorded for each inpatient discharge varies by HCUP member state, but up to 15 diagnoses and 15 procedures were included per discharge in the KID data set and coded in ICD-9-CM. In the HCUP data, the first diagnosis is considered the primary diagnosis, and all other ICD-9-CM codes are considered secondary. Using the 919 ICD-9-CM codes, we identified two sets of criteria by which to define the prevalence range. To establish the upper bound of possible GD discharges, we defined the maximum number of discharges of patients with suspected GD as those for which any diagnosis (up to 15 diagnoses per discharge) was included in the list of 919 codes. For a conservative minimum, discharges with a primary diagnosis in the set of ICD-9-CM codes were selected. In HCUP and other claims data sets, the first listed diagnosis is commonly defined as the condition to be chiefly responsible for inpatient admission and care. To account for variability in coding practice and discharges for newborns, in which "live birth" is often coded first, we considered any diagnosis in our maximum definition, as has been done in similar studies. In addition, we required that the ICD-9-CM diagnosis be a clinical indication for genetic testing given the age at discharge. Specifically, an age cutoff was applied based on estimates of genetic test diagnostic yield for a given ICD-9-CM in neonates versus the remaining pediatric population (Table S2). For example, a diagnosis code indicating scoliosis would only be considered suspected GD if observed in a neonate, but not in an adolescent. For each definition, we consider the background population as those patients represented by discharges with no ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes in the list.

Results

Patient Characteristics

Patient attrition is displayed in Figure 1. Of the 4353 patients who had at least 1 medical claim with a primary or secondary diagnosis for hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy, 2335 (53.6%) satisfied the inclusion criteria: male sex, age 1 to 18 years at the index date, and continuous enrollment for at least 12 months after the index date. After excluding patients who also carried diagnoses of other neuromuscular diseases, 1386 patients (31.8%) remained in the study.

Patients of White race (53.2%) were the most commonly represented race (using the Medicaid database only as race information was not available in the Commercial database) (Table 1). The most commonly represented region was the South (36.1%, using the Commercial database only as region was not widely available in the Medicaid database). Of the 1386 patients, 622 (44.8%) were aged < 10 years at the index date. The median follow‐up duration was 3.0 (interquartile range, 1.9–4.7) years, with patients < 10 years having a slightly longer duration of follow‐up (3.9 [interquartile range, 2.0–5.3] years versus 2.5 [interquartile range, 1.7–4.0] years; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to type of insurance, region, or race.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^115xwcf4]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The vast majority of rare diseases (RDs) are complex, disabling, and life-threatening conditions with a genetic origin. RD patients face significant health challenges and limited treatments, yet the extent of their impact within health care is not well known. One direct method to gauge the disease burden of RDs is their overall cost and utilization within health-care systems.

Methods

The 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) databases were used to extract health-care utilization data using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.

Results

Of 35.6 million national hospital weighted discharges in the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 32% corresponded to RD-associated ICD-10 codes. Total charges were nearly equal between RDs ($768 billion) compared to common conditions (CCs) ($880 billion) (p < 0.0001). These charges were a result of higher charges per discharge and longer length of stay (LOS) for RD patients compared to those with CCs (p < 0.0001). Health-care cost and utilization was similarly higher for RDs with pediatric inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency visits.

Conclusion

Pediatric and adult discharges with RDs show substantially higher health-care utilization compared to discharges with CCs diagnoses, accounting for nearly half of the US national bill.

### Muscular dystrophy surveillance tracking and research network (MD STARnet): case definition in surveillance for childhood-onset Duchenne / Becker muscular dystrophy [^1176s4yn]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance Tracking and Research Network (MD STARnet) is a multisite collaboration to determine the prevalence of childhood-onset Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy and to characterize health care and health outcomes in this population. MD STARnet uses medical record abstraction to identify patients with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy born January 1, 1982 or later who resided in 1 of the participating sites. Critical diagnostic elements of each abstracted record are reviewed independently by > 4 clinicians and assigned to 1 of 6 case definition categories (definite, probable, possible, asymptomatic, female, not Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy) by consensus. As of November 2009, 815 potential cases were reviewed. Of the cases included in analysis, 674 (82%) were either "definite" or "probable" Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy. These data reflect a change in diagnostic testing, as case assignment based on genetic testing increased from 67% in the oldest cohort (born 1982–1987) to 94% in the cohort born 2004 to 2009.

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^111ptEp2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

### Severe congenital muscular dystrophy in a LAMA2-mutated case [^113posht]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical features and molecular data are described for a patient with undetectable expression of laminin alpha2 chain (merosin) and severe congenital muscular dystrophy. Molecular analysis of the LAMA2 gene revealed two previously un-described mutations. The patient achieved independent sitting at age 2, but lost head balance at age 7; he was never able to stand unsupported. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse hypomyelination in both cerebral hemispheres; electrophysiological assessment revealed progressive sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Investigation of the primary molecular defect in congenital muscular dystrophy patients is important for genetic counseling, because the clinical features of the various forms overlap, and because significant laminin alpha2 chain reduction may occur in patients with primary defects in other genes.

### Health care utilization and expenditures for children and young adults with muscular dystrophy in a privately insured population [^1141kvLq]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

We provide estimates of medical care utilization and expenditures for children and young adults younger than age 30 with muscular dystrophies in the United States. Accurate estimates are essential for calculations of lifetime costs and for economic evaluations of screening and management strategies for muscular dystrophy. We compare the medical expenditures for persons with muscular dystrophy with others by age groups. The incremental annual expenditures of medical care for privately insured individuals with muscular dystrophy relative to others in 2004 averaged $18 930 and ranged from $13 464 at ages 5 to 9 to $32 541 at ages 15 to 19. Individuals with muscular dystrophy had average medical expenditures 10 to 20 times greater than individuals without muscular dystrophy. Individuals aged 15 to 19 years had the highest number of inpatient admissions related to respiratory infections and cardiac complications. The findings underscore the need for appropriate treatment options for individuals with muscular dystrophy as they age.

Table 2
Health-care utilization metrics for GD-associated discharges

Mean total charges, costs, and length of stay per discharge after propensity score adjustment are shown with difference in adjusted means between genetic disease (GD) and non-GD discharges, based on GD minimum or maximum definition (see "Materials and methods"). Aggregate total charges and costs for all pediatric discharges are also displayed.

Fig. 1
Genetic disease (GD) estimates and mean health-care utilization by age. Mean (a) total cost per discharge and (b) length of stay per discharge, by age group for each GD discharge definition. Error bars display standard errors.

GD maximum estimate discharges were aggregated according to clinical ICD-9-CM categories based on ICD-9-CM coding groups and are annotated in Table S1. Sixty-six percent of GD maximum estimate discharges had a single GD-linked ICD-9 code, and 84% had diagnosis codes in a single diagnosis group (see Figures S1 and S2). Mean total costs and charges generally increased incrementally with a larger number of GD-linked diagnoses per discharge (Fig. 2). When considering between one and seven diagnoses, which shows a linear relationship between number of codes and total charges and costs, we observed a mean incremental total cost of $13,999 (total charge of $43,862) per additional GD-linked code (Table S6). After seven diagnoses, the relationship is less clear, likely due to small sample sizes. Discharges with eight or more GD-linked codes represent only 4% of neonatal and 2% of pediatric discharges.

### Prevalence of congenital muscular dystrophy in Italy: a population study [^115vLgJX]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We provide a nationwide population study of patients with congenital muscular dystrophy in Italy.

Methods

Cases were ascertained from the databases in all the tertiary referral centers for pediatric neuromuscular disorders and from all the genetic diagnostic centers in which diagnostic tests for these forms are performed.

Results

The study includes 336 patients with a point prevalence of 0.563 per 100,000. Mutations were identified in 220 of the 336 (65.5%). The cohort was subdivided into diagnostic categories based on the most recent classifications on congenital muscular dystrophies. The most common forms were those with α-dystroglycan glycosylation deficiency (40.18%) followed by those with laminin α2 deficiency (24.11%) and collagen VI deficiency (20.24%). The forms of congenital muscular dystrophy related to mutations in SEPN1 and LMNA were less frequent (6.25% and 5.95%, respectively).

Conclusions

Our study provides for the first time comprehensive epidemiologic information and point prevalence figures for each of the major diagnostic categories on a large cohort of congenital muscular dystrophies. The study also reflects the diagnostic progress in this field with an accurate classification of the cases according to the most recent gene discoveries.
