## Question

ELEVATE study findings for refractory episodic migraine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the findings of the ELEVATE trial for atogepant in refractory episodic migraine, specifically regarding study design, efficacy, safety, patient-reported outcomes, onset of effect, and how these results compare within the broader treatment landscape and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and population to ensure applicability. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary efficacy outcomes and their clinical significance. Next, I will review safety and tolerability, followed by patient-reported outcomes and early-onset data. After that, I need to compare these results with other CGRP-pathway therapies and consider guideline context. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications and limitations before concluding with a concise takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the study design and population so I don't jump to conclusions about generalizability. ELEVATE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 3b trial conducted across 73 sites in North America and Europe, enrolling adults aged 18–80 years with episodic migraine who had previously failed 2–4 classes of conventional oral preventive treatments, which operationalizes a "difficult-to-treat" population that many clinicians encounter in practice [^1179LZYS] [^114DTcAW].

> Wait, let me verify the intervention and dosing because dose selection matters for both efficacy and tolerability. Participants were randomized 1:1 to atogepant 60 mg once daily versus placebo for 12 weeks, with stratification by baseline monthly migraine days, number of failed classes, and region; the 60 mg QD dose is the approved preventive dose and the one used consistently across pivotal programs, which facilitates cross-trial comparisons and real-world extrapolation [^1179LZYS] [^117DZBKE].

> I should confirm the primary endpoint and analytic approach to ensure the magnitude of benefit is interpreted correctly. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) across 12 weeks using an off-treatment hypothetical estimand in the safety population with evaluable data; atogepant reduced MMDs by 4.2 days versus 1.9 days with placebo, yielding a least-squares mean difference of −2.4 days (95% CI −3.2 to −1.5; adjusted p < 0.0001), which is statistically significant and clinically meaningful in this refractory cohort [^1179LZYS] [^114DTcAW].

> Hold on, I should verify responder thresholds because patients and clinicians often prioritize ≥ 50% reductions. The ≥ 50% MMD reduction rate was 51% with atogepant versus 18% with placebo (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.9–8.1), reinforcing a robust clinical effect size that exceeds what is typically seen in less selected populations and aligns with what many consider a minimal clinically important difference in preventive trials [^114DTcAW].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability to balance benefit and risk. Constipation was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event with atogepant at 10% versus 3% on placebo; serious adverse events occurred in 3% on atogepant versus 0% on placebo, and discontinuations due to adverse events were low and similar between groups, suggesting a favorable tolerability profile consistent with the broader atogepant program and supporting use in patients who often struggle with side effects from conventional preventives [^1179LZYS] [^1123iP5w].

> I will now examine patient-reported outcomes because disability and quality-of-life gains often drive real-world value. In ELEVATE, atogepant produced significant improvements in Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Role Function-Restrictive scores and Headache Impact Test-6 at week 12, with large effect sizes relative to placebo, indicating meaningful improvements in daily functioning and headache burden in this hard-to-treat group [^1144twrf].

> But wait, what about onset of benefit — does atogepant require months to work like some traditional preventives? Let me check the early-efficacy data. Across pooled analyses including ELEVATE, atogepant 60 mg QD demonstrated a rapid onset with reduced odds of a migraine day on day 1 and significant reductions in weekly migraine days by week 1, with sustained benefits through week 4; this early signal is clinically important for patients seeking timely relief and may improve adherence [^11783fEk] [^111v2FLj].

> I need to ensure these results are contextualized against other CGRP-pathway therapies and guideline perspectives. Compared with erenumab in LIBERTY, which showed a 30% ≥ 50% responder rate at 12 weeks in episodic migraine with 2–4 prior failures, atogepant achieved 51% ≥ 50% response in ELEVATE; while cross-trial comparisons require caution, this suggests comparable or potentially higher response rates for the oral gepant in this refractory population, with the added advantage of oral administration and no injection-site reactions [^1151jppi] [^114DTcAW] [^1179LZYS]. Eptinezumab in DELIVER showed robust efficacy in patients with 2–4 prior failures, including early onset at day 1, but requires IV infusion, which may limit accessibility and acceptability for some patients compared with an oral option [^115sNLkF] [^112maZ69].

> Let me consider how guidelines frame this evidence so I don't overstate certainty. Although ELEVATE is a high-quality RCT, current guideline frameworks emphasize comparative effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes; nonetheless, the trial's design, statistical rigor, and clinically meaningful effect sizes support atogepant as a reasonable option after failure of conventional oral preventives, aligning with broader recommendations to individualize preventive therapy in difficult-to-treat migraine [^113Cci8v] [^1136kjtM].

> I should double-check practical clinical implications and limitations before concluding. Atogepant 60 mg QD is an oral, once-daily preventive requiring no titration, with early onset and a tolerability profile that often suits patients who failed or could not tolerate beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, or tricyclics; however, constipation should be anticipated and managed proactively, and the population studied was predominantly female and White, so generalizability to other demographics warrants cautious interpretation pending broader data [^1179LZYS] [^114DTcAW] [^11783fEk].

> In summary, ELEVATE demonstrates that atogepant 60 mg QD significantly reduces monthly migraine days and increases ≥ 50% responder rates in adults with episodic migraine who failed 2–4 conventional oral preventives, with improvements in quality of life and early onset of benefit, and a safety-tolerability profile consistent with the known gepant class. These findings support atogepant as a compelling oral preventive option for refractory episodic migraine, particularly for patients prioritizing non-injectable therapy and rapid onset [^1179LZYS] [^114DTcAW] [^1144twrf] [^11783fEk].

The ELEVATE trial found that **atogepant 60 mg once daily** reduced monthly migraine days by 4.2 days vs 1.9 days with placebo (LS mean difference −2.4 days; 95% CI −3.2 to −1.5; p < 0.0001) in adults with episodic migraine who had failed 2–4 conventional oral preventives [^1179LZYS]. The **≥ 50% responder rate was 51%** with atogepant vs 18% with placebo (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.9–8.1) [^114DTcAW]. Atogepant was well tolerated, with constipation the most common adverse event (10% vs 3% placebo) and low discontinuation rates (2% vs 1% placebo) [^1179LZYS]. These results support atogepant as an effective, oral preventive option for refractory episodic migraine [^1179LZYS].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3b trial [^1179LZYS].
- **Population**: Adults aged 18–80 years with episodic migraine (4–14 monthly migraine days) who failed 2–4 conventional oral preventives [^111SYJW2].
- **Intervention**: Atogepant 60 mg once daily vs placebo for 12 weeks [^1179LZYS].
- **Primary endpoint**: Change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days over 12 weeks (off-treatment hypothetical estimand) [^1179LZYS].
- **Secondary endpoint**: Proportion achieving ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine days over 12 weeks [^114DTcAW].

---

## Primary efficacy outcomes

The **mean reduction in monthly migraine days** was 4.2 days with atogepant vs 1.9 days with placebo (LS mean difference −2.4 days; 95% CI −3.2 to −1.5; p < 0.0001) [^1179LZYS]. The **≥ 50% responder rate** was 51% with atogepant vs 18% with placebo (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.9–8.1) [^114DTcAW].

---

## Secondary efficacy outcomes

Secondary outcomes included significant improvements in **monthly headache days**, **acute medication use days**, and **patient-reported outcomes** (e.g. HIT-6, MSQ) with atogepant vs placebo [^1144twrf].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Adverse events**: Constipation most common (10% atogepant vs 3% placebo); nausea, fatigue, and upper respiratory infections were also reported [^1179LZYS].
- **Serious adverse events**: Rare and similar between groups [^1123iP5w].
- **Discontinuations**: Low and similar (2% atogepant vs 1% placebo) [^1179LZYS].

---

## Clinical implications

Atogepant provides a **novel oral option** for patients with refractory episodic migraine, offering significant efficacy and favorable tolerability without injection-site reactions or laboratory monitoring [^117DZBKE]. It is especially valuable for patients who prefer oral therapy or cannot tolerate or access injectables [^113xFBUv].

---

## Comparison with other preventive treatments

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy (≥ 50% responder rate)** | **Route of administration** | **Common adverse effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Atogepant | 51% | Oral | Constipation, nausea |
| Erenumab (LIBERTY) | 30% | Subcutaneous injection | Injection site reactions, constipation |
| Eptinezumab (DELIVER) | 41–43% | Intravenous infusion | Infusion reactions, fatigue |

---

Atogepant's efficacy is **comparable to or better than** other preventive options, with the added benefit of oral administration and a favorable safety profile [^1179LZYS] [^112sKTgW].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Predominantly White, female population; broader diversity needed [^1179LZYS].
- **Long-term data**: 12-week trial; longer-term safety/efficacy data are needed [^1136kjtM].
- **Drug interactions**: Caution with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers [^notfound].

---

The ELEVATE trial demonstrates that **atogepant 60 mg once daily** significantly reduces migraine frequency and improves quality of life in refractory episodic migraine, with a favorable safety profile and the convenience of oral administration [^1179LZYS].

Clinical trials are a key component of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for Controlled Trials of Drugs in Migraine. Advances in drugs, devices, and biologicals, as well as novel trial designs, have prompted several updates over the nearly 30 years since, including most recently the Guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment of chronic migraine (2018), the Guidelines for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults (2019), and Guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment of migraine in children and adolescents (2019). The present update incorporates findings from new research and is intended to optimize the design of controlled trials of preventive pharmacological treatment of episodic migraine in adults. A guideline for clinical trials with devices will be published separately.

COVID-19 Quarantine and Migraine Chronicity

It is uncommon to uncover articles linking positive outcomes of migraine management to the health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was, however, suggested that the quarantine imposed by governments in many regions of the world in curbing the spread of the virus had a somewhat positive effect on the clinical well-being of migraine patients. In Italy, 47.1% of those surveyed meeting the definition of episodic or chronic migraine with or without aura by ICHD-3 criteria in a single institutional observational study registered an improvement in the frequency and intensity of their attacks. This was attributed to the changes in the pattern of work and psychological well-being that were promoted by being in a stable relationship and being gainfully employed, as identified through multivariate logistic regression. Having the diagnosis of "chronic migraine" was interestingly favorable for symptom improvement during the pandemic (p = 0.003). However, OTA preventative treatment, which was taken by close to a quarter of the population surveyed (n = 42, 24.7%), resulted equally in patients' migraine symptoms improving and worsening over the same period (p = 0.4).

CGRP Monoclonal Antibodies (CGRP mAb) and Migraine

CGRP levels are elevated during acute migraine flares and are thought to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of migraine.CGRP has been shown to trigger migraine attacks both with and without aura following intravenous infusions.CGRP mAbs were developed to target either the CGRP ligand or receptors and were adopted as a migraine prophylactic agent. In treatment-refractory migraine patients, CGRP mAbs were shown to be highly efficacious in reducing mean monthly migraine days and exhibited excellent safety profiles. Collectively as demonstrated in a network meta-analysis, CGRP mAbs may be marginally better in migraine prevention compared to botulinum toxins, although the latter proved to be superior in reducing monthly headache days when CGRP mAbs (fremanezumab) were administered quarterly. This finding is in line with a recent statement released by the American Headache Society (AHS), which concluded that CGRP targeting therapies ought to be a first-line therapy in migraine prevention without the need to exhaust other modalities of migraine prophylaxis.

Recommendations for future research and clinical consideration emphasize gaps in high-quality evidence: "Although many preventive therapies reviewed herein are rated as Level C or U on the basis of the quality of evidence available, for some treatments extensive clinical experience supports a possible role in migraine prevention". Until stronger data are available, "practitioners are cautioned not to discount these agents because Class I prospective clinical studies are lacking", and "A case-by-case evaluation of these agents as treatment options is prudent". "Future directions should include validating these initial clinical observations in scientifically sound RCTs".

Results

Participants and Baseline Demographics

In the ADVANCE, ELEVATE, and PROGRESS trials, 910, 315, and 778 participants were randomized to a treatment arm, respectively. Of the 2 arms included in this analysis, the safety populations included ADVANCE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 231; placebo, n = 222; ELEVATE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 156; placebo, n = 157; and PROGRESS, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 261; placebo, n = 255. The mITT populations included ADVANCE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 222; placebo, n = 214; ELEVATE, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 151; placebo, n = 154; and PROGRESS, atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 256; placebo, n = 246 (Figure 1). For each trial, demographics were similar across treatment arms. The majority of participants across the ADVANCE, ELEVATE, and PROGRESS trials were female (87.6% [397/453], 89.5% [280/313], 87.2% [450/516]) and White (85.2% [386/453], 95.8% [300/313], 59.7% [308/516]), with a mean age of 41.6, 42.2, and 42.1 years and a mean body mass index of 30.6, 25.9, and 25.5 kg/m², respectively (Table 1). Prior oral migraine preventive treatment use occurred in 70% of participants in ADVANCE. In PROGRESS, 66% of participants met criteria for acute medication overuse at baseline.

### Efficacy and safety of erenumab in participants with episodic migraine in whom 2–4 prior preventive treatments had failed: LIBERTY 3-year study [^1156CaE2]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The LIBERTY study assessed the efficacy and safety of erenumab in participants with episodic migraine (EM) and 2–4 prior preventive treatment failures. The results have been presented after 3 years of erenumab exposure in its open-label extension phase (OLEP).

Methods

Participants completing the 12-week double-blind treatment phase (DBTP) of the LIBERTY study could enter the OLEP and receive 140 mg of erenumab once monthly for 3 years. The main outcomes included the proportion of participants achieving ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine days (MMDs), the mean MMD change from baseline, and tolerability and safety.

Results

Overall, 240/246 (97.6%) participants entered the OLEP and 168/240 (70.0%) completed the study (85/118 continuing erenumab [n = 1 lost during follow-up]; 83/122 switching from placebo [n = 2 lost during follow-up]). In the overall population, 79/151 participants (52.3%) with valid data points achieved ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs at week 168 (i.e., responders). In the continuous erenumab group, 35/117 participants (29.9%) were ≥ 50% responders at week 12 of the DBTP and 26/35 (74.3%) remained ≥ 50% responders in at least half of OLEP visits. Of the 82/117 participants (70.1%) not achieving responder status at week 12 in the continuous erenumab group, 17/82 (20.7%) converted to ≥ 50% responders in at least half of OLEP visits. Of 103/120 participants (85.8%) not achieving responder status at week 12 in the placebo-erenumab group, 42/103 (40.8%) converted to ≥ 50% responders in at least half of OLEP visits after switching to erenumab. Overall, the mean (SD) MMD change from baseline showed sustained improvement over 3 years (-4.4 [3.9] days at week 168). The most common treatment-emergent AEs (per 100 person-years) were nasopharyngitis (28.8), influenza (7.5), and back pain (5.8). Overall, 9.6% (3.9 per 100 person-years) and 6.7% (2.7 per 100 person-years) of participants reported events of treatment-emergent hypertension and constipation, respectively. The safety and tolerability profile remained consistent with earlier studies.

Discussion

Erenumab (140 mg) showed sustained efficacy over 3 years in participants with EM and 2–4 prior preventive treatment failures. No new safety signals were observed.

### Diagnostic lessons from the spectrum study [^111YeiMh]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Article abstract Migraine is a heterogeneous condition that causes symptoms that vary both among individuals and within individuals from attack to attack. We examined and reviewed several important lessons on the diagnosis of migraine learned from the distribution of headache types and patterns of treatment response in the Spectrum Study, including recruitment and diagnostic issues. The accuracy of an initial diagnosis, assigned by a clinician in the context of a clinical trial, was compared with the results of a final diagnosis, assigned by a neurologist, reviewing the initial evaluation as well as headache diaries for up to 10 attacks. Several lessons can be learned from the Spectrum Study. Recruitment difficulties teach us that disabling tension-type headache is difficult to find, suggesting that it is rare. Examination of the final diagnosis given after diary evaluations suggests that a diagnosis of migraine can usually be confirmed for patients with disabling headache. After reclassification of the final sample of 432 subjects, 24/75 (32%) patients initially clinically classified as having disabling episodic tension-type headache proved to have migraine or migrainous headache after a diary review. Among study participants, 90% of subjects with disabling headache (HIMQ score > 250) had a migraine-related disorder. Treatment response suggests that, in migraineurs, tension-type headaches may have a pathophysiology similar to that of migraine. The diary data show that mild headaches in patients with disabling migraine often evolve into full-blown migraine. The Spectrum Study supports the view that, for patients with disabling episodic headache, migraine is often the correct diagnosis. In clinical practice, the suspicion of migraine should be high for patients experiencing episodic disabling headache. Assessment of headache-related disability may assist practitioners in making a diagnosis of migraine.

### Safety and efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults for whom conventional oral preventive treatments have failed (ELEVATE): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b trial [^1179LZYS]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Atogepant, an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, has been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine, but its efficacy and safety in people who have been failed by conventional oral preventive migraine treatments has not yet been evaluated in a dedicated clinical trial. The ELEVATE trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in participants for whom two to four classes of conventional oral preventive treatments have failed.

Methods

ELEVATE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3b trial done at 73 sites in Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Adults (18–80 years) with episodic migraine who had previously been failed by two to four classes of conventional oral treatments for migraine prevention were randomly assigned (1:1) using interactive web response technology to oral atogepant 60 mg once a day or placebo, stratified by baseline monthly migraine days, number of treatment classes participants have been failed by, and region. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period in the off-treatment hypothetical estimand (OTHE) population, which included participants in the safety population (all participants who received ≥ 1 dose of study intervention) who had evaluable data available for the baseline period and for one or more of the 4-week post-baseline periods (whether on treatment or off treatment). The primary endpoint was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures and a fixed-sequence procedure was used to control for multiple comparisons. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04740827) and EudraCT (2019–003448–58), and is completed.

Findings

Between March 5, 2021, and Aug 4, 2022, 540 participants were screened, 315 were randomly assigned, and 313 participants (280 [89%] female, 33 [11%] male, and 300 [96%] White) received at least one dose of study intervention. In the OTHE population, which comprised 309 participants (155 assigned to placebo and 154 to atogepant), least squares mean changes from baseline in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks were -1·9 (SE 0·4) with placebo and -4·2 (0·4) with atogepant (least squares mean difference -2·4, 95% CI -3·2 to -1·5; adjusted p < 0·0001). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event with atogepant was constipation in 16 (10%) of 156 participants (vs four [3%] of 157 for placebo). Serious adverse events occurred in four [3%] of 156 participants in the atogepant group vs none in the placebo group, and treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation occurred in three [2%] in the atogepant group vs two [1%] in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Atogepant 60 mg once a day was safe, well tolerated, and showed significant and clinically relevant reductions in mean monthly migraine days compared with placebo across 12 weeks in patients with episodic migraine who had previously been failed by two to four classes of conventional oral preventive treatments. Atogepant might be an effective preventive treatment option for patients in this difficult-to-treat population.

### Efficacy of galcanezumab in patients with episodic migraine and a history of preventive treatment failure: results from two global randomized clinical trials [^1171w5mY]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this subgroup analysis in patients with episodic migraine include that these are findings from two large, global, multi‐centre, phase 3 RCTs. Failure of prior preventives within subgroups was based on multiple reasons related to both efficacy and safety/tolerability with inadequate or no response being the most common reasons. The list of medications associated with prior failure was restricted to medications identified in treatment guidelines as having been investigated for preventive use. Efficacy in subgroups was demonstrated not only for migraine frequency‐related end‐points but also for other outcomes. Further, the results are consistent with those in the overall population and in patients with one prior failure. Limitations include that the sample sizes of the subgroups presented here are limited. The definition of failure in the subgroups had no adequate dose or duration requirement. Moreover, patients with failures of ≥ 3 preventive classes (level A or B evidence, adequate dose) over their lifetime were excluded from studies. A study designed specifically to examine the effects of galcanezumab in patients with episodic or chronic migraine with 2–4 prior preventive failures (NCT03559257) 21 may address this.

In conclusion, the findings of this subgroup analysis in patients with episodic migraine are clinically relevant considering that the subgroups chosen here are consistent with the expected target population for galcanezumab based on current treatment guidelines. Galcanezumab with its mechanism of action targeting the pathophysiology of migraine and favourable efficacy may offer an effective treatment option for patients with episodic migraine who have failed prior preventives.

### Efficacy of galcanezumab in patients with episodic migraine and a history of preventive treatment failure: results from two global randomized clinical trials [^111Qryfa]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

The efficacy of galcanezumab, a monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, has been demonstrated in two pivotal trials in patients with episodic migraine.

Methods

EVOLVE‐1 and EVOLVE‐2 were identical phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled studies in patients with episodic migraine. Mean migraine headache days per month at baseline was 9. Patients were randomized 2:1:1 to monthly injections of placebo, galcanezumab 120 mg/240 mg during the 6‐month double‐blind treatment period. Key efficacy outcomes were assessed in subgroups amongst patients for whom, previously, for efficacy and/or safety/tolerability reasons (i) one or more (≥ 1) preventives failed, (ii) two or more (≥ 2) preventives failed and (iii) preventives were never used, or used but not failed (no prior failure).

Results

In an integrated analysis of EVOLVE studies, galcanezumab 120 mg/240 mg versus placebo led to larger overall mean (SE) reductions in monthly migraine headache days across 6 months in patients with prior preventive failures (P < 0.001): ≥ 1 failure: 120 mg: −4.0 (0.4); 240 mg: −4.2 (0.5); placebo: −1.3 (0.4); ≥ 2 failures: 120 mg: −3.1 (0.7); 240 mg: −3.8 (0.8); placebo: −0.5 (0.6). Similar results were observed amongst patients with no prior failure, but the placebo response was larger: 120 mg: −4.7 (0.2); 240 mg: −4.5 (0.2); placebo: −3.0 (0.2) (P < 0.001 versus placebo). Significant improvements were observed with galcanezumab versus placebo for ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% reduction in monthly migraine headache days.

Conclusion

In patients with episodic migraine treated with galcanezumab, those with ≥ 1 or ≥ 2 prior preventive failures had significantly larger improvements, versus placebo, in efficacy outcomes. Similar results were observed in patients with no prior failure, with a larger placebo response.

### Does earlier headache response equate to earlier return to functioning in patients suffering from migraine? [^1142CPrD]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

This study explored the association between headache response and return to functioning, and identified migraine-associated symptoms related to functional status and acceptability of migraine treatment as reported by patients. Data from migraineurs enrolled in the active arms of a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial were analysed. The relationships between headache response and functional response, and clinical factors and treatment acceptability were assessed using χ² tests of proportions and logistic regressions. A greater proportion of patients with headache response at 0.5 h were functioning at 0.5, 1 and 2 h compared with patients who did not attain a headache response at 0.5 h (P < 0.0001). These patients also were more likely to find their treatment acceptable (P < 0.05). The results suggest a direct temporal relationship among the key determinants of migraine resolution. Rapid headache response is associated with faster return to functioning; rapid headache and functional responses are significant attributes of treatment acceptability.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^113Dp1HE]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Fluoxetine for episodic migraine prevention — Class II evidence — shows mixed placebo-controlled results with a study reporting reductions in a calculated pain index but baseline imbalances. In the original guideline, 1 Class II study showed fluoxetine (racemic) was significantly better than placebo for migraine prevention, but the results were not duplicated in a second study; since then, a Class II study has shown fluoxetine 20 mg/day was more effective than placebo in reducing total pain index scores (calculated as [D1 × 1] + [D2 × 2] + [D3 × 3]), with pain index scores for the fluoxetine group decreasing from 125 (baseline) to 41.3 (SD ± 63.8; p = 0.001) versus placebo 98 at baseline and 61.1 at 6 months (SD ± 57.7; p = 0.07), although differences were noted between treatment groups for baseline measures.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^1165RaQb]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.4. Frequency of attacks

Recommendations:

1.1.4.1. Attacks of migraine should occur two to eight times per month.

1.1.4.2. The frequency of other headaches (including non-target) must be no greater than 1 day per month.

1.1.4.3. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headache between attacks of migraine under study.

1.1.4.4. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

Comments:

A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that those with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of freedom from headache between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse, and it avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. The evaluation of three to five consecutive attacks provides information on consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack (refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response).

1.1.5. Duration of migraine

Recommendation:

Migraine should be present for at least 1 year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

Comments:

Because there are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, and the 1-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria, a minimum course of 1 year is advised to exclude people with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician evaluation of medical records. At least five prior attacks of migraine without aura or two prior attacks of migraine with aura are required for diagnoses using ICHD criteria.

1.1.6. Age at onset

Recommendation:

The age at onset of migraine should be less than 50 years.

Comments:

Few adults will be excluded by this criterion, as migraine beginning after the age of 50 years is rare, and the prevalence of secondary headaches or organic diseases mimicking migraine increases after age 50. The inclusion of subjects with onset of migraine after 50 years of age can be considered in phase IV trials, as long as the migraine diagnosis is well established by ICHD criteria, and secondary headaches have been ruled out.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in episodic cluster headache: a randomized clinical trial [^114Jcad7]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary End Point

A numerically greater proportion of participants achieved a 50% or greater reduction in the number of weekly attacks in weeks 1 through 4 with eptinezumab vs placebo (prespecified secondary end points) (Figure 2 B). The percentage of 50% or greater responders with eptinezumab vs placebo over week 1 was 33.0% (36 of 109) vs 24.1% (28 of 116; odds ratio [OR], 1.56 95% CI, 0.87–2.82; p = 0.14), over week 2 was 50.9% (54 of 106) vs 37.3% (41 of 110; OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03–3.07; p = 0.04), over week 3 was 62.5% (65 of 104) vs 43.8% (49 of 112; OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.30–3.97; p = 0.004), and over week 4 was 66.7% (68 of 102) vs 50.5% (54 of 107; OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.21–3.83; p = 0.009). The discrepancy in conclusions stemming from the primary end point and 50% or greater responder rates motivated post hoc sensitivity analyses based on PRESS residuals and participant influence (eFigure 2 in Supplement 3). This analysis found 6 participants (5 eptinezumab, 1 placebo) with PRESS residual values greater than 2000, indicating a very high influence on results (eFigure 2A in Supplement 3). These participants had a high variability in the number of CH attacks reported during the placebo-controlled period (eFigure 2B in Supplement 3). After removing these 6 participants (2.6%), the result for change from baseline in number of attacks across weeks 1 to 4 changed, with an advantage favoring eptinezumab vs placebo (eFigure 2C in Supplement 3). A separate analysis of change from baseline removing 29 (12.6%) participants with PRESS residual values greater than 500 showed an advantage for eptinezumab for each week (eFigure 2C in Supplement 3). In the PRESS analysis for 50% or greater responder rates, the values were almost unchanged by removal of participants with PRESS residuals greater than 500 or participants with PRESS residuals greater than 2000 (eFigure 2D in Supplement 3).

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^116kTW8V]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The study populations of all 3 trials consisted of mostly female and mostly White participants, so results may not be generalizable to the full patient population. In addition, the trials excluded participants if they used opioids or barbiturates ≥ 4 days (≥ 2 days for ADVANCE) per month in the 3 months before visit 1 or during the baseline period, and those who did not have a response to > 4 preventive treatments (> 4 classes of preventive treatments in ELEVATE). Studies including these populations are needed. These are group-level analyses limited to the first 4 weeks of treatment and should not be interpreted as predictive of subsequent responses. Group-level analyses should not be used to infer individual responses because variations may be observed within individuals.

In summary, atogepant demonstrated greater reductions in the proportion of participants with a migraine day on day 1, WMDs as early as week 1, and MMDs in the first 4 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. Improvements in efficacy outcomes were accompanied by the first demonstration of a preventive treatment to improve PROs assessing functional and quality-of-life outcomes as early as week 1. These results were consistent across three phase 3 trials in populations of participants with EM, EM with prior inadequate response to conventional, oral preventive treatments, and CM. The analyses reported here demonstrate the early efficacy and functional improvements of atogepant and address a key unmet need of providing preventive treatment options with early benefits across the spectrum of migraine disease state severity.

Gabapentin for episodic migraine — trial parameters, efficacy, and adverse events are summarized as follows: In studies using gabapentin at doses ranging between 900–2,400 mg, there was a median 12-week treatment phase (range 12–20 weeks). Regardless of the dose, gabapentin was found to be inefficacious for the treatment of episodic migraine when compared with placebo, and adverse events were higher with gabapentin (68%) versus placebo (57%), including abnormal thinking, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and dizziness, vertigo or both.

### Is chronic migraine one end of a spectrum of migraine or a separate entity? [^115PrsSK]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic migraine is associated with abnormalities in the periaqueductal grey that may be progressive. The condition is also associated with a greater degree of impairment in cortical processing of sensory stimuli than episodic migraine, perhaps due to more pervasive or persistent cortical hyperexcitability. These findings fit with the model of migraine as a spectrum disorder, in which the clinical and pathophysiological features may progress over time. This progression may result from changes in nociceptive thresholds and ensuing central sensitization caused by recurrent migraine in susceptible individuals. This may lead to changes in baseline neurological function between headaches, evident not only in electrophysiological and functional imaging studies, but also as psychological and somatic complaints that occur after years of episodic migraine. From current research and migraine models, a conceptualization of chronic migraine is emerging in which relatively permanent and pervasive central changes have occurred that warrant novel and tolerable treatments.

### Eptinezumab in episodic migraine: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (PROMISE-1) [^112maZ69]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

PROMISE-1 was designed utilizing guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine put forth by the International Headache Society Clinical Trials subcommittee. Study sites were in only two countries, limiting geographic diversity. The study also enrolled low numbers of non-Caucasians and men.

The overall response to placebo was high in this trial. High rates of placebo response are common and have been attributed to a number of factors, including the novelty of treatment, number of active treatment arms increasing patient expectations, and the number of patients previously naïve to preventive therapy. The amount of patient contact with migraine care experts throughout the trial may also have contributed to the higher than expected placebo response.

These results demonstrate that eptinezumab (100 mg, as the lowest effective dose, or 300 mg) is associated with a clinically meaningful preventive effect over multiple efficacy measures, is well tolerated, and has an acceptable safety profile for the prevention of migraine in adult patients with episodic migraine. The migraine preventive effect was observed as early as the first day after IV administration (day 1), with a > 50% reduction in the percentage of patients with a migraine on day 1 compared to baseline for eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg. Clinical results with eptinezumab 30 mg were less consistent over the same 12-week treatment period. During the first month following administration, nearly a third of patients in the eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg groups experienced a ≥ 75% reduction in migraine days. The migraine preventive effect of eptinezumab was maintained over the full 12-week dosing interval, with patients who received a single dose of eptinezumab experiencing significantly greater reductions from baseline in mean migraine days during weeks 1–12 relative to placebo.

### Three-year treatment with anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies modifies migraine course: the prospective, multicenter I-GRAINE study [^112Eh92t]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

To determine whether prolonged treatment with anti-CGRP mAbs could have disease-modifying effects, specifically designed studies with adequately powered populations are essential. However, indirect evidence can be gleaned from patients undergoing repeated treatment cycles. In this regard, a previous 2-year real-world study demonstrated gradual clinical improvement during a second treatment cycle (T2) with anti-CGRP mAbs, compared to the first (T1), in individuals with high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM; ≥ 8 migraine days/month) or chronic migraine (CM). This finding suggests that extended treatment with anti-CGRP mAbs may influence the progression of migraine.

Building on this finding, we conducted a longer (3-year). multicenter, prospective, real-world study to further investigate the potential of anti-CGRP mAbs in modifying the course of migraine.

### Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of orally administered atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine in adults: a double-blind, randomised phase 2b / 3 trial [^1123iP5w]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Atogepant is an orally administered, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist under investigation for treatment of migraine. We aimed to examine a range of oral doses for safety, tolerability, and efficacy for the preventive treatment of migraine.

Methods

In this double-blind, phase 2b/3 trial, adults (aged 18–75 years), with a history (≥ 1 year) of migraine and 4–14 migraine days per month, were randomly assigned 2:1:2:2:1:1 (by means of a sequence generated by the statistical programming department of the sponsor, and operationalised through an automated interactive web-based response system) to receive placebo or atogepant 10 mg once daily, 30 mg once daily, 60 mg once daily, 30 mg twice daily, or 60 mg twice daily, in matching capsules. Participants, site personnel, and all study sponsor personnel were masked to treatment allocations. The study was done in 78 academic and private practice settings in the USA. The primary outcome was change from baseline in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks of treatment using a modified intention-to-treat approach. The overall type I error rate for multiple comparisons across active treatment doses was controlled at the 0·05 level by means of a graphic approach. The main outcomes to assess safety and tolerability were adverse event recordings. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02848326 and is completed.

Findings

Between Sept 6, 2016, and April 23, 2018, of 1772 individuals screened, 834 were randomly assigned and 825 received one dose or more of study medication: 186 received placebo, 93 atogepant 10 mg once daily, 183 atogepant 30 mg once daily, 186 atogepant 60 mg once daily, 86 atogepant 30 mg twice daily, and 91 atogepant 60 mg twice daily. Overall, 714 (87%) of 825 participants were female, 628 (76%) were white, median migraine duration was 17·5 years (IQR 10·0–28·0), and 232 (28%) had previously used preventive treatment. The primary efficacy analysis included 795 patients: 178 received placebo, 92 atogepant 10 mg once daily, 182 atogepant 30 mg once daily, 177 atogepant 60 mg once daily, 79 atogepant 30 mg twice daily, and 87 atogepant 60 mg twice daily. Across the 12-week treatment period, all five atogepant groups showed significant least-squares mean (SE) change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days versus placebo: atogepant 10 mg once daily -4·0 (0·3; p = 0·024), 30 mg once daily -3·8 (0·2; p = 0·039), 60 mg once daily -3·6 (0·2; p = 0·039), 30 mg twice daily -4·2 (0·4; p = 0·0034), and 60 mg twice daily -4·1 (0·3; p = 0·0031); placebo -2·9 (0·2). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across all groups were nausea (range 5% [5/93] for 10 mg once daily to 12% [22/186] for 60 mg once daily vs 5% [9/186] for placebo) and fatigue (1% [1/93] for 10 mg once daily to 10% [9/91] for 60 mg twice daily vs 3% [6/186] for placebo). Treatment-related TEAE frequency ranged from 18% (17/93) for 10 mg once daily to 26% (24/91) for 60 mg twice daily, versus 16% (30/186) for placebo. Seven participants reported a total of eight serious TEAEs (two participants each in the placebo, 30 mg once-daily, and 60 mg once-daily groups, and one participant in the 10 mg once-daily group). TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 33 (5%) of 639 atogepant participants and 5 (3%) of 186 of those randomised to placebo. All serious TEAEs were unrelated to treatment.

Interpretation

All doses of oral atogepant were associated with a significant decrease in monthly migraine days over 12 weeks compared with placebo. Atogepant was safe and well tolerated over 12 weeks, supporting its phase 3 development for the preventive treatment of migraine.

### Early efficacy and late gain in chronic and high-frequency episodic migraine with onabotulinumtoxinA [^116ysotz]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The aim was to analyse the clinical characteristics of a long-term follow-up of patients with chronic and high-frequency episodic migraine in treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) or chronic migraine (CM) according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 beta were included. A comparative analysis was carried out at each study time point identifying outcome measures according to initial diagnosis and treatment duration.

Results

In all, 578 patients were recruited and after 24 months outcome data were collected from 100 patients: 84.0% CM and 16.0% HFEM. After 24 months, headache frequency was significantly reduced by 10.5 days from baseline, 64.0% reported a ≥ 50% reduction in pain intensity and 70.0% of patients had ≥ 50% reduction in analgesic use. Comparing baseline diagnoses, at month 6 CM patients presented higher mean reduction in frequency (CM 44.3% ± 32.6% vs. HFEM 34.6% ± 24.8%) and analgesic use (CM 53.6% ± 35.4% vs. HFEM 39.3% ± 33.2%). At month 12, the mean reduction in frequency was similar in CM and HFEM patients (CM 44.7% ± 33.4% vs. HFEM 41.2% ± 28.2%). Improvement in pain intensity, analgesic use and Migraine Disability Assessment were proportional in both diagnoses.

Conclusions

OnabotulinumtoxinA efficacy is significant at 6 months in frequency and analgesic intake and remains stable during follow-up, whilst the intensity of pain decreases in a stepwise manner at each time point of the analysis. The improvement in CM and HFEM patients is proportional and significant after 1 year of treatment.

### Responder rates with eptinezumab over 24 weeks in patients with prior preventive migraine treatment failures: post hoc analysis of the DELIVER randomized clinical trial [^1162x52H]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Eptinezumab reduced monthly migraine days more than placebo in the DELIVER study, a clinical trial with patients with difficult‐to‐treat migraine and prior preventive treatment failures. This post hoc analysis assesses the sustained response to eptinezumab at the population and patient level and evaluates the potential for response in initial non‐responders.

Methods

Adults with chronic or episodic migraine and two to four prior preventive treatment failures were randomized to eptinezumab 100 mg, 300 mg or placebo every 12 weeks. Primary outcomes in this post hoc analysis are the proportion of patients with ≥ 30%, ≥ 50% or ≥ 75% reduction in monthly migraine days (i.e. migraine responder rates [MRRs]) during weeks 1–12 and weeks 13–24 and across 4‐week intervals. Secondary outcomes are maintenance and shifts in MRRs from weeks 1–12 to weeks 13–24.

Results

Between weeks 1–12 and 13–24, ≥ 30% MRRs increased from 65.9% to 70.4% (100 mg) and from 71.0% to 74.5% (300 mg), versus 36.9% to 43.1% (placebo). The ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% MRRs were sustained or increased over the 24‐week period. The largest increase in ≥ 30% MRRs occurred after the second infusion with eptinezumab. The percentage of initial non‐responders (< 30% MRRs during weeks 1–12) who experienced response (≥ 30% MRRs during weeks 13–24) to the second dose was 34.7% (100 mg) and 30.4% (300 mg) with eptinezumab versus 21.1% with placebo.

Conclusion

Across MRR thresholds, most patients who responded to eptinezumab during weeks 1–12 maintained or improved response during weeks 13–24. More than one‐third of initial non‐responders became responders after their second infusion.

### Rates of response to atogepant for migraine prophylaxis among adults: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1125fG1e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the distribution of responder rates to the oral, small-molecule, calcitonin gene–related peptide receptor antagonist atogepant for preventing migraine?

Findings

In a secondary analysis of a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 902 adults with migraine, all doses of atogepant significantly increased the proportion of participants who achieved a 25% or greater, 50% or greater, 75% or greater, and 100% reduction in mean monthly migraine-days during 12 weeks of treatment. The atogepant and placebo groups reported similar rates of treatment-emergent adverse effects.

Meaning

Atogepant appears to be effective and well tolerated for the preventive treatment of migraine as measured by 4 levels of the clinically meaningful end point of responder rates.

### Efficacy and tolerability of erenumab in patients with episodic migraine in whom two-to-four previous preventive treatments were unsuccessful: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3b study [^1151jppi]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

A substantial proportion of patients with migraine does not respond to, or cannot tolerate, oral preventive treatments. Erenumab is a novel CGRP-receptor antibody with preventive efficacy in migraine. We assessed its efficacy and tolerability in patients with episodic migraine in whom previous treatment with two-to-four migraine preventives had been unsuccessful.

Methods

LIBERTY was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study at 59 sites in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18–65 years and had a history of episodic migraine with or without aura for at least 12 months, had migraine for an average of 4–14 days per month during the 3 months before screening, and had been treated unsuccessfully (in terms of either efficacy or tolerability, or both) with between two and four preventive treatments. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either erenumab 140 mg (via two 70 mg injections) or placebo every 4 weeks subcutaneously for 12 weeks. Randomisation was by interactive response technology and was stratified by monthly frequency of migraine headache (4–7 vs 8–14 migraine days per month) during the baseline phase. Cenduit generated the randomisation list and assigned participants to groups. Participants, investigators, people doing various assessments, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater reduction in the mean number of monthly migraine days during weeks 9–12. Efficacy was measured in the full analysis set, which included all randomly assigned patients who started their assigned treatment and completed at least one post-baseline monthly migraine day measurement. Safety and tolerability were assessed by recording adverse events and by physical examination, assessment of vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and electrocardiography. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03096834. The trial is closed to new participants, but the open-label extension phase is ongoing.

Findings

Between March 20, 2017, and Oct 27, 2017, 246 participants were randomly assigned, 121 to the erenumab group and 125 to the placebo group. 95 of 246 (39%) participants had previously unsuccessfully tried two preventive drugs, 93 (38%) had tried three, and 56 (23%) had tried four. At week 12, 36 (30%) patients in the erenumab had a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the mean number of monthly migraine days, compared with 17 (14%) in the placebo group (odds ratio 2·7 [95% CI 1·4–5·2]; p = 0·002). The tolerability and safety profiles of erenumab and placebo were similar. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event was injection site pain, which occurred in seven (6%) participants in both groups.

Interpretation

Compared with placebo, erenumab was efficacious in patients with episodic migraine who previously did not respond to or tolerate between two and four previous migraine preventive treatments. Erenumab might be an option for patients with difficult-to-treat migraine who have high unmet needs and few treatment options.

Evidence gaps and research needs — comparative effectiveness trials are prioritized and should emphasize combination therapy comparators and inadequate responders. "There is a critical need for funding agencies, such as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute or National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to support well-designed, comparative effectiveness trials of newer medications to treat moderate to severe episodic migraine compared with the combination of a triptan and an NSAID or acetaminophen". "These trials should focus on the combination therapies as initial treatment options and in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment after a moderate to severe episodic migraine", and "The trials should aim to treat multiple migraine headaches". The systematic review "did not identify head-to-head comparative studies for lasmiditan, celecoxib, eletriptan, frovatriptan, or naratriptan", and "did not find comparative effectiveness evidence eligible for this clinical guideline to evaluate the efficacy of switching pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine headache".

### Spotlight on cervical vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of primary headache disorders: a review [^114TGJHk]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Currently published clinical nVNS data demonstrate promising clinical effects for the abortive use in episodic migraine and cluster headache. The interpretation of the findings in this narrative review may be hindered due to several considerations. Although, most of the abortive and preventive trials have been determined as Class I–IV studies (Class I studies for the acute treatment and Class II–IV studies for the preventive use), comparative and reproduc ible conclusions are limited by the different stimulation protocols and/or outcome parameter measures. Secondly, a more systematic review-based approach including multiple comparative correlation analysis of primary and secondary endpoint classified as significantly different or nearly-significant should re-examine the positive findings of our narrative review. So far, the episodic subtypes of migraine and cluster headache have responded superiorly compared to the chronic forms. Due to its noninvasive character along with the reported tolerability, cervical nVNS may be justified in the pre-refractory state of migraine and cluster headache, and probably in a migraine subpopulation with limited available options (e.g. adolescents with migraine, menstruation-associated migraine). The afferent properties of the vagus nerve are well connected via the ncl. tractus solitarii to the locus coeruleus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the parabrachial plexus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and directly to the TNC and the cervical spinal cord. Given these anatomic reciprocal projections of the vagus nerve, electrical noninvasive modulation of the cervical vagal afferents may impact trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission.

Along with a rising number of targeted preclinical studies supporting the observed clinical VNS responsiveness in primary headache disorders, the authors strongly believe that VNS constitutes an emerging issue of ongoing headache treatment and research.

Outcomes of interest and adverse event handling — prioritized outcomes were migraine frequency, migraine duration, number of acute medication intake days, frequency of migraine-related emergency department visits, migraine-related disability, QoL, physical functioning, and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). The accompanying systematic review did not identify eligible studies that assessed physical functioning or the frequency of emergency department visits. AEs were captured through FDA labels and eligible studies if the studies reported a significant difference in the incidence of an AE or the difference was 5% or more between groups, and AEs were not rated using the GRADE approach.

### Responder rates with eptinezumab over 24 weeks in patients with prior preventive migraine treatment failures: post hoc analysis of the DELIVER randomized clinical trial [^111B3A8e]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Given the differences in prescribing guidelines and criteria for treatment initiation and discontinuation for anti‐CGRP monoclonal antibodies across countries, it is important to understand the potential trajectory of response for patients treated with these medications across a variety of thresholds. The data presented here may guide clinicians to continue treatment with eptinezumab for at least two infusions before making dosage change evaluations or discontinuing treatment. The current analysis illuminates the potential expectations for the maintenance and shift in migraine responder status in patients with migraine and multiple prior treatment failures treated with eptinezumab versus placebo in the DELIVER study. The results highlight that significantly more patients treated with eptinezumab than with placebo will experience migraine response and that a substantial proportion of eptinezumab‐treated patients will experience a maintained or improved migraine response over 24 weeks of treatment. Additionally, approximately one‐third of eptinezumab‐treated patients with insufficient migraine response during the first dosing interval (weeks 1–12) responded after a second infusion (weeks 13–24) in both the 100 mg and 300 mg treatment groups.

The ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% MRRs during weeks 1–12 and 13–24 in the eptinezumab groups were consistent with data from the pivotal PROMISE studies in episodic and chronic migraine, but placebo MRRs in the PROMISE studies were higher than observed in this study where patients have experienced two to four prior preventive treatment failures. A post hoc analysis of the PROMISE studies found that 37.6% (100 mg), 36.3% (300 mg) and 33.9% (placebo) of patients with < 50% migraine response during weeks 1–12 in PROMISE‐1 experienced ≥ 50% response during weeks 13–24; in PROMISE‐2, these percentages were 28.7% (100 mg), 29.0% (300 mg) and 18.5% (placebo). Thus, across three trials of eptinezumab in different migraine populations, approximately a third of eptinezumab‐treated patients who did not experience response during the first infusion experienced migraine response after a second infusion, highlighting the importance of a series of at least two treatments. Whilst eptinezumab does has a rapid onset of action, related to its intravenous route of administration, some patients, due to the natural fluctuation of disease, may require additional time with preventive treatment to gain the full benefits.

### Preventive pharmacologic treatments for episodic migraine in adults [^115WrzfM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Systematic review of preventive pharmacologic treatments for community-dwelling adults with episodic migraine.

Data Sources

Electronic databases through May 20, 2012.

Eligibility Criteria

English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive drugs compared to placebo or active treatments examining rates of ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine frequency or improvement in quality of life.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

We assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence and conducted random effects meta-analyses of absolute risk differences and Bayesian network meta-analysis.

Results

Of 5,244 retrieved references, 215 publications of RCTs provided mostly low-strength evidence because of the risk of bias and imprecision. RCTs examined 59 drugs from 14 drug classes. All approved drugs, including topiramate (9 RCTs), divalproex (3 RCTs), timolol (3 RCTs), and propranolol (4 RCTs); off-label beta blockers metoprolol (4 RCTs), atenolol (1 RCT), nadolol (1 RCT), and acebutolol (1 RCT); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril (1 RCT) and lisinopril (1 RCT); and angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan (1 RCT), outperformed placebo in reducing monthly migraine frequency by ≥ 50% in 200–400 patients per 1,000 treated. Adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation (68 RCTs) were greater with topiramate, off-label antiepileptics, and antidepressants than with placebo. Limited direct evidence as well as frequentist and exploratory network Bayesian meta-analysis showed no statistically significant differences in benefits between approved drugs. Off-label angiotensin-inhibiting drugs and beta-blockers were most effective and tolerable for episodic migraine prevention.

Limitations

We did not quantify reporting bias or contact principal investigators regarding unpublished trials.

Conclusions

Approved drugs prevented episodic migraine frequency by ≥ 50% with no statistically significant difference between them. Exploratory network meta-analysis suggested that off-label angiotensin-inhibiting drugs and beta-blockers had favorable benefit-to-harm ratios. Evidence is lacking for long-term effects of drug treatments (i.e., trials of more than 3 months duration), especially for quality of life.

Efficacy Outcomes

The baseline daily rate of participants with a migraine day over the 4-week baseline period across treatment arms ranged from 26.8% to 27.7% in ADVANCE, 32.3% to 33.1% in ELEVATE, and 67.7% to 68.4% in PROGRESS.

Migraine responder rates

More eptinezumab‐treated patients achieved ≥ 30% migraine response than did patients given placebo (Figure 1; Table S1). During the first dosing interval (weeks 1–12), 65.9% (n = 197/299, 100 mg; p < 0.0001) and 71.0% (n = 208/293, 300 mg; p < 0.0001) of patients achieved ≥ 30% migraine response with eptinezumab, compared with 36.9% (n = 110/298) with placebo. During the second dosing interval (weeks 13–24), ≥ 30% MRRs increased to 70.4% (n = 202/287, 100 mg; p < 0.0001) and 74.5% (n = 213/286, 300 mg; p < 0.0001) with eptinezumab and 43.1% (n = 127/295) with placebo. When analyzed by 4‐week intervals, the largest increase in ≥ 30% MRRs occurred between weeks 9–12 and weeks 13–16 with eptinezumab, representing an increase in effect with a second infusion of active treatment. An exploratory analysis identified that this increase in effect was observed in the episodic migraine population, and maintenance of the increased effect was observed in the chronic migraine population (Table S2). Although the recommended threshold for clinical response is ≥ 50% MRR for episodic migraine, ≥ 30% MRR was analyzed here for comparison to chronic migraine.

### Effects of eptinezumab vs placebo on headache pain and most bothersome symptom in migraine attack… [^114V8jai]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Median times to headache pain freedom were 4. 0 hours in the eptinezumab group and
9. 0 hours in the placebo group; median times to absence of most bothersome symptom were 2. 0 hours and
3. 0 hours, respectively. The purpose of the RELIEF study was to assess the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab compared with placebo when infused during an active migraine attack in patients with a monthly migraine frequency rendering them eligible for preventive migraine treatment per current guidelines. 14, 15. If both co-primary efficacy end points demonstrated statistical significance, then testing continued hierarchically to the key secondary end points then to the additional secondary end points. In the first analysis, rescue medication censoring was removed; therefore, the time value for each patient was censored only if the patient did not report pain freedom/absence of most bothersome symptom at all during the 48 hours after start of infusion. In the second analysis, the data were calculated based on the requirement for an event to persist for at least 30 minutes; for example, any patient reporting pain freedom at 2 hours but reporting pain recurrence at 2. 5 hours was still categorized as at risk.

In addition, eptinezumab provided faster time to headache pain relief, sustained headache pain freedom, and delayed time to next migraine. Adverse events reported in this study were consistent with previous clinical trials of eptinezumab for migraine prevention, 9–11 with the most common TEAE being hypersensitivity in 2. 1% of patients in the eptinezumab group. Combined with the results of secondary end points — reduced need for acute or rescue medication for the qualifying migraine attack, sustained efficacy through the 24- and 48-hour time points, and delayed time to next migraine — results of the current study demonstrate that an active migraine would not be an obstacle for initiating preventive treatment with eptinezumab.

### Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine: the multicentre, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled PREMIUM trial [^113Rsu5G]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Several alternative and emerging therapies provide an opportunity to improve care for patients with migraine by addressing poor tolerability, adherence, and persistence with standard preventive migraine medications. Non-invasive neuromodulation therapies and injectable monoclonal antibody medications targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor are effective and well tolerated for migraine prevention. The new preventive medications, including the calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies, are not effective for all patients and are currently not recommended for patients under the age of 18 years, pregnant patients, and older adults. There continues to be a need for additional effective, tolerable, and safe treatment options that can be used without concern about potential adverse interactions with existing or emerging treatments.

Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS; gammaCore®; electroCore, Inc. Basking Ridge, NJ, USA) is a neuromodulation therapy with Class I evidence for the acute treatment of migraine attacks for patients with episodic migraine. nVNS has also shown preliminary efficacy for migraine prevention in a small double-blind study of a chronic migraine population (n = 59) and in open-label studies of patients with chronic migraine or treatment-refractory episodic migraine (n = 20) and a menstrually related migraine population (n = 51). The efficacy of nVNS in these and other primary headache studies combined with its established tolerability and safety profile suggest that nVNS could represent a valuable addition to available migraine prevention treatments. Objectives of the current study were to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of nVNS for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine.

### Supportive self-management program for people with chronic headaches and migraine: a randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation [^111pwcU8]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A quarter of people in the intervention group did not attend any treatment sessions. This was despite participants confirming they were available on proposed dates before randomization. Nonattendance is common in trials of group interventions for chronic pain, for example, 17% and 11% in 2 similar studies. The unpredictable nature of headache disorders might explain the higher nonattendance rate in this study. Nevertheless, the minimal adherence rate in the CHESS of 69% compares favorably with minimal adherence rates of 70% and 63%, respectively, in these previous studies. Our CACE analyses provided very similar estimates of effect sizes to the ITT analyses, indicating that better adherence to the intervention is unlikely to increase benefit from the intervention.

Although diaries were poorly completed, the findings were consistent with main results. Defining the population of interest is important for trials of interventions of headache disorders. It is also important that criteria developed for evaluating drug treatments for pain are not inappropriately applied to studies on nonpharmacological treatments. This study was originally designed to study a population meeting an epidemiologic definition of chronic headache. This maps onto the point in the care pathway, in primary care, where a general (family) practitioner might refer people to such a treatment program, which includes a headache classification, following a single consultation rather than following completion of a headache diary. Our main results are describing the effect on the majority population classified as having chronic migraine or chronic tension–type headache and episodic migraine after a single nurse interview. While the interview has been validated, the population may not be the same as those diagnosed with chronic migraine by a headache specialist. It is reassuring that findings were not materially different for those with chronic migraine or chronic tension–type headache and episodic migraine; this gives some reassurance that findings apply to all those with "chronic migraine". Although the presence of chronic headache was an entry criterion for this study, and the median delay between study entry assessment and completion of the baseline questionnaire was just 8 days, only 62% reported that they had had headaches on 15 or more days in the preceding 3 months in their baseline questionnaire. This may be partly because of the known short-term variability in headache days and possibly some response shift in questionnaire completion. Nevertheless, it is possible we included some participants who did not meet diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine or chronic tension–type headache and episodic migraine. The population recruited was, however, the population that would have been offered the CHESS intervention if it was shown to be successful: meaning our findings are directly applicable to clinical practice in primary care. The treatment effect was not materially different from the overall estimate in those reporting ≥ 15 headache days in the previous month; this suggests our findings are applicable to those formally diagnosed with chronic migraine or chronic tension–type headache and episodic migraine.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) — evidence update and recommendation scope: no new studies on the effect of candesartan or telmisartan met the inclusion criteria for the 2023 VA/DoD Headache CPG systematic evidence review; therefore, this recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced. Although the available evidence base has not changed since the 2020 CPG, across the three studies reviewed only one study either had a diagnosis of or met criteria for chronic migraine; hence, this recommendation is now restricted to episodic migraine, whereas the 2020 CPG included both episodic and chronic migraine. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.

Conclusion

This is the first study to demonstrate that both 120-mg and 240-mg doses of GMB were superior to PBO in improving patient functioning as measured by the MSQ version 2.1. This benefit in Japanese patients with episodic migraine was observed within the first month of treatment and was maintained for 6 months. The improvements in functioning observed in Japanese patients with migraine were consistent with findings from global studies, which have primarily examined Caucasian populations.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^113hLrS6]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.2. Placebo control

Recommendations:

1.2.2.1. Interventions under evaluation for the acute treatment of migraine should be compared with placebo.

1.2.2.2. When two presumably active treatments are compared, a placebo control should be included for assay sensitivity.

Comments:

The placebo effect is a genuine psychobiological phenomenon that affects the results of clinical trials across different disease states. In trials for the acute treatment of migraine placebo response varies widely, from 6% to 56% for headache relief and from 6% to 25% for pain freedom. This variability makes it difficult to interpret the results of active comparator trials that do not include placebo. Trials using historical controls or active comparators lack assay sensitivity and require large sample sizes to provide the narrow confidence intervals (CIs) needed to ensure that new drugs are not inferior to controls.

In the past, modified designs (e.g. exclusion of placebo responders or sequential parallel designs) to reduce placebo response have proved poorly effective. Nonetheless, particular care should be dedicated to identify and mitigate placebo response risks as much as possible.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^111LMnry]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Eptinezumab — subgroup efficacy, administration logistics, and early response are detailed as follows: In patients diagnosed with both chronic migraine and medication overuse headache (MOH), patients meeting the criteria for both headache types experienced 16.7 ± 4.6 monthly migraine days across treatment groups, and both the eptinezumab 100 mg dose (-8.4) and eptinezumab 300 mg dose (-8.6) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days from baseline throughout the study period compared with the placebo dose (p < 0.0001). As per administration protocol, an infusion of eptinezumab is administered over a 30-minute period (± 15 minutes) with additional time attributed to being monitored for at least 2 hours after the infusion is completed. Additionally, patient response to eptinezumab is observed quickly after the first dose; a statistically significant reduction in migraine occurred 1 day after infusion, with 28.6% of patients receiving the 100 mg dose, 27.8% receiving the 300 mg dose, and 42.3% receiving the placebo having a migraine (p < 0.0001). Across studies, eptinezumab is proven to be an efficacious, safe, and tolerable treatment option for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, regardless of the duration of migraine, age, sex, or BMI, and eptinezumab also has value among patients who have been treating refractory migraine and those who experience MOH; in pregnancy and lactation, the risk of adverse outcomes in pregnancy has not been characterized.

### Safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in patients with two-to-four previous preventive treatment failures (DELIVER): a multi-arm, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3b trial [^115sNLkF]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Background

The monoclonal antibody eptinezumab, which targets calcitonin gene-related peptide, has shown migraine preventive effects starting the day following infusion and acceptable safety and tolerability in phase 3 trials, but benefits in the subpopulations of patients with previous preventive treatment failures were not examined. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in adults with migraine and two-to-four previous preventive treatment failures.

Methods

DELIVER was a multicentre, multi-arm, phase 3b trial comprising a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period and a 48-week dose-blinded extension. We recruited adults with episodic or chronic migraine with at least 4 monthly migraine days (as per International Headache Society guidelines) and documented evidence of two-to-four previous preventive treatment failures within the past 10 years, from 96 study locations across Europe (n = 93) and the USA (n = 3). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via a centralised randomisation system, stratified by baseline monthly headache days and country, to eptinezumab 100 mg, eptinezumab 300 mg, or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (captured using a daily electronic diary) in weeks 1–12, assessed in the full analysis set. All participants and study personnel were masked to study drug assignments. The dose-blinded extension period is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04418765, and EudraCT, 2019–004497–25.

Findings

Between June 1, 2020, and Oct 7, 2021, 891 individuals were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug (safety population; eptinezumab 100 mg n = 299 [34%], eptinezumab 300 mg n = 294 [33%], placebo n = 298 [33%]). 865 patients completed the placebo-controlled period. The change from baseline to weeks 1–12 in mean monthly migraine days was -4·8 (SE 0·37) with eptinezumab 100 mg, -5·3 (0·37) with eptinezumab 300 mg, and -2·1 (0·38) with placebo. The difference from placebo in change in mean monthly migraine days from baseline was significant with eptinezumab 100 mg (-2·7 [95% CI -3·4 to -2·0]; p < 0·0001) and eptinezumab 300 mg (-3·2 [-3·9 to -2·5]; p < 0·0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 127 (42%) of 299 patients in the eptinezumab 100 mg group, in 120 (41%) of 294 in the eptinezumab 300 mg group, and in 119 (40%) of 298 in the placebo group. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was COVID-19 (20 [7%] of 299 patients in the eptinezumab 100 mg group, 17 [6%] of 294 in the eptinezumab 300 mg group, and 16 [5%] of 298 in the placebo group). Serious adverse events were uncommon (five [2%] of 299 in the eptinezumab 100 mg group, seven [2%] of 294 in the eptinezumab 300 mg group, four [1%] of 298 in the placebo group) and included anaphylactic reaction (eptinezumab 300 mg n = 2) and COVID-19 (eptinezumab 100 mg n = 1 and eptinezumab 300 mg n = 1).

Interpretation

In adults with migraine and two-to-four previous preventive treatment failures, eptinezumab provided significant migraine preventive effects compared with placebo, with acceptable safety and tolerability, indicating that eptinezumab might be an effective treatment option for this patient population. The dose-blinded extension period will provide additional long-term safety data in patients with migraine and previous preventive treatment failures.

We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 142 clinical research sites across the USA, the UK, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan. Adults aged 18–80 years with a 1-year or longer history of chronic migraine were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral atogepant 30 mg twice a day, oral atogepant 60 mg once a day, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) across the 12-week treatment period. The primary analysis was done in the modified intent-to-treat population and included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study intervention, had an evaluable baseline period of electronic diary (eDiary) data, and had at least one evaluable post-baseline 4-week period (weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) of eDiary data during the double-blind period. The safety population consisted of all participants who received at least one dose of study intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03855137).

Findings

Between March 11, 2019 and Jan 20, 2022, 1489 participants were assessed for eligibility. 711 were excluded, and 778 participants were randomly assigned to atogepant 30 mg twice a day (n = 257), atogepant 60 mg once a day (n = 262), or placebo (n = 259). Participants in the safety population were aged 18–74 years (mean 42·1 years). 459 (59%) of 773 patients were White, 677 (88%) patients were female, and 96 (12%) were male. 84 participants discontinued treatment during the trial, and 755 comprised the modified intent-to-treat population (atogepant 30 mg twice a day n = 253, atogepant 60 mg once a day n = 256, and placebo n = 246). Baseline mean number of MMDs were 18·6 (SE 5·1) with atogepant 30 mg twice a day, 19·2 (5·3) with atogepant 60 mg once a day, and 18·9 (4·8) with placebo. Change from baseline in mean MMDs across 12 weeks was -7·5 (SE 0·4) with atogepant 30 mg twice a day, -6·9 (0·4) with atogepant 60 mg once a day, and -5·1 (0·4) with placebo. Least squares mean difference from placebo was -2·4 with atogepant 30 mg twice a day (95% CI -3·5 to -1·3; adjusted p < 0·0001) and -1·8 with atogepant 60 mg once a day (-2·9 to -0·8; adjusted p = 0·0009). Most common adverse events for atogepant were constipation (30 mg twice a day 28 [10·9%]; 60 mg once a day 26 [10%]; and placebo 8 [3%]) and nausea (30 mg twice a day 20 [8%]; 60 mg once a day 25 [10%]; and placebo 9 [4%]). Potentially clinically significant weight decrease (≥ 7% reduction at any time post-baseline) was observed in each treatment group (atogepant 30 mg twice a day 14 [6%]; atogepant 60 mg once a day 15 [6%]; and placebo 5 [2%]).

Interpretation

Atogepant 30 mg twice a day and 60 mg once a day showed clinically relevant reductions in MMDs across 12 weeks in chronic migraine patients. Both atogepant doses were well tolerated, consistent with the known safety profile of atogepant.

### Onset of efficacy and duration of response of galcanezumab for the prevention of episodic migraine: a post-hoc analysis [^114WNXpR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel preventive treatments that are effective and well tolerated are highly desirable given the number of individuals who suffer from frequent migraineand the burden migraine causes. Few drugs are approved by regulatory authorities for migraine prevention; with the exception of the recently approved humanised monoclonal antibodies, none are migraine-specific, only a small fraction of patients receive preventive treatment, and they are associated with undesirable side effects and low adherence rates. Although the postmarketing side effects and adherence are not yet known for the monoclonal antibodies, they were well tolerated in clinical trials.

Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of migrainehave unveiled several potential drug targets for both acute and preventive treatment. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is found throughout the trigeminovascular complexand in central brain regions. This neuropeptide is regarded as important in the pathophysiology of migraine.CGRP's role in migraine has been supported by several experimental and clinical findings: during spontaneous migraine attacks, the jugular venous blood concentration of CGRP increases. Interictal blood concentrations are significantly elevated in patients with episodic and chronic migraine, suggesting that elevated CGRP levels are not simply symptomatic, but may even serve as a biomarker for disease activity. Intravenous infusion of recombinant human CGRP can trigger a migraine attack that is indistinguishable from a spontaneous attack, and raised CGRP serum concentrations can be reversed with triptan administration — an effect that coincides with migraine symptom relief. In addition, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in the acuteand preventivetreatment of migraine headache in double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials.

RESULTS

Patients

Comprehensive details of study design, patient disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, primary and key secondary efficacy end‐points and safety/tolerability outcomes have been published previously. The full analysis set comprised 890 patients (100 mg, n = 299; 300 mg, n = 293; placebo, n = 298), and 97.2% (865/890) completed the 24‐week placebo‐controlled treatment period. Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy comprised 0.4% (4/891) of patients. Patients with a non‐missing responder status for both weeks 1–12 and 13–24 included 287 patients who received eptinezumab 100 mg, 286 patients who received eptinezumab 300 mg and 295 patients who received placebo.

The mean (standard deviation) age of the full analysis set was 43.8 (10.6) years. A total of 800 patients (89.9%; 800/890) were female and 854 (96.0%; 854/890) were White. All but one patient had experienced at least one prior treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, 494/890 (55.5%) had at least one prior treatment failure due to safety/tolerability concerns and 28/890 (3.1%) had at least one prior treatment failure due to contraindication.

During the 28‐day baseline period, mean (standard deviation) MMDs were 13.8 (5.6) in the eptinezumab 100 mg group, 13.7 (5.4) in the eptinezumab 300 mg group and 13.9 (5.7) in the placebo group. Based on the number of migraine and headache days during the baseline period, 484/890 (54.4%) patients had episodic migraine and 405/890 (45.5%) had chronic migraine; one patient did not fit into either group after re‐calculation of baseline values.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^114keq3T]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

A rapid onset of action has been demonstrated from calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Current evidence suggests that oral CGRP receptor antagonists, or gepants, may be differentiated from conventional oral preventive treatments regarding speed of onset. Gepants do not require dose titration and have benefits as acute treatments. In prevention trials, atogepant and rimegepant have demonstrated efficacy over the first 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, preliminary analyses with atogepant for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine (CM) have demonstrated efficacy at day 1, and this report will expand on those analyses.

Atogepant is an oral CGRP receptor antagonist approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. The ADVANCE trial in episodic migraine (EM) and the PROGRESS trial in CM demonstrated the efficacy of atogepant compared with placebo on the primary endpoint of change from baseline in monthly migraine days (MMDs) over 12 weeks. The ELEVATE trial demonstrated the efficacy of atogepant compared with placebo on the primary endpoint of change from baseline in MMDs over 12 weeks in participants with EM who had previously been failed by 2–4 classes of conventional oral migraine preventive treatments. Here, we extend these previous analyses by using data from 3 large trials (ADVANCE, ELEVATE, and PROGRESS) to address the primary research question of evaluating the early outcomes of atogepant 60 mg once daily (QD) (efficacy on day 1, and efficacy and functional outcomes weekly for the first 4 weeks, and across the first 4-week period).

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^1136kjtM]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical context for preventive therapy selection underscores individualized care and study limitations: "Treatment regimens, therefore, need to be designed case by case, which may include complex or even nontraditional approaches". "A shortcoming of migraine prevention clinical studies is the relatively brief treatment duration (often only 12–16 weeks)". "Long-term assessment of the efficacy and safety of migraine preventive treatments is needed". Additional considerations include that "It seems reasonable that a clinician be mindful of comorbid and coexistent conditions in patients with migraine, to maximize potential treatment efficacy and minimize AE risk", and "Because migraine is frequent in women of childbearing age, the potential for adverse fetal effects related to migraine prevention strategies is particularly concerning".

### Safety and efficacy of AMG 334 for prevention of episodic migraine: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^114Yr11m]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway is a promising target for preventive therapies in patients with migraine. We assessed the safety and efficacy of AMG 334, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the CGRP receptor, for migraine prevention.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, patients aged 18–60 years with 4 to 14 migraine days per month were enrolled at 59 headache and clinical research centres in North America and Europe, and randomly assigned in a 3:2:2:2 ratio to monthly subcutaneous placebo, AMG 334 7 mg, AMG 334 21 mg, or AMG 334 70 mg using a sponsor-generated randomisation sequence centrally executed by an interactive voice response or interactive web response system. Study site personnel, patients, and the sponsor study personnel were masked to the treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days from baseline to the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase. The primary endpoint was calculated using the least squares mean at each timepoint from a generalised linear mixed-effect model for repeated measures. Safety endpoints were adverse events, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and anti-AMG 334 antibodies. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01952574. An open-label extension phase of up to 256 weeks is ongoing and will assess the long-term safety of AMG 334.

Findings

From Aug 6, 2013, to June 30, 2014, 483 patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 160), AMG 334 7 mg (n = 108), AMG 334 21 mg (n = 108), or AMG 334 70 mg (n = 107). The mean change in monthly migraine days at week 12 was -3·4 (SE 0·4) days with AMG 334 70 mg versus -2·3 (0·3) days with placebo (difference -1·1 days [95% CI -2·1 to -0·2], p = 0·021). The mean reductions in monthly migraine days with the 7 mg (-2·2 [SE 0·4]) and the 21 mg (-2·4 [0·4]) doses were not significantly different from that with placebo. Adverse events were recorded in 82 (54%) patients who received placebo, 54 (50%) patients in the AMG 334 7 mg group, 54 (51%) patients in the AMG 334 21 mg group, and 57 (54%) patients in the AMG 334 70 mg group. The most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, fatigue, and headache. Serious adverse events were reported for one patient in the AMG 334 7 mg group (ruptured ovarian cyst) and one patient in the AMG 334 70 mg group (migraine and vertigo); these events were judged to be unrelated to AMG 334 treatment. Nine (3%) of 317 patients had neutralising antibodies. No apparent association was recorded between patients with positive anti-AMG 334 antibodies and adverse events. No clinically significant vital signs, laboratory, or electrocardiogram findings were recorded.

Interpretation

These results suggest that AMG 334 70 mg might be a potential therapy for migraine prevention in patients with episodic migraine and support further investigation of AMG 334 in larger phase 3 trials.

Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors — In a Class II crossover study, candesartan reduced the mean number of headache days vs placebo (18.5 with placebo vs 13.6 with candesartan; p = 0.001), and secondary endpoints favored candesartan (e.g., headache hours 139 vs 95; migraine days 12.6 vs 9.0; migraine hours 92.2 vs 59.4; headache severity index 293 vs 191) with no serious adverse events (AEs) and common AEs including "dizziness" 31%, "symptoms of the respiratory system" 21%, and fatigue 14%; a Class II lisinopril study showed reductions in headache hours (129 vs 162 [mean change 20; CI 5–36]), headache days (17.9 vs 23.7 [20, CI 5–30]), and migraine days (14.5 vs 18.5 [21, CI 9–34]) with AEs of cough (26%; 10% discontinued), dizziness (23%), and "tendency to faint" (10%) and no serious AEs; in a single Class II trial, telmisartan 80 mg did not differ from placebo for reduction in migraine days (−1.65 vs −1.14); overall, "Lisinopril and candesartan are possibly effective for migraine prevention (1 Class II study each). Telmisartan is possibly ineffective for reducing the number of migraine days (1 negative Class II study)".

### Fremanezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine [^112zJUeB]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The recent approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway introduced the first preventive treatments for migraine that were specifically designed to target the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Fremanezumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2Δa) administered via subcutaneous injection, is the first approved monoclonal antibody that targets the CGRP ligand and offers both quarterly (once every 3 months) and monthly dosing. Areas covered: An introduction to migraine, overview of the migraine preventive treatments that target CGRP or its receptor, background on CGRP, and details on the fremanezumab clinical development program in both chronic and episodic migraine. Focus is on the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies, as well as the recently completed long-term Phase 3 study. Expert opinion: The approval of the first disease-specific preventive treatments for migraine heralds a new era in the treatment of migraine. Fremanezumab has a favorable efficacy and safety profile, which is maintained over the long term. Data from patient subgroups with more-complex disease are promising, and an ongoing study in treatment-refractory patients is evaluating the efficacy of fremanezumab in patients who have failed on multiple prior therapies.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^11783fEk]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Three phase 3 trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of atogepant in episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) across 12-week treatment periods. This analysis evaluates improvements in efficacy and functional outcomes in the first 4 weeks of treatment with the oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, atogepant, for the preventive treatment of migraine.

Methods

ADVANCE, ELEVATE, and PROGRESS were phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trials. ADVANCE and ELEVATE included participants aged 18–80 years with > 1 year history of EM and 4–14 monthly migraine days (MMDs). ELEVATE required previous treatment failures to 2–4 classes of oral preventives. PROGRESS included participants aged 18–80 years with > 1 year history of CM, ≥ 15 monthly headache days, and ≥ 8 MMDs. This analysis reports the atogepant 60 mg once daily (QD) and placebo treatment arms. Outcomes included efficacy endpoints (reporting a migraine day on day 1, change from baseline in weekly migraine days [WMDs] at weeks 1–4, and in MMDs in the first 4 weeks) and functional endpoints evaluated by the Activity Impairment in Migraine-Diary (AIM-D) at weeks 1–4 and the European Quality-of-Life 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) at weeks 1–2 and 4.

Results

The modified intent-to-treat population included the ADVANCE (atogepant, n = 222; placebo, n = 214), ELEVATE (atogepant, n = 151; placebo, n = 154), and PROGRESS (atogepant, n = 256; placebo, n = 246) studies. Atogepant-treated participants had greater reductions in the proportion of participants with a migraine day on day 1. The odds ratio compared with placebo was 0.39 (95% CI 0.23–0.67; p = 0.0006) in ADVANCE, 0.53 (95% CI 0.29–0.94, p = 0.031) in ELEVATE, and 0.63 (95% CI 0.43–0.93, p = 0.021) in PROGRESS. Atogepant treatment reduced WMDs at weeks 1–4 and MMDs in the first 4 weeks, and improved AIM-D and EQ-5D-5L at all assessed timepoints for weeks 1–4 compared with placebo.

Discussions

Atogepant 60 mg QD demonstrated superiority to placebo in efficacy and functional measures in the first 4 weeks of treatment across 3 preventive studies, 2 in EM and 1 in CM.

Episodic migraine prevention — rimegepant evidence and recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against rimegepant for the prevention of episodic migraine (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, rimegepant 75 mg taken every other day decreased monthly migraine days by 4.3 days per month during weeks 9–12 compared with 3.5 days for placebo (p = 0.0099); after the screening of 1,591 patients, 741 received study medication (370 rimegepant and 371 placebo), and secondarily 49% achieved at least a 50% reduction compared with 41% in the placebo group, while AEs were reported equally (36% of both treatment groups). The study comprised a 4-week observational screening phase, a 12-week double-blind treatment phase, and a 52-week open-label extension phase, the quality of the evidence for this recommendation was moderate, and the primary endpoint results demonstrated rimegepant was superior to placebo.

### Eptinezumab in episodic migraine: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (PROMISE-1) [^117KGckZ]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These results demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful migraine preventive effect of eptinezumab in patients with episodic migraine over weeks 1–12 following the first IV administration. The ≥ 75% migraine responder rates were 24.7% for patients treated with eptinezumab 30 mg, 22.2% for 100 mg, and 29.7% for 300 mg, compared with 16.2% for placebo, with ≥ 50% responder rates of 50.2%, 49.8%, 56.3%, and 37.4%, respectively. These findings are consistent with previous phase 2 results in patients with episodic migraine, where 33% of patients treated with eptinezumab 1000 mg experienced a ≥ 75% reduction in monthly migraine days over 12 weeks compared with 9% in the placebo group. Similarly, 51% of patients receiving eptinezumab 1000 mg demonstrated a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs compared to 33% in those patients receiving placebo.

The preventive effects of eptinezumab in patients with episodic migraine were observed as early as the first day after administration (day 1), with a > 50% reduction in the percentage of patients with a migraine on day 1 compared to baseline in the 100 mg and 300 mg treatment groups. The results seen on the first day following the administration, if normalized to a 28-day period, are reflective of the prevalence observed over weeks 1–12. During the first month following administration, nearly a third of patients treated with eptinezumab 100 mg (30.8%) and 300 mg (31.5%) experienced a ≥ 75% reduction in migraine days. The migraine preventive effect of eptinezumab was maintained over the full 12-week dosing interval, with patients receiving eptinezumab experiencing significantly greater reductions from baseline in mean migraine days during weeks 1–12 relative to placebo (the primary endpoint). Within the statistical testing hierarchy, eptinezumab 30 mg did not achieve significance for any of the prespecified primary and key secondary endpoints; thus, formal statistical testing of the remaining endpoints was not performed (for more information, please see Supplemental material 3).

### Atogepant (Qulipta) [^117DZBKE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Episodic Migraine

The efficacy of QULIPTA for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults was demonstrated in two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2). The studies enrolled patients with at least a 1-year history of migraine with or without aura, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria.

In Study 1 (NCT03777059), 910 patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive QULIPTA 10 mg (N = 222), QULIPTA 30 mg (N = 230), QULIPTA 60 mg (N = 235), or placebo (N = 223), once daily for 12 weeks. In Study 2 (NCT02848326), 652 patients were randomized 1:2:2:2 to receive QULIPTA 10 mg (N = 94), QULIPTA 30 mg (N = 185), QULIPTA 60 mg (N = 187), or placebo (N = 186), once daily for 12 weeks. In both studies, patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids) as needed. The use of a concomitant medication that acts on the CGRP pathway was not permitted for either acute or preventive treatment of migraine. The studies excluded patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks within six months prior to screening.

### Reversion from chronic migraine to episodic migraine following treatment with erenumab: results of aanalysis of a randomized, 12-week, double-blind study and a 52-week, open-label extension [^114eMwNV]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine reversion rates from chronic migraine to episodic migraine during long-term erenumab treatment.

Methods

A daily headache diary was completed during the 12-week, double-blind treatment phase of a placebo-controlled trial comparing erenumab 70mg, 140mg, and placebo, and weeks 1–12, 21–24, 37–40, and 49–52 of the open-label treatment phase. Chronic migraine to episodic migraine reversion rates were assessed over the double-blind treatment phase; persistent reversion to episodic migraine over 24 weeks (double-blind treatment phase through the first 12 weeks in the open-label treatment phase), long-term persistent reversion to episodic migraine over 64 weeks (double-blind treatment phase plus open-label treatment phase); delayed reversion to episodic migraine through the first 12 weeks of the open-label treatment phase among patients remaining in chronic migraine during the double-blind treatment phase.

Results

In the double-blind treatment phase, 53.1% (95% confidence interval: 47.8–58.3) of 358 erenumab-treated completers had reversion to episodic migraine; monthly reversion rates to episodic migraine were typically higher among patients receiving 140mg versus 70mg. Among 181 completers (receiving erenumab for 64 weeks), 98 (54.1% [95% confidence interval: 46.6–61.6]) had reversion to episodic migraine during the double-blind treatment phase; of those, 96.9% (95% confidence interval: 91.3–99.4) had persistent reversion to episodic migraine, 96.8% (95% confidence interval: 91.1–99.3) of whom had long-term persistent reversion to episodic migraine. Delayed reversion to episodic migraine occurred in 36/83 (43.4% [95% confidence interval: 32.5–54.7]) patients; of these, 77.8% (95% confidence interval: 60.9–89.9) persisted in reversion through week 64.

Conclusions

Patients with reversion to episodic migraine at week 12 will likely persist as episodic migraine with longer-term erenumab; others may achieve delayed reversion to episodic migraine. Clinical trial registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02066415.

### Responder rates with eptinezumab over 24 weeks in patients with prior preventive migraine treatment failures: post hoc analysis of the DELIVER randomized clinical trial [^114Kya67]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DELIVER comprised patients with episodic or chronic migraine with documented evidence of two to four prior preventive treatment failures. Patients with multiple treatment failures could be considered to have resistant or refractory migraine. Resistant migraine is defined as at least three failures of different preventive migraine medication classes with at least eight debilitating headache days per month for at least three consecutive months; preventive treatment refractory migraine is defined as failure of all available preventive migraine medication classes with at least eight debilitating headache days per month for at least six consecutive months. Patients with resistant or refractory migraine experience a negative impact on quality of life and personal, professional and social activities, as well as increased healthcare costs, and patients can feel hopeless about their disease state and remission. Resistant or refractory migraine may be more difficult to treat, and although the demographic was not captured in this study a proportion of the DELIVER population may have met resistant or refractory migraine criteria. The ≥ 30% MRR threshold has been deemed clinically meaningful by the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Subcommittee and is a treatment‐renewal guideline per NICE and CADTH. Beyond guidelines, whether treatment is providing meaningful benefit to the patient should be amongst the items discussed between clinicians and their patients when determining next steps with treatment.

### Long-term safety, efficacy and functional outcomes of atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine [^116N1gbC]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

AimLong-term data for oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, atogepant, in episodic migraine (EM) has been reported. This is the first report on one-year outcomes in participants with chronic migraine (CM) and in the EM population with prior preventive treatment failures. Here, we report the long-term safety, tolerability, efficacy and functional outcomes of one-year preventive treatment of EM or CM with atogepant. MethodsThis is an interim analysis of an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, 156-week, safety extension study that enrolled completers from phase 3 PROGRESS and ELEVATE trials. The participants completing week 52 or early termination were evaluated. Eligible adults with at least a one-year history of migraine, with either CM (PROGRESS) or EM who previously had inadequate response to two to four classes of conventional oral preventive treatments (ELEVATE). All participants received atogepant 60mg once daily. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability of atogepant. Efficacy and functional outcomes were prespecified exploratory analyses. ResultsOf 596 participants, 595 (PROGRESS, n = 325; ELEVATE, n = 270) were treated and included in the safety population and 524 (PROGRESS, n = 284; ELEVATE, n = 240) were included in the modified intent-to-treat population. In this interim analysis, mean duration of atogepant exposure was 496.5 days. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 79.0% of participants; most were mild/moderate and not related to atogepant. Common TEAEs (≥ 5%) included COVID-19 (28.7%), nasopharyngitis (10.9%) and constipation (8.2%). TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 5.9% of participants. One death attributed to asphyxia by housefire was observed. Other serious TEAEs occurred in 5.5% of participants and none were related to atogepant. Alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3× upper limit of normal occurred in two participants; neither met Hy's law criteria. Improvements in efficacy and functional outcomes from lead-in study baseline were observed at weeks 13–16 in this open-label study and were consistent through 48 and 52 weeks, respectively. ConclusionsOverall safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of atogepant and the drug was well-tolerated over the course of the study. No new safety signals were identified. Improvements in efficacy and functional outcomes were consistent during the study. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04686136.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^1128AEWu]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Episodic migraine prevention — epidemiology and prior guidance: "Epidemiologic studies suggest approximately 38% of individuals with migraine need preventive therapy, but only 3%–13% currently use it". Regarding botulinum toxin, "Separate guidelines are available for botulinum toxin. The 2008 guideline included a Level B recommendation that botulinum toxin was probably ineffective for the prevention of episodic migraine".

### Effect of fremanezumab compared with placebo for prevention of episodic migraine: a randomized clinical trial [^116ZGtJd]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Fremanezumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that targets calcitonin gene-related peptide, may be effective for treating episodic migraine.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of fremanezumab compared with placebo for prevention of episodic migraine with a monthly dosing regimen or a single higher dose.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted at 123 sites in 9 countries from March 23, 2016 (first patient randomized), to April 10, 2017, consisting of a screening visit, 28-day pretreatment period, 12-week treatment period, and final evaluation at week 12.

Participants

Study participants were aged 18 to 70 years with episodic migraine (6–14 headache days, with at least 4 migraine days, during 28-day pretreatment period). Patients who had previous treatment failure with 2 classes of migraine-preventive medication were excluded.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous monthly dosing of fremanezumab (n = 290; 225 mg at baseline, week 4, and week 8); a single higher dose of fremanezumab, as intended to support a quarterly dose regimen (n = 291; 675 mg of fremanezumab at baseline; placebo at weeks 4 and 8); or placebo (n = 294; at baseline, week 4, and week 8).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was mean change in mean number of monthly migraine days during the 12-week period after the first dose.

Results

Among 875 patients who were randomized (mean age, 41.8 [SD, 12.1] years; 742 women [85%]), 791 (90.4%) completed the trial. From baseline to 12 weeks, mean migraine days per month decreased from 8.9 days to 4.9 days in the fremanezumab monthly dosing group, from 9.2 days to 5.3 days in the fremanezumab single-higher-dose group, and from 9.1 days to 6.5 days in the placebo group. This resulted in a difference with monthly dosing vs placebo of -1.5 days (95% CI, -2.01 to -0.93 days; P < .001) and with single higher dosing vs placebo of -1.3 days (95% CI, -1.79 to -0.72 days; P < .001). The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation were injection site erythema (n = 3), injection site induration (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 2), anxiety (n = 2), and depression (n = 2).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with episodic migraine in whom multiple medication classes had not previously failed, subcutaneous fremanezumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a statistically significant 1.3- to 1.5-day reduction in the mean number of monthly migraine days over a 12-week period. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness against other preventive medications and in patients in whom multiple preventive drug classes have failed and to determine long-term safety and efficacy.

### Treatment approaches to maximizing therapeutic response in migraine [^111VS4zm]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic condition that presents with episodic disabling attacks, which can respond unpredictably to therapies. Studies support early treatment intervention strategies as part of the routine clinical care of migraine patients. Identifying illness severity and stratifying treatment accordingly (as in other diseases such as asthma, diabetes, or hypertension) improves patient outcome. Assessing the presence of any coexisting conditions, such as depression or anxiety, is another essential part of managing migraine.

### Efficacy of galcanezumab in patients with episodic migraine and a history of preventive treatment failure: results from two global randomized clinical trials [^116WmJji]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The efficacy of galcanezumab, a monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, has been demonstrated in two pivotal trials in patients with episodic migraine.

Methods

EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 were identical phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with episodic migraine. Mean migraine headache days per month at baseline was 9. Patients were randomized 2:1:1 to monthly injections of placebo, galcanezumab 120 mg/240 mg during the 6-month double-blind treatment period. Key efficacy outcomes were assessed in subgroups amongst patients for whom, previously, for efficacy and/or safety/tolerability reasons (i) one or more (≥ 1) preventives failed, (ii) two or more (≥ 2) preventives failed and (iii) preventives were never used, or used but not failed (no prior failure).

Results

In an integrated analysis of EVOLVE studies, galcanezumab 120 mg/240 mg versus placebo led to larger overall mean (SE) reductions in monthly migraine headache days across 6 months in patients with prior preventive failures (P < 0.001): ≥ 1 failure: 120 mg: -4.0 (0.4); 240 mg: -4.2 (0.5); placebo: -1.3 (0.4); ≥ 2 failures: 120 mg: -3.1 (0.7); 240 mg: -3.8 (0.8); placebo: -0.5 (0.6). Similar results were observed amongst patients with no prior failure, but the placebo response was larger: 120 mg: -4.7 (0.2); 240 mg: -4.5 (0.2); placebo: -3.0 (0.2) (P < 0.001 versus placebo). Significant improvements were observed with galcanezumab versus placebo for ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% reduction in monthly migraine headache days.

Conclusion

In patients with episodic migraine treated with galcanezumab, those with ≥ 1 or ≥ 2 prior preventive failures had significantly larger improvements, versus placebo, in efficacy outcomes. Similar results were observed in patients with no prior failure, with a larger placebo response.

### Atogepant for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine (PROGRESS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^113tr6b5]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) was published by Patricia Pozo-Rosich and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Migraine. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the trial question was: what is the role of atogepant in patients with chronic migraine? In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the population was: 512 patients (452 female, 60 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–80 years with ≥ 1 year history of chronic migraine. The key exclusion criteria were cluster headache; painful cranial neuropathy; history of inadequate response to > 4 preventive migraine treatments; use of opioids or barbiturates for at least 4 days per month in the previous 3 months. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the interventions were: n = 257 atogepant (at an oral dose of 30 mg BID) n = 255 placebo (matching placebo). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks (7.5 days vs. 5.1 days; MD 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.5). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in monthly headache days (7.4 days vs. 5.1 days; MD 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.4) Significant increase in reduction in monthly acute medication use days (6.7 days vs. 4.1 days; MD 2.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.6) Significant increase in ≥ 50% reduction in 3 month average of monthly migraine days (43% vs. 26%; OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.1). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent serious adverse events. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 30 mg BID) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 18–80 years with ≥ 1 year history of chronic migraine, atogepant was superior to placebo with respect to a least-square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks.

### Responder rates with eptinezumab over 24 weeks in patients with prior preventive migraine treatment failures: post hoc analysis of the DELIVER randomized clinical trial [^116MToXU]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Eptinezumab reduced monthly migraine days more than placebo in the DELIVER study, a clinical trial with patients with difficult-to-treat migraine and prior preventive treatment failures. This post hoc analysis assesses the sustained response to eptinezumab at the population and patient level and evaluates the potential for response in initial non-responders.

Methods

Adults with chronic or episodic migraine and two to four prior preventive treatment failures were randomized to eptinezumab 100mg, 300mg or placebo every 12weeks. Primary outcomes in this post hoc analysis are the proportion of patients with ≥ 30%, ≥ 50% or ≥ 75% reduction in monthly migraine days (i.e., migraine responder rates [MRRs]) during weeks 1–12 and weeks 13–24 and across 4-week intervals. Secondary outcomes are maintenance and shifts in MRRs from weeks 1–12 to weeks 13–24.

Results

Between weeks 1–12 and 13–24, ≥ 30% MRRs increased from 65.9% to 70.4% (100mg) and from 71.0% to 74.5% (300mg), versus 36.9% to 43.1% (placebo). The ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% MRRs were sustained or increased over the 24-week period. The largest increase in ≥ 30% MRRs occurred after the second infusion with eptinezumab. The percentage of initial non-responders (< 30% MRRs during weeks 1–12) who experienced response (≥ 30% MRRs during weeks 13–24) to the second dose was 34.7% (100mg) and 30.4% (300mg) with eptinezumab versus 21.1% with placebo.

Conclusion

Across MRR thresholds, most patients who responded to eptinezumab during weeks 1–12 maintained or improved response during weeks 13–24. More than one-third of initial non-responders became responders after their second infusion.

### Atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in Japanese participants: a phase 2 / 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an active treatment extension (RELEASE) [^114WYtLn]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

BackgroundAtogepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist approved in the US and EU for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine (EM) in Japanese participants. MethodsRELEASE was a phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling adult participants with a ≥ 1-year history of migraine, < 50 years of age at time of migraine onset, history of 4–14 monthly migraine days (MMDs), and < 15 monthly headache days in the three months prior to screening and during the screening/baseline period. The study included a four-week screening/baseline period, 12-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP), 12-week active treatment extension period, and 30-day safety follow-up. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to placebo, atogepant 10mg once daily (QD), 30mg QD, or 60mg QD for the 12-week DBTP. Completers of the DBTP could continue to the 12-week active treatment extension period where the placebo group was rerandomized 1:1:1 to atogepant 10mg, 30mg, or 60mg; atogepant groups continued the same dose. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean MMDs across the 12-week DBTP. ResultsOf 807 participants screened, 523 were treated in the 12-week DBTP (Safety Population 1 [placebo, N = 134; atogepant 10mg, N = 126; 30mg, N = 131; 60mg, N = 132]; modified intent-to-treat population [placebo, N = 133; atogepant 10mg, N = 127; 30mg, N = 130; 60mg, N = 131]). The least square mean difference (95% confidence interval) from placebo in mean MMDs across 12 weeks was -1.57 (-2.24, -0.89) for atogepant 10mg, -1.90 (-2.57, -1.22) for 30mg, and -2.10 (-2.78, -1.43) for 60mg (all p < 0.0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the DBTP occurred in 46.3%, 45.2%, 38.9%, and 43.2% of participants receiving placebo, atogepant 10mg, 30mg and 60mg, respectively. During the DBTP, TEAEs occurring ≥ 5% were constipation and nasopharyngitis, and there was one serious TEAE in the atogepant 10mg group considered not related to treatment. TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation were infrequent in all treatment groups in the DBTP. Safety was consistent in the 12-week active treatment extension period. ConclusionsAtogepant treatment demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in mean MMDs compared with placebo across the 12-week DBTP in Japanese participants with EM. The safety profile of atogepant in Japanese participants was consistent with the known safety profile in the global population. No new safety signals were identified.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^115ZTGZ5]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Analysis of evidence — The original search identified 179 articles, and a supplemental search (2007–2009) yielded 105 additional articles; of the total 284 articles, 29 were classified as Class I or Class II. Included studies randomized adult patients with migraine to an agent or a comparator (including placebo) and utilized masked outcome assessment, and at least 2 panelists independently reviewed and rated each study according to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) therapeutic classification of evidence scheme; studies with completion rates below 80% were downgraded. Studies were excluded if they assessed acute migraine treatment, migraine aura treatment/prevention, or nonpharmacologic treatments.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^111Na1X9]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Topiramate for episodic migraine prevention — evidence synthesis and comparative effectiveness — has Class I and II support and shows placebo-controlled and active-comparator efficacy. Results of 5 Class II studies support those of the Class I studies showing topiramate as effective for migraine prevention, with four demonstrating significant improvement over placebo and one suggesting equivalence of topiramate (100, 200 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day); two studies comparing topiramate and amitriptyline (25–150 mg/day) reported no difference in efficacy for primary endpoints, and one Class II 24-week pilot study failed to show a difference between topiramate 200 mg and placebo. Topiramate is established as effective for migraine prevention (4 Class I studies, multiple Class II studies; 1 negative Class II study), and topiramate is probably as effective for migraine prevention as propranolol, sodium valproate, and amitriptyline as noted on-page with their respective study class counts.

### Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor as a novel target for the management of people with episodic migraine: current evidence and safety profile of erenumab [^115AiJrS]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, all completed studies on episodic migraine showed clinically significant effectiveness of erenumab at a minimum dose of 70 mg on the main migraine variables. Both studies NCT01952574 and ARISE showed the same difference of −1.1 days in the main change in monthly migraine days with the 70 mg dose vs placebo for a 3-month duration of treatment. ARISE also showed a 0.6 day reduction of the acute migraine-specific medication days and a 10.2% increase in the percentage of patients presenting a 50% or higher reduction of monthly migraine days with the same dose vs placebo. A 6-month duration treatment, as carried out in the STRIVE study, enhanced efficacy for the same dose of 70 mg vs placebo, reducing by 1.4 the mean monthly number of migraine days and by 0.9 the migraine-specifc medication days and enhancing by 16.3% the percentage of patients presenting a 50% or greater reduction of mean monthly number of migraine days.

STRIVE also showed higher effects with the 140 mg dose vs placebo: a reduction of 1.9 migraine days and 1.4 migraine-specific medication days and an increase of 23% in the percentage of patients presenting a 50% or greater reduction of mean monthly number of migraine days.

In conclusion, the average response rate and reduction of mean monthly number of migraine days are similar across studies for the same duration of treatment and same dose of erenumab, 70 mg. The higher dose of 140 mg provides slightly better outcomes, but the cost/benefit ratio of dose increasing will need to be explored further in future studies, especially for longer-term treatments.

The study PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) was published by Patricia Pozo-Rosich and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Migraine. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the trial question was: what is the role of atogepant in patients with chronic migraine? In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the population was: 516 patients (450 female, 66 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–80 years with ≥ 1 year history of chronic migraine. The key exclusion criteria were cluster headache; painful cranial neuropathy; history of inadequate response to > 4 preventive migraine treatments; use of opioids or barbiturates for at least 4 days per month in the previous 3 months. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the interventions were: n = 261 atogepant (at an oral dose of 60 mg once daily) n = 255 placebo (matching placebo). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks (6.9 days vs. 5.1 days; MD 1.8, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.9). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in least-square mean reduction in monthly headache days (7 days vs. 5.1 days; MD 1.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.9) Significant increase in reduction in mean monthly acute medication use days (6.2 days vs. 4.1 days; MD 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1) Significant increase in ≥ 50% reduction in 3 month average of monthly migraine days (41% vs. 26%; OR 2, 95% CI 1.4 to 3). In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent serious adverse events. In the PROGRESS (atogepant 60 mg OD) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 18–80 years with ≥ 1 year history of chronic migraine, atogepant was superior to placebo with respect to a least-square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^111ub6b5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A rapid onset of efficacy for migraine preventive treatments is a clinically desirable and meaningful treatment attribute prioritized by people living with migraine and by clinicians. This analysis reports the efficacy and improvements in functional measures during the first 4 weeks of treatment with atogepant 60 mg QD using data from 3 pivotal trials, ADVANCE, ELEVATE, and PROGRESS. The proportion of participants with a migraine day on day 1 was reduced with atogepant treatment. Atogepant also demonstrated a reduction in WMDs as early as week 1 and in MMDs across the first 4 weeks of treatment. Improvements in functional measures were shown with atogepant as early as week 1 for both domains of the AIM-D and at weeks 1–2 for both components of the EQ-5D-5L. These results were observed across all 3 studies, illustrating a consistent effect across a representative spectrum of migraine disease severity. The reduction in MMDs and the improvement in AIM-D during the first 4 weeks are consistent with the significant reduction in MMDs and improvement in AIM-D during the 12-week treatment period previously reported for all 3 trials (eTable 1). The atogepant safety profile during the first 4 weeks is consistent with the safety profile during the previously reported 12-week treatment periods (eTable 2).

The onset of efficacy of preventive treatments, including onabotulinumtoxinA and injectable mAb treatments targeting CGRP or the CGRP receptor, has been studied in multiple secondary and post hoc analyses. Participants treated with onabotulinumtoxinA for CM saw a reduction in headache and migraine days per week at week 1. Galcanezumab (CGRP-targeted mAb) treated participants with EM demonstrated reduced MHDs at week 1 and a lower proportion had migraine headaches beginning 1 day postinjection. Erenumab (mAb targeting the canonical CGRP receptor) treated participants with EM and CM showed reductions in WMDs within the first week of treatment. Eptinezumab (CGRP-targeted mAb) treatment was associated with a reduction in the proportion of participants with EM and CM with a migraine at day 1 postinjection. Fremanezumab (CGRP-targeted mAb) treatment was associated with reduced mean weekly headache days at week 1 and increased proportions of participants with EM and CM reporting no headache 1 day postinjection. The efficacy results presented here show that the rapid onset of treatment effects seen with injectable CGRP targeted treatments or onabotulinumtoxinA can also be achieved with once daily oral atogepant.

### Safety and efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults for whom conventional oral preventive treatments have failed (ELEVATE): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b trial [^114DTcAW]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The study ELEVATE was published by Cristina Tassorelli and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Migraine. In the ELEVATE study, the trial question was: what is the effect of atogepant in patients with episodic migraine who had previously failed conventional oral preventive treatments? In the ELEVATE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ELEVATE study, the population was: 313 patients (280 female, 33 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–80 years with episodic migraine who had previously failed 2–4 classes of conventional oral treatments for migraine prevention. The key exclusion criteria were clinically significant hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or neurologic disease; ≥ 15 headache days/month 3 months prior to the first visit; history of migraine accompanied by diplopia or decreased level of consciousness or retinal migraine. In the ELEVATE study, the interventions were: n = 156 atogepant (at an oral dose of 60 mg/day) n = 157 placebo (matching placebo). In the ELEVATE study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks (4.2 days vs. 1.9 days; MD 2.4, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.2). In the ELEVATE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction of ≥ 50% in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks (51% vs. 18%; OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.9 to 8.1). In the ELEVATE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent adverse events. In the ELEVATE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 18–80 years with episodic migraine who had previously failed 2–4 classes of conventional oral treatments for migraine prevention, atogepant was superior to placebo with respect to least square mean reduction in monthly migraine days across 12 weeks.

### Randomised, controlled trial of erenumab for the prevention of episodic migraine in patients from Asia, the middle east, and latin America: the EMPOwER study [^111dyd3i]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The EMPOwER study conducted in patients from Asia, the Middle East and Latin America met the primary and secondary endpoints. Treatment with erenumab was associated with a statistically significant reduction in monthly migraine days and in the use of acute migraine-specific medication, significantly increased achievement of ≥ 50%, ≥ 75% and 100% reduction in monthly migraine days, and improved patient-reported outcomes over a period of 3 months compared with placebo. Compared with the erenumab 70 mg dose, erenumab 140 mg was associated with a consistent numerical superiority across all efficacy endpoints, a finding consistent with previous pivotal studies of erenumab.

Combined with the efficacy results, the low proportion of patients who discontinued the study due to adverse events and the lack of any new safety findings, extend the evidence for erenumab as a safe preventive treatment for episodic migraine to ethnicities previously under-represented in prior erenumab trials.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of atogepant as preventive treatment in resistant individuals with chronic migraine: six-month real-world evidence [^113uCjmP]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

BackgroundThe discovery of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) as a key player in migraine pathophysiology has revolutionized the approach to preventive treatment. Atogepant, an oral small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonist, has shown promising efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for both episodic and chronic migraine. However, real-world evidence, particularly in individuals with chronic migraine and multiple preventive treatment failures, remains limited. This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of daily atogepant 60mg in a homogeneous cohort of resistant individuals with chronic migraine over a 24-week period to extend the short-term observation assessed in previous real-world studies. MethodsIn the present real-world, prospective, monocentric study, a total of 100 participants (93% female; mean ± SD, age 43 ± 11 years) with chronic migraine with at least three previous treatment failures without medication overuse headache were consecutively recruited and received atogepant 60mg daily for six months. All participants had failed a median of six previous preventive treatments, including CGRP-monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (68%) and onabotulinumtoxin-A (BoNT-A) (14%). Primary outcomes included change in monthly migraine days (MMDs) and greater than 50% responder rate at 12 and 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in monthly headache days (MHDs), acute medication intake (MAMI), headache impact (Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and patient satisfaction (Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC)), change in MMDs, demographic and clinical features associated with greater than 50% responder rate, as well as effectiveness in individuals with previous CGRP-mAbs failure. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were also recorded. ResultsAt weeks 12 and 24, MMDs were reduced by 5.6 and 7.1 days from baseline, respectively (p < 0.001), while 45% and 53% of participants achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs. Significant improvements were also seen in MHDs (-8.1 days), MAMI (-5.1 days) and HIT-6 scores (-6.2 points). Conversion from chronic to episodic migraine occurred in 60% of participants. PGIC results showed that 69% of participants reported feeling "much" or "very much" better. Logistic regression identified higher socioeconomic status (odds ratio = 2.87) as a positive predictor and previous CGRP-mAb failure (odds ratio = 0.38) as a negative predictor of treatment response. Nevertheless, among individuals with more than one CGRP-mAb failure, 47% achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs. TEAEs were reported by 53% of participants, with constipation (28%) and fatigue (16%) being the most common. ConclusionsAtogepant 60mg daily demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit and good tolerability in real-world individuals with treatment-resistant chronic migraine over a 24-week period. These findings extend data from RCTs and real-world studies limited to 12-week period of observation, supporting atogepant as an effective option even in individuals with prior CGRP-mAb failure.

### Early onset and maintenance effect of galcanezumab in Japanese patients with episodic migraine [^116QvhiN]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Similar to the results observed in this study for galcanezumab, botulinum toxin A has also demonstrated an early onset of effect in chronic migraine, significantly reducing weekly headache and migraine days starting at week 1 of treatment. However, botulinum toxin A has not been demonstrated to be more efficacious than placebo for episodic migraineand is only approved for the prevention of chronic migraine in the USA and Europe. The results of our study suggest that galcanezumab, a CGRP monoclonal antibody, may be more rapidly acting than many other conventional preventive treatments currently available, and may overcome the challenges associated with conventional preventive treatments, including lack of efficacy, low adherence, and high discontinuation rates.

The current study showed that approximately half of the patients receiving galcanezumab experienced ≥ 50% response at each week from weeks 1 to 4. The monthly 50% response rate also remained stable; regardless of the dose, approximately 40–50% of patients treated with galcanezumab had a 50% response rate at all time points over the 6-month treatment period. In this study, patients were Japanese, slightly older, and had lower body mass index compared with the patients included in previous trials. However, compared with the results from the pooled analysis of the previous randomized controlled trials, the 50% response rates in the current study were generally similar over the treatment period. These results correlate with a recent cohort study, which showed no association between clinical characteristics and a 50% response rate in a small number of patients with episodic migraine, suggesting that patients' baseline demographic and clinical characteristics may not affect patients' responsiveness to galcanezumab in episodic migraine.

### New therapeutic developments in chronic migraine [^117ToQCE]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic migraine is a common cause of chronic daily headache, which is often refractory to standard treatment. New research has increased our understanding of this disorder and its treatment. This review focuses on recent clinical trials and advances in our understanding of migraine pathophysiology.

Recent Findings

Migraine research has traditionally focused on the more common episodic form of the disorder, but recent clinical trials have started to focus on chronic migraine or chronic daily headache. Topiramate, onabotulinum toxin type A, gabapentin, petasites and tizanidine are among the agents that appear to be effective in the treatment of chronic migraine. New acute medications including an inhaled form of dihydroergotamine will soon be available and neuromodulatory procedures such as occipital nerve stimulation may be effective for the most disabled patients. In the past few years, other studies have shed light on potential risk factors for chronic migraine such as medication-overuse headache, temporomandibular disorders, obstructive sleep apnea and obesity.

Summary

This review explains advances in the treatment of chronic migraine, a common disorder seen in neurological practice. These new advances in preventive treatment and a better understanding of its risk factors will allow clinicians to better identify individuals at greatest risk and prevent the development of chronic migraine.

### Time course of efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from the randomized, double-blind ADVANCE trial [^112keK3e]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Findings

Once-daily oral atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine provided a rapid onset of action, with a statistically significant decrease in the likelihood of experiencing a migraine attack as early as the first full day after administration.
All doses of atogepant were associated with a statistically significant reduction in weekly migraine days across the first week of treatment and each subsequent week within the first month of treatment.
All doses of atogepant were associated with a statistically significant reduction in monthly migraine days in each month (4-week interval) of the 3-month double-blind treatment period.

### Patients' values and preferences regarding pharmacologic treatments for the prevention of episodic migraine headache: a systematic review for the American College of Physicians [^113xFBUv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Decision making regarding pharmacologic treatments for the prevention of episodic migraine may depend on the importance that patients place on outcomes and specific treatment preferences.

Purpose

To assess patients' values and preferences regarding pharmacologic treatments for the prevention of episodic migraine.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and CINAHL from inception to April 2024.

Study Selection

Quantitative studies reporting on values and preferences regarding pharmacologic treatments for the prevention of migraine in adults were eligible.

Data Extraction

We extracted data on study design, participants, and findings and assessed risk of bias using a tool developed by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group.

Data Synthesis

We included 6 studies (5 discrete choice experiments and 1 survey) comprising a total of 2307 participants and assessing the importance of a total of 32 attributes. Risk of bias was moderate in 3 and low in 3 studies; all but 1 were industry spon sored. Migraine severity, frequency, and duration were found to be the most important among several outcomes including acute medication need and side effects (low certainty). Other outcomes of importance were migraine attack on day 1 postdosing (moderate certainty) and duration of daily activity limitations (high certainty). Patients preferred oral tablets to injections and infusions (moderate certainty).

Limitations

Importance of attributes relative to each other could not be assessed due to the scarcity of direct comparisons. Participant sampling was unclearly reported in most studies.

Conclusion

Patients may have the strongest preference for oral treatments that reduce the severity, frequency, and duration of their migraine attacks, which reduce the duration of daily activity limitations and reduce risk of migraine on day 1. Side effects may be less important.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^114g5hyr]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
Change From Baseline in Mean Monthly Migraine Days in the First 4 Weeks for ADVANCE (A), ELEVATE (B), and PROGRESS (C) (Modified Intent-to-Treat Population)

The results from ADVANCE have been previously published and are included for reference.n = number of participants assessed at timepoint; N = number of participants randomized to study treatment.

Functional Outcomes

Baseline mean PDA domain scores of AIM-D across treatment arms ranged from 14.84 to 15.70 in ADVANCE, 16.71 to 18.30 in ELEVATE, and 28.91 to 30.54 in PROGRESS. Atogepant-treated participants had greater reductions (improvements in the performance of daily activities) in mean weekly PDA domain scores starting at week 1 compared with placebo. The LSMD from placebo at week 1 was −4.22 (95% CI −6.22 to −2.23; nominal p < 0.0001) in ADVANCE, −6.76 (95% CI −9.35 to −4.16, nominal p < 0.0001) in ELEVATE, and −5.83 (95% CI −8.36 to −3.30, nominal p < 0.0001) in PROGRESS (Figure 5). Reductions were consistent through weeks 2, 3, and 4, with comparisons at all timepoints showing greater reductions than placebo. A greater proportion of participants achieved the clinically meaningful threshold of ≥ 9 (for participants with EM) or ≥ 13.1 (for participants with CM) point improvement from baseline in the PDA domain score at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 compared with placebo across all 3 trials (eFigure 2).

### Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for the prevention of migraine: highlights from pivotal studies and the clinical relevance of this new drug class [^112LpM1z]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the new drug class of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists (monoclonal antibodies) and their clinical relevance in migraine prophylaxis. Data Sources: A literature search was performed in PubMed (January 2009 to November 2019) using the terms migraine, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab for clinical trials and studies. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Reports from human studies in English were evaluated for clinical evidence supporting pharmacology, efficacy, and adverse events. Initial pharmacokinetic and preclinical studies were excluded. Data Synthesis: In chronic and episodic migraine, prophylaxis with injections of monoclonal antibodies antagonizing CGRP reduced monthly migraine days with minimal clinically significant adverse events. In addition, there is evidence supporting efficacy in refractory migraine despite optimal prophylaxis. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This is the first target-specific migraine prophylaxis treatment to show efficacy with minimal adverse effects. A higher drug cost is a barrier but is balanced by improved quality of life. Current therapies have limited efficacy and tolerability because of poor side effect profiles. CGRP antagonists represent a shift to more precise migraine treatments. Conclusions: Monoclonal antibodies inhibiting CGRP are effective in migraine prophylaxis with minimal adverse effects. Targeting CGRP is a novel clinical strategy in managing migraine.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^111SYJW2]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

Full methodological details for ADVANCE (NCT03777059, conducted within the United States), ELEVATE (NCT04740827, conducted in North America and Europe), and PROGRESS (NCT03855137, conducted in North America, Europe, and East Asia), including study design, dates, size, randomization and blinding, and inclusion and exclusion criteria, have been previously published.

In ADVANCE, participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive atogepant 10 mg QD, 30 mg QD, 60 mg QD, or placebo. In PROGRESS, participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive atogepant 30 mg twice daily (BID), 60 mg QD, or placebo. In ELEVATE, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive atogepant 60 mg QD or placebo (eFigure 1). All analyses reported here include the approved atogepant dose of 60 mg QD, the only dose common among all 3 trials.

Participants

ADVANCE and ELEVATE included adults 18–80 years old with ≥ 1-year history of EM with or without aura, defined using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). Participants had 4–14 migraine days per month (based on patient history) in the 3 months before visit 1 and in the 4-week screening/baseline period per the electronic diary (eDiary), with a migraine onset at less than 50 years of age. PROGRESS included adults 18–80 years with ≥ 1-year history of CM, defined using ICHD-3 criteria, with migraine onset at less than 50 years. Participants had ≥ 15 headache days per month (based on patient history) in ≥ 3 months before the baseline/screening visit, and ≥ 15 headache days, including ≥ 8 migraine days during the 4-week baseline period based on eDiary. In ADVANCE and PROGRESS, participants could have a previous inadequate response to ≤ 4 conventional oral migraine preventive treatments. ELEVATE required participants who had previously been failed by 2–4 classes of conventional oral migraine preventive treatments, based on study definitions for lack of efficacy, tolerability, or both. PROGRESS allowed enrollment of participants with acute medication overuse at baseline, whereas ADVANCE and ELEVATE did not. Additional key inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the eMethods.

### Early use of erenumab vs nonspecific oral migraine preventives… [^114j18S4]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The 12-month, interventional, global, multicenter, active-controlled, randomized clinical trial comparing sustained benefit of 2 treatment paradigms in adult episodic migraine patients, including 621 randomized patients, demonstrated that compared with nonspecific oral preventives, patients treated with erenumab were 6 times more likely to achieve 50% or greater reduction in monthly migraine days and 11 times more likely to complete the treatment on the first designated drug. Significant reduction in cumulative average MMDs was reported with erenumab treatment vs OMPM treatment. Substantially fewer patients in the erenumab arm compared with the OMPM arm switched medication and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. No new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that earlier use of erenumab in patients with EM who failed 1 or 2 previous preventive treatments provided greater and sustained efficacy, safety, and adherence than continuous OMPM. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03927144. The full analysis set comprised all randomized patients. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses used FAS. The mean change from baseline in cumulative average MMDs was significantly greater in the erenumab arm vs the OMPM arm, starting from month 1 and continuing through month 12. At month 12, the change from baseline in adjusted mean for MMDs was −4. 32 days and −2. 65 days.

The APPRAISE trial was also the first, to the authors' knowledge, clinical trial that reported a composite primary end point that combined widely accepted and clinically meaningful reduction of migraine frequency with sustained adherence to initially assigned treatment at 12 months, thus reflecting the 2 most common reasons for preventive treatment discontinuation: insufficient efficacy and/or tolerability.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^113wjV5q]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Change From Baseline in the Performance of Daily Activities Domain of the AIM-D at Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 for ADVANCE (A), ELEVATE (B), and PROGRESS (C) (Modified Intent-to-Treat Population)

n = number of participants assessed at timepoint; N = number of participants randomized to study treatment.

Baseline mean PI domain scores of AIM-D across treatment arms ranged from 11.27 to 11.91 in ADVANCE, 14.10 to 15.61 in ELEVATE, and 25.09 to 27.00 in PROGRESS. Atogepant-treated participants had greater reductions in mean weekly PI domain scores starting at week 1 compared with placebo. The LSMD from placebo at week 1 was −3.03 (95% CI −4.65 to −1.40; nominal p = 0.0003) in ADVANCE, −6.41 (95% CI −8.78 to −4.05, nominal p < 0.0001) in ELEVATE, and −4.12 (95% CI −6.39 to −1.86, nominal p = 0.0004) in PROGRESS (Figure 6). Reductions were consistent through weeks 2, 3, and 4, with comparisons at all timepoints showing greater reductions compared with placebo. A greater proportion of participants achieved the clinically meaningful threshold of ≥ 6 (for participants with EM) or ≥ 10 (for participants with CM) point improvement from baseline in the PI domain score at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 compared with placebo across all 3 trials (eFigure 3).

### Evaluation of galcanezumab for the prevention of episodic migraine… [^114dgahk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discontinuations owing to AEs were few and not statistically different for either galcanezumab treatment group compared with placebo. A total of 740 patients entered the posttreatment period, and 704 patients completed the posttreatment period. None of the discontinuations in the posttreatment period were owing to an AE, and the primary reason for discontinuation was "withdrawal by patient". The LS mean change difference from placebo was −1. 9 days for galcanezumab, 120 mg, and −1. 8 days for galcanezumab, 240 mg. Onset of effect was observed in month 1 for both galcanezumab treatment groups.

After multiplicity adjustment, the mean percentage of patients with at least 50%, at least 75%, and 100% reduction from baseline in monthly MHD during treatment was statistically significantly greater in both galcanezumab dose groups compared with placebo. For the MIDAS total score, galcanezumab treatment reduced the baseline mean score by approximately 20 points, resulting in a score of approximately 15. 0, which can be graded as "moderately limiting disability. "23 Efficacy results from this study confirmed those reported in phase 2 studies, 17, 18 and the treatment duration was twice as long in this study. These results were replicated in a similarly designed study 29 in which 915 patients were randomized and received at least 1 dose of IP. The large sample size and high completion rate during the 6-month treatment period provided more definitive conclusions with regard to efficacy and safety/tolerability than phase 2 studies. The 6-month duration of treatment allowed for an appropriate assessment of response durability. This longer treatment duration may have contributed to a higher rate of discontinuations during treatment than those observed in other studies of CGRP monoclonal antibodies with only 3-month treatment periods.

### Effect of preventive treatment with atogepant on quality of life, daily functioning, and headache impact across the spectrum of migraine: findings from three double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trials [^1144twrf]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to assess the effects of preventive migraine treatment with atogepant vs. placebo on patient-reported quality of life and functioning.

Methods

Analyses of patient-reported outcomes from three 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating preventive migraine treatment with atogepant 60 mg once-daily: ADVANCE (low-frequency episodic migraine [LFEM], 4–8 monthly migraine days [MMDs] and high-frequency episodic migraine [HFEM], 8–14 MMDs), PROGRESS (chronic migraine, CM) and ELEVATE (episodic migraine in those previously failed by two to four classes of oral preventive treatments).

Results

Least squares mean differences (95% confidence interval (CI)) in change from baseline were greater (p < 0.05) for atogepant vs. placebo for Migraine-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire Role Function-Restrictive domain scores at week 12 (ADVANCE: LFEM 12.0 (95% CI = 6.0–18.0), HFEM 9.9 (95% CI = 3.4–16.4); PROGRESS: 6.2 (95% CI = 2.5–9.8); ELEVATE: 17.7 (95% CI = 13.1–22.3)), for Headache Impact Test-6 total scores at week 12 (ADVANCE: LFEM -4.7 (95% CI = -6.7 to -2.7); HFEM -3.4 (95% CI = -5.5 to -1.2); PROGRESS: -2.8 (95% CI = -4.1 to -1.4); ELEVATE: -6.5 (95% CI = -8.3 to -4.7)) and for Activity Impairment in Migraine-Diary-Performance of Daily Activities scores across 12 weeks (ADVANCE: LFEM -2.3 (95% CI = -3.9 to -0.7), HFEM -4.5 (95% CI = -6.9 to -2.2); PROGRESS: -3.4 (95% CI = -5.3 to -1.5); ELEVATE: -4.7 (95% CI = -6.4 to -3.1)).

Conclusions

Preventive migraine treatment with atogepant 60 mg once-daily vs. placebo improved measures of migraine-related quality of life and functioning among participants with different headache frequencies and histories of previous treatment failure. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03777059 (ADVANCE); NCT03855137 (PROGRESS); NCT04740827 (ELEVATE).

### Neuromodulation in primary headaches: current evidence and integration into clinical practice [^112YFYyZ]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neuromodulatory approaches add to our armamentarium of therapeutic tools for the treatment of primary headaches. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current controlled studies on the different neuromodulation techniques and recommendations for clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Evidence for efficacy of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) is limited to acute use in migraine with ambiguous results and episodic cluster headache as well as chronic cluster headache if applied in addition to conventional treatment. Transcutaneous stimulation of the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerve was effective in both acute and preventive stimulation (the latter with ambiguous results) in episodic migraines. Thus, invasive procedures should be reserved for severe and refractory cases only. Occipital nerve stimulation for chronic refractory cluster headache is the only available invasive approach with a Conformité Européenne mark.

Summary

Neuromodulation can complement conventional therapy, with noninvasive procedures being used preferably. Given the limited number of studies for each modality and the lack of head-to-head studies, it is difficult to place neuromodulation techniques in a conventional treatment algorithm.
