## Question

will Glimepiride、Amlodipine、Atorvastatin cause kidney impaiment with declined ccr level? how?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether glimepiride, amlodipine, and atorvastatin cause kidney impairment with a decline in creatinine clearance, and if so, how that happens mechanistically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of each drug in renal impairment. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence for effects on kidney function, including any dose-dependent or interaction-related risks. Next, I will check guideline positions and practical dosing advice. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and monitoring plan, making sure I distinguish true nephrotoxicity from hemodynamic or pharmacokinetic effects that can mimic injury.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basics for glimepiride in CKD, because that will anchor the risk assessment. Glimepiride is hepatically metabolized but has active metabolites cleared by the kidney; as kidney function declines, metabolite accumulation increases and urinary excretion of M1/M2 falls substantially, with AUCs rising several-fold in severe impairment, which elevates hypoglycemia risk rather than direct nephrotoxicity per se [^112hNok9] [^111Ndfuy] [^113E3Uuv]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: guidelines emphasize that sulfonylureas like glimepiride should be used cautiously in CKD with conservative dosing and close monitoring for hypoglycemia, and they do not list glimepiride as a nephrotoxin, which supports the conclusion that the kidney signal is pharmacokinetic accumulation rather than structural renal injury [^112BLs5s] [^111vdzvv].

> Next, I should review amlodipine's renal effects, and I need to be careful not to conflate hemodynamic changes with nephrotoxicity. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that can increase renal plasma flow and GFR via afferent arteriolar vasodilation, which may transiently raise measured GFR without improving long-term kidney outcomes; importantly, this is not nephrotoxicity, and in ALLHAT, amlodipine was not superior to chlorthalidone for preventing ESRD or large GFR declines, despite higher measured GFR early on, underscoring a hemodynamic rather than renoprotective effect [^116zUQue] [^115Vhwg4]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positioning: KDIGO notes that CCBs are not first-line for kidney protection beyond blood pressure control, aligning with the idea that any GFR changes with amlodipine are hemodynamic and not indicative of kidney damage [^112nBPZZ].

> Now, atorvastatin: I initially thought statins might be broadly nephrotoxic, but wait, let me reconsider that assumption. Large post hoc analyses of randomized trials show atorvastatin is associated with a modest, dose-dependent improvement in kidney function slopes over time, with higher-dose atorvastatin showing larger favorable eGFR trajectories, and this aligns with meta-analytic data that statins reduce cardiovascular events in CKD without clear harm to kidney function, although effects on hard renal endpoints are modest and heterogeneous across studies [^116uW21A] [^1157hV7d] [^117NoZJS]. I should double-check safety signals: RCTs and meta-analyses do not show increased acute kidney injury with atorvastatin, and KDIGO recommends statin therapy broadly in CKD, which argues against clinically meaningful nephrotoxicity at guideline-supported doses [^117NoZJS] [^117EU9DL].

> But wait, what if drug–drug interactions alter exposure and indirectly affect renal markers? I need to check that. DrugBank notes that amlodipine can inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of glimepiride, potentially increasing glimepiride levels, and that glimepiride may reduce the excretion of atorvastatin, which could raise atorvastatin exposure; however, these interaction warnings do not translate into established nephrotoxicity, and the main clinical risk is hypoglycemia from higher glimepiride exposure rather than direct kidney injury, so I should not over-interpret these as renal toxicity signals [^115hYPZo]. Hold on, I should verify that no major safety reviews list these combinations as causing AKI; indeed, they do not, reinforcing that the concern is pharmacokinetic potentiation rather than intrinsic nephrotoxicity [^notfound].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence for kidney outcomes with these agents in aggregate. For glimepiride, no trials demonstrate renoprotection or increased risk of kidney failure; the consistent message is hypoglycemia risk in CKD due to metabolite accumulation, prompting conservative dosing and preference for alternatives like glipizide in advanced CKD when sulfonylureas are necessary [^112BLs5s] [^111vdzvv]. For amlodipine, randomized data show no superiority over thiazide or ACE inhibitor for preventing ESRD or large GFR declines, despite early GFR increases, confirming a hemodynamic effect without structural benefit or harm [^115Vhwg4]. For atorvastatin, multiple analyses suggest a small improvement in kidney function trajectories and strong cardiovascular benefit in CKD, with no signal for increased AKI or CKD progression in RCTs, supporting its use when indicated [^116uW21A] [^117NoZJS].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with best practice. KDIGO recommends statin therapy in CKD and does not advise routine dose reduction for atorvastatin based on eGFR, while advising careful medication dosing as kidney function declines and vigilance for drug–drug interactions; diabetes guidelines similarly caution about sulfonylurea accumulation in CKD and recommend dose conservatism and monitoring rather than avoidance of statins, which fits the evidence base [^117EU9DL] [^112BLs5s] [^111vdzvv]. I should confirm that no guideline lists glimepiride or amlodipine as nephrotoxic agents; indeed, they do not, reinforcing that the kidney considerations here are pharmacokinetic and hemodynamic rather than toxic [^117EU9DL].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a hidden toxicity signal. None of these three agents has credible evidence for causing kidney impairment via direct nephrotoxicity; glimepiride's issue is active metabolite accumulation with hypoglycemia risk in CKD, amlodipine can acutely increase GFR via hemodynamics without improving hard renal outcomes, and atorvastatin tends to have neutral to slightly favorable kidney function trajectories with robust cardiovascular benefit in CKD, so a declining creatinine clearance while on these drugs should prompt evaluation for other causes rather than reflexively blaming the medications themselves [^112hNok9] [^115Vhwg4] [^116uW21A]. I should double-check that this conclusion matches the totality of the data; yes, across pharmacokinetics, RCTs, and guidelines, there is no consistent signal that these drugs cause kidney injury, though prudent dosing and monitoring in CKD remain essential [^117EU9DL] [^112BLs5s].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical recommendations are clear and safe. In CKD, start glimepiride at 1 mg daily and titrate cautiously with close glucose monitoring, consider switching to glipizide in advanced CKD if hypoglycemia emerges, use amlodipine as needed for blood pressure recognizing its hemodynamic GFR effects, and continue atorvastatin when indicated with standard monitoring; if creatinine clearance declines, reassess volume status, concomitant nephrotoxins, and intercurrent illness before changing these agents, and follow KDIGO guidance for evaluating eGFR changes that exceed expected variability, especially after adding or uptitrating RAAS inhibitors or other hemodynamically active drugs [^112hNok9] [^112BLs5s] [^117EU9DL]. Hold on, I should verify that this monitoring approach aligns with high-quality guidance; yes, KDIGO and VA/DoD materials support structured reassessment of kidney function and medications every 3–6 months in CKD, which fits this scenario well [^117EU9DL].

---

In sum, **glimepiride does not directly impair kidney function** but increases hypoglycemia risk as eGFR declines, so start low and titrate cautiously [^112hNok9] [^111vdzvv]. Amlodipine is **not nephrotoxic** and may modestly increase GFR via hemodynamic effects, but it does not slow CKD progression [^116zUQue] [^115Vhwg4]. Atorvastatin is **renally safe** and may modestly slow eGFR decline; no dose adjustment is needed in CKD [^112r3vWF] [^116uW21A]. Together, these agents are unlikely to cause a clinically meaningful decline in creatinine clearance when dosed and monitored appropriately [^116BVZUa].

## Glimepiride and renal function

### Pharmacokinetics in renal impairment

- **Metabolism**: Hepatic metabolism to active metabolites (M1, M2) [^notfound].
- **Excretion**: Renal elimination of metabolites; impaired function increases exposure [^117EtznW].
- **Exposure**: Severe impairment increases M1 AUC ~2.3-fold and M2 ~8.6-fold [^117EtznW].

---

### Clinical evidence and recommendations

- **Risk**: Higher hypoglycemia risk as eGFR falls; start 1 mg/day and titrate cautiously [^112hNok9] [^111vdzvv].
- **Monitoring**: Close glucose monitoring and dose adjustments are essential in CKD [^112BLs5s].
- **Direct nephrotoxicity**: No evidence of direct renal injury from glimepiride [^notfound].

---

## Amlodipine and renal function

### Pharmacodynamics and renal hemodynamics

Amlodipine causes **vasodilation** that lowers blood pressure and reduces renal vascular resistance, with a modest increase in GFR and renal plasma flow without changing filtration fraction or proteinuria [^116zUQue]. Clinically, it is **not nephrotoxic** and does not cause acute kidney injury or progressive CKD [^notfound].

---

### Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **ACCOMPLISH**: Amlodipine-based therapy reduced CKD progression vs HCTZ, but this reflects BP effects, not direct renoprotection [^111z5Y4m].
- **ALLHAT**: Amlodipine did not outperform chlorthalidone or lisinopril for renal outcomes in high-risk hypertensives [^115Vhwg4].
- **Guidelines**: CCBs are acceptable for BP control in CKD, especially when ACEi/ARB are contraindicated or as add-on therapy [^117EU9DL].

---

## Atorvastatin and renal function

### Pharmacokinetics and renal handling

Atorvastatin is **hepatically metabolized** with minimal renal clearance, so no dose adjustment is needed in CKD [^112r3vWF]. Safety is supported by extensive clinical experience without increased nephrotoxicity risk [^117PphdM].

---

### Clinical evidence on renal outcomes

- **Meta-analyses**: Statins reduce cardiovascular events in CKD but have minimal direct effect on eGFR decline [^117NoZJS].
- **Post hoc analyses**: Atorvastatin shows a modest, dose-dependent slowing of eGFR decline (~1.3–3.9 mL/min/1.73 m² over 5 years) [^1157hV7d].
- **PLANET**: Atorvastatin stabilized eGFR vs rosuvastatin in diabetic CKD, suggesting class differences [^111AT8PD].

---

### Safety considerations

Rarely, **high-dose statins** may cause transient proteinuria or mild creatinine rises, but these are not linked to progressive renal injury [^117PphdM]. Routine monitoring of renal function is reasonable, but no dose change is required solely for CKD [^112r3vWF].

---

## Combined use of glimepiride, amlodipine, and atorvastatin

### Potential interactions and cumulative renal effects

Glimepiride and amlodipine share **CYP3A4 metabolism**, so amlodipine may increase glimepiride levels and hypoglycemia risk, especially in CKD [^115hYPZo]. No evidence shows that the combination increases nephrotoxicity or accelerates creatinine clearance decline [^notfound].

---

### Clinical management and monitoring

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain eGFR, electrolytes, and glucose before starting therapy [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: Recheck eGFR and electrolytes 2–4 weeks after changes, then every 3–6 months in CKD [^117EU9DL].
- **Dose adjustments**: Reduce glimepiride dose as eGFR declines; no routine adjustment is needed for amlodipine or atorvastatin [^112hNok9] [^112r3vWF].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Medication** | **Effect on renal function** | **Clinical recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| Glimepiride | No direct nephrotoxicity; increased hypoglycemia risk in CKD | Start 1 mg/day; titrate cautiously; monitor glucose closely [^112hNok9] [^111vdzvv] |
| Amlodipine | No nephrotoxicity; may modestly increase GFR via hemodynamics | Safe in CKD; monitor BP and electrolytes [^116zUQue] [^117EU9DL] |
| Atorvastatin | No nephrotoxicity; may modestly slow eGFR decline | No dose adjustment; monitor lipids and liver enzymes [^112r3vWF] [^116uW21A] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Glimepiride, amlodipine, and atorvastatin are **unlikely to cause a clinically meaningful decline in creatinine clearance** when used appropriately. Glimepiride requires caution due to hypoglycemia risk in CKD, amlodipine is hemodynamically neutral to mildly favorable, and atorvastatin may modestly slow eGFR decline. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments — especially for glimepiride as kidney function worsens — mitigate risks and support safe use in CKD [^117EU9DL].

Introduction

Patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and this association between kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes is also observed in patients with relatively normal kidney function. 1 The intricate interaction between the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CVD results from the fact that both share common risk factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Kidney function decline due to these factors usually displays a linear course over the years, and the grade of kidney function decline has recently been demonstrated to be useful as an independent risk factor for mortality, CVD, and/or ESRD in both CKD and non‐CKD populations. 2, 3, 4 Because of its linearity, the slope visualizing the course of kidney function during a given time span — instead of single kidney function measurements — provides additional information. In addition, individual slopes include information about the preceding course of kidney function and may therefore not completely depend on the severity of kidney function impairment at the baseline measurement of a study. Individual slopes over time, therefore, are potentially an important predictor for both CVD and kidney outcomes over the long run. 5 Thus, interventions that beneficially influence slope over time may also reflect cardiovascular and renal protection at an early stage, as has already been demonstrated with other kidney protective agents such as inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS). 6 In patients with CKD, as in other high‐risk patients, statins have proven to exert a substantial cardiovascular benefit. 7, 8 Whether this effect of statins is partially attributable to an effect on kidney function is unknown.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the slope of kidney function as measured by the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level. 2, 26 The reciprocal of the serum creatinine level has a linear relationship with the GFR, unlike the serum creatinine level, which has a curvilinear relationship. These values, expressed as (mg/dL)⁻¹, approximate GFR values, with which most clinicians are familiar. In addition, equations from the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration that are adjusted for ethnic group were used to determine the estimated GFR and eGFR slopes over time. Finally, the proportion of patients who reached an eGFR decline of > 30% — a recently advocated surrogate for long‐term renal outcomes — was calculated. 4

Furthermore, the proportion of major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all‐cause mortality were assessed. A major cardiovascular event was defined as major coronary event (death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or resuscitation after cardiac arrest), fatal or nonfatal stroke, major cardiovascular event (stroke plus any major coronary event), acute coronary event (major coronary event or unstable angina), any coronary event (acute coronary event, unstable angina, or angina or ischemia requiring emergency hospitalization). Cardiovascular mortality was defined as death from coronary heart disease, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, or other cardiovascular death.

8.6 Renal Impairment

To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, the recommended starting dose of glimepiride is 1 mg daily for all patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

A multiple-dose titration study was conducted in 16 patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 mg to 8 mg daily for 3 months. Baseline creatinine clearance ranged from 10–60 mL/min. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride was evaluated in the multiple-dose titration study and the results were consistent with those observed in patients enrolled in a single-dose study. In both studies, the relative total clearance of glimepiride increased when kidney function was impaired. Both studies also demonstrated that the elimination of the two major metabolites was reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Limitations

A number of limitations of our study need to be addressed. First, ideally the presence of all 3 groups in an RCT would have reduced the large heterogeneity of the baseline characteristics, which was observed in our study due to the use of different sets of studies. Heterogeneous effects across studies on kidney function slope were observed, but the slopes were all in the same direction, indicating that the effect on kidney function was robust. Despite adjustments for baseline characteristics in our analyses, differences in patient characteristics among the trials might still explain to some extent why the size of the effect on slope differed. Second, the studies in this analysis included patients with preserved kidney function and a low risk of development of ESRD. Therefore, the changes in kidney function over time were very small and, thus, of limited value in daily clinical practice. Third, albuminuria is an important risk marker for progressive kidney function decline, but in our analysis we could not evaluate albuminuria effects over time because this was not systemically assessed within the included trials. Finally, for the same reason, we were not able to handle time‐varying covariates that influence slopes such as improvement of BP control or the introduction of RAS inhibitors in the follow‐up the 6 RCTs.

In conclusion, our analysis shows that atorvastatin improves kidney function over time in a dose‐dependent manner (ie, 80‐mg versus 10‐mg dose). In each of the treatment groups it was shown that kidney function improvement is strongly associated with lower cardiovascular risk. These data support the notion that both the cardio‐ and vasculoprotective efficacies of a pharmacological agent are reflected by the course of kidney function over time. Although the changes were small, our data also suggest that this kidney‐related parameter, and not only LDL‐cholesterol lowering, might represent a surrogate end point for long‐term outcomes in cardiovascular risk patients.

Role in renoprotection

In the ACCOMPLISH trial, HCTZ was inferior to amlodipine for the prevention of end-stage renal disease. Furthermore, in patients who were > 65 years old at baseline, there was a 70% RRR in patients progressing to dialysis in the amlodipine group versus the HCTZ group (p = 0.053, for the difference). In the intention-to-treat population, the amlodipine group had a 48% RRR for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, defined as doubling of serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 mL/min, or dialysis compared with the HCTZ group. Furthermore, patients with CKD, defined as an eGFR of 45.1 mL/min at baseline, showed a significantly greater decline in renal function with HCTZ versus amlodipine (−2.3 vs −1.6 mL/min; p = 0.001).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

To account for the influence of differences in the dropout rate (ie, nonrandom effects) among the treatment arms within the 6 RCTs, a sensitivity analysis was performed including on‐treatment creatinine measurements only. This analysis did not influence the results.

Finally, the proportion of patients with a decrease of > 30% in eGFR from baseline to the last visit was calculated. The percentage of patients with a decrease > 30% were 2.5% (95% CI 2.2% to 2.9%), 2.1% (95% CI 1.9% to 2.4%), and 2.0% (1.7% to 2.4%) for the placebo, atorvastatin 10‐mg group, and atorvastatin 80‐mg group, respectively.

Effect of Individual Kidney Function Slopes on Cardiovascular Event Rate and Mortality

Figures 2 and 3 report the hazard ratios of the Cox proportional hazard model to assess the effect of average annual change in kidney function on major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, and all‐cause mortality. The model adjusted according to study showed that for these outcomes average annual change in kidney function was a highly significant predictor. In the model with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, plasma LDL, systolic BP, diastolic BP, baseline RAAS inhibitor use, baseline aspirin use, diabetes mellitus, smoking, history of cardiovascular events at baseline (ie, either a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event), diuretics use, and hypertension, average annual change in kidney function was a significant predictor within both atorvastatin groups for major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. For all‐cause mortality, the group treated with atorvastatin 80 mg had the lowest hazard ratio for each SD of kidney function slope. Hazard ratios for major cardiovascular events when the highest quartile was compared with the lowest quartile were 1.82, 2.00, and 1.56 for placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg, respectively (P < 0.0001). When the slope of eGFR was used similar findings were observed (data not shown).

Statistical Analyses

To determine the slope for the 3 pooled arms, a mixed model was run separately for each treatment pooling with time of assessment as a random effect and with adjustments for study; all per‐patient creatinine data were included in the model, starting from baseline. Additionally, homogeneity of slopes in the studies within each pooling was tested by adding study×time of assessment to the mixed model. The slopes were also computed for each of the 3 pooled arms with adjustments for study, age, sex, body mass index, plasma low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, baseline RAAS inhibitor use, baseline aspirin use, diabetes mellitus, smoking, history of CVD, diuretics use, and hypertension. To compare the 10‐mg slope to the 80 mg slope, only TNT data were used because in this study subjects were randomized to 10 mg versus 80 mg. This mixed model included treatment, time of assessment, and treatment by time interactions. In additional models, adjustments for (1) number of creatinine measures; (2) age and sex; and (3) change in LDL at month 3 from baseline were made for the slope calculations. Slopes from the mixed model are presented as estimate (standard error [SE]).

To evaluate the impact of individual 1/creatinine slopes on cardiovascular events, a Cox proportional hazards model was used with 1/creatine slope as the predictor in the model. Major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, and all‐cause mortality were assessed. Subjects without the event were censored at their last clinical visit date or the last date they were known to be alive, whichever was later. For major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death, subjects who had died due to non‐cardiovascular causes were censored on the date of death. The Cox model included the slopes with adjustments for each trial. Additionally, an adjusted Cox model was run with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, plasma LDL, systolic BP, diastolic BP, baseline RAAS inhibitor use, baseline aspirin use, diabetes mellitus, smoking, history of CVD, diuretics use, and hypertension. These analyses were performed for each treatment pooling separately. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed in which slope was included as a quartile in the study‐adjusted Cox model.

Discussion

This large‐scale post hoc analysis including individual data from 6 long‐term cardiovascular outcome trials demonstrates that in patients at risk or with CVD, atorvastatin modestly improves kidney function over time in a dose‐dependent manner. In addition, this analysis shows that kidney function improvement is strongly associated with lower cardiovascular risk independent of treatment, whereas a decrease in kidney function is associated with worse cardiovascular outcome. For each SD increment of slope of kidney function, we observed a 13% to 14% reduction in major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality while being treated with atorvastatin (either 10 or 80 mg daily).

Our data therefore indicate that efficacy of cardiovascular protection over the long term obtained with atorvastatin is reflected by effects on the course of kidney function over time. In addition, our results emphasize the bidirectional connection between the cardiovascular system and the kidneys (ie, the cardiorenal axis) in treating cardiovascular disease. This implies that both CVD reduction and renoprotection are achieved by treating patients at risk or with CVD with atorvastatin. Vice versa, a renoprotective strategy, as represented by atorvastatin treatment according to our data, translates into better cardiovascular risk management. In daily clinical practice one may therefore consider incorporating kidney function trajectories as read out for the success of cardiovascular risk management regimens, in addition to control of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as BP and lipid goals. So far, no adequately powered RCTs have tested the hypothesis that targeting the kidney function change over time may represent a cardiovascular risk factor subject to treatment.

12.2	 Pharmacodynamics

Amlodipine

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) primary prevention in diabetes — proven measures and GRADE trial findings: The only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with diabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure management. There is no evidence that the use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, or other interventions prevent CKD without hypertension or albuminuria, and the American Diabetes Association does not recommend routine use of these medications solely for prevention. In the GRADE study comparing liraglutide, sitagliptin, glimepiride, and insulin glargine, a total of 5,047 participants were enrolled from July 2013 to August 2017 and were followed for an average of 5 years; almost all participants did not have signs of kidney disease at enrollment, and no differences between the examined medications were observed, suggesting no unique reno-protective effects for prevention. Of note, the SGLT2 inhibitors were not included because they were not routinely available at study initiation.

Practice Point 2.1.4 — hemodynamically active therapies and estimated GFR (eGFR) changes in CKD — states that GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation; early after intensive blood pressure (BP) control, reductions of 10%–20% within the first 3 months are typical, and acute rises in serum creatinine (SCr) or declines in eGFR of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes; post hoc SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) analyses found similar trajectories with > 10% initial drops except when the acute "dip" was > 30% from baseline; during initiation of anti-hypertensive agents, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or SGLT2i, a significant drop in eGFR (> 30%) should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring, and healthcare providers should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents as earlier "dips" are typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity.

Role for statins

Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and are the lipid modifying agent of choice for people with diabetes. Simvastatin is associated with a number of side effects and drug interactions with other agents (such as diltiazem and amlodipine). Thus, atorvastatin 20 mg is suggested as the first line lipid-lowering agent. Dose titration up to a maximum dose of 80 mg should be done with care, especially at lower eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2.

Rosuvastatin is a high intensity statin. In CKD stage 1–2, there is no dose adjustment. In CKD stage 3 or below, the starting dose is 5 mg. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that the maximum dose below eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² is 10 mg. However, European and SPC guidance is to avoid rosuvastatin at eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

Where statin intolerance is an issue, consider switching to an alternate statin, reducing the dose or, alternate day dosage.

Role for ezetimibe

Ezetimibe blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and upregulates hepatic LDL receptor expression, enabling reduction of atherogenic lipoproteins. The main role for ezetimibe in DKD is as an adjunctive to statin use, or in statin intolerance. Ezetimibe can be used in mild to severe kidney disease and co-administered with any dose of statin.

### Acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients treated with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide versus amlodipine and risk of cardiovascular outcomes [^115wc7UY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

From an epidemiologic standpoint, it was interesting to observe that the acute declines in eGFR were more strongly associated with the primary outcome in the amlodipine rather than the hydrochlorothiazide arm when conducting within‐arm analysis, though statistical significance for tests of effect modification was not achieved. This observation may stem from the fact that amlodipine initiation is often associated with an increase in eGFR that can counter the efferent vasodilation mediated by RAS inhibition, so patients who experienced acute declines in eGFR despite the use of amlodipine likely have greater severity of illness and have a higher risk of cardiovascular events. For the same reason, when we conduct comparisons of the risk of cardiovascular outcomes across randomized treatment groups in our spline‐based analysis, we believe the lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes observed with amlodipine versus hydrochlorothiazide initiation across any level of decline in eGFR is conservatively estimated, given the greater severity of illness that may be present in those treated with amlodipine who experienced a decline in eGFR. However, in both arms, any acute decline in eGFR that occurred following initiation of the intervention was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes.

In the ACCOMPLISH trial, patients who have a baseline history of cardiovascular disease were particularly at risk for these acute declines in eGFR, which is consistent with the results of prior studies. Recent post hoc analyses of a few randomized controlled trials (eg, Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterrax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation) showed that acute rises in serum creatinine after starting RAS inhibition was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes, though the changes in serum creatinine were measured over longer intervals after randomization (eg, 4 months). In Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACEi Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) and Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) trials, there was also a tendency for acute declines in eGFR within 8 weeks after the initiation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers to have a non–statistically significant tendency towards a higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes in post hoc analysis, which is consistent with the results of our study. We do note that the duration over which changes in eGFR were ascertained in ONTARGET (a 6‐month period) may be more reflective of natural progression of disease, and less likely to be related to hemodynamic eGFR declines after RAS inhibition.

### Time to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function in drug development and beyond [^115PF1g2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

KDIGO guidelines recommend that nephrologists approach kidney disease classification as well as prognosis with a composite of cause, GFR categories (index of kidney function in health and disease), and albuminuria categories (marker of kidney damage). Independent of eGFR, albuminuria has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular and kidney events as well as cognitive decline in addition to overall mortality. In line with the eGFR‐based estimates, KDIGO guidelines agree that eGFR values < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² correspond with severe kidney impairment irrespective of the degree of albuminuria. However, they deviate from eGFR‐based categorization for eGFR values ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as demonstrated in Table 1.

Table 1
CKD classification

This eGFR and albuminuria‐based categorization was developed by KDIGO based on correlation of these parameters with diagnosis and progression of CKD in subjects with various forms of kidney diseases and has been applied successfully by nephrologists for almost a decade. It is worthwhile testing whether this algorithm may serve as a better predictor of drug pharmacokinetics as well and thus provide a more nuanced and accurate framework for dose modifications of drugs whose exposure is impacted by kidney impairment.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride [^114EeHP9]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

8.6	Renal Impairment

To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, the initial dosing, dose increments and maintenance dosage of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets should be conservative. During initiation of pioglitazone and glimepiride tablet therapy and any subsequent dose adjustments, these patients should be observed carefully for hypoglycemia.

A multiple-dose titration study was conducted in 16 patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 mg to 8 mg daily for three months. Baseline creatinine clearance ranged from 10 to 60 mL/min. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride were evaluated in the multiple-dose titration study and the results were consistent with those observed in patients enrolled in a single-dose study. In both studies, the relative total clearance of glimepiride increased when kidney function was impaired. Both studies also demonstrated that the elimination of the two major metabolites was reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^115Ztg73]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Post hoc evaluation for slopes of kidney function decline was performed using serum creatinine values collected from randomized patients from long‐term cardiovascular outcome randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with atorvastatin in which slope analysis was not a predefined outcome (Table 1). 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 Studies were eligible for inclusion when they were RCTs with ≥ 12 months of follow‐up; included participants who were older than 18 years; had > 2 serum creatinine values measured; and randomly assigned therapy with fixed doses of atorvastatin or placebo. We excluded those studies that were designed to investigate patients with predefined primary kidney disease and/or ESRD. Because plasma creatinine levels were collected only at 2 time points in the IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering) trial (in 8888 randomized post–myocardial‐infarction patients), 21 and 4D (German Diabetes and Dialysis Study) included type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on dialysis, 24 these studies were excluded from the analysis. ALLIANCE (Aggressive Lipid‐Lowering Initiation Abates New Cardiac Events) data were excluded because variable atorvastatin doses were used in the active treatment arm. 25 Three groups were formed, and the data from individual subjects were pooled. To assess the slope in placebo patients, the placebo arms from ASCOT (Anglo‐Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial), CARDS (Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and ASPEN (Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non‐Insulin‐Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) were pooled. 17, 18, 19, 22 To assess the slope in atorvastatin 80 mg, the 80‐mg arms from SPARCL, TNT (Treating New Targets), and SAGE (Study Assessing Goals in the Elderly) were pooled. 17, 20, 23 Additionally, data derived from the ASCOT, CARDS, and ASPEN trials were pooled, and the slopes within the 10‐mg atorvastatin arm from these trials were assessed. 18, 19, 22 For TNT, which included 10 001 randomized coronary artery disease patients, a formal comparison of the 10‐mg dose versus the 80‐mg dose was performed. 20

Slope of Kidney Function

The average annual change in kidney function (as assessed by the estimate of the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level based on a mean [SD] number of 4.7 [1.4] measurements) from the mixed model, displayed a linear pattern over time, is shown in Figure 1 and Figure S1. Patients randomized to placebo and 10 mg and 80 mg atorvastatin had slopes (estimate [SE]) of 0.009 (0.0008), 0.011 (0.0006), and 0.014 (0.0006) (mg/dL)⁻¹/y, respectively (P < 0.0001 for each group). In the adjusted models with adjustments for (1) number of serum creatinine measures, (2) age and sex, and (3) change in LDL at month 3 from baseline, the slopes did not change. Additionally, slope×study interaction was tested to assess homogeneity of slopes across the studies. The study×slope interactions assessed in each of the 3 pooled groups (atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg and placebo) were all statistically significant, indicating differences in slopes among the different studies (P < 0.0005 in all groups). Overall, the slopes were, however, all in the same direction. The fully adjusted model had minimal impact on the values of the slopes, where slopes (SE) for placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg were 0.008 (0.0007), 0.011 (0.0005), and 0.014 (0.0006), respectively.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^116uW21A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney function decreases during the lifetime, and this decline is a powerful predictor of both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Statins lower cardiovascular risk, which may relate to beneficial effects on kidney function. We studied whether atorvastatin influences kidney function decline and assessed the association between individual kidney function slopes and cardiovascular outcome.

Methods and Results

Data were collected from 6 large atorvastatin cardiovascular outcome trials conducted in patients not selected for having kidney disease. Slopes of serum creatinine reciprocals representing measures of kidney function change ([mg/dL]⁻¹/y), were analyzed in 30 621 patients. Based on treatment arms, patients were categorized into 3 groups: placebo (n = 10 057), atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 12 763), and 80 mg daily (n = 7801). To assess slopes, mixed‐model analyses were performed for each treatment separately, including time in years and adjustment for study. These slopes displayed linear improvement over time in all 3 groups. Slope estimates for patients randomized to placebo or atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg were 0.009 (0.0008), 0.011 (0.0006), and 0.014 (0.0006) (mg/dL)⁻¹/y, respectively. A head‐to‐head comparison of atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg based on data from 1 study ([Treating to New Targets]; n = 10 001) showed a statistically significant difference in slope between the 2 doses (P = 0.0009). From a Cox proportional hazards model using slope as a predictor, a significant (P < 0.0001) negative association between kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes was found.

Conclusions

In patients at risk of or with cardiovascular disease, atorvastatin improved kidney function over time in a dose‐dependent manner. In the 3 treatment groups, kidney function improvement was strongly associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114PAbAn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive therapy in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) indicates that diuretics are especially useful, and β-Blockers and calcium channel blockers also are effective therapies. Based on a series of small studies and the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may worsen proteinuria and failed to improve clinical outcomes when used as primary antihypertensive therapy in DKD. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial subgroup with type 2 diabetes and CKD (defined as GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), amlodipine was comparable to lisinopril or chlorthalidone for GFR decrease or onset of kidney failure when each agent was given separately. For DKD characterized by microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in the absence of concurrent RAS inhibition, although they appear to be safe if they also use an ACE inhibitor or an ARB.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact) [^117EtznW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal Impairment

Pioglitazone

The serum elimination half-life of pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV remains unchanged in patients with moderate [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 30 to 50 mL/min] and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment when compared to subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is required.

Glimepiride

In a single-dose, open-label study glimepiride 3 mg was administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as estimated by CLcr: Group I consisted of five patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr > 50 mL/min), Group II consisted of 3 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 20 to 50 mL/min) and Group III consisted of seven patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 20 mL/min). Although, glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.3-fold higher mean AUC for M1 and an 8.6-fold higher mean AUC for M2 compared to corresponding mean AUCs in Group I. The t½for glimepiride did not change, while the t½for M1 and M2 increased as renal function decreased. Mean urinary excretion of M1 plus M2 as a percentage of dose decreased from 44.4% for Group I to 21.9% for Group II and 9.3% for Group III.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^111AT8PD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Current evidence indicates that kidney‐protective effects of statins show a heterogeneous picture. Statins reduce, for instance, biomarkers for kidney damage, including albuminuria, 9, 10 but not uniformly so. 11 In addition, various controlled trials show that statins are beneficial by inducing a smaller estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction at the end of the study, 12, 13 and other studies indicate that eGFR may even improve. 14, 15, 16 The heterogeneous effects may depend on both the dose and type of statin used, as also demonstrated by the recent PLANET trials in both diabetic and nondiabetic CKD patients. 11 In PLANET, rosuvastatin negatively influenced kidney function, as expressed by decreased eGFR and increased proteinuria, whereas atorvastatin improved GFR without influencing proteinuria. 11

We set out to address whether the high‐potency statin, atorvastatin, has an effect on age‐related kidney function decline during an observation period extending beyond 12 months and whether this effect is dose dependent. Finally, we assessed whether the slopes of individual patients predicted cardiovascular outcome measures.

### Renal physiology of glucose handling and therapeutic implications [^113FwA7y]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyperglycemia is a pivotal factor in the cascade of events leading to the initiation and progression of renal and cardiovascular (CV) complications in patients with diabetes. Despite this mechanistic paradigm, maintenance of tight glycemic control, paradoxically, has little or no impact on CV event reduction and has modest protective effects on renal complications. Specifically, for effects in the kidney, tight glycemic control consistently reduces albuminuria progression as a surrogate of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) worsening. In contrast, protective effects on 'hard' renal endpoints such as end-stage kidney disease have been relatively limited to long-term follow-up of the ADVANCE-ON trial — a benefit that was seen beyond the duration of the trial. The physiological mechanisms responsible for this lack of benefit with intensive control are not known. Some older-generation glucose-lowering therapies used in previous trials, such as sulfonylureas, are associated with weight gain, hypertension, significant hypoglycemic risk or retention of salt and water, which may offset any potential benefits associated with concomitant improvements in glycemic control with these agents. Regardless of the mechanism, patients with diabetes remain at high risk for the development of CV and renal complications despite achievement of glycemic and blood pressure (BP) targets, the use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAS) inhibitors and achievement of lipid control with statins. There is therefore a large unmet need to identify effective and safe glucose-lowering agents to improve glycemic control, while avoiding the potential pitfalls of older-generation glucose-lowering agents.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^113CExFr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — KDIGO dose recommendations and SHARP evidence in CKD: The KDIGO guideline did not compare or harmonize their recommendations to other lipid guidelines, and the strongest evidence base cited is SHARP, which enrolled individuals older than 40 years with a serum creatinine level ≥ 1.7 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 27 ± 13 (SD) mL/min/1.73 m². There is less trial evidence for individuals with CKD who do not meet SHARP entry criteria. A noted difference from ACC/AHA is that KDIGO recommends reducing the dose of statins in individuals with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (ie, avoiding high-intensity statins). In the absence of studies showing adverse effects with higher doses, the authors caution this may cause confusion for those with CKD and a history of acute coronary syndrome, for whom the recommendation is to treat with a high-intensity statin. They also note that labeling states dose adjustment for kidney disease is not required for atorvastatin and that rosuvastatin labeling does not recommend dose adjustment until creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Effect of chronic kidney disease on nonrenal elimination pathways: a systematic assessment of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and OATP [^117VQSiE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and a significant contributor to the burden of chronic disease. 1, 2 CKD has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 8–16%, and as such is considered an important global public health issue. 3 Despite the existence of many guidelines related to dose adjustment of renally cleared medications in patients with CKD, impaired kidney function continues to be associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events. 4 Thus, it is critical to adequately assess the effect of impaired kidney function on systemic exposure and pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs to optimize drug usage in this tenuous patient population.

Renal impairment not only alters drug elimination by the kidneys, but also affects drug metabolism and transport in other organs (e.g. liver) that may lead to clinically relevant changes in nonrenal clearance. 5, 6 For example, repaglinide, which is primarily metabolized in the liver after organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)‐mediated uptake, had a nearly fourfold increase in terminal half‐life and threefold increase in area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) in patients with severe and endstage renal disease (ESRD) compared with subjects with normal renal function. 7 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency recently published guidances to recommend performing clinical studies to assess the effect of renal impairment on the PK of both renally and nonrenally eliminated drugs. 8, 9 However, dosing adjustments to account for nonrenal clearance changes are not common.

### Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate after dapagliflozin in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a prespecified secondary analysis of the DELIVER randomized clinical trial [^114LYY2Z]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Among patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction enrolled in the DELIVER trial, the development of an initial decline in eGFR greater than 10% was more common among patients randomized to dapagliflozin than placebo. However, among those assigned to dapagliflozin, the presence of an initial eGFR decline was not associated with a higher risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome, nor with a difference in the longer-term rate of eGFR decline, compared with patients who did not develop an initial decline. Although AEs were overall more common among those with vs those without an initial eGFR decline, most were similar between dapagliflozin and placebo.

Initially used as a therapy to lower blood glucose in patients with diabetes, early experience with SGLT2is noted a propensity for these medications to cause modest acute elevations in serum creatinine level. Confirmation of these patterns (and reciprocal changes in eGFR level) were obtained in subsequent large clinical outcomes trials. More importantly, these trials also observed that the eGFR decline was reversible after drug discontinuation, and despite the initial decline, these medications slowed the longer-term decline in kidney function, compared with placebo. The acute decline in eGFR is felt to be a result of a reduction in intraglomerular pressure, via mechanism(s) that are still to be fully elucidated. Notably, some smaller mechanistic reports have shown that the acute decline in eGFR level with dapagliflozin occurs without evidence of kidney damage, as assessed by urine kidney injury biomarkers.

### Effect of single tablet of fixed-dose amlodipine and atorvastatin on blood pressure / lipid control, oxidative stress, and medication adherence in type 2 diabetic patients [^115G9Zfz]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Because MDA-LDL is thought to be involved in many steps of atherosclerosis, it is a promising candidate as a risk factor for atherosclerosis other than established risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and LDL-C. It has been shown that the plasma concentration of MDA-LDL is increased in patients with unstable carotid artery plaques. In the present study, this combination tablet decreased MDA-LDL, which suggests the possibility that this medication might directly intervene in many processes of atherosclerosis. Taking these findings together with the result that this combination tablet improved baPWV and mean IMT, this medication is thought to be highly promising as an anti-atherosclerosis drug.

MDA-LDL has been reported to exert direct cytotoxicity on endothelial cells, to promote synthesis and secretion of adhesion molecules, to increase platelet aggregation and monocyte adhesion, and to enhance foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesions, all of which lead to remodeling of vessel walls. The level of circulating MDA-LDL is reported to be elevated in patients with diabetes. The mechanisms underlying the increase in MDA-LDL in diabetic patients are not clear, although enhancement of lipid peroxidation might be involved. The main causes of death of diabetic patients are macrovascular diseases caused by severe atherosclerosis. Considering this, the observation that this combination tablet decreased MDA-LDL significantly might have clinical significance from the perspective of macrovascular disease prevention. Measurement of MDA-LDL, especially in diabetic patients, is expected to have a clinical impact.

During the observation period, Cr and ACR decreased, eGFR increased, and BNP decreased significantly. All of these results may reflect the reno- and cardio- protective effects of this combination tablet. Although statins have been reported to possess a reno-protective effect, it was shown that the reno-protective effect of atorvastatin is stronger than that of other statins. Atorvastatin has been shown to improve eGFR and Cr clearance in several sub-analyses from large scale clinical trials such as the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the Treating to New Targets (TNT), and the Greek atorvastatin and coronary heart disease evaluation (GREACE).

As one of the mechanisms underlying the reno-protective effect of atorvastatin, the possibility that atorvastatin might suppress podocyte injury was reported recently. In a sub-analysis of TNT, administration of atorvastatin significantly reduced hospitalization due to heart failure. Therefore, as a mechanism of BNP lowering in this study, there is a possibility that the pleiotropic effect of atorvastatin was added to the blood pressure-lowering effect of amlodipine.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^116hYhHF]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Dose adjustments by level of GFR emphasizes considering kidney function for medication dosing and identifies when higher accuracy methods are needed. Specifically, "Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medications cleared by the kidneys". The text explains that "Many medications and/or their active metabolites are excreted by the kidneys" and that "Failure to properly account for the effect of GFR when designing appropriate drug-dosing regimens can predispose a person to treatment failure or adverse events". For situations requiring greater precision, "Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFR estimates may be unreliable, use equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured GFR may be indicated". The guideline also notes regulatory recognition that "any contemporary, widely accepted, and clinically applicable estimating GFR equation is considered reasonable to assess GFR in pharmacokinetic studies".

### Glimepiride (glimepiride 3 mg) [^113E3Uuv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Gender

There were no differences between males and females in the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride when adjustment was made for differences in body weight.

Race

No studies have been conducted to assess the effects of race on glimepiride pharmacokinetics but in placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1Cwas comparable in Caucasians (n = 536), blacks (n = 63), and Hispanics (n = 63).

Renal impairment

In a single-dose, open-label study, glimepiride 3 mg was administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as estimated by creatinine clearance (CLcr): Group I consisted of 5 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr > 50 mL/min), Group II consisted of 3 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 20 to 50 mL/min) and Group III consisted of 7 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 20 mL/min). Although glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.3-fold higher mean AUC for M1 and an 8.6-fold higher mean AUC for M2 compared to corresponding mean AUCs in Group I. The apparent terminal half-life (T1/2) for glimepiride did not change, while the half-lives for M1 and M2 increased as renal function decreased. Mean urinary excretion of M1 plus M2 as a percentage of dose decreased from 44.4% for Group I to 21.9% for Group II and 9.3% for Group III.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^116s7GTn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Our results confirm the observations in other cohorts, where kidney function was also found to display a linear relationship over time. Somewhat surprisingly, the slopes in all 3 cohorts had a positive direction. It is known from other cardioprotective agents such as RAAS inhibitors that these drugs protect against kidney function decline, but these agents do not usually improve kidney function. 6 Previous post hoc analyses of 2 RCTs (TNT and SPARCL, which were also included in the current analysis) have demonstrated that the average of eGFR increased during follow‐up under atorvastatin treatment both in CKD and non‐CKD patients. 14, 15 A limitation of these 2 analyses was that during follow‐up the number of subjects declined, particularly in SPARCL. 14 Therefore, nonrandom effects might have explained the overall eGFR increase, meaning that only the patients with better outcome — those randomized to the most effective treatment arm — remained in the trial, and those patients with worse eGFR were dropouts. In keeping with this, a closer look at the data from the post hoc analysis of SPARCL revealed that the eGFR change from baseline was less exaggerated when the "last observation carried forward" analysis, including all subjects (ie, a total of 4393 instead of 2169 subjects with complete eGFR data after 60‐month follow‐up), was performed. 14 According to this analysis, eGFR remained stable in the high‐dose atorvastatin arm while eGFR declined in the placebo group. 14 Our study was able to test the robustness of the renal results from the 2 previous post hoc analyses by combining all 6 outcome RCTs in which patients were randomized to atorvastatin or control treatment and by analyzing slopes of kidney function (using both reciprocal serum creatinine and eGFR values) instead of mean eGFR values at follow‐up visits. Because of the presumed linearity of slopes when an adequate number of creatinine values are used, the effect of atorvastatin on kidney function decline is subject to differences in follow‐up duration and drop‐out of patients to a much lesser extent. Yet, in our analysis nonrandom effects related to the protective effect of atorvastatin might have accounted for eGFR improvement. We therefore performed additional sensitivity analyses by including only serum creatinine data while patients were still receiving the study drug, which gave very similar results to the main analysis. The possibility that nonrandom effects may have importantly influenced our results seems therefore unlikely, particularly in regard to comparisons among the 3 groups. Nonrandom effects may, however, have been responsible for the positive slopes observed in the patient group randomized to placebo.

### Study details | Effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers… [^116rduws]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Among patients with chronic kidney disease, the stage is divided into stage 1–5 by the level of GFR, with higher stages representing lower GFR levels. Renin-Angiotensin System is an enzymatic cascade in which angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I, which in turn, is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme to form angiotensin II. Angiotensin II produces renal vasoconstriction, so blocking the RAS is shown to be a useful approach to reduce the renovascular risk. Among the RAS blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers are most commonly used in clinical practice. 7) According to the National Kidney Foundation guideline, the workgroup recommend hypertensive patients with diabetes and CKD stage 1–4 should be treated with an ACEI or ARB, usually in combination with a diuretic.

For patients with suboptimal GFR without evidence of kidney damage like microalbuminuria, they are not considered as having CKD. There is lack of consensus on the selection of anti-hypertensive medication in this group of patients. For subjects having normoalbuminuria, BENEDICT study demonstrates the delay in onset of microalbuminuria with the use of either trandolapril alone or trandolapril plus verapamil. In ADVANCE trial, treatment with fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide reduced total renal event by 21%, defined as having new or worsening nephropathy or the development of new microalbuminuria. However these studies mainly focus on using urinary albumin excretion as outcome measures. They seldom took the value of GFR into account. However studies have found that significant decline in GFR in the absence of increase urine albumin excretion exists in a substantial percentage of adults with diabetes.

Decline in GFR should have diagnostic and prognostic value equivalent to urinary albumin excretion. However from literature, we cannot found the effect of RAS blockers on the decline in GFR. We therefore would like to carry out this study to investigate whether RAS blockers can delay the progress of renal disease, with particular attention to the value of GFR, in patients with GFR ≥ 60 but without microalbuminuria.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^116AyvdY]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — hemodynamically active therapies and eGFR change: Practice Point 2.1.4 states that among people with chronic kidney disease who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, "GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation". Acute eGFR decline after intensive blood pressure control shows "reductions of 10%–20% being typical within the first 3 months of treatment", and "acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents". Trials of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) suggest participants with " > 10% initial drop in eGFR" have similar outcomes "except in unusual cases when the acute "dip" in eGFR was > 30% from baseline". A "significant drop in eGFR (> 30%)" during initiation of antihypertensives, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or SGLT2i "should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring", and providers "should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents" because early dips are "typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity".

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride [^117UT2mf]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal Impairment

Pioglitazone

The serum elimination half-life of pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV remains unchanged in patients with moderate [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 30 to 50 mL/min] and severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment when compared to subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is required.

Glimepiride

In a single-dose, open-label study glimepiride 3 mg was administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as estimated by CLcr: Group I consisted of five patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr > 50 mL/min), Group II consisted of 3 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 20 to 50 mL/min) and Group III consisted of seven patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 20 mL/min). Although, glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.3 fold higher mean AUC for M1 and an 8.6 fold higher mean AUC for M2 compared to corresponding mean AUCs in Group I. The t½for glimepiride did not change, while the t½for M1 and M2 increased as renal function decreased. Mean urinary excretion of M1 plus M2 as a percentage of dose decreased from 44.4% for Group I to 21.9% for Group II and 9.3% for Group III.

Hepatic Impairment

Pioglitazone

Compared with healthy controls, subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Grade B/C) have an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone (pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV) mean Cmaxbut no change in the mean AUC values. Therefore, no dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is required.

There are postmarketing reports of liver failure with pioglitazone and clinical trials have generally excluded patients with serum ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. Use pioglitazone and glimepiride tablets with caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Glimepiride

It is unknown whether there is an effect of hepatic impairment on glimepiride pharmacokinetics because the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride has not been adequately evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment.

### Effect of atorvastatin on kidney function in chronic kidney disease: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1138mgNt]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of atorvastatin on kidney function was assessed in patients with stages 2–4 chronic kidney disease.

Methods

We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in chronic kidney disease clinics in Northern Tasmania and enrolled 132 patients with serum creatinine levels > 120 μmol/l, not taking lipid-lowering therapy and at all levels of proteinuria and serum cholesterol. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of atorvastatin/day (64) or placebo (68) and were followed with trial visits 3-monthly for a mean of 2.5 yrs. The primary outcome was the rate of both MDRD eGFR and Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (C-G CrCl) decline. Analysis was based on intention to treat and included all patients that had at least one follow-up visit.

Results

The rate of MDRD eGFR decline was 29% lower; 1.04 ± 3.84 vs. 1.47 ± 3.74 ml/min/1.73 m²/yr (P = 0.53), and the C-G CrCl was 20% lower; 1.88 ± 5.07 vs. 2.36 ± 4.61 ml/min/1.73 m²/yr (P = 0.58) in atorvastatin-treated, compared with placebo-treated patients. Although blood pressure decreased in both atorvastatin and placebo-treated groups there were no differences between groups. In addition, there was no difference in concomitant medication intake including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers between groups.

Conclusions

There was a trend toward a slower eGFR decline in the atorvastatin-treated group that did not reach statistical significance. This may have been due to the lack of power of the study. However, atorvastatin may have a renoprotective effect in those patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. This needs to be assessed in further studies.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium [^112hJmzM]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate.

Amlodipine

1.1 Hypertension

Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Renal outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients treated with… [^115Vhwg4]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

This study was performed to determine whether, in high-risk hypertensive patients with a reduced glomerular filtration rate, treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of renal disease outcomes compared with treatment with a diuretic. Methods. Conclusions In hypertensive patients with reduced GFR, neither amlodipine nor lisinopril was superior to chlorthalidone in reducing the rate of development of ESRD or a 50% or greater decrement in GFR. Participants assigned to receive amlodipine had a higher GFR than those assigned to receive chlorthalidone, but rates of development of ESRD were not different between the groups.

The purpose of this article is to report the efficacy of first-step treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor, each compared with a diuretic, in modifying renal disease outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients stratified by baseline GFR and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. In ALLHAT participants with reduced renal function, neither amlodipine nor lisinopril was superior to chlorthalidone in reducing incidence of ESRD or a composite of ESRD and a 50% or greater decline in GFR. Participants assigned to receive amlodipine had a higher GFR than those assigned to receive chlorthalidone, but rates of development of ESRD were not different among the groups. This may reflect a true difference in the ability to preserve renal function or a hemodynamic effect of amlodipine, resulting in an initial increase in GFR. Effects of amlodipine on the renal microcirculation have been well documented.

Amlodipine induces vasodilation of constricted preglomerular renal resistance vessels in isolated perfused kidneys, with preferential augmentation of GFR with a reduced effect on plasma flow. 23, 24 Under these conditions, higher GFR is achieved via higher intraglomerular pressure with increased proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. In summary, the apparent increase in MDRD-estimated GFR with amlodipine should be interpreted with caution and in our study did not translate into improved clinical renal disease outcomes during follow-up. In addition, interactions based on levels of proteinuria could not be assessed. This may be particularly relevant to this comparison, since amlodipine was less effective than an ACE inhibitor in reducing proteinuria in AASK. 25.

The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) factorial trial was a landmark randomized controlled clinical trial in 11140 type 2 diabetic patients from 215 centers in 20 countries with a two-by-two factorial design. In the blood pressure-lowering arm, patients were treated using a fixed combination of the ACE-inhibitor, perindopril, and the thiazide-like diuretic, indapamide, or placebo, whereas in the glucose-lowering arm, the intervention compared the sulphonylurea gliclazide plus other glucose-lowering drugs, targeting a glycated hemoglobin value of 6.5% or less, with standard glucose control. Primary end-points were major macro- and microvascular events in both arms. This review gives an overview of the results of the primary randomized trial, results from observational follow-up studies, and results of several biomarker studies and discusses the perspectives of these data in the context of recent major outcome trials for current medical treatment.

### Comparison of pioglitazone vs glimepiride on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes… [^113g3ubX]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measure Change in percent atheroma volume from baseline to study completion. Results Least squares mean PAV increased 0. 73% with glimepiride and decreased
0. 16% with pioglitazone. During the first 24 weeks of the trial, HbA1c values were reduced comparably in the 2 treatment groups, but subsequently diverged, with average postrandomization values slightly lower in the pioglitazone group, 6. 9% compared with
7. 0% in the glimepiride group. The mean HDL-C levels increased from baseline significantly more in the pioglitazone treatment group, 5. 7 mg/dL compared with
0. 9 mg/dL for the glimepiride group. Another secondary IVUS parameter, normalized total atheroma volume, showed a greater reduction for pioglitazone compared with glimepiride: −5. 5 mm³ vs −1. 5 mm³ that did not reach statistical significance, with a significant within-group decrease from baseline for the pioglitazone group and no change for the glimepiride group. Decreases in hemoglobin were more common in the pioglitazone group. An increase in fractures and reductions in hemoglobin level are both effects previously observed with TZD therapy. More patients randomized to pioglitazone had an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels, but there were no differences in incidence of elevations in creatinine.

### Canagliflozin slows progression of renal function decline independently of glycemic effects [^115JCHJS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition with canagliflozin decreases HbA1c, body weight, BP, and albuminuria, implying that canagliflozin confers renoprotection. We determined whether canagliflozin decreases albuminuria and reduces renal function decline independently of its glycemic effects in a secondary analysis of a clinical trial in 1450 patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin and randomly assigned to either once-daily canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or glimepiride uptitrated to 6–8 mg. End points were annual change in eGFR and albuminuria over 2 years of follow-up. Glimepiride, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg groups had eGFR declines of 3.3 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.8 to 3.8), 0.5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (95% CI, 0.0 to 1.0), and 0.9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.4), respectively (P < 0.01 for each canagliflozin group versus glimepiride). In the subgroup of patients with baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased more with canagliflozin 100 mg (31.7%; 95% CI, 8.6% to 48.9%; P = 0.01) or canagliflozin 300 mg (49.3%; 95% CI, 31.9% to 62.2%; P < 0.001) than with glimepiride. Patients receiving glimepiride, canagliflozin 100 mg, or canagliflozin 300 mg had reductions in HbA1c of 0.81%, 0.82%, and 0.93%, respectively, at 1 year and 0.55%, 0.65%, and 0.74%, respectively, at 2 years. In conclusion, canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg/d, compared with glimepiride, slowed the progression of renal disease over 2 years in patients with type 2 diabetes, and canagliflozin may confer renoprotective effects independently of its glycemic effects.

### GFR decline and subsequent risk of established kidney outcomes: a meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials [^113XhgUJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The currently established end points for clinical trials of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine level, which approximates a 57% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). There is increased interest in using alternative end points in clinical trials to shorten trial duration and reduce sample size. As part of an evaluation of using lesser declines in GFR as alternative end points, we examined the associations of various levels of eGFR decline with the subsequent development of established end points and assess the consistency of alternate levels of eGFR decline across varying clinical manifestations of kidney disease and interventions.

Study Design

Observational analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Setting & Participants

9,488 participants in 37 randomized controlled trials in CKD.

Predictor

Alternative end points, defined as 30% and 40% declines in eGFR from baseline to month 12. Effect modification by baseline eGFR, proteinuria, cause of disease, and interventions.

Outcomes

Established end point, defined as end-stage renal disease, eGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m², or doubling of serum creatinine level.

Results

From baseline to 12 months, 16.1% and 7.8% of participants had eGFR declines of ≥ 30% or ≥ 40%, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 2.0 (IQR, 1.2–3.1) years after the 12-month baseline period, 2,661 established end points were observed. A strong linear association was observed between eGFR decline and subsequent established end points. HRs for the established end point for 30% and 40% decreases in eGFR compared to a 0% decline were 9.6 (95% CI, 7.3–12.6) and 20.3 (95% CI, 14.1–29.3), respectively. The associations were consistent regardless of baseline eGFR, proteinuria, causes of disease, and interventions.

Limitations

Observational study subject to residual confounding.

Conclusions

The strong associations between lesser declines in eGFR and the subsequent development of established end points were consistent across different clinical characteristics of kidney disease and interventions and support implementation of alternative end points in clinical trials of CKD progression.

Albuminuria with preserved kidney function — Individuals older than 50 years with albuminuria in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² are at increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events, but there are no randomized trials indicating that statin treatment in this population decreases the risk of CHD; in CARE, individuals with proteinuria (protein excretion ≥ 1 +, corresponding to albumin excretion > 300 mg/g or category A3) had greater cardiovascular risk without data on statin effect, in CARDS atorvastatin reduced events (HR, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.99) but is not appropriate to extrapolate to those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, and in PREVEND IT (albumin-creatinine ratio of 30–300 mg/g; category A2) pravastatin did not decrease events (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49–1.57); without trial data, we would recommend that this population be treated according to the guidelines for the general population and we would favor using the general population recommendations for those older than 50 years with CKD and eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, with a research recommendation to develop a risk predictor.

Similarly, meta-analysis showed no evidence of benefits on CV or kidney outcomes for beta-blockers or CCBs compared to placebo or standard of care, and these studies were not properly powered for kidney or CV outcomes.

Case presentation

Case 1

Madam A, 45-year-old Malay lady diagnosed T2DM since age 30 years old, however has never been compliance to treatment. Since 2011 she has been suffering from frequent infections occurring at buccal space, left hand and right foot, requiring antibiotics, incision and drainages. Her glucose control was poor with Hba1c ranged around 12% with serum creatinine ranging around 60–70 μmol/l with proteinuria 4+. She was first seen in Nephrology clinic in March 2015 when she presented with bilateral lower limb swelling and deranged renal profile. Her serum creatinine was 120 μmol/l (eGFR 65 mL/min per 1.73m 2) that time with low albumin 28 g/L and persistent nephrotic range proteinuria with urine protein-creatinine index (UPCI) at 0.23–0.3 g/mmol. Ophthalmology review noted bilateral moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. She was treated with basal bolus insulin, diuretic and statin but subsequently defaulted nephrology follow-up. Patient was referred again from the health clinic a year after (March 2016) for similar complain but this time with much worsening renal function. Her creatinine this time was 222 μmol/l and her medications at this time was amlodipine 10 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, subcutaneous (SC) isophane insulin 6 IU BD and simvastatin 40 mg ON. Patient again did not turn up for her subsequent follow up and admitted on trying alternative medicine for her renal impairment. She came again in August 2016 presented with apparent nephrotic syndrome with grossly edematous lower limb with ascites and poorly controlled blood pressure to the emergency department. Her blood investigations showed serum creatinine 612 μmol/l (eGFR 12 mL/min per 1.73 m²), UPCI 1.48 g/mmol, urinalysis: blood 1+/ protein 4+/ leukocytes negative (Table 1). Urgent renal doppler ultrasound showed normal size kidneys, no evidence of obstructive uropathy or renal vein thrombosis. In view of sudden drop in renal function a renal biopsy was planned and results showed features of advance diabetic nephropathy, modular glomerulosclerosis pattern with 60% global sclerosis and moderate hypertensive vascular changes associated with severe chronic tubulointerstitial damage. There are also features of interstitial nephritis seen. Diabetic nephropathy (Tervaert Class IV) with moderate hypertensive vascular changes and interstitial nephritis (Fig. 1). She was counselled on long term renal replacement therapy and she has been dialysis dependant since then.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^112BLs5s]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Diabetes Guideline — Advanced CKD, hypoglycemia risk, and glucose-lowering drug selection — The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in patients with substantial decreases in eGFR (CKD stages 4 and 5) for two reasons: decreased clearance of insulin and some oral agents and impaired renal gluconeogenesis with advanced kidney mass loss; patients with type 1 diabetes receiving insulin or who have significant creatinine elevations (mean 2.2 mg/dL) have a 5-fold increase in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, it is imperative that patients being treated intensively monitor their glucose levels closely and reduce their doses of medicines as needed to avoid hypoglycemia. Progressive falls in kidney function result in reduced clearances of the sulfonylureas or their active metabolites, necessitating a decrease in drug dosing, and first generation sulfonylureas should be avoided altogether in patients with CKD; among second-generation sulfonylureas, glipizide is the preferred agent as it does not have active metabolites and does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and an increase in the levels of the active metabolite occurs with nateglinide but not with the similar drug, repaglinide.

### HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for people with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis [^117NoZJS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most frequent cause of death in people with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to people who have existing coronary artery disease. This is an update of a review published in 2009, and includes evidence from 27 new studies (25,068 participants) in addition to the 26 studies (20,324 participants) assessed previously; and excludes three previously included studies (107 participants). This updated review includes 50 studies (45,285 participants); of these 38 (37,274 participants) were meta-analysed.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits (such as reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, MI and stroke; and slow progression of CKD to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)) and harms (muscle and liver dysfunction, withdrawal, and cancer) of statins compared with placebo, no treatment, standard care or another statin in adults with CKD who were not on dialysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 5 June 2012 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of statins with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or other statins, on mortality, cardiovascular events, kidney function, toxicity, and lipid levels in adults with CKD not on dialysis were the focus of our literature searches.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two or more authors independently extracted data and assessed study risk of bias. Treatment effects were expressed as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (lipids, creatinine clearance and proteinuria) and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (major cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or non-fatal stroke, ESKD, elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, cancer and withdrawal rates) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 50 studies (45,285 participants): 47 studies (39,820 participants) compared statins with placebo or no treatment and three studies (5547 participants) compared two different statin regimens in adults with CKD who were not yet on dialysis. We were able to meta-analyse 38 studies (37,274 participants). The risk of bias in the included studies was high. Seven studies comparing statins with placebo or no treatment had lower risk of bias overall; and were conducted according to published protocols, outcomes were adjudicated by a committee, specified outcomes were reported, and analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat methods. In placebo or no treatment controlled studies, adverse events were reported in 32 studies (68%) and systematically evaluated in 16 studies (34%). Compared with placebo, statin therapy consistently prevented major cardiovascular events (13 studies, 36,033 participants; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.79), all-cause mortality (10 studies, 28,276 participants; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.91), cardiovascular death (7 studies, 19,059 participants; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.87) and MI (8 studies, 9018 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.72). Statins had uncertain effects on stroke (5 studies, 8658 participants; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.12). Potential harms from statin therapy were limited by lack of systematic reporting and were uncertain in analyses that had few events: elevated creatine kinase (7 studies, 4514 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.48), liver function abnormalities (7 studies, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.50), withdrawal due to adverse events (13 studies, 4219 participants; RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.60), and cancer (2 studies, 5581 participants; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 130). Statins had uncertain effects on progression of CKD. Data for relative effects of intensive cholesterol lowering in people with early stages of kidney disease were sparse. Statins clearly reduced risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and MI in people with CKD who did not have CVD at baseline (primary prevention).

Authors' Conclusions

Statins consistently lower death and major cardiovascular events by 20% in people with CKD not requiring dialysis. Statin-related effects on stroke and kidney function were found to be uncertain and adverse effects of treatment are incompletely understood. Statins have an important role in primary prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality in people who have CKD.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence-focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^117PphdM]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Effects on renal function

With the exception of the hydrophilic statins pravastatin and rosuvastatin, statins are metabolized by the liver and cleared minimally by the kidney. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline has provided recommendations for lipid management in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dose reduction based on estimated glomerular filtration rate may be prudent in patients with severe kidney dysfunction who are receiving intensive statin regimens.

While few studies have been performed in CKD patients, recent meta-analyses indicate that statin treatment reduces CVD risk in patients with CKD, especially those with mild kidney disease. There was, however, no clear benefit in patients on dialysis. Given that statins reduce CVD events by 20% in CKD, this has prompted guidelines to recommend statin therapy in CKD patients except those on dialysis.

Mild proteinuria, often transient, is seen at low frequency with high dose statin treatment but is not associated with impaired renal function (as reviewed previously). This may be caused by reduced tubular reabsorption of albumin, related to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and reduced prenylation of proteins involved in endocytosis. A potential concern, however, is whether high dose statin therapy increases the risk of acute kidney disease. One retrospective analysis involving more than two million statin users (59 636 with CKD) newly treated with a statin between 1997 and 2008, reported a 34% higher RR of acute renal injury within 120 days of initiation of high vs. moderate intensity statin treatment, although this was attenuated with prolonged statin exposure. This was not seen in patients with CKD. While this retrospective analysis may raise concerns, data from RCTs have not shown any increase in risk. A meta-analysis of 24 RCTs involving 15 000 patient years exposure reported no change in the risk of acute renal impairment, and no increase in serious adverse renal events during statin treatment. Furthermore, in a number of meta-analyses that have focused on CKD patients, there was no increase in progression of CKD or acute renal events on statin therapy. Indeed, it has been suggested that statins may have potential renoprotective effects, or even slow progression of CKD, although no such benefit on renal function was evident in other studies.

Take home messages

Statin treatment is not associated with clinically significant deterioration of renal function.
Dose reduction based on estimated glomerular filtration rate may be prudent in patients with severe kidney dysfunction who are receiving intensive statin regimens.
A protective effect of statins on the kidney cannot be excluded but further study is merited.

### Kidney function decline and serious adverse drug reactions in patients with CKD [^115CiWxr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The impact of kidney function decline on serious ADR risk has been poorly investigated. We comprehensively describe ADRs and assess the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serious ADR risk.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

3,033 participants in French Chronic Kidney Disease-Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD-REIN) cohort study, a nationwide sample of nephrology outpatients with moderate to advanced CKD.

Predictors

Demographic and biological data (including eGFR), medication prescriptions.

Outcome

ADRs (preventable or not) were prospectively identified from hospital discharge reports, medical records, and patient interviews. Expert pharmacologists used validated tools to adjudicate ADRs.

Analytical Approach

Restricted cubic splines in fully adjusted cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the relationship between eGFR and the risk of serious ADRs (overall and by subtype).

Results

During a median follow-up period of 4.7 years, 360 patients experienced 488 serious ADRs. Kidney and urinary disorders (n = 170) and hemorrhage (n = 170) accounted for 70% of serious ADRs. The most common medications classes were antithrombotics and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. The majority of those serious ADRs were associated with hospitalization (n = 467), with 32 directly or indirectly associated with death and 22 associated with a life-threatening event. More than 27% of the 488 serious ADRs were preventable or potentially preventable. The eGFR is a major risk factor for serious ADRs. The risk of acute kidney injury was 2.2% higher and risk of bleeding ADRs was 8% higher for each 1mL/min/1.73m 2 lower baseline eGFR.

Limitations

The results cannot be extrapolated to patients who are not being treated by a nephrologist.

Conclusions

ADRs constitute a major cause of hospitalization in CKD patients for whom lower eGFR level is a major risk factor.

Plain-Language Summary

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have complex clinical presentations, take multiple medications, and often receive inappropriate prescriptions. Using data from a large, prospective CKD cohort, we found a high incidence of serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The 2 most common serious ADRs were drug-induced acute kidney injury and bleeding. A large proportion of serious ADRs required hospital admission, and 11% led to death or were life threatening. Lower kidney function was a major risk factor for serious ADRs. Many of these serious ADRs were determined to be partly preventable through greater adherence to prescription guidelines. This report enhances our understanding of the potential toxicity of drugs taken by patients with moderate to advanced CKD. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring kidney function when prescribing drugs, particularly for high-risk medications such as antithrombotic agents.

### The effects of eGFR change on CVD, renal, and mortality outcomes in a hypertensive cohort treated with 3 different antihypertensive medications [^115o7hSB]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Impaired renal function is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and mortality. The impact of short-term renal function decline on outcomes is less well studied. The association of antihypertensive medications with the impact of short-term estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline is not known.

Methods

We examined 20,207 hypertensive participants with baseline and 2-year creatinine levels from which eGFR changes were estimated. The associations between eGFR change with incident coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure (HF), all-cause mortality, and ESRD during 2.9 years of in-trial follow up, and with mortality during in-trial and post-trial follow-up (7.6 years), were studied. Results were assessed by primary hypertension (HTN) treatment (chlorthalidone, lisinopril, and amlodipine) and adjusted for baseline eGFR levels.

Results

In the short run, an eGFR decline below the cohort median (-1.28 ml/minute/1.73 m²/2 years) vs. above the median, or a 5 ml/min/1.73 m²/year decline vs. no decline, was associated with significant hazard risk for CHD (1.06–1.28), HF (1.24–1.91), ESRD (2.84–6.01), and mortality (1.08–1.19), but not with stroke risk. In the long term, there was a significant association with mortality (1.11–1.34). Interaction terms for outcomes by antihypertensive treatments were not statistically significant except for ESRD between amlodipine vs. chlorthalidone (hazard ratio: 3.17 [2.59, 3.88] vs. 2.41 [1.98, 2.97]; P interaction = 0.005) for a 5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year eGFR decline.

Conclusion

Decline in eGFR over 2 years is associated with increased risk of clinical outcomes beyond the effects of baseline eGFR. These risks were the same irrespective of the primary medication used to treat HTN.

KDOQI narrative — Thiazolidinediones and dosing oversight in CKD: Rosiglitazone is cleared by the liver and does not have to be reduced with impaired kidney function, and therefore rosiglitazone does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with CKD, but it has the potential, along with pioglitazone, to worsen fluid retention. Doses are not specified by level of kidney function, but should be adjusted based on frequent monitoring to balance goals of glycemic control with avoiding hypoglycemia, and other considerations include avoiding or minimizing the occurrence of interactions with drugs used to lower blood glucose.

### HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for people with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis [^112QerBj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dyslipidaemia occurs frequently in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and contributes both to cardiovascular disease and worsening renal function. Statins are widely used in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients (pre-dialysis) even though evidence favouring their use is lacking.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of statins in CKD patients who were not receiving renal replacement therapy.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (in The Cochrane Library), and hand-searched reference lists of textbooks, articles and scientific proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing statins with placebo, no treatment or other statins in adult pre-dialysis CKD patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (lipids, creatinine clearance and proteinuria) and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis and withdrawal rates) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty six studies (25,017 participants) comparing statins with placebo were identified. Total cholesterol decreased significantly with statins (18 studies, 1677 patients: MD -41.48 mg/dL, 95% CI -49.97 to -33.99). Similarly, LDL cholesterol decreased significantly with statins (16 studies, 1605 patients: MD -42.38 mg/dL, 95% CI -50.71 to -34.05). Statins decreased both the risk of all-cause (21 RCTs, 18,781 patients, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74, 0.89) and cardiovascular deaths (20 studies, 18,746 patients: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.90). Statins decreased 24-hour urinary protein excretion (6 studies, 311 patients: MD -0.73 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.52), but there was no significant improvement in creatinine clearance - a surrogate marker of renal function (11 studies, 548 patients: MD 1.48 mL/min, 95% CI -2.32 to 5.28). The incidence of rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (well known complications of statins use), were not significantly different between patients receiving statins and placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients who are not receiving renal replacement therapy. They do not impact on the decline in renal function as measured by creatinine clearance, but may reduce protein excretion in urine. Statins appear to be safe in this population. Guidelines recommendations on hyperlipidaemia management in CKD patients could therefore be followed targeting higher proportions of patients receiving a statin, with appropriate monitoring of adverse events.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^117EU9DL]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Holistic approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment and risk modification — core components emphasize periodic reassessment and first-line pharmacotherapy for most patients: Regular risk factor reassessment (every 3–6 months) is advised. First-line drug therapy includes sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) continue until dialysis or transplant; aiming for systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 120 mm Hg with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor at maximum tolerated dose (if HTN); and statin-based therapy using moderate- or high-intensity statin. Targeted therapies for complications include nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) in people with diabetes and an indication for use; dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or diuretic if needed to achieve individualized blood pressure (BP) target; steroidal MRA if needed for resistant hypertension if estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45; antiplatelet agent for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) based on ASCVD risk and lipids; management of anemia, CKD-MBD, acidosis, and potassium abnormalities where indicated; and using the same principles to diagnose and manage ASCVD and atrial fibrillation as in people without CKD. The caption further specifies that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker should be first-line therapy for BP control when albuminuria is present; otherwise a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic can also be considered, and that all 3 classes are often needed to attain BP targets.

### Rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a 4-year (208-week) phase III trial of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycemic control [^1128rtbF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Durability of efficacy and preservation of beta-cell function are important unmet medical needs in the treatment of patients with T2DM. This study will compare the effect of the insulin secretagogue glimepiride with empagliflozin, which has an insulin-independent mode of action, on the annualized slope of glycemic control (coefficient of durability) and biomarkers of insulin secretion over 4 years. Furthermore, the study design includes a 4-week follow-up period to assess, using a mixed MTT, whether empagliflozin truly delays or masks deterioration of beta-cell function during treatment through urinary glucose excretion.

Identification of chronic kidney disease and its progression is based on the assessment of renal function (eGFR) and markers such as albuminuria. Recommendations for intensive glycemic control for prevention or delay of diabetic nephropathy are based almost exclusively on studies that have demonstrated an improvement in albuminuria. In patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease, glycemic control is recommended to be part of a multifactorial intervention strategy that includes blood pressure control. Thus, empagliflozin, which lowers blood pressure and body weight as well as improving glycemic control, may offer an advantage over glimepiride in reducing the onset or deterioration of albuminuria as a surrogate marker of glomerular and tubular damage. A limitation of this study is that as the incidence of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease or death from renal disease is expected to be low in these patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment at baseline, this study is not powered to detect differences in hard renal outcome events.

Reduction of macrovascular complications is an important goal in the management of patients with T2DM. While this study is not powered to detect a difference in CV outcomes - assuming a yearly rate of 4-MACE (major adverse cardiac events) (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina) of 1% in this low-risk population, one might expect approximately 60 adjudicated 4-MACE in a 4-year trial - exploratory comparative effectiveness data could support treatment decisions until hard evidence emerges from dedicated CV outcome trials.

### Relationship of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with renal function in patients treated with atorvastatin [^114TPqCY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiological studies have suggested that people with elevated plasma high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are at decreased cardiovascular risk. 1 Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often have abnormalities of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, including a reduced level of HDL cholesterol. 2 Previous longitudinal studies investigating the relationship of low levels of HDL cholesterol (or its main apolipoprotein, apoA‐I) on kidney function have been inconsistent, with both positive 3, 4, 5 and negative findings reported. 6, 7 It is not known whether a low HDL cholesterol level can predict either CKD or a decline in renal function in patients who are treated with a statin. Recent findings from the PLANET I (Prospective Evaluation of Proteinuria and Renal Function in Diabetic Patients With Progressive Renal Disease) and PLANET II (Prospective Evaluation of Proteinuria and Renal Function in Non‐diabetic Patients With Progressive Renal Disease) studies have demonstrated that atorvastatin rendered better renoprotection as compared with rosuvastatin. 8 Moreover, these studies showed that patients randomized to atorvastatin had stabilization of eGFR during follow‐up, while those randomized to rosuvastatin still had progression of eGFR decline. Post hoc analyses of other double‐blind placebo‐controlled randomized controlled trials indicate that treatment with atorvastatin is associated with eGFR improvement over time. 9, 10, 11 The mechanism explaining the discrepant effects within the same class of statins on eGFR trajectories is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether HDL cholesterol levels predict renal function in the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial, a double‐blind controlled trial in which patients with stable coronary disease were randomized to 2 doses of atorvastatin (either 10 or 80 mg daily). 12

### Effect of short-term rosuvastatin treatment on estimated glomerular filtration rate [^112Nq15B]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

To define the effect of short-term rosuvastatin treatment on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the database of controlled clinical trials in the Rosuvastatin Clinical Development Program was reviewed. Thirteen studies comprising 3,956 rosuvastatin-treated patients were selected based on a serum creatinine measurement at 6 or 8 weeks after initiation of rosuvastatin treatment, randomization to approved and marketed rosuvastatin doses (5 to 40 mg), and unchanged rosuvastatin dose from treatment initiation (baseline) through 6 to 8 weeks of treatment. eGFR was determined with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. eGFR significantly increased for each dose of rosuvastatin individually and for all doses combined compared with baseline (range +0.9 to +3.2 ml/min/1.73 m2). Further analysis of 5 blinded, placebo-controlled trials comprising 525 patients showed an increase in eGFR of +0.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval +0.1 to +1.5) for all rosuvastatin-treated patients, which was significantly different from baseline (p < 0.04) and from a change of -1.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo-treated patients (95% confidence interval -2.5 to -0.5, p < 0.001). The increase in eGFR for rosuvastatin-treated patients was consistent across all major demographic and clinical subgroups of interest, including patients with baseline proteinuria, baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes. In conclusion, these results are consistent with previous rosuvastatin studies that showed an upward trend in eGFR with long-term treatment (≥ 96 weeks) and with the hypothesis that statins may have pleiotropic mechanisms of action that include beneficial renal effects.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes – A tiered approach: an overview of the joint association of British clinical diabetologists and UK kidney association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^115u3p1M]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, we suggest the following treatment targets: total cholesterol ≤ 4.0 mmol/L, non‐HDL cholesterol ≤ 2.5 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol ≤ 1.8 mmol/L. For pragmatic reasons we have not suggested percentage reductions in baseline levels, nor have we suggested a graded approach to therapy. We are aware that with time pressures and conflicting demands, lipid management is often neglected. Clear targets and a simple stepwise approach to management can help more people access appropriate therapy.

In most cases, atorvastatin 20 mg is suggested as the first‐line lipid‐lowering agent with dose titration or use of higher intensity statins as required and according to summary of product characteristics (SPC) and local guidance. Specialist advice should be sought at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In people with statin intolerance, ezetimibe alone or in combination with bempedoic acid can be used. Fibrates cause a reversible increase in creatinine and specialist advice is recommended when these are used in people with CKD.

There are newer agents, inclisiran, PSCK9 inhibitors and icosapent ethyl, available for people who do not meet treatment targets using statins or ezetimibe. These agents have specific licensing indications (including specific cholesterol ranges) and also local restrictions. For these agents, evidence for benefit exists up to stage G3b CKD.

Lipid‐lowering therapy is effective in lowering CVD risk, however, there are specific side effects to be aware of which are listed on the individual summary of product characteristics, and these should be appropriately discussed prior to medication initiation.

2.3 Tier 3

In the SGLT2i trials, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors over and above the standard of care treatment, which included BP and glycaemic control and optimum RASi, around 10% of patients reached primary kidney end points and around 7% reached CVD end points. This suggests despite optimum Tier 2 treatment there remains residual risk of kidney disease progression and CVD in a significant number of patients, for whom we suggest the following interventions.

### Glucose-lowering drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease: a narrative review on pharmacokinetic properties [^115Vvj8q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The achievement of a good glycaemic control is one of the cornerstones for preventing and delaying progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with both diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). As for other drugs, the presence of an impaired renal function may significantly affect pharmacokinetics of the majority of glucose-lowering agents, thus exposing diabetic CKD patients to a higher risk of side effects, mainly hypoglycaemic episodes. As a consequence, a reduction in dosing and/or frequency of administration is necessary to keep a satisfactory efficacy/safety profile. In this review, we aim to summarize the pharmacology of the most widely used glucose-lowering agents, discuss whether and how it is altered by a reduced renal function, and the recommendations that can be made for their use in patients with different degrees of CKD.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury in hypertension — monitoring and medication effects are specified. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) (including ACEi, ARB, and MRA) may lead to an expected reduction, or dip, in eGFR of up to 30% via vasodilation of efferent arterioles. This expected short-term dip in eGFR is associated with preservation of kidney function in the long-term and should not lead to discontinuation of the RAASi unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate for evaluation of other causes of AKI, CKD progression, and possible renal artery stenosis. The presence of new kidney dysfunction/injury may also be observed with the addition or dose increase of diuretics. This should prompt evaluation of volume status to rule out hypovolemia and other possible causes of kidney dysfunction, and it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112ykkgR]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix K — nephrotoxic agents and medication dose adjustments in chronic kidney disease (CKD) highlights the burden and organization of drug-induced kidney injury: In hospitalized acute kidney injury (AKI), approximately 1 in 5 episodes are medication-related, and during critical care approximately a third of patients receive multiple potentially nephrotoxic medications; in outpatients with stage G3-G5 CKD, approximately half use a potentially inappropriate medication. The kidney receives 20% of cardiac output and has a greater exposure to the risk of toxic drug effects than other organ systems. For risk framing, the KDIGO 2019 Controversies in Acute Kidney Injury model organizes drugs into two major categories by which they can cause harm: kidney dysfunction or kidney injury. Pharmacovigilance signals include that, per the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2019–2023, there were 77,000 reports of serious AKI suspected to be caused by a drug; seven of the top 10 suspect generic drugs were in the PPI class representing 86% of all reported cases of serious, drug-induced AKI, and global surveillance reports where the PPI class occupies 4 of 5 drugs suspected of causing nephrotoxicity. Clinically, the primary care provider must have a high degree of clinical suspicion of drugs may be causative when an acute decline in kidney function is detected, with cessation of the offending agent as the first step in reversing drug-induced AKI; patient knowledge of having CKD was associated with a protective effect, reducing exposure.

### An assessment of statin safety by nephrologists [^115LzWka]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Recently, concerns regarding potential adverse effects of the statins on the kidney have been raised. The Kidney Expert Panel of the National Lipid Association's (NLA) Safety Task Force, made up of 3 nephrologists, was convened to review all of the currently available evidence pertinent to determining whether statins cause kidney injury, independent of the known, rare mechanisms of rhabdomyolysis and allergic, drug-induced, interstitial nephritis. The Panel reviewed published and unpublished evidence and found none that suggested that statins, when used in doses currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cause kidney injury.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^1157hV7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Modeled slopes of reciprocal of serum creatinine across the 3 groups (placebo [green], atorvastatin 10 mg [black], and 80 mg [red]).

In order to perform a formal comparison between the atorvastatin doses, the TNT data set was analyzed and showed a significant dose effect of atorvastatin on average annual change in kidney function. In the patients randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg, the slope was significantly lower (estimate [SE] of 0.012 [0.0007] (mg/dL)⁻¹) compared with the slope observed in the 80‐mg group (0.015 [0.0007] (mg/dL)⁻¹, P = 0.0009).

The eGFR slopes showed a similar pattern. Placebo and 10 mg and 80 mg atorvastatin had slopes (estimate [SE]) of 0.25 (0.068), 0.51 (0.054), and 0.78 (0.056) mL/(min·1.73 m²) per year, respectively (P = 0.0002 for placebo and P < 0.0001 for atorvastatin 10 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg). Again, the adjusted models affected the slopes negligibly (data not shown). These findings would roughly translate to an eGFR increase of 1.3, 2.6, and 3.9 mL/(min·1.73 m²) over a 5‐year period for placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg, respectively. In the formal comparison using TNT data, once again a dose effect could be observed (0.58 [0.065] and 0.86 [0.065] mL/(min.1.73 m²) in the atorvastatin 10‐ and 80‐mg groups, respectively [P = 0.003]).

### Safety and efficacy of antihyperglycaemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^116NNYmG]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

6 INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES

6.1 Sulfonylureas

Sulfonylureas (SUs) were the first oral agents to treat T2DM and have been used for over 60 years. SUs work by stimulating the β‐cells in the pancreas to increase insulin secretion and decreasing hepatic insulin clearance independently of hyperglycaemia. 50 SUs are recommended to be used after and in combination with metformin as dual therapy and frequently used due to low cost and high effectiveness. Several studies have proven that SUs reduce HbA1C from 1.0% to 2.0% on average as monotherapy and combination, respectively. 51

SUs have a higher risk of hypoglycaemia in comparison with other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs and should be cautiously dosed in patients with DKD. 3 Since most SUs are eliminated by the kidneys, dose adjustment or drug discontinuation should be considered in advanced DKD stages. 3 Considering these facts, glipizide is the preferred 2nd generation SU as no dose adjustment is needed on moderate to severe CKD with no increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Another commonly utilized agent, glyburide, should be avoided in CKD stages 3‐5, while glimepiride can be used in CKD stage 3 with caution (Table 1). 52

Table 1
Safety of different antihyperglycaemic agents at different stages of eGFR

No evidence of renoprotective effects such as decreasing albuminuria or delaying DKD progression has been recognized as attributable to SUs. 53 The reports to be exposed in June 2019 of the CAROLINA trial will provide evidence of long‐term outcomes of glimepiride vs linagliptin considering cardiovascular as primary and renal as secondary endpoints. 54

6.2 GLP‐1 RAs

Glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists (RA) are drugs classified as incretin‐based therapies. The main incretins in humans are GLP‐1 and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which are secreted by the intestines after every meal. GLP‐1 receptor agonists then, work by the stimulation of GLP‐1 receptors, enhancing insulin secretion, appetite suppression, delaying gastric emptying, and inhibiting glucagon release from the pancreas. 55 Current clinically used GLP‐1 RAs are resistant to Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) cleavage and are generally long‐acting drugs, reducing HbA1C with a variability between 1.3% and 1.9%. 56 GLP‐1‐RAs use has increased in the past decade due to their efficacy and mostly due the low risk for hypoglycaemia and their beneficial effect on weight loss. 57

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact) [^116i3S2s]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In pharmacokinetic studies with pioglitazone, no significant differences were observed in pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although clinical experiences have not identified differences in effectiveness and safety between the elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients, these conclusions are limited by small sample sizes for patients ≥ 75 years old.

Glimepiride

In clinical trials of glimepiride, 1053 of 3491 patients (30%) were ≥ 65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between patients with type 2 diabetes ≤ 65 years (n = 49) and those > 65 years (n = 42) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Glimepiride is substantially excreted by the kidney. Elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment. In addition, hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Use caution when initiating DUETACT and increasing the dose of DUETACT in this patient population.

8.6 Renal Impairment

To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, the initial dosing, dose increments and maintenance dosage of DUETACT should be conservative. During initiation of DUETACT therapy and any subsequent dose adjustments, these patients should be observed carefully for hypoglycemia.

A multiple-dose titration study was conducted in 16 patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 mg to 8 mg daily for three months. Baseline creatinine clearance ranged from 10 to 60 mL/min. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride were evaluated in the multiple-dose titration study and the results were consistent with those observed in patients enrolled in a single-dose study. In both studies, the relative total clearance of glimepiride increased when kidney function was impaired. Both studies also demonstrated that the elimination of the two major metabolites was reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Longitudinal assessment of estimated glomerular filtration rate in apparently healthy adults: a post hoc analysis from the JUPITER study (justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) [^1131iBDr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Serum creatinine-based estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are frequently used to identify patients with chronic kidney disease and assess cardiovascular risk both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. Although change in eGFR may be useful to assess change in renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease, the utility of serum creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain, particularly among individuals with normal or only mildly impaired renal function.

Objective

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between baseline serum creatinine and eGFR, as well as changes in these parameters, in apparently healthy adults in a post hoc analysis of data obtained in participants in the JUPITER study (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin).

Methods

JUPITER was a randomized study of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus placebo in apparently healthy adults with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ≥ 2.0 mg/L, LDL-C < 130 mg/dL, and serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL. Changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFR, based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, were assessed in the entire population and in subsets classified according to baseline eGFR status.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the 16,279 JUPITER study participants (mean age, 66 years; 62% men; 72% white; and 58% with a history of hypertension) who had both a baseline and ≥ 1 postbaseline serum creatinine measurement were similar to the entire population of 17,802 patients who entered the trial. The mean age of the study population was 66 years, 62% were men, 72% were white, and 58% had a history of hypertension. Mean (SD) serum creatinine increased from baseline by 0.08 (0.16) mg/dL and 0.09 (0.14) mg/dL in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.001) at year 1 and by 0.09 (0.18) and 0.10 (0.16) mg/dL (P = 0.0045) at the final visit. Reductions in MDRD and CKD-EPI eGFR were ∼ 0.5 mL/min/1.73 m² greater with placebo than with rosuvastatin (P < 0.004) at year 1 and the final visit. The magnitude of eGFR change was closely related to baseline eGFR, with greater reductions among subjects with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² in both the rosuvastatin and placebo groups. Among those with an eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m², mean changes at year 1 and final visit ranged from -16 to -23 mL/min/1.73 m² with MDRD and CKD-EPI, respectively; in contrast, mean changes were < 1 mL/min/1.73 m² in subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

Conclusions

In JUPITER, reductions in MDRD or CKD-EPI eGFR levels were greater in study participants with higher baseline eGFR levels but less in the rosuvastatin than in the placebo group. Future studies are required to assess the reliability of serum creatinine-based estimates of GFR to assess change in renal function, particularly among individuals with normal serum creatinine levels.

### Statins, mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events among veterans with CKD… [^115k1QwP]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Among adults older than 65 years with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 4 and no history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, is new statin use associated with lower risk of mortality or major adverse cardiovascular events. Findings In this cohort study of 14 828 participants, a target trial emulation of statin initiation found that statins were significantly associated with a 9% lower risk of all-cause mortality. There was a numerically lower risk of MACE, but the results were not statistically significant. Meaning These findings suggest that in older adults with CKD stages 3 to 4 without prior ASCVD, statin initiation may lower risk of mortality and MACE. Importance There are limited data for the utility of statins for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and death in adults with chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions and Relevance In this target trial emulation of statin initiation in US veterans older than 65 years with CKD stages 3 to 4 and no prior ASCVD, statin initiation was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality but not MACE. Results should be confirmed in a randomized clinical trial. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among older adults with chronic kidney disease. 1 Yet, data for the role of statins for primary ASCVD prevention in individuals with moderate CKD are limited. A meta-analysis of 8834 participants in primary prevention trials with CKD, primarily stage 3, reported a 41% reduction in ASCVD events and a 34% reduction in total mortality. 2 Conversely, there is evidence that there is no benefit to initiating statins in persons receiving hemodialysis. 3–5. Frailty was defined according to the 31-item VA Frailty Index.

20 Polypharmacy was defined as having prescriptions from 5 or more VA medication classes prior to baseline. 17 In veterans with available data, we extracted laboratory data to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate. Calculations were based on the serum creatinine closest to the CKD diagnosis date and did not factor race into the equation. 21 Finally, to quantify ASCVD risk, which directly leads clinicians to recommend a statin prescription, we calculated cardiovascular risk according to the VA ASCVD risk score. 22.
