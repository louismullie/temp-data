## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about identifying and managing a 21-year-old who develops urticaria whenever her body temperature increases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis based on the temperature-linked trigger and lesion morphology. Then, I should verify key differentials that can mimic this presentation. Next, I will review diagnostic confirmation strategies, including provocation testing and when to pursue additional workup. After that, I need to outline a stepwise treatment algorithm, starting with trigger avoidance and antihistamines and escalating to biologics if needed. Finally, I should consider prognosis, special situations, and a concise, actionable plan with safety counseling and follow-up checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. The description of small, pruritic wheals with large flares provoked by rising core body temperature during exercise, sweating, emotional stress, or hot showers strongly suggests cholinergic urticaria, which is a chronic inducible urticaria defined by pinpoint 1–3 mm wheals with prominent flares triggered by core temperature increases, and it accounts for roughly 5% of chronic urticaria and about 30% of physical urticarias, aligning with the age and phenotype here [^114tu1kQ] [^111uA7nv] [^112Wo5B3].

> Wait, let me verify the key differentials so I don't jump to conclusions. Heat urticaria is localized to skin exposed to heat and typically requires direct thermal contact rather than a global rise in core temperature, which doesn't fit this case; aquagenic urticaria is triggered by water contact irrespective of temperature and would not explain flares with passive warming; exercise-induced anaphylaxis presents with larger wheals and systemic symptoms and should be distinguished using supervised exercise and passive heating challenges; cold urticaria is the opposite trigger and would not match a heat-associated pattern, though coexisting cold urticaria is possible in a minority [^114c2kDM] [^114Xe6gT] [^111Xc34a] [^111PSz9R].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach next. History is paramount here, and I need to check for reproducibility with sweating, anxiety, or hot environments and document lesion size and time course. Provocation testing such as partial immersion in a 42°C bath to raise core temperature by about 0.7°C or supervised exercise can support the diagnosis, but hold on, I should verify the test limitations — negative predictive value is imperfect, so a negative test does not exclude cholinergic urticaria, and methacholine intradermal testing is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule out disease, so I must interpret results in clinical context [^111SoEKm] [^111Xc34a] [^115n82yn].

> Next, I should review whether any additional workup is warranted. In straightforward chronic inducible urticaria without atypical features, extensive laboratory testing rarely changes management. I need to ensure I screen for red flags such as atypical wheals, systemic symptoms, or poor response to therapy that might suggest vasculitis, mastocytosis, or autoinflammatory mimics, and only pursue targeted testing if the history or exam suggests an underlying process, keeping in mind that routine panels have very low yield in chronic urticaria [^1136tgrN] [^111r7UA2] [^114dcFNb].

> Now, I will outline first-line management. Let me think about trigger mitigation first: advise avoiding abrupt core temperature rises when feasible, consider premedication before known triggers, and counsel on rapid cooling strategies after episodes. Pharmacologically, start a daily nonsedating second-generation H1 antihistamine such as cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine, or levocetirizine, and I should double-check that continuous daily use is superior to as-needed dosing for control in chronic urticaria [^112zaYfA] [^1179SnLv] [^114KLjLg].

> Hold on, I should verify the escalation strategy if control is inadequate. Updosing second-generation antihistamines to two to four times the standard dose is guideline-supported and often effective; if still uncontrolled, I can add a leukotriene receptor antagonist such as montelukast or consider combination strategies, while reserving first-generation sedating antihistamines at bedtime for severe nocturnal pruritus due to adverse effects; I need to ensure we avoid chronic systemic corticosteroids except for very short rescue courses given risks and lack of durable benefit [^116C6tnp] [^1142P3Hj].

> For refractory disease, I should confirm the role of biologics. Omalizumab is the preferred next step with robust randomized data and guideline endorsement in antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria, including inducible phenotypes; I should double-check that patients are truly refractory on maximally tolerated antihistamine therapy before initiating, and consider that some patients may require dose or interval adjustments to optimize response [^111AptKf] [^114w3CA9] [^113juP2s].

> But wait, what if omalizumab fails or is unavailable. Cyclosporine is a reasonable third-line option with good efficacy but requires blood pressure and renal monitoring; in exceptional refractory cases, case-level evidence supports agents such as danazol for cholinergic urticaria, though I need to weigh hepatic and hormonal risks carefully; emerging reports suggest dupilumab may help select refractory cholinergic cases, but I should confirm this is off-label and evidence is limited to case reports at this time [^116C6tnp] [^116oqRUb] [^113jS3iA].

> I should also consider nonpharmacologic adjuncts. Gradual, supervised heat desensitization protocols have been described for heat urticaria and may be extrapolated cautiously in select cholinergic patients, but I need to ensure safety and supervision given anaphylaxis risk; importantly, I must not confuse this with cold desensitization, which is not recommended in cold urticaria per BAD guidance, underscoring the need to match modality to phenotype [^114c2kDM] [^111FFCq9].

> Let me reconsider safety counseling and emergency preparedness. I need to ensure the patient can distinguish cholinergic urticaria from exercise-induced anaphylaxis, which mandates epinephrine autoinjector prescription and strict exercise precautions. If there is any history of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular symptoms with episodes, I should arrange supervised exercise testing and provide an action plan, as cholinergic urticaria itself can rarely be severe and even life-threatening in some cases [^111Xc34a] [^114YfbQ9] [^114tu1kQ].

> I will now examine prognosis and follow-up. Many patients improve over time, but cholinergic urticaria can persist for years. I should set expectations, track control with validated tools such as UAS7 or UCT, and reassess periodically for triggers, comorbidities, and the need to step down therapy once stable control is sustained for several months. I need to ensure we avoid unnecessary testing unless new red flags emerge [^11422N3j] [^115B7twK] [^1136tgrN].

> Final synthesis: The most likely diagnosis is cholinergic urticaria given the reproducible small wheals with large flares triggered by core temperature increases. Confirm with careful history and, if needed, supervised heat or exercise provocation while recognizing test limitations. Manage with trigger mitigation and daily second-generation antihistamines, escalate to higher doses if needed, add leukotriene antagonists or first-generation agents at bedtime for breakthrough symptoms, and proceed to omalizumab for refractory disease, reserving cyclosporine or investigational options for exceptional cases. Provide anaphylaxis education when exercise triggers are involved and reassess control regularly to guide step-down therapy [^114tu1kQ] [^111SoEKm] [^116C6tnp] [^111AptKf].

The most likely diagnosis is **cholinergic urticaria** [^notfound], a chronic inducible urticaria triggered by core body temperature rise from exercise, heat, or emotional stress [^114tu1kQ]. First-line treatment is **nonsedating H1 antihistamines** [^1142P3Hj] at standard dose, with up to fourfold updosing if needed [^113juP2s]; if refractory, add omalizumab [^111AptKf] or consider leukotriene receptor antagonists or H2 blockers [^116C6tnp]. Nonpharmacologic measures include **trigger avoidance** [^112zaYfA], gradual heat acclimation, and cooling strategies; epinephrine autoinjectors are indicated for severe reactions [^114YfbQ9]. Prognosis is variable, with spontaneous remission in some and persistence in others [^114KLjLg]; regular follow-up is essential to adjust therapy and monitor for complications [^11422N3j].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: Pinpoint (1–3 mm) wheals with large flares, often pruritic or burning, appearing within minutes of heat exposure or exertion and resolving within 30–60 minutes [^114tu1kQ] [^112Wo5B3].

- **Triggers**: Exercise, sweating, hot showers, emotional stress, and warm environments [^114tu1kQ] [^112Wo5B3].

- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical; provocation testing (e.g. exercise, hot bath, methacholine) may help but has limited negative predictive value [^111SoEKm] [^112Wo5B3].

---

## Pathophysiology

Mechanistically, **mast cell degranulation** releases histamine and other mediators in response to acetylcholine and sweat-derived factors during heat/sweating [^112Wo5B3] [^111SoEKm]. An **autoimmune component** may be present, with autoantibodies against IgE or FcεRI in some patients [^notfound].

## Treatment strategies

### Pharmacological management

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Second-generation H1 antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine) | Histamine H1 blockade | First-line; ~50% respond | Updose to 4× if needed [^113juP2s] [^115B7twK] |
| Omalizumab | Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody | Effective in refractory cases | Rapid onset; excellent safety [^111AptKf] [^115B7twK] |
| Leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast) | Leukotriene pathway inhibition | Adjunctive therapy | Limited evidence [^notfound] |
| H2 antihistamines (famotidine) | Histamine H2 blockade | Adjunctive therapy | Limited evidence [^1179SnLv] |

---

### Non-pharmacological management

- **Trigger avoidance**: Minimize heat exposure, use cooling strategies, and acclimate gradually to heat [^113K8F4J].

- **Cooling measures**: Cold packs, fans, and rapid cooling after heat exposure [^notfound].

- **Education**: Teach recognition of early symptoms and use of emergency medications [^114YfbQ9].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis is **variable**, with spontaneous remission in some and persistence in others; regular follow-up is essential to adjust therapy and monitor for complications [^113EUAYD] [^11422N3j]. Follow-up should include periodic reassessment of control, adherence, and adverse effects, with therapy stepped down once stable [^11422N3j].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

- **Trigger identification**: Keep a symptom diary to identify and avoid triggers [^112zaYfA].

- **Emergency preparedness**: Carry epinephrine autoinjectors for severe reactions [^114YfbQ9].

- **Support groups**: Consider psychological support and patient education resources [^116evQ2t].

---

Cholinergic urticaria is best managed with a **stepwise approach** — starting with second-generation H1 antihistamines and escalating to omalizumab for refractory disease — plus trigger avoidance and cooling strategies. Regular follow-up and patient education are critical to maintaining control and quality of life [^113juP2s].

### Severe refractory cholinergic urticaria treated with danazol [^116oqRUb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cholinergic urticaria is a form of physical urticaria triggered by a rise in core body temperature. Antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment; however, adequate symptom control can sometimes be difficult to maintain. Limited data suggest danazol may be an effective alternative in severe, refractory cases.

Methods and Results

We present a case of a 22-year-old male with severe, refractory cholinergic urticaria. Despite treatment with high doses of antihistamines, he continued to have symptoms that impaired his ability to function. Treatment with danazol resulted in a significant improvement in the control of his urticaria.

Discussion

Cholinergic urticaria can sometimes be severe. In cases that fail to respond to traditional forms of treatment, danazol is a viable alternative for the treatment of cholinergic urticaria. Given the potential adverse effects associated with its use, danazol should be reserved for more severe and refractory cases.

Urticaria is a heterogeneous inflammatory disorder that can be acute or chronic and is defined by the appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both. Very recently, the newest update and revision of the international European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma Clinical Immunology guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria was published. It aims to help primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. The guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations approach to developing consensus recommendations. These recommendations were then discussed in a Delphi conference that included more than 250 specialists in the field, and they are endorsed by more than 50 international societies. Here, we highlight changes from previous versions of the international urticaria guideline and their impact on clinical practice.

### An approach to the patient with urticaria [^1163gdAq]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with urticaria make up a large proportion of the referrals to allergy clinics. There are many causes of urticaria and it is the clinical history which is most important when attempting to identify potential causes; however, urticaria is very often idiopathic. In a small minority of patients urticaria may be a symptom of a serious underlying medical illness or the allergic symptoms may progress to cause systemic reactions, and it is important to identify these patients and to remember that severe urticaria is a distressing and disabling condition. This review will discuss classification, investigation and treatment of urticaria and will consider some of the more unusual types of urticaria that may be encountered in the out-patient clinic.

### Aquagenic urticaria: presentation, diagnosis and management [^112u1GjY]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Aquagenic urticaria, a rare and enigmatic form of physical urticaria, is characterised by the rapid onset of urticarial lesions on contact with water, irrespective of its temperature or source. With less than 100 cases documented in the literature, aquagenic urticaria continues to challenge clinicians and researchers due to its elusive pathophysiology and varying clinical presentations. Diagnosis relies heavily on the clinical presentation and history, complemented by provocation tests which are crucial for confirming aquagenic urticaria and distinguishing it from other types of chronic inducible urticaria. The management of aquagenic urticaria, constrained by the impracticality of water avoidance, primarily focuses on providing symptomatic relief which emphasises the need for further investigation into targeted therapeutic interventions.

Here, we present a case of aquagenic urticaria manifesting during early adolescence. This report delves into the clinical manifestations observed, explores the current understanding of the pathogenesis and reviews the diagnostic approaches and treatment modalities available aiming to enhance clinician awareness and improve patient outcomes.

Appropriate management of urticaria depends on the correct evaluation of clinical patterns and causes where these can be identified. Guidance for treatment is presented, based on the strength of evidence available at the time of preparation. As many of the recommendations relate to the off-licence use of drugs, it is particularly important that clinicians should be familiar with dosing and side-effects of treatment in the context of managing urticaria.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1179SnLv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — antihistamines — In most cases antihistamines are effective therapy, and after eliminating identifiable triggers, high-quality evidence supports antihistamines as first-line therapy. Second-generation antihistamines are designed to limit transfer across the blood-brain barrier and have less sedating effects than first-generation agents; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills and should be prescribed with caution in older adults, and higher than FDA-approved doses of some second-generation antihistamines can cause sedation. Second-generation antihistamines are effective for acute urticaria when used regularly and titrated to an effective dose in most patients, with reassuring long-term safety, even in small children; other medications with potent antihistaminic activity, such as doxepin, might have efficacy when FDA-approved antihistamines lack sufficient efficacy, and Histamine 2 blockers, in combination with H1-antihistamines, might be considered, although the evidence supporting this combination is weak.

Solar urticaria — clinical features and natural history describe rapid onset of wheals with sun exposure, generally within 1–3 minutes, with typical wheals developing within 1 to 3 minutes and a 1- to 3-hour delay reported but less typical. Symptoms usually resolve after stopping exposure, usually within 30 minutes and almost always within 24 hours, though in rare cases they can persist for more than 24 hours. It is initially present in pediatric and older adult (age > 65 years) patients, with a usual age of onset between 20 and 41 years, and retrospective studies suggest resolution in 15% to 86% of patients after 5 years of symptoms. Triggers include UVB (280–320 nm), UVA (320–400 nm), visible light (400–600 nm), and even infrared (> 600 nm) radiation.

### Chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema: clues to the mimics [^113Ym3Ep]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Urticaria and angioedema are experienced by up to 1 in 5 people, usually the result of common allergen or medication triggers and infections. Similarly, the majority of recurrent angioedema has an exogenous trigger, for example, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or is hereditary (type 1 and 2 hereditary angioedema); chronic spontaneous urticaria are most often autoimmune or autoallergic in routine clinical practice. There are, however, several skin and systemic conditions that can imitate the clinical appearance of either angioedema or urticaria, whereas there are several uncommon conditions that have chronic urticaria and/or recurrent angioedema as part of their disease manifestations. Correct diagnosis is paramount to ensuring subsequent tailored therapy for many of these conditions, and in many instances, diagnostic delay can be several years with morbid consequence. In this grand rounds article, we present 2 illustrative clinical cases as the backdrop to discussing a practical diagnostic approach for clinicians to recognize copycat phenotypes and "red flags" that should prompt further investigation of several uncommon mimics. We highlight key diagnostic features, epidemiology, and management for mimics where treatment is distinct from the common phenotypes of recurrent angioedema and chronic urticarias.

A 22-year-old woman presented with daily urticaria since infancy. Wheals were generalized, intensely pruritic, and individual lesions lasted less than 24 hours (Fig 1). She reported exacerbation by cold and windy weather and endorsed associated fevers, joint pain/stiffness, and conjunctivitis. She denied hearing loss. Her father had similar symptoms, though he had not been formally evaluated or treated. Laboratory evaluation revealed mild elevation in serum immunoglobulin E level (123 kU/L) but negative antinuclear antibody and histamine release assay. Treatments that failed included maximum recommended doses of oral antihistamines and a 9-month trial of omalizumab. At that time, prednisone had been the only effective treatment. Skin biopsy was obtained (Fig 2).

### Management of chronic spontaneous urticaria made practical: what every clinician should know [^115B7twK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its significant impact on quality of life, optimal management of chronic spontaneous urticaria remains challenging because of knowledge gaps regarding triggers, treatment response variability, and limited data for special populations. Second-generation H1-antihistamines are the first-line treatment and effective in approximately 50% of patients. For those who remain symptomatic, up-dosing up to fourfold is safe and recommended. However, prolonged ineffective antihistamine therapy should be avoided to prevent delayed disease control. In such cases, timely escalation to biologics, particularly omalizumab, is essential. Omalizumab remains the cornerstone of biologic therapy, offering rapid and sustained efficacy with an excellent safety profile. Personalized approaches involving dose escalation or interval adjustments further optimize outcomes. Cyclosporine A serves as an effective third-line option, particularly for autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria, but requires close monitoring because of dose-related adverse effects. Special considerations for children, pregnant individuals, and elderly people are discussed, reflecting the need for tailored approaches. Trigger avoidance, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may aid management, although evidence is limited for many suspected exacerbating factors. Regular assessment of disease activity and control using validated tools such as the Urticaria Activity Score and Urticaria Control Test is essential for guiding treatment decisions and monitoring response. Updated international guidelines are anticipated to address emerging therapies and current knowledge gaps.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1136tgrN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) laboratory testing — After a thorough history and physical examination, no further diagnostic testing might be appropriate; however, limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes, with targeted testing based on clinical suspicion. Extensive routine testing for exogenous and rare causes of CU or immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for inhalants or foods is not warranted, and routine laboratory testing in patients with CU whose history and physical examination lack atypical features rarely yields clinically significant findings (C). Extensive testing uncovered an otherwise undiscovered specific underlying disease process in 1.6% of cases of CU, and a more recent study found that although 17% of laboratory tests performed in 356 patients with CU were abnormal and 8.4% of patients underwent additional testing, only 1 patient had a management change leading to improvement; in 2 other reports a definite cause was found in only 5% or less. Limited testing might be justified for its 'reassurance value'; however, extensive routine testing is not favorable from a cost-benefit standpoint and does not lead to improved patient care outcomes.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — biopsy and evaluation — Although skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases, it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders, and biopsy is rarely indicated when lesions are typical of urticaria with duration < 24 hours without bruising or purpura; biopsy might be indicated when mastocytosis or urticarial vasculitis is suspected. Most often acute urticaria is self-limiting and resolves in less than 6 weeks, and extensive evaluation for causes not suggested by history or examination is not cost-effective and has not been associated with improved outcomes.

### Aquagenic urticaria: presentation, diagnosis and management [^114kiLTg]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Aquagenic urticaria, a rare form of physical urticaria, arises when water contacts the skin's dermis, irrespective of its temperature. Notably, its onset typically coincides with puberty and exhibits a higher prevalence in females. The typical clinical presentation involves the emergence of hives on the upper limbs and trunk, excluding the palms, within thirty minutes of water exposure. These hives commonly resolve between 30 and 60 min post water removal. Systemic symptoms like wheezing or dyspnoea are infrequent. To further elucidate the prevalence and characteristics of aquagenic urticaria in the paediatric population, previously reported cases of aquagenic urticaria with reported treatments and outcomes are described in table 1.

Table 1
Reported cases of paediatric aquagenic urticaria

The exact pathophysiological underpinnings of aquagenic urticaria remain unclear. Early propositions by Shelly and Rawnsley postulated an interaction between water and sebaceous glands or sebum, leading to mast cell degranulation, histamine release and resultant weal formation. Supporting this, Tkach hypothesised an increase in water's passive diffusion due to hair follicles' altered osmotic pressure, an idea further bolstered by Gallo et al, who observed urticarial occurrences post-hair extraction. Another theory posits that water-soluble epidermal antigens diffuse through the dermis, triggering histamine release. Contrarily, some researchers argue against the histamine-centric explanation, as they have noted consistent histamine levels in patients post-water exposure. Given its significant impact on patients' quality of life, the absence of a universally accepted mechanistic explanation remains problematic.

The diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria primarily relies on the patient's history of repeated urticarial reactions following water exposure, supplemented by a water provocation test. Though several methods exist for this test, the standard procedure involves application of a 35℃–37℃ water compress to the upper body for 20–30 min. The emergence of an urticarial response signifies a positive result. Aquagenic urticaria can be provoked by water at any temperature, however, using a compress at room temperature is essential to eliminate the potential overlap with cold-induced or local heat urticaria. The predominant diagnostic challenge for aquagenic urticaria is its differentiation from other physical inducible urticaria variants like cholinergic, heat, cold, pressure and exercise-induced urticaria. Hence, patients must undergo specific provocative tests tailored to these conditions (table 2).

### Evaluating chronic urticaria patients for allergies, infections, or autoimmune disorders [^1135YhGJ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common disorder affecting one-fifth of the world's population. The pathophysiology is characterized by an increased propensity for mast cell degranulation with the release of potent mediators into the dermal and subdermal tissues with resulting vasoactive, chemotactic, and inflammatory effects. The final clinical manifestation of the typical urticarial lesion is the effect of several diverse effects and causes. The general classification is acute, chronic, and physical urticaria. In general, allergenic triggers can be identified in between 60–80% of acute urticarias. Physical urticarias are characterized by the onset after the specific inciting stimulus, which can reproduce the characteristic lesion which is usually of shorter duration (with the exception of delayed pressure urticaria). Chronic idiopathic urticaria is associated with thyroid autoimmunity and, more recently, anti-mast cell receptor antibodies. An extensive work-up is usually not indicated or helpful in identifying a cause. Food or other allergens are rare causes of this type of presentation. The evaluation and work-up is dependent on clues identified by history. The treatment is removal of specific and non-specific triggers and the use of symptomatic medications generally attenuating the mediator effects.

### Cold-induced urticaria associated with type I cryoglobulinemia, successfully treated with rituximab [^114u2zYk]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cold-induced urticaria (ColdU) is a common form of chronic inducible urticaria. It is characterized by the development of wheals and, sometimes, angioedema upon skin exposure to cold air, liquids, or objects. Although considerable progress has been made over the last years in the understanding of the condition and its treatment, ColdU remains a challenging clinical problem. Patients often suffer from ColdU for years before they are diagnosed, and treatment requires a personalized approach. Similar to other forms of chronic urticaria, ColdU has a significant impact on quality of life. Here, we describe a case of severe and refractory ColdU associated with cryoglobulinemia and successfully treated with rituximab.

Cold urticaria — presentation, confirmation, and management: "Subjects with cold urticaria have pruritus and swelling with exposure of the skin to a cold stimulus", and "might have systemic reactions associated with systemic cold exposure (eg, aquatic activities)". Diagnosis "can be confirmed by applying a cold stimulus to the patient's skin and observing a wheal-and-flare reaction during rewarming of the skin". The "primary treatment for cold urticaria is avoidance of cold exposure, as feasible; however, prescribing pharmacotherapy is also frequently advisable", and "Some forms of cold urticaria might have a negative ice cube test result".

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

Cold urticaria — diagnosis and primary treatment: The diagnosis of cold urticaria can be confirmed by applying a cold stimulus (eg, an ice cube on the forearm) to the patients' skin and observing a wheal-and-flare reaction during rewarming of the skin, though it might not confirm acquired cold urticaria in up to 20% of patients. Some forms of cold urticaria might have a negative ice cube test result. The most common provocation uses a 0°C to 4°C stimulus to the volar forearm for 5 minutes with rewarming, interpreting a wheal-and-flare as positive; if negative after 5 minutes, repeat in incremental steps for up to 10 minutes, avoiding repeated application to the same site, and use 1-minute increments to determine the minimum time to induce a wheal. Hand immersion in 10°C water for 5 minutes has also been proposed as a diagnostic test. The cold stimulation time test might assist the clinician in confirming the diagnosis and determine the response of cold-induced urticaria to medications. For management, The primary treatment for cold urticaria is avoidance of cold exposure, as feasible; however, prescribing pharmacotherapy is also frequently advisable.

### Chronic urticaria [^117JkRPC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Chronic urticaria has a spectrum of clinical presentations and causes. About 50% of patients with "idiopathic" disease have histamine-releasing autoantibodies in their blood. The term autoimmune urticaria is increasingly being accepted for this subgroup of patients, in whom immunosuppressive therapies may be appropriate if conventional approaches to management are unsuccessful. This article reviews the classification, causes, and management of chronic urticaria in light of recent advances in the understanding of its etiology.

Learning Objective

At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should have up-to-date knowledge of the classification, assessment, and management of chronic urticaria and understand where the concept of autoimmune urticaria fits into existing frameworks.

### Chronic urticaria: unmet needs, emerging drugs, and new perspectives on personalised treatment [^113juP2s]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a common and debilitating mast cell-driven skin disease presenting with itchy wheals, angio-oedema, or both. Chronic urticaria is classified as spontaneous (without definite triggers) and inducible (with definite and subtype-specific triggers; eg, cold or pressure). Current management guidelines recommend step-up administration of second-generation H1-antihistamines to four-fold the approved dose, followed by omalizumab and ciclosporin. However, in many patients, chronic urticaria does not respond to this linear approach due to heterogeneous underlying mechanisms. A personalised endotype-based approach is emerging based on the identification of autoantibodies and other drivers of urticaria pathogenesis. Over the past decade, clinical trials have presented promising options for targeted treatment of chronic urticaria with the potential for disease modification, including Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-cytokine therapies, and mast cell depletion. This Therapeutics article focuses on the evidence for these novel drugs and their role in addressing an unmet need for personalised management of patients with chronic urticaria.

Cholinergic urticaria versus EIA — diagnostic differentiation — It is important to distinguish EIA from cholinergic urticaria; EIA can be confirmed by exercise challenge in a controlled environment, whereas cholinergic urticaria can be identified by both exercise challenge and passive heating. Cholinergic urticaria is characterized by punctate (1–3 mm) wheals and the urticarial lesions of EIA are typically larger. Because exercise challenge carries risk for anaphylaxis, it should be done in a setting in which personnel, equipment, and supplies required for anaphylaxis management are present. The presence of cholinergic urticaria is favored by a history of symptoms with other stimuli that increase core body temperature and by cutaneous reaction to methacholine intradermal challenge or hot-water immersion.

Chronic urticaria (CU) step‑care algorithm — treatment proceeds from Step 1 to Step 4 with defined actions and general principles. Step 1 is monotherapy with a second‑generation antihistamine with avoidance of triggers (e.g. NSAIDs) and relevant physical factors if physical urticaria/angioedema syndrome is present. Step 2 includes dose advancement of the second‑generation antihistamine used in Step 1, adding another second‑generation antihistamine, adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and adding a first‑generation antihistamine to be taken at bedtime. Step 3 is dose advancement of a potent antihistamine (e.g., hydroxyzine or doxepin) as tolerated. Step 4 adds an alternative agent such as omalizumab or cyclosporine, with other anti‑inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, or biologics as options. The figure further states to begin treatment at the step appropriate for the patient's level of severity and previous treatment history, that at each level of the step‑approach medication(s) should be assessed for patient tolerance and efficacy, and that step‑down in treatment is appropriate at any step once consistent control of urticaria/angioedema is achieved.

### Physical urticaria [^116V1ZaC]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Physical urticarias are a unique subgroup of chronic urticaria in which patients develop urticaria secondary to environmental stimuli. Common triggers include exercise, temperature changes, cold, heat, pressure, sunlight, vibration, and water. Systemic symptoms have occurred during severe episodes. Physical urticarias are responsible for approximately 20% to 30% of all cases of chronic urticaria. A basic knowledge of these unusual disorders is important for all healthcare providers. This article covers the following types of physical urticarias: dermatographism, cholinergic urticaria, local heat urticaria, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, vibratory angioedema, solar urticaria, and aquagenic urticaria.

### The diagnostic workup in chronic spontaneous urticaria-what to test and why [^111r7UA2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), the guidelines recommend very limited diagnostic procedures during the routine workup, although additional investigations might be indicated in some patients with CSU. For physicians treating patients with CSU, it is often difficult to decide which diagnostic tests are useful.

Objective

To provide recommendations on what diagnostic tests should be performed on which patients with CSU.

Methods

We performed an extensive literature search on the respective topics and identified relevant questions that should prompt diagnostic procedures based on the published evidence and expert consensus among all authors.

Results

We provide questions, diagnostic testing, where appropriate, and recommendation that should be included when assessing the history of a patient with CSU, to explore and rule out differential diagnoses, to assess patients for underlying causes and modifying conditions, to explore patients for comorbid diseases and consequences of having CSU, and to assess patients for CSU components that can help to predict their disease course and response to treatment.

Conclusions

Here, we provide physicians treating patients with CSU with information about which clues should lead to which tests and why.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^113QwphX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In spite of being an old disease and apparently easy to diagnose, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is still perceived as an uncontrollable and difficult to manage disease. The perception of the patient is that his/her condition is not well understood and that is suffering from a disorder with hidden causes that doctors are not able to tackle. Sometimes patients go through a number of clinicians until they found some CSU expert who is familiar with the disease. It is surprising that myths and believes with no scientific support still persist. Guidelines are not widely implemented, and recent tools to assess severity are infrequently used. European and American recent guidelines do not agree in several key points related to diagnosis and treatment, which further contributes to confusion. With the aim to clarify some aspects of the CSU picture, a group of allergists and dermatologists from the Spanish Dermatology and Allergy societies developed a Frequent Asked Questions leaflet that could facilitate physicians work in daily practice and contribute to a better knowledge of common clinical scenarios related to patients with CSU.

Summary Statement 85 states "A number of alternative therapies have been studied for the treatment of CU; these therapies merit consideration for patients with refractory CU". The text notes that "as many as 50% of these patients might not achieve satisfactory control with antihistamine therapy", and alternatives are evaluated "to reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids". Summary Statement 86 adds that anti-inflammatory agents "including dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine, have limited evidence for efficacy… and some require laboratory monitoring for adverse effects", yet "are generally well tolerated, might be efficacious in properly selected patients, and can be considered for treatment of patients with antihistamine-refractory CU".

### Current approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of systemic mastocytosis [^113cXFF7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical manifestations of mastocytosis and examine the recommended diagnostic procedures and therapeutic options available for the treatment of this condition.

Data Sources

PubMed searches were performed for articles published regarding presentation and classification of mastocytosis and the diagnostic criteria and treatment options for this condition using the keywords mastocytosis, clinical features, World Health Organization diagnostic criteria, management, pathogenesis, and urticaria pigmentosa. Retrieved articles were surveyed for additional citations.

Study Selection

Articles were reviewed for relevance to the study objectives, and more recent articles were preferentially included. Prospective studies were preferentially included when available.

Results

Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous disorder that results from clonal mast cell proliferation. Symptoms are typically limited to the skin in the pediatric population, requiring only symptomatic treatment with spontaneous resolution by puberty. Disease course in adults ranges from minimally symptomatic in most to highly aggressive but tends to be persistent. Symptoms can be protean and nonspecific. The mainstay of treatment consists of avoidance of triggers of mast cell degranulation and symptom-based therapy.

Conclusions

Mastocytosis should be suspected in patients who present with a constellation of symptoms, including flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, unexplained syncope, and classic urticaria pigmentosa lesions. Diagnosis should be established by a bone marrow biopsy in all adults. Staging should be performed to assess disease burden and evidence of end-stage organ damage. Patients should be offered symptom-based treatment and cytoreductive therapy only for aggressive systemic mastocytosis or an associated hematologic malignant neoplasm.

### Aquagenic urticaria: presentation, diagnosis and management [^1119LCjV]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Aquagenic urticaria, a rare dermatological condition characterised by urticarial eruptions following water contact, poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This condition, although uncommon, necessitates heightened clinical awareness due to its substantial impact on the patient's quality of life. We present a comprehensive account of a paediatric case involving a girl in her mid-teens, who developed recurrent wheals post-exposure to water, independent of its temperature or source. Diagnosis hinged on a detailed clinical history and a definitive water provocation test, with routine laboratory assessments yielding no contributory findings. The therapeutic regimen featuring cetirizine yielded significant symptomatic relief. Although antihistamines are the cornerstone of treatment, the differential response among individuals necessitates an individualised approach, considering adjunctive treatments such as omalizumab and ultraviolet therapy. This case reinforces the critical role of clinical acumen in the recognition and diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria and calls for further research into its pathophysiology to refine treatment strategies.

After no response to antihistamines, he was started on dupilumab and achieved complete resolution of these episodes within four months. To our knowledge, dupilumab has not previously been reported as an off-label treatment for pediatric CholU, highlighting the need for further studies.

### Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach [^113qfUoj]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria (i.e., pruritic, raised wheals) and angioedema (i.e., deep mucocutaneous swelling) occur in up to 25 percent of the U.S. population. Vasoactive mediators released from mast cells and basophils produce the classic wheal and flare reaction. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially if symptoms are chronic or minimally responsive to therapy. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and methodical investigation are necessary to uncover diagnostic clues. Although serious medical illness can occur concurrently with chronic urticaria, acute urticaria generally is benign and self-limited. The mainstay of therapy for urticaria is avoidance of known triggering agents, judicious use of oral corticosteroids, and treatment with long-acting second-generation antihistamines, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory leukotriene antagonists. Consultation for investigative therapy may be necessary if symptoms continue despite a stepwise approach to diagnosis and therapy.

### Heat urticaria: a revision of published cases with an update on classification and management [^114c2kDM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Heat urticaria (HU) is a rare type of physical inducible urticaria, characterized by itchy erythema and well-demarcated weals appearing soon after heat exposure. Most cases occur in female patients aged 20–45 years. Both localized and generalized forms exist, depending on the limitation of the reaction to the skin area directly exposed to the physical stimulus or the involvement of distant sites, respectively. In most cases, HU is an immediate reaction, but delayed forms (mostly familial) have been described. HU is a long-lasting disease with overall duration at diagnosis of approximately 2 years. In about half of cases it is associated with systemic symptoms such as weakness, wheezing, headache, flushing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, tachycardia, even dyspnoea or syncope. The main differential diagnosis includes cholinergic urticaria, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and solar urticaria. The diagnosis of HU is established by provocation testing, which is also helpful to evaluate the critical temperature threshold. The mean threshold temperature is about 44 °C. A heat desensitization programme can be an effective treatment. Nonsedating H1 antihistamines administered at licensed doses are the mainstay of symptomatic therapy in nearly 60% of patients, but full symptom relief is achieved in only a minority of them. Omalizumab has proven effective in recent case reports.

### Cold urticaria syndromes: diagnosis and management [^114pLXCF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Cold urticaria is a chronic condition causing episodic symptoms of cold-induced wheals or angioedema in response to direct or indirect exposure to cold temperatures. Whereas symptoms of cold urticaria are typically benign and self-limiting, severe systemic anaphylactic reactions are possible. Acquired, atypical, and hereditary forms have been described, each with variable triggers, symptoms, and responses to therapy. Clinical testing, including response to cold stimulation, helps define disease subtypes. More recently, monogenic disorders characterized by atypical forms of cold urticaria have been described. Here, we review the different forms of cold-induced urticaria and related syndromes and propose a diagnostic algorithm to aid clinicians in making a timely diagnosis for the appropriate management of these patients.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria is a rare but significantly life-altering skin disease. Recent developments in immunology have promoted our understanding of its autoimmune pathology, but treatment options have not yet developed at the same pace. When antihistamines aren't sufficient, the next steps for treatment have less evidence for support. Fortunately, a Phase III clinical trial has shown that the monoclonal antibody omalizumab, approved for use in asthma, can reduce symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria when added to maximal doses of H1-antihistamines. Therapeutic options for chronic idiopathic urticaria are reviewed.

### Treatment of severely recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria: a discussion of relevant issues [^117LNQXP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common disorder with a prevalence of 1% that is characterized by recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both. CSU is self-limited but in many patients symptoms recur for several years and can be refractory to standard therapies. In this review, we present an illustrative case of a female patient with CSU who, despite taking 15 antihistamines a day in addition to a number of second-line therapies, continued to be refractory to treatment. However, once we initiated subcutaneous treatment with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, she experienced rapid relief of her CSU symptoms. Through this case, we present a review of the relevant issues, including the efficacy of laboratory tests to identify the cause of a patient's CSU, the association between CSU and thyroid disease and its relevance to treatment options, the recommendation to increase antihistamine dose up to fourfold and possible adverse events associated with this treatment option. We also include a discussion of the use of second-line therapies as well as omalizumab in refractory CSU patients.

### Urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^114KLjLg]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria involves intensely pruritic, raised wheals, with or without edema of the deeper cutis. It is usually a self-limited, benign reaction, but can be chronic. Rarely, it may represent serious systemic disease or a life-threatening allergic reaction. Urticaria has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 20 percent in the general population. It is caused by immunoglobulin E- and nonimmunoglobulin E-mediated mast cell and basophil release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Diagnosis is made clinically. Chronic urticaria is usually idiopathic and requires only a simple laboratory workup unless elements of the history or physical examination suggest specific underlying conditions. Treatment includes avoidance of triggers, although these can be identified in only 10 to 20 percent of patients with chronic urticaria. First-line pharmacotherapy for acute and chronic urticaria is nonsedating second-generation antihistamines (histamine H1 blockers), which can be titrated to larger than standard doses. First-generation antihistamines, histamine H2 blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and brief corticosteroid bursts may be used as adjunctive treatment. More than one-half of patients with chronic urticaria will have resolution or improvement of symptoms within one year.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^112QZrpZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Unmet Needs, Knowledge Gaps, Future Studies

As outlined above, there are many unmet needs and knowledge gaps when it comes to the discontinuation of CSU treatment. Further studies are needed to obtain the evidence required to guide step-down decisions. Most importantly, we need to identify markers of spontaneous remission of CSU in patients with complete response to prophylactic treatment. In addition, we need to better characterize the benefits and challenges of stopping treatment all at once or by tapering, and the reasons for choosing either strategy. As the evidence and experience increase on when and how to discontinue CSU treatment, step-down recommendations should be included in future updates and revisions of the international urticaria guideline.

### A systematic review of aquagenic urticaria-subgroups and treatment options [^116nwPoe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aquagenic urticaria (AquaU) is a rare variant of chronic inducible urticaria where wheals occur after skin contact with water. Information on clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes is limited, which makes the management of AquaU challenging.

Objective

To systematically review disease features and relevant triggers of AquaU and patients' response to treatment.

Methods

Related articles were searched by use of the terms "aquagenic urticaria" and "aquagenic angioedema" until June 2021 and reviewed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations.

Results

A total of 77 patients with AquaU were investigated in 59 studies including 47 case reports and 12 case series. AquaU predominantly presented in women (47 patients, 61%), and the mean age of onset of the disease was 19.6 ± 10.8 years (range: 0–54 years). Wheals commonly occurred in localized areas and regardless of the water temperature. Based on the reviewed evidence, AquaU can be classified as familial AquaU (FAquaU, 18.2%) and acquired AquaU (AAquaU, 81.8%). Although many treatments were used in both subtypes of AquaU, the use of second-generation H 1 antihistamines (2 nd AH 1) was reported most often to achieve marked improvement in both subtypes. The use of topical therapies in AquaU, which most commonly use hydrophobic vehicles, is poorly documented and of controversial efficiency.

Conclusions

AquaU is proposed to be classified into 2 subtypes, FAquaU and the more common AAquaU. Treatment with a 2 nd AH 1 is recommended as the first-line treatment for both types of AquaU. Further studies are required to fill knowledge gaps.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112xXbHJ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute urticaria:

- Definition: Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition characterized by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals or hives.
- Pathophysiology: Acute urticaria is caused by mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to characteristic skin lesions. The activation of these cells can occur through multiple triggers, including IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of acute urticaria in the United Kingdom is estimated at 355 per 100,000 population.
- Disease course: Clinically, acute urticaria presents as itchy, raised welts that can appear anywhere on the body. These hives are transient, often moving from one area of the body to another. In some cases, acute urticarial lesions may display central clearing with an ecchymotic or hemorrhagic hue.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of acute urticaria is generally good, as it is typically a self-limiting condition that resolves within 6 weeks.

### Subtypes of atypical cold urticaria and recommendations for their diagnostic workup [^114hX2mb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A substantial subset of patients suffering from cold urticaria (ColdU) have atypical disease presentations and develop cold-induced wheals and/or angioedema in a real world setting but not in response to standard cold stimulation tests (CSTs). How to diagnose atypical ColdU is largely unclear, and little is known about the clinical features and treatment responses.

Objective

The aim of the study was to describe subtypes of atypical ColdU and provide recommendations for the diagnostic workup.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive literature search on subtypes of atypical ColdU and published testing procedures. We then developed and pilot-tested modified cold stimulation tests (mCSTs) for 8 subtypes of atypical ColdU.

Results

Our systematic review identified 10 subtypes of atypical ColdU, i.e. delayed ColdU, ColdU with aberrant wheals, extended exposure ColdU, generalized exposure ColdU, localized ColdU, cold-induced cholinergic urticaria, cold-dependent dermographism, water-dependent ColdU, food-dependent ColdU and ultra-freeze ColdU. Pilot-testing of protocols for diagnostic mCSTs was successful in 8 of 8 variants. Based on these results, we generated recommendations for the diagnostic workup of known subtypes of atypical ColdU.

Conclusion

mCSTs provide a more precise diagnostic confirmation in patients with suspected atypical ColdU, allow effective monitoring throughout the disease course, facilitating access to specific therapy options, and ultimately leading to improved care for this patient population.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113kSR6E]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Summary Statement 13 — chronic urticaria (CU) evaluation: Evaluation should consider various possible causes, although most cases lack an identifiable cause. IgE-mediated reactions may rarely cause CU from foods, drugs, or other allergens, and non–IgE-mediated mast cell mediator release (for example with aspirin or other NSAIDs) can also cause CU. Chronic infections have been reported, but there are no convincing data implicating occult infections such as H pylori, chronic sinusitis, and cutaneous fungal infections. CU triggered exclusively by specific physical causes (eg, heat, cold, pressure, vibration) is considered a distinct entity.

### Cold urticaria-what we know and what we do not know [^116AjKw3]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Cold urticaria (ColdU) is a common form of chronic inducible urticaria characterized by the development of wheals, angioedema or both in response to cold exposure. Recent research and guideline updates have advanced our understanding and management of ColdU. Today, its pathophysiology is thought to involve the cold-induced formation of autoallergens and IgE to these autoallergens, which provoke a release of proinflammatory mediators from skin mast cells. The classification of ColdU includes typical and atypical subtypes. We know that cold-induced wheals usually develop on rewarming and resolve within an hour and that anaphylaxis can occur. The diagnosis relies on the patient's history and cold stimulation testing. Additional diagnostic work-up, including a search for underlying infections, should only be done if indicated by the patient's history. The management of ColdU includes cold avoidance, the regular use of nonsedating antihistamines and the off-label use of omalizumab. However, many questions regarding ColdU remain unanswered. Here, we review what is known about ColdU, and we present important unanswered questions on the epidemiology, underlying pathomechanisms, clinical heterogeneity and treatment outcomes. Our aim is to guide future efforts that will close these knowledge gaps and advance the management of ColdU.

Acquired cold urticaria (ACU) is a frequent subtype of physical urticaria that is caused by the release of proinflammatory mast cell mediators after cold exposure. Although the underlying causes of ACU still remain to be clarified in detail, a wide range of diseases has been reported to be associated with ACU. This review gives an overview of the clinical picture, the differential diagnoses, diagnostic tests and the aetiology of ACU, and summarizes current and novel therapeutic options based on the current literature.

### Chronic urticaria and angioedema: masqueraders and misdiagnoses [^114dcFNb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a common condition presenting with intensely pruritic wheals. Although individual lesions resolve within 24 hours, by definition, chronic urticaria lasts for a duration of at least 6 weeks. Both spontaneous and inducible forms exist. In the spontaneous variant, chronic urticaria occurs in the absence of clearly identifiable triggers. In chronic inducible urticaria, specific triggers may include dermatographism, cholinergic (heat), cold, exercise, delayed pressure, and solar. Extensive laboratory evaluation for chronic spontaneous urticaria is not required unless indicated by clinical history or physical examination. Angioedema describes sudden onset of localized edema involving the deep layers of the skin and submucosal tissues. It can be seen in isolation or in conjunction with chronic urticaria. Angioedema typically resolves slower than wheals, taking up to 72 hours or longer. Histamine- and bradykinin-mediated forms exist. Both chronic urticaria and angioedema have many mimics, and a broad range of differential diagnoses should be considered. Importantly, an incorrect diagnosis may have significant implications for the additional investigation, treatment, and prognosis of the affected patient. The aim of this article is to discuss the characteristics of chronic urticaria and angioedema, and an approach to the investigation and diagnosis of their mimics.

### How to approach chronic inducible urticaria [^1132rwbh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) is a group of chronic urticarias characterized by the appearance of recurrent wheals, recurrent angioedema or both, as a response to specific triggers. CIndU includes both physical (symptomatic dermographism, cold and heat urticaria, delayed pressure urticaria, solar urticaria, and vibratory urticaria) and nonphysical urticarias (cholinergic urticaria, contact and aquagenic urticaria). Here, we review the different forms of CIndU with an emphasis on symptomatic dermographism, cold urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, and delayed pressure urticaria. We discuss the clinical features, the diagnostic workup including provocation and threshold testing, and available treatment options.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111SoEKm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cholinergic urticaria — diagnostic testing includes physiologic and pharmacologic provocation with important limitations. Summary Statement 38: Provocative challenges that increase core body temperature, such as exercise and hot water immersion, or methacholine intradermal challenge have been considered for the diagnosis of cholinergic urticaria; however, the negative predictive value of these tests is not optimal, and lack of response cannot rule out the diagnosis. (D) Intradermal injection of 0.01 mg of methacholine in 0.1 mL of saline can elicit 1 or more "satellite wheals", but as few as 1 in 3 patients show this positive response and not consistently; thus methacholine challenge might confirm but cannot rule out the diagnosis. Provocative challenges that increase core temperature may offer better sensitivity, and partial immersion in a hot bath (42°C) to raise body temperature by 0.7°C or greater has been recommended.

### Aquagenic urticaria: presentation, diagnosis and management [^1139iuZ7]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Table 2
Common differential diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria and associated diagnostic evaluation tests

Given its ambiguous pathogenesis, treatment options for aquagenic urticaria remain limited and often yield varied results. Non-sedating, second-generation H1 antihistamines are commonly the primary line of treatment, with some patients requiring doses up to four times the typical daily amount. Yet, the response to this regimen can differ significantly from one individual to another. In cases where standard treatments are ineffective, ultraviolet (UV) monotherapy or UV combined with antihistamines, has demonstrated some efficacy. It is postulated that the UV therapy leads to an enhanced thickness of the epidermis, potentially inhibiting water from penetrating and interacting further within the epidermal environment. Alternative therapeutic measures encompass the use of topical barrier creams and acetylcholine antagonists. Notably, there have also been recent accounts of aquagenic urticaria being successfully managed with omalizumab.

Aquagenic urticaria, though rare, presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians due to its unique water-induced aetiology. Detailed patient history, thorough physical examinations and water provocation tests are invaluable tools in establishing a definitive diagnosis. While the pathogenesis remains enigmatic, the efficacy of treatments such as second-generation H1 antihistamines underscores the strides made in managing this condition. Continued research is vital to deepen our understanding and enhance therapeutic strategies, ensuring the best possible patient outcomes.

Learning points

Aquagenic urticaria, although a rare dermatological condition, demands heightened clinical awareness due to its significant impact on patient quality of life, particularly during sensitive developmental periods such as adolescence. Clinicians should consider aquagenic urticaria in the differential diagnosis when patients present with recurrent urticarial lesions triggered by water exposure.
The diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria relies on a detailed clinical history, ruling out other forms of inducible urticaria and the implementation of water provocation test to assess the skin for an urticarial reaction secondary to water exposure.
The management of aquagenic urticaria should be individualised, considering the variability in response to treatments. While non-sedating, second-generation H1 antihistamines are the cornerstone of treatment, some patients may require higher doses or adjunctive therapies.
Continued research and clinical documentation of aquagenic urticaria cases are essential to unravel its pathophysiology and develop more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

### How to manage chronic urticaria' beyond' guidelines: a practical algorithm [^111kvJmx]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a disease characterized by pruritic weals, angio-oedema or both occurring for at least 6 weeks. It encompasses spontaneous and inducible urticarias. The national and international guidelines outline the principles of treatment. Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody, has transformed the management of many severe and treatment-refractory patients. However, current UK guidance on its use does not address the needs of those with less severe disease, inducible urticarias, idiopathic histaminergic angio-oedema without weals as a presentation of CU and omalizumab non-responders. Our algorithm and a summary of the evidence to support its principles offers guidance and a more systematic targeted approach to using a range of 'off-label' agents for specific phenotypes of CU. It will be of use when guideline-recommended mast cell mediator antagonists fail to control symptoms and/or using omalizumab is ineffective, not practical or unfunded.

### The urticaria spectrum: recognition of clinical patterns can help management [^1172t6Qk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria has diverse clinical presentations and causes. The implication of classifying urticaria primarily by clinical presentation rather than aetiology is that management can be focused on specific clinical problems without extensive investigations. Management pathways may involve nonpharmacological measures and drug interventions, which can be grouped into first-, second- and third-line therapies. Stronger, but potentially more risky, second- and third-line approaches may be justified for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy with antihistamines even though it may not be possible to define a specific aetiology, such as autoimmune urticaria, with confidence.

### An approach to the hospitalized patient with urticaria and fever [^112ws4A1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common skin disorder with a long differential diagnosis. Most cases are readily treated symptomatically and have no systemic implications. However, a number of diseases and syndromes, including vasculitides, immunologic disorders, infectious diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes, can present with urticaria and systemic symptoms, which may lead to hospitalization of the patient. These urticarial syndromes are important to recognize as they often have significant health implications. A comprehensive history and physical exam is important in distinguishing cases of simple urticaria from these syndromes. The presence of atypical wheals, systemic symptoms such as fever or arthralgia, and a lack of response to antihistamine therapy are important diagnostic clues that should prompt further workup.

### Physical urticaria: clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, and management [^116V24GG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical urticaria is a type of urticaria in which recurrent wheals and/or angioedema occur following exposure of the skin to a physical stimulus. It is classified according to its triggers, which may be mechanical (friction, pressure, and vibration), thermal (cold and heat), or solar electromagnetic radiation. Symptoms of different physical urticarias can develop following specific activities that expose patients to an eliciting stimulus and may be variably accompanied by mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms, including nausea, headache, or even anaphylaxis. Differentiation of physical urticaria from other chronic urticarias requires careful clinical assessment and confirmatory provocation testing, which in turn can inform appropriate management. This clinical review provides an evidence-based summary of the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, and management of physical urticaria.

### Chronic inducible urticaria: a systematic review of treatment options [^114TN3eP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic inducible urticaria (CindU) is a condition characterized by the appearance of recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both as a response to specific and reproducible triggers.

Objective

We sought to systematically assess evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options for CindU. Results were used to inform the 2017 update of "The EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis and management of urticaria".

Methods

Randomized controlled trials and controlled intervention studies were searched systematically in various databases. Included studies were evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Where possible, results from single studies were meta-analyzed, applying the Mantel-Haenszel approach by using a random-effects model (Der Simonian-Laird).

Results

We identified 30 studies that included patients with cold urticaria, symptomatic dermographism, delayed-pressure urticaria, or cholinergic urticaria. No studies on other forms of CindU were eligible. Risk of bias was often rated as unclear or high. Overall, second-generation antihistamines were more effective than placebo, and available data indicate that updosing might be effective. Omalizumab proved effective in patients with symptomatic dermographism, who did not respond to antihistamines. Detailed results are given for each type of CindU.

Conclusions

The available evidence is limited by small samples, heterogeneous efficacy outcomes, and poor reporting quality in many of the included studies. The findings are congruent with the suggested stepwise approach to treating CindUs. However, the data do not allow for drawing specific conclusions for specific subtypes of CindU.

### Potential therapeutic approaches for chronic urticaria: beyond H1-antihistamines and biologics [^112wcu4p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a disease that can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and ability to function. There are effective treatment options, such as nonsedating antihistamines or biologics, but some patients do not respond to these therapies, or the therapies are not available or affordable to all patients. This review aims to summarize potential treatment strategies for patients (1) who do not respond to antihistamines and (2) cannot readily access or do not respond to biologics. The review emphasizes the importance of sound clinical practice, including correct diagnosis of chronic urticaria phenotypes, treatment of associated comorbidities, and consideration of add-on pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Although some treatments may lack high-quality evidence, they may still be justifiable in certain cases, provided that there is shared decision-making, regular reassessment, and early recognition of adverse events.

Limitations

This review has several limitations. First, this is not a systematic review, and some studies were not included. Second, the proposed algorithm is based on the expert opinion of the coauthors of this review and available literature, primarily case reports and case series. Furthermore, few publications specified the treatment of children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and other vulnerable patients. The treatment algorithm should be adjusted to meet the needs of these populations. Last, drug combinations were used in many studies, making the identification of individual drug efficacy difficult.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^1175aLkj]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

Due to the lack of knowledge of the physiopathological CSU mechanisms, a plethora of causative theories and alternative therapies have always emerged. CSU landscape has greatly changed. We now have much better tools to assess severity and quality of life. More importantly at the present time, we could offer a real hope to control symptoms to these desperate patients. For that reason, it is very important to provide physicians with updated knowledge. Delivering clear and simple recommendations on when and how apply these new tools and treatments also reinforces good clinical practice that in turn will greatly improve patients' life and healthcare performance. It is quite discouraging to observe differences between the American and European CSU diagnosis and treatment approaches. Both sides have points to make and each of them has strengths and weaknesses. We tried to offer a FAQ (Frequent Asked Questions) section for the physician who approaches a CSU patient. Our main point would be to take into consideration the recent existence of a very effective treatment and not to continue offering outdated treatment options.

### Evidence-based evaluation and management of chronic urticaria in children [^111VmA5u]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria affects nearly 25% of the population at some time in their lives. In a subset of children, urticaria will develop into a chronic condition that can greatly affect quality of life. Although numerous causes and triggers are proposed for chronic urticaria (CU) in children, ranging from infections, allergens, and medications to physical factors and autoimmune disease, the exact etiology is not always identifiable. Accordingly, a large subset of cases are designated "chronic idiopathic urticaria". Because of the clinical complexities of CU, as well as the confusing literature on this topic, we have developed a conceptual framework based on the cumulative evidence to assist with the categorization, clinical evaluation, and treatment of CU in children.

### An overview of chronic urticaria [^113EUAYD]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Acknowledging urticaria as a symptom of mast cell degranulation is stressed. The biology of the mast cell, and the recognized immunologic and non-immunologic mast cell secretagogues are individually discussed along with mechanisms of activation and mediators released. The major, preformed mediator histamine in the skin produces a prototypic, short-lived urticaria, however, the clinical spectrum and pattern of "hives" indicate that other mediators contribute to the polymorphism and variable behavior of this symptom. The clinical assessment is almost exclusively restricted to the history and physical examination. Features to review and examine are presented. The cause of "acute" urticaria is identifiable (by history) in the majority of patients, and except for hives that accompany an anaphylactic reaction, these patients rarely present to the physician for care. The persistent, or "chronic" hiver whose history cannot elicit a cause, is rarely triggered by an individual trigger, despite extensive professional evaluation. Evidence to support changing the chronological, "acute" and "chronic" classification of urticaria to "identifiable" and "non-identifiable" triggered urticaria is discussed, as is the futility of extensive, costly laboratory work-ups. The natural history of urticaria reveals that management should be directed toward allowing the patient to maintain an acceptable quality of life (with or without some urticaria), until the episode resolves.

Methods

We constituted a national working group of allergists and dermatologist that have a specialized clinic dedicated to CSU. We met during 2012–2013 every 2 months to discuss the outcomes of each stage of the review and set the next step to take. We first generated a list of issues that emerge when approaching a patient suffering from CSU. From this list, we generated a list of specific questions that address each point. We then distributed the questions, that were distributed previously in the meetings, among the participants and worked remotely on each answer. Frequently asked questions with direct clinical relevance were chosen by the authors. Answers to these questions and summaries of key points were agreed upon by consensus. The questions were numbered and grouped into sections related to diagnosis, clinical evaluation and follow-up, as well as treatment and management in special cases.

A review of the literature on chronic urticaria (from January 1st, 2009, up to December 1st, 2013) was performed by an independent documentalist using the MEDLINE database through a PubMed search. The search strategy included retrieval of documents with the following words included in the 'Title' field: 'urticaria', 'idiopathic', 'chronic', 'diagnosis', 'prognosis', 'assessment', 'duration', 'severity', 'quality of life', 'treatment', 'management' and 'omalizumab'. The search was performed using these terms separately or combined to explore all possibilities. Additionally, publications included in the field 'Related citations in PubMed' appearing together with the Abstract of retrieved citations were reviewed. Other filters included 'review' for the category of article type and 'full text available' and 'free full text available' for the category of text availability. In all cases, the title and abstract of the articles were carefully read, and suitable articles were selected based on the study content. The references of retrieved documents were also checked for articles of interest. A final list of articles with the corresponding abstracts and the full text were distributed to the authors. This information and documents from their own files were used as a scientific background for the review.
