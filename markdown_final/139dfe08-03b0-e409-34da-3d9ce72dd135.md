## Question

Early detection of hepatic encephalopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about early detection of hepatic encephalopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and why early detection matters. Then, I should classify the spectrum of HE and the diagnostic gold standards. Next, I will appraise screening and diagnostic tools for overt HE, followed by covert and minimal HE. After that, I need to consider special populations and contexts, including acute liver failure, TIPS, and older adults with cognitive symptoms. Finally, I will integrate a pragmatic, stepwise algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and future directions, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its significance. Hepatic encephalopathy spans from minimal deficits detectable only by testing to coma, is common in cirrhosis, and carries substantial morbidity, mortality, and quality-of-life impact; early recognition alters management and prognosis, so I need to ensure my approach aligns with guideline-based priorities for timely detection and treatment initiation [^3a67b4d8] [^4104df64].

> I will now examine the classification framework to anchor detection targets. Overt HE is clinically evident and graded by West Haven criteria, with disorientation and asterixis as reliable markers; covert HE includes minimal HE plus grade 1 HE, where subtle deficits are present but not overt; this distinction guides both screening intensity and the tools I should select in practice [^ba771847] [^5d9e06aa].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic gold standards and their limitations. For overt HE, diagnosis is clinical and a diagnosis of exclusion, with West Haven criteria and careful exclusion of alternative etiologies; for covert/minimal HE, psychometric testing such as PHES is considered a reference standard, though no single test is perfect and inter-test correlation is modest, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting isolated results [^8a5fb4ed] [^12b4510f] [^74931712].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening tools for overt HE. I initially thought structured instruments like HESA might be broadly required, but wait, let me verify guideline positions; AASLD/EASL endorse clinical diagnosis for overt HE, with HESA and similar algorithms used primarily in research or when a standardized approach is desired, so I should correct that overstatement and frame HESA as optional rather than mandatory in routine care [^8a5fb4ed] [^39a41352].

> For covert and minimal HE, I need to check which tools have the best validation and feasibility. PHES remains a widely used reference, but EncephalApp Stroop shows strong diagnostic performance and can be completed in about 10 minutes; a shortened QuickStroop version achieves comparable accuracy in under 1 minute, which is highly actionable in clinic; EEG and CFF are sensitive but constrained by availability and operator dependence, so I should match the test to the setting and question at hand [^74931712] [^17bfc8e1] [^84895769] [^9a6d710d].

> Let me consider the role of ammonia, because I need to ensure I do not overuse it. Elevated ammonia supports the pathophysiology but does not diagnose HE, and a normal ammonia in a patient with suspected HE should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis; moreover, preanalytical pitfalls are common, so I should reserve ammonia for cases with diagnostic uncertainty rather than routine screening [^9c210ca2] [^a2338d78] [^5f43aa55].

> I should double-check neuroimaging indications. Brain CT or MRI does not prove HE, but imaging is recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain, in first episodes, or when there is nonresponse to therapy, to exclude structural lesions or alternative causes; this is especially important in acute settings or when focal deficits are present [^c4e530aa] [^67a1056a].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In acute liver failure, encephalopathy is a defining feature and warrants intensive monitoring at the first sign of mental status change, with early transplant referral; after TIPS, HE risk is higher and surveillance should be proactive; in older adults with cognitive decline, undiagnosed cirrhosis and HE may masquerade as dementia, so using FIB-4 to screen for liver disease can uncover reversible contributors to cognitive impairment [^2d842a2a] [^696b8325] [^b9bd902a] [^15ed2080].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, stepwise algorithm and verify alignment with guidelines. First, screen all patients with cirrhosis periodically for overt HE using clinical assessment and West Haven grading, and maintain a low threshold to evaluate for covert HE in those with impaired quality of life, employment or safety concerns, or prior HE; second, if covert HE is suspected, use PHES or EncephalApp/QuickStroop where available, recognizing that two complementary modalities may be needed in research or equivocal cases; third, exclude alternative causes of neuropsychiatric impairment and consider ammonia only when the diagnosis is uncertain; fourth, initiate evidence-based therapy when HE is diagnosed, including lactulose for overt HE and secondary prophylaxis, with rifaximin add-on for recurrence, and consider treating covert HE when it impacts function or safety [^a0369d90] [^74931712] [^0abc842a] [^77a1b032] [^0d709aad] [^97da4ec7].

> But wait, what about evidence gaps and future directions. I need to ensure I acknowledge that current tools have limited standardization, normative data vary by region and language, and we lack robust, prospective data linking early detection to hard outcomes like transplant-free survival; digital and machine-learning approaches may refine detection, and efforts to harmonize PHES, validate shortened Stroop protocols, and integrate multimodal biomarkers are critical next steps [^1f0a8c5a] [^c996cede] [^84895769].

> In summary, early detection of hepatic encephalopathy hinges on structured clinical assessment for overt disease and targeted use of validated psychometric or neurophysiological tools for covert disease, with ammonia and imaging deployed selectively; aligning with guideline-based, risk-stratified screening and promptly initiating therapy when detected are the key levers to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence [^8a5fb4ed] [^a0369d90] [^9a86e06b].

Early detection of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) relies on **routine cognitive screening** in cirrhosis using validated tools (PHES, EncephalApp/Stroop, ICT) [^a0369d90] [^17bfc8e1] [^26bb8607] to identify minimal/covert HE, as these predict overt HE and poor outcomes [^0a189c17] [^87ed9cbe]. Clinical vigilance for subtle changes — sleep disturbance, attention deficits, and asterixis — is essential, especially in high-risk patients (TIPS, prior HE, infection, GI bleeding) [^b9bd902a] [^f24e5f5a]. Ammonia is not diagnostic but helps when the diagnosis is uncertain; **normal ammonia lowers the likelihood of HE** [^a2338d78] [^6a6dbffc]. Early detection enables timely treatment of precipitants and initiation of lactulose/rifaximin, reducing recurrence and improving quality of life [^10bb76f8] [^0d709aad] [^77a1b032].

---

## Clinical spectrum and importance of early detection

HE spans minimal HE (MHE) — subclinical deficits detected only by testing — to overt HE with disorientation, confusion, or coma [^3a67b4d8]. MHE/CHE are common (up to 80% in some cohorts) and strongly predict overt HE, falls, impaired driving, and reduced quality of life [^0ebfe5bd] [^87ed9cbe]. Early detection allows intervention before overt HE, improving outcomes and reducing healthcare use [^77a1b032].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms of early HE

Early HE presents with **nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms**; clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in cirrhosis:

- **Sleep disturbances**: inversion of sleep-wake cycle, daytime sleepiness.
- **Cognitive impairment**: subtle attention deficits, memory problems, slowed processing.
- **Personality changes**: irritability, apathy, disinhibition.
- **Neuromuscular signs**: asterixis (flapping tremor), constructional apraxia, ataxia.

These features are often missed without structured assessment, especially in **grade 1 HE** [^a60c9847].

---

## Diagnostic tools and methods for early detection

Several **validated tools** are available for early HE detection:

| **Diagnostic tool** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) | Battery of five paper-pencil tests (NCT-A/B, DST, line tracing, serial dotting) | Gold standard for MHE; widely used; age/education adjusted norms [^74931712] [^68b85f7b] |
| EncephalApp (Stroop) | Smartphone app measuring reaction times in "off" and "on" states | High sensitivity/specificity; quick (< 1 min with QuickStroop); validated against PHES [^17bfc8e1] [^84895769] |
| Inhibitory Control Test (ICT) | Computerized test of inhibitory control | Simple, reliable, correlates with PHES; suitable for clinic use [^26bb8607] [^dfee621e] |
| Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) | Frequency at which fused light appears to flicker | Objective; less affected by age/education; requires equipment [^78697916] [^74931712] |
| Electroencephalography (EEG) | Measures cortical activity; detects slowing | Objective but nonspecific; limited availability [^9a6d710d] |

---

## Role of serum ammonia levels

Serum ammonia is central to HE pathophysiology but is **not diagnostic**; levels correlate poorly with severity and are influenced by collection and assay factors [^9c210ca2] [^5f43aa55]. However, a normal ammonia level in a patient with suspected HE should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses, whereas a clearly elevated level supports HE in the right clinical context [^a2338d78] [^6a6dbffc].

---

## High-risk populations and screening strategies

Certain populations warrant **targeted screening** for early HE:

- **TIPS patients**: High incidence of HE; regular cognitive assessment recommended [^b9bd902a].
- **Patients with prior HE**: Increased recurrence risk; routine screening advised [^notfound].
- **Patients with infections or GI bleeding**: Common precipitants; heightened vigilance needed [^d811c486].

Routine screening of all cirrhosis patients for MHE/CHE is debated; **selective screening** of those with impaired QoL, employment/safety concerns, or high-risk features is reasonable [^f4cc297e] [^a0369d90].

---

## Impact of early detection on patient outcomes

Early detection and treatment of HE improve outcomes: **reduced recurrence** — lactulose and rifaximin lower HE recurrence and hospitalizations [^0d709aad] [^77a1b032]; **improved quality of life** — treating MHE/CHE enhances cognition and daily function [^0ebfe5bd]; **better prognosis** — early intervention may improve survival, though data are limited [^notfound].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Despite available tools, early HE detection faces barriers: **lack of standardization** — variable norms, learning effects, and poor inter-test correlation limit comparability [^f53f3cb3] [^74931712]; **limited awareness** — clinicians may miss subtle deficits without structured testing [^a60c9847]; **resource constraints** — some tests require training or equipment not universally available [^74931712].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **structured assessment** and selective screening: screen patients with cirrhosis and no prior overt HE for covert HE using validated tools where available [^a0369d90]; diagnose overt HE clinically, excluding other causes and using West Haven grading [^8a5fb4ed]; consider neuropsychological/neurophysiological testing for covert HE in patients with mild neuropsychiatric abnormalities [^1b11486a].

---

Early detection of HE requires **routine cognitive screening** in cirrhosis, clinical vigilance for subtle changes, and selective use of validated tools. This approach enables timely treatment, reduces recurrence, and improves quality of life, though standardization and access remain challenges.

A Practical Approach to the Diagnosis and Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of decompensated cirrhosis that can be reversed with treatment. Frequent episodes of recurrence are common, impacting patients, caregivers and healthcare systems, increasing morbidity and mortality statistics and resulting in grave financial consequences. Uptake and adherence to formal recommendations for HE diagnosis and management are low. There is an unmet need to advocate for the use of these recommendations in a more pragmatic form. Clinicians from multiple disciplines, dedicated to raising liver disease awareness, convened in a roundtable format to review and discuss the latest HE guidelines and relevant peer-reviewed literature on HE. The result was this clinical care publication on the screening, diagnosis and management of HE which seeks to facilitate clinicians' recognition and diagnosis of HE, apply a pathway of care for HE that addresses steps for initial management, long-term maintenance and prevention; it also addresses practical recommendations concerning situations encountered in HE. Resources are provided to address the different needs of the three key players in HE: patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

### Predicting overt hepatic encephalopathy for the population with cirrhosis [^00548e2e]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with poor quality of life, sharply increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, falls, and motor vehicle accidents. HE manifests with a dynamic spectrum of severity. Overt HE is clinically obvious disorientation, even coma. Although multiple strategies are available to characterize early-stage HE, data are limited that validate these methods in predicting overt HE, many are impractical in clinical practice, and test cutoffs relevant to the average patient clinicians manage are lacking. To accurately and efficiently classify the risk of overt HE in the population with cirrhosis, novel strategies may be needed. Herein, we review the potential competing strategies for the prediction of overt HE. Conclusion: We propose refining diagnostic cutoffs for tests that are designed to define early HE, using overt HE as a gold standard and expanding prediction tools by using measures of components from the risk pathway for HE.

### Lactulose vs PEG for overt hepatic encephalopathy… [^39a41352]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

The initial and follow-up HESA scores are depicted for the lactulose control and PEG experimental groups. Each transparent symbol represents a patient whose HESA score had changed from 0 to 24 hours; solid symbols represent patients whose HESA score showed no change at 24 hours. HESA indicates hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm; PEG, polyethylene glycol 3350–electrolyte solution. Potential causes of HE at the time of admission were also evaluated and are defined in the eAppendix in the Supplement. Grade of HE was determined by using the hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm, which has been shown to be an objective scoring instrument. 14 Resolution of HE was defined as an improvement in HESA to grade 0, patient discharge, patient death, or 2 consecutive days when HESA grade remained at 1 after an initial improvement in at least 1 full grade.

Permission to administer the HESA was obtained from the Technology Transfer Office of the University of California, San Diego. Two study team members were certified for clinical and neuropsychiatric testing. Both the initial and the 24-hour follow-up HESAs were completed by 1 study team member for all patients. Different HESA versions were used during follow-up testing at 24 hours to prevent learning and recall bias. The 24-hour interval was chosen to minimize differences in circadian rhythm. The results of this study indicate that bowel cleansing with PEG, normally used for colonoscopy preparations, is a safe, rapid, and effective immediate treatment strategy for patients presenting with acute overt HE. When compared with lactulose, the current standard treatment for overt HE, objective measures of HE improved significantly faster in those receiving PEG.

By accelerating improvement in mentation, initial treatment with PEG has the potential to not only shorten hospitalizations but also permit health care professionals to concentrate on managing the precipitating factors and identifying other causes of metabolic encephalopathy that may be present. We describe herein a novel approach to the early management of an acute presentation of overt HE. Compared with lactulose treatment, the current standard of care for acute HE in hospitalized patients, a single dose of PEG significantly improved the overall grade of encephalopathy in the first 24 hours, reduced days to HE resolution, and appeared to lead to shorter length of stay.

Laboratory testing — high blood-ammonia levels alone do not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in HE with chronic liver disease (CLD); if a patient with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has a normal ammonia level, the diagnosis of HE is in question. For ammonia-lowering drugs, repeated ammonia measurements may be helpful to test efficacy, but logistical challenges, specimen type differences, and method variability should be considered when interpreting results.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^e63f5f17]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

On the basis of the results of the Needs Assessment survey and follow on discussions, a PubMed search was undertaken to identify additional management guidelines and recommendations for management of HE. The MESH term 'hepatic encephalopathy' combined with the subheadings 'therapy', 'rehabilitation', 'diet therapy', or 'drug therapy' was used as an initial search. This was then supplemented by a search combining the MESH term 'hepatic encephalopathy' and the article types 'consensus development conference', 'consensus development conference, NIH', or 'guideline'. A total of 1146 possible publications were identified and a manual search of this list was then undertaken to identify publications that could inform the development of draft statements. Because of the paucity of suitable papers, a free text search ('hepatic encephalopathy' AND (guideline* OR algorithm)) and a MESH search ('cognition disorders' AND cirrhosis) were also undertaken. These did not retrieve any additional suitable citations.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^a21a0e93]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting. Symptoms include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness. Overt (symptomatic) hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis that is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy may present to healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, we developed a series of 'consensus points' to provide some guidance on management.

Methods

Using a modified 'Delphi' process, consensus statements were developed that summarize our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Points on which full consensus could not be reached are also discussed.

Results

Our recommendations emphasize the role of all healthcare providers in the identification of cognitive impairment in patients with cirrhosis and provide guidance on steps that might be considered to make a diagnosis of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, treatment recommendations are summarized. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy can have a significant impact on patients; however, in most circumstances identification and management of minimal hepatic encephalopathy remains the responsibility of specialists in liver diseases.

Conclusion

Our opinion statements aim to define the roles and responsibilities of all healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. We suggest that these recommendations be considered further by colleagues in other disciplines and hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with cirrhosis and with a 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment through to a formal diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^77a1b032]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Specific therapy for overt HE episodes includes supportive care, treatment of underlying precipitants, and initiation of specific therapy; first-line choices are nonabsorbable disaccharides or short-course antibiotics. All patients recovering from an acute episode of overt HE should also receive secondary prophylaxis to reduce the risk of recurrence; the evidence-based choices include nonabsorbable disaccharides and/or rifaximin. Appropriate therapy can reduce the duration of admission and reduce the risk of subsequent readmission. However, to maximize the benefits from therapy, early diagnosis is essential to allow prompt initiation of recommended treatment.

We recommend that our conclusions and recommendations be considered further by our colleagues in gastroenterology and hepatology and those in other disciplines and hope that these recommendations assist in the development of regional/national cross-speciality guidelines to improve the identification and triage of patients who may have HE and facilitate appropriate management. We also hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with HE from initial 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment, which may be by a clinician or healthcare provider not routinely responsible for management of an individual's liver disease.

### Hepatic encephalopathy [^02e56cd2]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

In the last decade, a significant amount of research has been devoted to the pathogenesis and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy have become important research tools. The search for a suitable animal model of HE associated with cirrhosis is still ongoing. Moreover, consensus terminology and diagnostic criteria for HE in humans are badly needed.

Hepatic encephalopathy guideline (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD] and European Association for the Study of the Liver [EASL]) — recommendation grading and scope are defined as follows: the AASLD/EASL Practice Guidelines Subcommittee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup, with minor modifications (Table 1). The classifications and recommendations are based on three categories: the source of evidence levels I through III; the quality of evidence designated by high (A), moderate (B), or low quality (C); and the strength of recommendation classified as strong (1) or weak (2). Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care, and they are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case; specific recommendations are based on relevant published information.

### Drug-induced liver injury: a comprehensive review [^e25789e1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Early detection of coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy and referral for consideration for LT is paramount to improving the overall survival rate of patients with suspected idiosyncratic DILI. Nevertheless, 25% of patients listed for LT die whilst waiting for a suitable graft. Current evidence to delineate spontaneous recovery from idiosyncratic DILI-induced ALF is scarce, especially in those already listed for LT. Consequently, a robust multidisciplinary approach involving a hepatologist, surgeon, anaesthetist and psychiatrist is critical to reducing mortality of transplant candidates and avoiding unnecessary LT.

Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities and motor disturbances in patients with advanced liver disease. It is estimated to occur in 30% to 45% of patients with liver cirrhosis and in 10% to 50% of patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. It can be seen in cancer patients due to multiple factors. Early diagnosis and treatment are important but can be challenging, especially in mild forms with subtle findings. This article reviews the pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, grading, and management of hepatic encephalopathy.

Grey areas and future needs

MHE and CHE correspond to a broad spectrum of neuropsychological manifestations of liver disease that require quantification and in which differential diagnoses should be carefully considered. The detection of risk thresholds for the occurrence of OHE, impairment in daily life activities and in QoL has unfortunately not yet been well defined. Therefore, future clinical research should try to detect such thresholds. The diagnostic methods needed to form the basis for clinical trials also need to be investigated. The diagnosis of MHE and CHE has received considerable interest; however, it is still not possible to compare results among studies and the precision needs improving.

One important area of uncertainty is whether the term CHE, introduced to expand MHE to grade I oriented patients, is actually informative and clinically valuable. A closer scientific collaboration between clinical hepatologists and brain researchers, including functional brain imaging experts, is needed, and neuropsychologists and psychiatrists may also be needed to clarify the broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in patients with liver disease.

### Hepatic encephalopathy: novel insights into classification, pathophysiology and therapy [^4104df64]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent and serious complication of both chronic liver disease and acute liver failure. HE manifests as a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, from subclinical changes (mild cognitive impairment) to marked disorientation, confusion and coma. The clinical and economic burden of HE is considerable, and it contributes greatly to impaired quality of life, morbidity and mortality. This review will critically discuss the latest classification of HE, as well as the pathogenesis and pathophysiological pathways underlying the neurological decline in patients with end-stage liver disease. In addition, management strategies, diagnostic approaches, currently available therapeutic options and novel treatment strategies are discussed.

Research on hepatic encephalopathy is hampered by the imprecise definition of this disabling complication of liver disease. Under this light, the Organisation Mondiale de Gastroentérologie commissioned a Working Party to reach a consensus in this area and to present it at the 11th World Congress of Gastroenterology in Vienna (1998). The Working Party continued its work thereafter and now present their final report. In summary, the Working Party has suggested a modification of current nomenclature for clinical diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy; proposed guidelines for the performance of future clinical trials in hepatic encephalopathy; and felt the need for a large study to redefine neuropsychiatric abnormalities in liver disease, which would allow the diagnosis of minimal (subclinical) encephalopathy to be made on firm statistical grounds. In the interim, it proposes the use of a psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score, based on the result of 5 neuropsychologic tests. Finally, the need for a careful evaluation of the newer neuroimaging modalities for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was stressed.

Hepatic encephalopathy research priorities — research into clinical management should remain in close contact with pathophysiology research, and such collaboration should result in new causal and symptomatic treatment modalities that need and motivate clinical trials. There is a severe and unmet need for controlled clinical trials on treatment effects on all the different forms of HE, and decisive clinical studies are few despite high patient numbers and resource utilization. There are no data on which factors and patients represent the higher costs, creating an insufficient basis for allocating resources and establishing priority policies. Many drugs that were assessed for HE several decades ago were studied following an obsolete standard of care, so any study of treatment for HE should be reassessed or repeated using the current standard of care. It is critical to develop protocols to identify precipitating factors and ACLF.

### Diagnosis and management of acute liver failure [^2c065cc3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a devastating syndrome afflicting previously healthy individuals. Early recognition of the illness is crucial, as aggressive treatment may improve outcomes. Despite significant advances in care, however, the mortality remains high (30–100%). This brief review will focus on the causes and overall management of the complications of ALF.

Recent Findings

Our knowledge of the causes of ALF has expanded significantly in the last decade. The mechanism of hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema in this setting continues to be elucidated and is discussed here.

Summary

Improved outcomes can be achieved with the early recognition and aggressive management of ALF.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as 'brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting'. Symptoms of overt HE include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness – particularly disturbance of the sleep/wake cycle–. In more severe HE, patients may become disorientated, acutely confused and suffer from agitation or coma. Minimal HE, the mildest form of HE, is clinically undetectable and requires the use of psychometric or neurophysiological testing to make a diagnosis.

Overt HE is a common complication of cirrhosis; at diagnosis approximately 10% of patients have HE, and 20–40% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HE during their disease course. In a multicentre study in Europe, of 2145 successive patients at different stages of liver disease 21% had HE. HE is also associated with a poor prognosis; 1-year mortality in patients with HE was 64% in one population-based series. Mortality may also be correlated with HE severity. In addition, HE affects the patient's quality of life, and caregiver burden. There is also accumulating evidence that after apparent resolution of HE persistent cognitive dysfunction may occur.

Brain scans — computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) do not contribute diagnostic or grading information for HE; however, because the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage is at least 5-fold increased and symptoms may be indistinguishable, a brain scan is usually part of the diagnostic workup of first-time HE and when there is clinical suspicion of other pathology.

### The burden of minimal hepatic encephalopathy: from diagnosis to therapeutic strategies [^0ebfe5bd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is the mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). It affects the performance of psychometric tests focused on attention, working memory, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial ability, as well as electrophysiological and other functional brain measures. MHE is a frequent complication of liver disease, affecting up to 80% of tested patients. By being related to falls, an impairment in fitness to drive and the development of overt HE, MHE severely affects the lives of patients and caregivers by altering their quality of life and their socioeconomic status. MHE is detected in clinically asymptomatic patients using appropriate psychometric tests and neurophysiological methods that highlight neuropsychological alterations, such as video-spatial orientation deficits, attention disorders, memory, reaction times, electroencephalogram slowing, prolongation of latency-evoked cognitive potentials, and reduction in the critical flicker frequency. Several treatments have been proposed for MHE treatment, including non-absorbable disaccharides, poorly absorbable antibiotics such as rifaximin, probiotics and branched-chain amino acids. However, because of the multiple diagnosis methods, the various endpoints of treatment trials and the variety of agents used in trials, the treatment of MHE is not currently recommended as routine, but only on a case-by-case basis.

### Key insights and clinical pearls in the identification and management of cirrhosis and its complications [^d6decdd3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent, chronic condition with an asymptomatic compensated phase, in which patients may feel well, and a decompensated phase that begins with the onset of complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding). Because patients with cirrhosis may appear healthy with normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin levels, awareness of clinical signals is important. For example, patients with thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Early recognition and management of cirrhosis-related complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding) are important, given their association with hospitalization and poor prognosis (eg increased odds of short-term mortality). Hepatic encephalopathy can be the most subtle cirrhosis-related complication and associated cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed. Because hepatic encephalopathy can be associated with hospital readmissions, reducing readmission rates after hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalizations is critical. This includes incorporating ongoing therapy (eg rifaximin plus lactulose) in postdischarge management plans to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Strategies that mitigate cirrhosis progression and prevent the development of cirrhosis-related complications are key to improving patient outcomes.

### Overt hepatic encephalopathy: more than meets the eye [^4600873b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION:

We aimed to assess the reliability of a qualitative approach to overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) diagnosis compared with the semiquantitative, and recommended one.

METHODS:

The above 2 methods were compared in 411 outpatients (71% males, 60 ± 10 years, model for end-stage liver disease 13.5 ± 5.0).

RESULTS:

Of the 73 patients with OHE on quantitative assessment, 19 (26%) were missed on qualitative assessment, with no difference in the likelihood of the physician missing grades II or III. Sixty-eight (20%) of the 270 patients with no OHE on quantitative assessment were wrongly qualified as having OHE.

DISCUSSION:

Qualitative clinical evaluation of OHE is not reliable, and recommendations should be followed.

### Minimal hepatic encephalopathy: simplifying its diagnosis [^26bb8607]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is relatively common and has a significant effect on the quality of life in patients with cirrhosis. However, diagnosing this entity clinically can be quite challenging. Inhibitory control testing (ICT) as a screening tool for diagnosis of MHE has been used clinically for sometime. The study published in this issue to validate ICT as a screening modality for MHE suggests it is a relatively simply, reliable test and can be easily administered by ancillary staff in the clinic. The study demonstrates that ICT has the potential to become a popular diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of MHE. A multicenter study to further validate the system for wider use will further strengthen the argument for its use in every patient with cirrhosis.

Introduction

Advanced liver disease is notorious for its systemic complications, particularly its overwhelming effect on brain function. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), is defined as brain dysfunction that occurs as a result of acute liver failure or liver cirrhosis and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It can manifest as a broad spectrum of reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities, ranging from change in behaviour or personality, intellectual impairment and altered mentation to coma. It is classified as overt HE (OHE) if clinically evident or minimal HE if apparent through neurophysiologic testing.OHE occurs in 30%–40% of patients with liver cirrhosis and is a frequent cause of hospitalisation; roughly 22 931 hospitalisations occurred secondary to HE in 2009.HE is associated with high risk of recurrence, increase in economic burden, poor prognosis and unfortunate quality of life.

One of the main setbacks in early diagnosis and treatment of HE is the lack of a well-validated, gold standard assessment method to detect HE. The most widely used HE grading system till this date is the West Haven Criteria (WHC), which is a subjective method that divides HE into four stages based on changes in intellectual function, level of consciousness, behaviour and neuromuscular signs. Given that it only relies on clinical judgement, it has been heavily criticised for its poor sensitivity in detecting milder forms of HE that are only present with subtle neurocognitive impairments. The HE Scoring Algorithm (HESA) is an adaptation of the WHC that possesses both subjective and objective indicators to measure neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with HE (online supplemental table 1) and seems to offer an advantage over other exiting methods as it incorporates a multidimensional approach for the diagnosis of HE.

### New assessment of hepatic encephalopathy [^fc0a8f89]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis that requires careful appraisal of the clinical manifestations, evaluation of the underlying neurological disorders, and assessment of liver function and the portal-systemic circulation. This article reviews recent developments in the assessment of HE and discusses the controversy regarding the use of a categorical or a continuous approach in measuring the severity of this condition. New scales facilitate effective monitoring and assessment of episodic HE. Neuropsychological test batteries and neurophysiological tests are of value for evaluating cognitive function in outpatients and can establish the diagnosis of minimal HE, and the severity of low-grade HE. These tools allow better evaluation of the origin of cognitive complaints and help in estimating the risk of accidents. It is now possible to complete the evaluation with measurement of the effects of cognitive impairment on daily living. In difficult cases, imaging of the brain and portal-systemic circulation with magnetic resonance imaging is especially helpful. Based on these studies, neurological signs and symptoms can be attributed to HE in patients with mild liver disease and in those with complex neurological manifestations. The new methods presented are also valuable for investigating the neurological manifestations occurring after liver transplantation.

### Saccadic eye movements in neurological disease: cognitive mechanisms and clinical applications [^5b0f8e7d]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy

Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy is a common and generally reversible cause of confusion and cognitive change. Here, brain neuronal activity is globally disrupted by perturbations to its local environment — be they related to energy metabolism, osmolality, temperature or changes to acid–base or electrolyte balance. For example, in liver failure, shunting of toxins from the gastrointestinal system that would otherwise be hepatically cleared and cerebral oedema co-exist. These processes contribute to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy whose clinical manifestations can range from subtle drowsiness or confusion to fulminant coma. Early detection of hepatic encephalopathy, especially when its manifestations are subtle (so-called minimal hepatic encephalopathy), can be difficult. However, intervention when mild encephalopathy is detected can mitigate more severe manifestations. The Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) is considered a gold standard for the diagnosis of minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Impairments in the PHES correlates with impaired performance on assessments of saccadic eye movements. Specifically, Casanova-Ferrer et al. found significant linear correlations between worse PHES score and increased AS latency and error rate. However, the authors primarily reported on the proportion of abnormal parameters from proprietary software analysis of the eye movements, many of which are derivative measurements. In any case, this is an early exploration of using saccadic tests as a biomarker in a specific disease context (that is, liver failure) where it can improve clinical detection and quantification of encephalopathy where there is a high pre-test probability of its existence. It also points towards analogous application in other causes of toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, which as a group is a prevalent disorder whose early detection is challenging but impacts clinical management.

### Undiagnosed cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy in veterans with dementia… [^15ed2080]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The findings of this study suggest that clinicians treating patients with dementia should investigate a reversible factor associated with cognitive decline, including missed or undiagnosed cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. Importance Dementia and hepatic encephalopathy are challenging to distinguish clinically. Undiagnosed cirrhosis in a patient with dementia can lead to missed opportunities to treat HE. The findings of this cohort study suggest that clinicians encountering patients with dementia should be encouraged to screen for cirrhosis using the FIB-4 score to uncover reversible factors associated with cognitive impairment, such as HE, to enhance outcomes. Cirrhosis, HE, and dementia are prevalent in the rapidly increasing older veteran population, creating the potential for overlap and diagnostic confusion.

9, 10 In older patients with risk factors for both cirrhosis and dementia, the lack of clinically applicable biomarkers and diagnostic tests complicates accurate diagnoses and treatment. 10, 14 Therefore, to diagnose or exclude HE as a potential factor associated with cognitive impairment, a strong suspicion for underlying cirrhosis is needed. While AUD and viral hepatitis are well known to be associated with advanced liver disease, 17 these findings should encourage health care professionals taking care of patients with dementia, including primary care, urgent care clinicians, geriatricians, and neurologists, to seek these out and diagnose cirrhosis as a potential factor associated with cognitive dysfunction. We used the FIB-4 index as a marker of potential liver disease in this study. The FIB-4 index is a scalable, inexpensive, and useful approach to identify patients with possible advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

12 We used several validated methods to exclude previously diagnosed cirrhosis in this population. 9 However, the large number of people with diagnosed dementia and diagnosed cirrhosis represent another population of interest; these have challenges in comanagement because HE and dementia overlap. 9 The use of FIB-4 scores necessitated exclusion of patients who did not have liver enzyme levels available, and few were excluded for extremes of laboratory test values to avoid confounding. These percentages of affected patients were corroborated with medical records review of 2 separate validation cohorts. In conclusion, FIB-4 should be considered as a screening tool to detect cirrhosis and potential HE in older veterans with dementia. Those with high scores should be considered for further evaluation and treatment.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^696b8325]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

General management — initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation — Initial assessment should focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic or acute-on-chronic liver failure, with extensive laboratory and imaging tests helping in that differentiation; obtaining a complete history is of utmost importance, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, complementary and alternative medications, and controlled substance monitoring databases, and all attempts should be made to contact next of kin if history is unobtainable; patients with acute liver failure should be referred for consultation by hepatology or gastroenterology as soon as possible after identification, prognostic assessment and decision related to transfer and liver transplant (LT) should be made as early as possible, and early referral to a liver transplant center is essential because transfer may take time and patients may deteriorate quickly; physical examination should focus on vital signs, presence of jaundice, signs of chronic liver disease, and careful mental status, and encephalopathy due to hepatic encephalopathy can be graded according to the West-Haven Criteria.

### Early prediction of short-term development of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with acute liver disease unrelated to paracetamol. A prospective study in Japan [^acb01ea6]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The aim of our study was to provide a predictive model for early recognition of the risk of short-term development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with symptomatic acute liver disease (ALD).

Methods

From a retrospective analysis of 220 patients with ALD, prothrombin time (PT) equal to, or lower than, 80% of normal, was set as the registration criteria in the subsequent patient cohorts of the study. Then, a HE-prediction model was derived by a logistic regression analysis of data in 259 new patients, and prospectively validated in 124 other patients, both groups of patients were affected by ALD unrelated to paracetamol (non-P ALD).

Results

The following HE-prediction model was established: λ = [0.692 × ln(1 + total bilirubin(mg/dL))] − 0.065 × PT(%) + [1.388 × Age(years)] + [0.868 × Etiology] − 1.156, where Age is 1 in patients older than 50 years and Etiology is 1 when the cause of non-P ALD is flare-up of type B hepatitis, auto-immune hepatitis or unknown, and 0 otherwise. In the validation group, according to the model-based risk of subsequent development of HE, sensitivity and specificity of the model were 100% and 69.0%, respectively, in patients with an evaluated risk lower than 20%, and 62.5% and 93.1%, respectively, in those with an evaluated risk equal to, or greater than, 50%.

Conclusion

In Japanese patients with symptomatic non-P ALD, our model, which includes four of the five items used in the King's College Hospital criteria, represents an acceptable, effective model to allow early detection of the risk of short-term development of HE. Using this model in other populations requires further validation specific to each of them.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — diagnostic differentiation from other causes: Because HE shares symptoms with concomitant disorders, differentiating HE from other causes can be difficult, and a normal blood ammonia level in a patient suspected of HE calls for consideration; none of the diagnostic measures used at present has been evaluated for their ability to differentiate HE from other causes; psychometric tests detect functional deficits but cannot differentiate causes; brain imaging results for diagnosing HE are disappointing; nevertheless, brain imaging should be done in every patient with chronic liver disease (CLD) and unexplained alteration of brain function to exclude structural lesions; in rare cases, reversibility by flumazenil may be useful.

Diagnosis and testing for overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) — The diagnosis of OHE is based on a clinical examination and a clinical decision, and clinical scales are used to analyze its severity; specific quantitative tests are only needed in study settings, and the gold standard is the West Haven criteria (WHC). These scales are subjective with limited interobserver reliability, especially for grade 1 HE, whereas disorientation and asterixis have good inter-rater reliability and are used as marker symptoms; in significantly altered consciousness, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is widely employed. OHE remains a diagnosis of exclusion due to many alternative causes of mental status change, and radiological assessment for a patient with altered mental status in HE is warranted.

Panel recommendations

General practitioners, acute care physicians and others, who may encounter patients with cirrhosis, should be aware of the signs and symptoms of HE. If these healthcare providers identify cognitive impairment, or symptoms of HE, in patients with cirrhosis, additional clinical assessment/workup may be required. This may include specialist consultation if helpful. All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their family physician: 38% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 3.63/5). Most patients with cirrhosis will be under appropriate specialist care. The primary care physician plays a vital role in the identification of patients with liver disease and should be aware of at-risk groups in addition to clinical signs and symptoms. Guidelines for the primary care provider on this are lacking. HE as a first presentation of cirrhosis would be unusual. However, HE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in appropriate clinical settings – for example, the patient with risk factors for liver disease, the patient with physical signs suggesting liver disease, or the patient with abnormal serum liver function tests. Unlike other decompensation events (e.g. variceal bleeding, ascites), patients with HE may not present to their usual specialist as a result of their symptoms, and patients with prior HE are more likely to present to their primary care provider or as an emergency admission. Therefore, it is necessary that patients with HE not presenting to their usual healthcare provider are identified and appropriate treatment initiated. Although assessment of cognition and psychiatric symptoms is relatively simple, making a definitive diagnosis of HE is more difficult and HE remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Symptoms of HE are relatively nonspecific (Table 1), which can lead to challenges in making a formal diagnosis of HE. Therefore, providers should be ready to consider HE as a cause of cognitive dysfunction and symptoms in patients with cirrhosis, and either work up the patient to make a formal diagnosis or, if necessary, be prepared to refer such patients to specialist care for further assessment. This prompt workup and/or referral should allow for early initiation of appropriate management, which might reduce the risk of hospitalization and thus reduce healthcare costs.
The lead clinician caring for patients with cirrhosis (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) should formally assess all patients for signs and symptoms of HE. All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their gastroenterologist: 63% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.5/5). All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their liver specialist: 75% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.75/5). Although the general practitioner or acute care physician or other healthcare provider encountering patients with cirrhosis and cognitive impairment should have a low 'threshold' for suspecting HE as a possible cause, we believe that it is the responsibility of the lead clinician (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) to routinely assess patients with cirrhosis for symptoms of HE. According to current guidelines this may involve clinical assessment and/or psychometric testing. As stated below (point 3), the selection of additional psychometric testing remains a matter of personal experience and availability. Routine formal assessment will facilitate early identification of symptoms of HE, and therefore initiation of appropriate management.
Assessment for overt HE should principally be by clinical evaluation, with use of additional testing as required on an individual basis (and according to availability). The assessment of overt HE outside a liver unit should be by clinical evaluation only: 25% strongly agree; 50% agree (mean score: 3.75/5). Only near consensus was reached for this statement as one author strongly felt that even outside the liver unit additional testing beyond clinical assessment was necessary. However, on further discussion it was agreed that for many healthcare providers the facilities are not available to undertake additional tests. Therefore, the final statement above, which allows for additional testing 'if available', was agreed upon. The EASL/AASLD guidelines state that overt HE is primarily a clinical diagnosis (Table 1). Psychometric and neurophysiological tests do not differentiate HE from other causes of cognitive dysfunction, and differential diagnoses include renal dysfunction, hyponatraemia, diabetes, sepsis, alcohol withdrawal and Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, psychometric, psychophysical and neurophysiological tests can have some value in supporting the clinical diagnosis of lower grades of overt HE, in addition to their use to detect minimal HE. These include simple paper and pencil tests (including the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test) as well as more sophisticated psychometric tests including the Inhibitory Control Test and Repeated Battery for Assessment of Neurological State, neurophysiological testing by electroencephalogram, or psychophysical testing – for example, the Critical Flicker Frequency. Full consensus on the use of a specific test or tests could not be reached, reflecting differences in availability and clinical opinion. It should be noted that not all of the available tests are fully validated and many require administration by a trained examiner. The results of several of these including the Inhibitory Control Test and Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test, can be affected by age, educational status and training effects, and for many tests validated 'normals' are not available for all countries/languages and populations. The availability of equipment for these tests varies, and in many centres pencil and paper tests are used and remain valuable. However, if available, the Critical Flicker Frequency test was felt by some authors to have several advantages, including lack of training effect, educational status, and age, and avoidance of interexaminer variability.
For all patients with HE, consideration should usually be given for referral to a liver unit or physician who specializes in liver disease. All patients with overt HE should be referred to a liver unit: 50% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.38/5). HE is a decompensation event and all healthcare providers managing patients with a diagnosis of HE should consider whether the patient should be referred to a liver specialist. Although policies vary with respect to wait-listing patients with HE and a number of allocation scoring systems have been proposed, further assessment of patients with HE is warranted as they may be eligible for assessment for liver transplantation.
All patients with overt HE should be treated (including checking for precipitants). All patients with HE should be treated: 75% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.75/5). The most important step in the management of HE is evaluation for precipitants (Table 2), and appropriate intervention. In addition, all patients with a diagnosis of overt HE should be treated. The most commonly used treatments are nonabsorbable disaccharides. A meta-analysis indicated that lactulose or lactitol therapy resulted in clinical improvement, although there was no effect on mortality. Although the same meta-analysis reported that nonabsorbable disaccharides were inferior to short-course antibiotic therapy, lactulose is the usual 'first choice' treatment for overt HE. Antibiotics are, however, commonly used, whereas other therapies available in some countries include oral branched chain amino acidsand intravenous-ornithine-aspartate (LOLA). Other treatment options specialists may consider include albumin dialysisand embolization of large spontaneous portal–systemic shunts, although these are not part of the EASL/AASLD recommendations. If helpful, advice on treatment should be sought from a specialist in liver diseases, particularly for more severe cases, and/or those for whom a nonstandard therapy is being considered.
After recovery/improvement of HE symptoms, secondary prophylaxis should be considered in all patients. After recovery/improvement of overt HE, patients should receive secondary prophylaxis: 83% strongly agree; 16% agree (mean score: 4.83/5). Prior HE is associated with an increased risk for subsequent episodes. In one study ∼50% of patients with at least one prior HE event (median 1) suffered recurrence within 1 year, and in another, 46% of those with at least two prior events suffered recurrence within 6 months. Therefore, it is appropriate to offer secondary prophylaxis to reduce recurrence in most, if not all, patients recovering from an episode of HE. Secondary prophylaxis should be initiated by the clinician managing an episode of HE, with advice from a gastroenterologist or specialist in liver disease if helpful. In patients with a median of one prior episode, lactulose was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for recurrence over a median 14 months' follow-up. Patients receiving lactulose should have the dose adjusted so that there are two or three bowel movements daily but without diarrhoea. In patients with at least two prior episodes of HE in the previous 6 months (the majority of whom were receiving lactulose), rifaximin-α (rifaximin) 550 mg twice daily was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for recurrent HE over 6 months and a reduction in the risk for HE-related hospitalization. The EASL/AASLD guidelines suggest rifaximin 550 mg twice daily add-on to lactulose after the second episode of HE. It may also be appropriate to consider rifaximin monotherapy in patients intolerant to lactulose despite patient education, and dose adjustment to achieve two or three bowel movements each day. A number of other therapies used for secondary prophylaxis are not included in the EASL/AASLD guidelinesbut were felt by some authors to have a role. Full consensus could not be reached on these treatments, partly because of differences in availability and clinical experience. These included laxatives, branched chain amino acids, and LOLA. For patients with hyperammonaemia and HE, LOLA was felt to be particularly helpful by one author, although only intravenous LOLA was reported by the EASL/AASLD guidelines as being effective for the treatment of HE episodes but not for secondary prophylaxis. There was also experience of using oral branched chain amino acids in patients with chronic HE who were protein intolerant, as recommended by the International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN) guidelines on nutrition. Patients receiving secondary prophylaxis should be encouraged to remain on therapy to maximize the benefits of treatment. It is the responsibility of all healthcare professionals who encounter patients with cirrhosis and HE to encourage compliance with therapy.
Liver specialists may assess patients with cirrhosis for minimal HE; other healthcare professionals caring for patients with cirrhosis should not be expected to routinely assess patients for minimal HE. Patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for minimal HE by their gastroenterologist: 38% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.13/5). Patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for minimal HE by their liver specialist: 88% strongly agree; 13% agree (mean score: 4.88/5). Substantial expertise is required to make a diagnosis of minimal HE and the diagnosis is defined by the test used. In addition, there are no therapies with a specific approval for its treatment. Therefore, it may be reasonable to expect that diagnosis and management of minimal HE should remain the responsibility of liver specialists. Although treatment for minimal HE has been shown to improve cognitive test score and quality of life–, it is not yet possible to confirm benefits in terms of reduced episodes of overt HE or other clinical outcomes. As a result, there is no agreement over potential treatment strategies, including the optimal duration of therapy. It is appropriate for those healthcare providers caring for patients with cirrhosis, who have the expertise and experience, to utilize psychometric or neurophysiological tests on a case-by-case basis if this will help clinical decision making. This reflects the EASL/AASLD guidelines, which suggest that consideration be given to testing patients for minimal HE and providing counselling in some circumstances – for example, potential consequences on driving, flying, train drivers, or operating machinery.
If diagnosed, consideration should be given to treatment of patients with minimal HE. All patients with a diagnosis of minimal HE should be treated: 38% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.13/5). If a diagnosis of minimal HE has been made it is reasonable to consider treatment, accepting the caveats above regarding uncertainties surrounding the endpoints of treatment and lack of licensed therapies. Such a decision should be taken in consultation with a specialist in liver diseases.

### A prospective, blinded assessment of ammonia testing demonstrates low utility among front-line clinicians [^5f43aa55]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although ammonia is essential to the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), its levels cannot diagnose HE, do not correlate with the grade of HE, and are plagued by technical challenges. 1 Nevertheless, ammonia levels are routinely obtained in the evaluation of hospitalized patients. 2 We have advocated for quality improvement to limit testing. 3 However, data are lacking regarding the reasons for, context, and perceived value of ammonia testing among ordering clinicians. Additional data are needed to optimize a quality improvement intervention aiming to curb overuse.

MHE and prognosis (survival and development OHE)

Although MHE represents an early stage in the spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with liver cirrhosis, its presence may correlate with an increase in mortality. Amodio et al were among the first to examine the role of psychometric tests in the prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis. The results of their "Choice 2" test were, in fact, associated with survival times. Although the model for end-stage liver disease and Child-Pugh scores are currently used in the prognosis, cognitive function also has a significant prognostic value, and thus may be used in combination with these staging systems of the patient's level of severity in terms of liver disease. Dhiman et al studied the correlation of age, level of serum bilirubin, Child-Pugh score, and PHES with prognosis. Patients with MHE showed a higher mortality rate than those without (39.1% vs. 22.9%). Moreover, the multivariate analysis identified two variables as significant independent prognostic factors; psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score ≤ −6 [hazard ratio 2.419 (95%CI, 1.014–5.769)] and Child-Turcotte-Pugh score ≥ 8 [hazard ratio 2.466 (95%CI, 1.010–6.023)] predicted poor survival. In another series, patients suffering from MHE were found to be at risk of developing OHE.

Diagnosis of MHE

There is no single optimal measure for assessing the presence of MHE. In fact, none of the methods proposed cover all aspects of HE: appropriate norms are needed for good sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients at risk of OHE; the rate of pathological results in patient groups without OHE differs markedly; and finally, the results of the various methods are not consistent. However, despite its significant negative impact on the daily lives of patients and caregivers, MHE is still likely to be ignored by most clinicians if standards of neuropsychological testing are not followed while testing a patient for MHE.

Hepatic encephalopathy management strategy — Patients with higher grades of HE who are at risk or unable to protect their airway need more intensive monitoring and are ideally managed in an intensive care setting, and alternative causes of encephalopathy are not infrequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Controlling precipitating factors in the management of OHE is of paramount importance, because nearly 90% of patients can be treated with just correction of the precipitating factor, and careful attention to this issue is still the cornerstone of HE management.

### Neuropsychological tools in hepatology: a survival guide for the clinician [^da5a56cd]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2012). Low credibility.

Neuropsychological assessment has three main applications in clinical hepatology: (i) to detect, grade and monitor liver failure-related cognitive alterations in end-stage liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy), (ii) to substantiate complaints of attention or concentration difficulties in patients with non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C viral infection, and (iii) to screen patients who are being considered for liver transplantation for early signs of dementia. However, there is limited agreement on how cognitive assessment should be conducted in these patients, and how results should be interpreted and used to implement clinical decisions. In this review, we summarize the available literature on neuropsychological dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and with chronic hepatitis C viral infection and provide some guidance on how to utilize neuropsychological assessment in practice.

Recommendations for future research, audit and service development

Earlier detection of liver disease

It has been clear for some time that people with ALD are more likely to present late, with more advanced disease, compared with those with other causes of liver disease. Recent initiatives in the UK have sought to find cases of disease at an earlier stage, for example, by the use of TE in people at risk of disease. Understanding the value of this approach and the best way to implement methods of early detection will be essential for future service development.

NITs for risk assessment in ALD

There is a clear unmet need to understand which NITs have the greatest utility for the risk assessment of ALD, and the cut-off levels which are best suited to confirming or excluding advanced fibrosis and risk of liver-related ill health. The optimal timeframe for repeat testing in patients at low risk of disease at baseline also needs to be established.

Treatments and services for decompensated disease and AH

There have been no new treatments for decompensated ALD cirrhosis or AH since the introduction of corticosteroids several decades ago. Given the increasing number of admissions and deaths from ALD this is an important gap in our ability to care for patients and improve outcomes. Research into new treatments is necessary. Research into new methods of delivering care is also required for example the value of 'hub and spoke' relationships between secondary and tertiary care for improved access to specialist services, and delivery of hepatology services outside of traditional hospital settings such as outpatient clinics based in community or alcohol treatment centres. Innovative research methods may be necessary to effectively deliver research in this cohort since concomitant health and social issues may reduce the value of traditional trial methods.

### Development of fully automated models for staging liver fibrosis using non-contrast MRI and artificial intelligence: a retrospective multicenter study [^5617d9fc]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver fibrosis, characterized by excessive collagen deposition and scar tissue formation due to chronic inflammation, markedly impairs hepatic circulation and alters liver architecture. Leveraging the liver's regenerative capacity, early-stage fibrosis can often be reversed with proper treatment. However, without intervention, ongoing inflammation and fibrosis may progress to cirrhosis, presenting greater treatment challenges. This stage enhances the likelihood of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompensation, alongside additional complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding. Notably, cirrhosis has ascended as a significant contributor to global mortality, accounting for 2.4% of all deaths worldwide in 2019. Liver biopsy, the current reference method for fibrosis assessment in clinical practice, is unsuitable for routine fibrosis screening due to its invasiveness, susceptibility to sampling error, associated morbidity, complication risks, and interpretative variability. Considering the silent and non-specific symptomatology of early-stage liver fibrosis, its detection presents significant challenges. Thus, it is critical to develop a highly accurate and efficient non-invasive diagnostic approach for the standard management protocols of chronic liver diseases.

Delphi process

Strong levels of consensus were reached regarding the role of gastroenterologists and liver specialists in the clinical diagnosis of HE, with lower levels of consensus regarding the role of the family physician. There was also consensus that all patients with cirrhosis should be assessed, not only those with a history of decompensation. As shown, full consensus was not reached regarding the specific diagnostic test or tests that should be used, nor the treatment of an overt HE episode. In contrast, there was general consensus that secondary prophylaxis was appropriate.

Postprocedural Follow-up

All TIPS patients are followed by serial duplex ultrasonography at 24 h, 1, 3, and 6 months after the TIPS placement, then every 6 months thereafter.

An upper endoscopy is scheduled at 6 months in patients treated for gastrointestinal bleeding as a complementary assessment. The patients are continually followed by a hepatologist.

Anticoagulation is not routinely recommended except in patients treated for massive thrombosis of the hepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome). In these cases, strict anticoagulation is mandatory to keep the INR above 2.

Occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy or its worsening is revealed by direct question of the patient, or by obtaining information by asking family members. Specific questions are asked regarding changes in personality, working capacity, sleep behaviors, and power of concentration. There are psychometric tests for the early detection of subclinical encephalopathy, including study of a handwriting specimen, a number-connection test, and a line-tracing test.

When a polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent graft is used, hepatic encephalopathy may be frequent; unlike bare stents, its occurrence tends to be constant during follow-up. Refractory hepatic encephalopathy can be managed by reducing the shunt diameter via various stenosing devices.

MHE and CHE are risk factors for the development of OHE.

### Late presentation of chronic viral hepatitis for medical care: a consensus definition [^29dab0b6]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

We present two consensus definitions of advanced and late stage liver disease being used as epidemiological tools. These definitions can be applied to assess the morbidity caused by liver diseases in different health care systems. We focus is on hepatitis B and C virus infections, because effective and well tolerated treatments for both of these infections have greatly improved our ability to successfully treat and prevent advanced and late stage disease, especially if diagnosed early. A consensus definition of late presentation with viral hepatitis is important to create a homogenous, easy-to-use reference for public health authorities in Europe and elsewhere to better assess the clinical situation on a population basis.

Methods

A working group including viral hepatitis experts from the European Association for the Study of the Liver, experts from the HIV in Europe Initiative, and relevant stakeholders including patient advocacy groups, health policy-makers, international health organisations and surveillance experts, met in 2014 and 2015 to develop a draft consensus definition of late presentation with viral hepatitis for medical care. This was refined through subsequent consultations among the group.

Results

Two definitions were agreed upon. Presentation with advanced liver disease caused by chronic viral hepatitis for medical care is defined as a patient with chronic hepatitis B and C and significant fibrosis (≥ F3 assessed by either APRI score > 1.5, FIB-4 > 3.25, Fibrotest > 0.59 or alternatively transient elastography (FibroScan) > 9.5 kPa or liver biopsy ≥ METAVIR stage F3) with no previous antiviral treatment. Late stage liver disease caused by chronic viral hepatitis is clinically defined by the presence of decompensated cirrhosis (at least one symptom of the following: jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, clinically detectable ascites, variceal bleeding) and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Conclusion

These consensus definitions will help to improve epidemiological understanding of viral hepatitis and possibly other liver diseases, as well as testing policies and strategies.

### Performance characterization of a novel electronic number connection test to detect minimal hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients [^ee2c8f33]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication of cirrhosis, characterized by cognitive deficits that negatively impact patients' quality of life. The mild, minimal hepatic encephalopathy (mHE) can only be detected by psychometric tests and early mHE detection can prevent more severe complications or even survival times. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and validity of the novel-developed electronic number connection test (eNCT), which is designed as a fast and easy-to-perform mHE patient self-test.

Methods

The eNCT design was inspired by the paper-pencil number connection test version A, showing 25 numbers on the screen (1–25), in a random order. The time required to tap on all digits in the correct order was measured. A total of 238 individuals (112 patients with liver cirrhosis) were enrolled in this study and eNCT times were compared with well-established paper-pencil tests. The Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test battery was used to detect mHE and cut-off values for mHE detection by the eNCT were defined.

Results

Overall, cirrhotic patients showed significantly slower test completion times compared with control participants. The eNCT performance was inversely correlated with Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test performance in cirrhotic patients, independent of the HE status. Thirty cirrhotic patients fulfilled the mHE criteria and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed high sensitivity (> 82%) and specificity (> 85%) for mHE detection. Finally, the eNCT showed excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.94).

Conclusion

The novel eNCT is a reliable HE self-test to monitor cognitive function and detect cognitive impairment in cirrhotic patients.

### Leveraging machine learning for precision medicine: a predictive model for cognitive impairment in cholestasis patients [^3bb7f8e5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholestasis is a clinical syndrome characterized by impaired bile flow, which disrupts the enterohepatic circulation and leads to the accumulation of bile components in the bloodstream. Although primarily associated with liver dysfunction, cholestasis exerts systemic effects that extend beyond hepatic damage, impacting cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive systems. Emerging research highlights the deleterious impact of cholestasis on cognitive function, particularly in domains such as memory, attention, and executive functioning. The underlying mechanisms appear multifaceted, involving chronic systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, gut-liver-brain axis dysregulation, and nutritional deficiencies such as hypoalbuminemia and fat-soluble vitamin depletion. Despite this growing body of evidence, cognitive dysfunction in cholestasis patients often remains underdiagnosed and poorly understood in clinical practice, necessitating robust predictive models to facilitate early identification and intervention.

The MoCA has been widely recognized as a gold standard for assessing cognitive function due to its sensitivity and multidomain coverage, making it particularly effective in detecting early and moderate-to-severe cognitive impairments. Unlike traditional cognitive screening tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), MoCA incorporates evaluations of executive function, visuospatial skills, and language, which are often the first domains to decline in systemic diseases like cholestasis. While MoCA has demonstrated utility in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disorders, its application in hepatobiliary conditions, particularly in cholestasis, remains underexplored. Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment in cholestasis patients shares similarities with cognitive dysfunction seen in other systemic diseases. Although MoCA has not been widely validated in cholestatic patients specifically, its sensitivity in detecting early cognitive deficits in liver-related conditions, such as hepatic encephalopathy, provides a foundation for its potential use in cholestasis. Studies focusing on cholestasis have primarily been descriptive, detailing its association with hepatic encephalopathy or neuroinflammatory states but lacking targeted tools for stratifying cognitive risk. The diagnosis of cholestasis in this study was based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging criteria, as outlined in the guidelines established by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Furthermore, existing predictive tools for cognitive impairment often fail to account for the unique biochemical and metabolic profiles of cholestasis patients, which include elevated bilirubin, altered coagulation parameters, and systemic inflammation markers such as D-dimer. This gap underscores the pressing need for disease-specific, data-driven approaches to predict cognitive outcomes.

### Overt hepatic encephalopathy: more than meets the eye [^a60c9847]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Although a semiquantitative assessment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has been repeatedly and formally recommended, the impact of its replacement by unstructured interviews and/or physicians' impressions, which are still common practice, has never been formally assessed. The concept behind the recommendation is that verbal abilities tend to be preserved even in severe OHE, which can therefore be easily missed in conversation, unless questions ascertaining temporal and spatial orientation are actually asked.

The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and the impact, if any, of a qualitative approach to OHE diagnosis compared with the semiquantitative one recommended in the most recent set of Italian guidelines (see Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Digital Content 1).

Testing for minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) and covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) — MHE and CHE is defined as the presence of test-dependent or clinical signs of brain dysfunction in patients with chronic liver disease who are not disoriented or display asterixis. The term "minimal" conveys that there is no clinical sign, cognitive or other, of HE, and the term "covert" includes minimal and grade 1 HE. Testing strategies can be divided into two major types: psychometric and neurophysiological.

---

### The burden of minimal hepatic encephalopathy: from diagnosis to therapeutic strategies [^f53f3cb3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

However, there is unfortunately still no optimal diagnostic protocol for the diagnosis of MHE. The "ideal" diagnostic tool should be based on a comparison between the different methods, on the evidence of the association of each of them with significant clinical outcomes — such as the ability to perform tasks that are potentially dangerous in real life, such as driving — and on patients' QoL, development of episodes of OHE and survival.

The diagnostic tools mentioned above are also used to test for MHE and CHE; however, they do not correlate well with each other because HE is a multidimensional dysfunction. Moreover, there is often a learning effect with psychometric tests and it is unclear whether current HE therapy plays a role in the test performance. Therefore, the interpretation of these tests and the use of the results for further management require a complete evaluation of the patient's history, the current therapy, as well as the effect on the patient's daily activities. Due to the high incidence of MHE and CHE in patients with liver cirrhosis, each patient considered at risk should "ideally" be tested. However, this strategy may be costly. In addition, the consequences of this screening strategy are still not always clear and a specific treatment — i.e. rifaximin, non-absorbable disaccharides, probiotics — is not always recommended unless on a case-by-case basis.

A cost-effective diagnostic approach may be to test patients who have an impairment in their QoL or fitness to drive. It is also important to test only those patients who do not have confounding factors, such as neuropsychiatric disorders, those on psychoactive medication, or those who report current alcohol use or pharmacological treatment for HE; moreover, testing should be done only by a trained examiner. If the test result is normal (i.e. negative for MHE or CHE), guidelines suggest repeating the test after six months. For multicenter studies, AASLD/EASL guidelines for the management of HE suggest that the diagnosis of MHE or CHE by consensus should use at least two of the current validated testing strategies: paper-pencil (PHES) and one of the following: computerized (CRT, ICT, SCAN, or Stroop) or neurophysiological (CFF or EEG).

### Comparison of the most favoured methods for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in liver transplantation candidates [^dfee621e]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of liver insufficiency. While there is widespread acceptance of its importance, there is no consensus on how best to diagnose and monitor HE.

Objective

To compare the four most favoured methods for the diagnosis of HE.

Design

170 patients who were on the waiting list for liver transplantation as well as 86 healthy controls were included in the study. All patients and controls underwent the portosystemic encephalopathy syndrome test yielding the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS), the inhibitory control test (ICT) and critical flicker frequency (CFF) measurement.

Results

PHES and ICT targets had the best sensitivity (85.7% vs 85.7%) and specificity (96.5% vs 97.6%) for the diagnosis of overt HE. CFF showed inferior sensitivity (40.9%) for the diagnosis of HE and dependency from previous alcohol abuse (p = 0.015). Multiple regression analysis showed that all test results apart from PHES were influenced by secondary diagnoses such as diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency.

Conclusions

In the German population of patients awaiting liver transplantation, PHES is the most robust method for the diagnosis and follow-up of HE.

### Minimal hepatic encephalopathy [^ebc3272e]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), formerly known as subclinical hepatic encephalopathy, is the mild cognitive impairment commonly seen in patients who have cirrhosis. Current understanding suggests that MHE forms part of the spectrum of hepatic encephalopathy, although this remains to be proven. Although traditionally viewed as having negligible clinical significance, MHE has a significant impact on quality of life. MHE often goes undiagnosed because in many patients there is no evidence of clinically overt signs of impaired cognition. In addition, the diagnostic criteria for MHE have not been standardized, which means that the exact characteristics of MHE remain in question. This Review focuses on the pathogenesis and neuropsychological findings (incorporating neuroimaging) of MHE, as well as the effect of MHE on quality of life and survival, and developments in treatment.

### Mini-mental state examination in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and liver cirrhosis: a prospective, quantified electroencephalography study [^789cf23a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The appropriate diagnosis of HE causes several problems. After exclusion of other causes of mental impairment, a careful clinical examination is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of overt, mainly more advanced stages of HE (grade 3 and grade 4 i.e. coma). However less advanced overt HE require a detailed neuropsychological evaluation. Moreover, for detection of minimal HE a clinical examination has a little value because of the lack of clear manifestations, and an additional more sensitive diagnostic tool is in this case necessary. However, until now no method is available that can discriminate the specific stages of HE objectively through the entire spectrum of minimal and overt HE. The West-Haven grading system, which classifies HE into categories, remains criticized because of its intense subjectivity and low intra- and inter-observer reliability. Therefore several other more objective diagnostic tools (e.g. neuroimaging, neurophysiological methods or psychomotor tests), were implemented to diagnose both minimal and overt HE, but there is still an ongoing debate which of them should be a diagnostic standard. In several studies spectral analysis of EEG has been proven to be a valuable, sensitive and observer –independent method to detect minimal HE, therefore it can be used as a reference tool and we applied it in our study as well. However the EEG detects cortical neuronal activity and may not ideally reflect a wide variety of neurophysiological events seen in HE. Moreover it is not broadly implemented in a daily practice because of its limited availability and the need of an experienced personnel to appropriate interpretation of the obtained electroencephalograms. Therefore there is still a need to develop screening tests for a clinical routine and for a research in studying patients with liver cirrhosis, which will cover a whole spectrum of pathophysiological spectrum of the phenomenon.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^3d4f3910]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

New Insights into HE (and) is an educational programme developed by a Steering Committee of hepatologists and gastroenterologists from across Europe. The aim of this programme is to improve the understanding and management of patients with HE. A series of Needs Assessment teleconferences were undertaken in November 2013 with 14 hepatologists and gastroenterologists managing patients with cirrhosis and HE. These open-question-led interviews were designed to identify educational needs around HE, which would inform the 'New Insights into HE' educational programme. As a result of these teleconferences, and subsequent discussions with the New Insights into HE Steering Committee and other faculty involved in developing the educational content, it was clear that a potential barrier to effective management of patients with HE is delay in identification and referral. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines present recommendations and options for the diagnosis and management of patients with HE (Fig. 1). However, these guidelines reflect the uncertainties and variability in management and often a lack of high-quality evidence to support one approach over another. Therefore, the final recommendations present options that '… not all readers may necessarily agree with… '. For the specialist in liver diseases this guideline therefore allows for management to reflect personal experience and preference while providing a framework for future developments. However, for those healthcare providers who are not hepatologists (or do not specialize in diseases of the liver), but have clinical responsibility for patients with cirrhosis, no guidance is provided to define their role in the identification and referral and/or management of patients with HE. To provide this guidance, eight members of the Steering Committee developed a series of Consensus Opinion Statements to better define the role of healthcare providers who do not specialize in liver diseases in the management of HE. The recommendations of this paper should therefore be reviewed alongside the EASL/AASLD treatment guidelines, and consideration should be given to an individual healthcare provider's experience and expertise.

### The stroop smartphone application is a short and valid method to screen for minimal hepatic encephalopathy [^17bfc8e1]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) detection is difficult because of the unavailability of short screening tools. Therefore, MHE patients can remain undiagnosed and untreated. The aim of this study was to use a Stroop smartphone application (app) (EncephalApp_Stroop) to screen for MHE. The app and standard psychometric tests (SPTs; 2 of 4 abnormal is MHE, gold standard), psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), and inhibitory control tests (ICTs) were administered to patients with cirrhosis (with or without previous overt hepatic encephalopathy; OHE) and age-matched controls from two centers; a subset underwent retesting. A separate validation cohort was also recruited. Stroop has an "off" state with neutral stimuli and an "on" state with incongruent stimuli. Outcomes included time to complete five correct runs as well as number of trials needed in on (Ontime) and off (Offtime) states. Stroop results were compared between controls and patients with cirrhosis with or without OHE and those with or without MHE (using SPTs, ICTs, and PHES). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to diagnose MHE in patients with cirrhosis with or without previous OHE. One hundred and twenty-five patients with cirrhosis (43 previous OHE) and 134 controls were included in the original cohort. App times were correlated with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (Offtime: r = 0.57; Ontime: r = 0.61; P < 0.0001) and were worst in previous OHE patients, compared to the rest and controls. Stroop performance was also significantly impaired in those with MHE, compared to those without MHE, according to SPTs, ICTs, and PHES (all P < 0.0001). A cutoff of > 274.9 seconds (Ontime plus Offtime) had an area under the curve of 0.89 in all patients and 0.84 in patients without previous OHE for MHE diagnosis using SPT as the gold standard. The validation cohort showed 78% sensitivity and 90% specificity with the > 274.9-seconds Ontime plus Offtime cutoff. App result patterns were similar between the centers. Test-retest reliability in controls and those without previous OHE was good; a learning effect on Ontime in patients with cirrhosis without previous OHE was noted.

Conclusion

The Stroop smartphone app is a short, valid, and reliable tool for screening of MHE.

### Memory function in early hepatic encephalopathy [^33855706]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Early hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is characterized by deficits in motor performance, visual perception, visuo-constructive abilities and attention. Whether defective memory is a feature of early HE is controversial.

Aims

To analyze memory function in patients with early HE.

Methods

Memory tests were applied to cirrhotic patients with grade 0 HE, minimal HE and grade I HE (n = 45) and controls (n = 52). The battery included short and long term memory tests requiring free recall or recognition. Minimal HE was diagnosed by assessing the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score using the PSE-Syndrom-Test and by carrying out a neurological examination. Group differences of the test results were analyzed using analysis of covariance.

Results

HE 0 patients achieved test results similar to the controls in all but two tests. Patients with early HE (minimal and grade I HE) scored lower than the controls in all tests applied. A detailed analysis of test performance showed that the patients' deficits were in attention and visual perception, rather than memory.

Conclusions

Patients with early HE score lower than controls in memory tasks predominantly because of deficits in attention and visual perception.

### Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome – the markers for an early HSES diagnosis [^65e119cb]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Since the original description of the hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES) by Levin et al. numerous cases have been reported in the literature. Although the etiology of HSES remains unknown, this syndrome is associated with acute onset of encephalopathy, shock, watery diarrhea, severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and renal and hepatic dysfunction.

As some authors have defined the HSES criteria, patients meeting them will usually have very poor prognoses with a fatal course or severe neurological sequelae. Our experience suggests that early detection of HSES plays an important role in survival and the reduction of neurological sequelae.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^eba6b140]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The recently published guidelines from the EASL/AASLD provide a framework for the diagnosis and management of patients with HE. Our opinion statements aim to define the role and responsibilities of all those healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and HE (Fig. 1). Although developed before the EASL/AASLD guidelines were published, the expert consensus opinion statements discussed here do not differ significantly from these guidelines.

In developing these statements we have acknowledged that making a definitive diagnosis of HE can be difficult. However, it is possible for all those healthcare providers who encounter patients with cirrhosis to identify cognitive impairment and be aware of HE in terms of the impact on patients. For those healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis we believe that it is reasonable that patients with suspected HE are referred to their gastroenterologist or liver specialist. It is then the responsibility of the primary provider (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) to ensure that appropriate clinical assessments are undertaken to make a diagnosis of overt HE. The use of psychometric and neurophysiological tests is essential to identify minimal HE, but the authors also felt they can be useful in the assessment of lower grades of overt HE. Gastroenterologists who have appropriate training and facilities/equipment should be prepared to supplement clinical assessment with such tests. If appropriate facilities or trained staff are not available, discussion with a liver specialist or liver unit should be considered. As HE is a decompensation event, such a discussion can be helpful to allow prompt consideration of whether the patient should be evaluated for liver transplantation.

### QuickStroop, a shortened version of encephalApp, detects covert hepatic encephalopathy with similar accuracy within one minute [^84895769]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is associated with poor outcomes but is often not diagnosed because of the time requirement. Psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) is the gold standard against which EncephalApp Stroop has been validated. However, EncephalApp (5 runs each in "Off" and "On" state) can take up to 10 minutes. This study sought to define the smallest number of EncephalApp runs needed for comparable accuracy to the total EncephalApp using CHE on PHES as gold standard.

Methods

A derivation and a validation cohort of outpatients with cirrhosis who underwent PHES (gold standard) and total EncephalApp was recruited. Data were analyzed for individual runs versus total EncephalApp time versus PHES-CHE. The derivation cohort (n = 398) was split into training (n = 299) and test (n = 99) sets. From the training data set a regression model was created with age, gender, education, and various sums of the "Off" settings. After this, a K-fold cross-validation on the test dataset was performed for both total EncephalApp time and individual Off runs and for the validation cohort.

Results

In both cohorts, Off runs 1 + 2 had statistically similar area under the receiver operating curve and P value to the total EncephalApp for PHES-CHE prediction. The adjusted (age, gender, education) regression formula from the derivation cohort showed an accuracy of 84% to diagnose PHES-CHE in the validation cohort. Time for CHE diagnosis decreased from 203.7 (67.82) to 36.8 (11.25) seconds in the derivation and from 178.2 (46.19) to 32.9 (9.94) seconds in the validation cohort.

Conclusions

QuickStroop, which is completed within 1 minute, gives an equivalent ability to predict CHE on the gold standard compared with the entire EncephalApp time.

TIPS in cirrhotic/ACLF patients — Early TIPS within 72 hours post-bleed reduced rebleeding and mortality versus pharmacotherapy/band ligation (rebleeding 23% vs 50%; mortality 14% vs 39%; p < 0.001 for both). In nine RCTs involving 608 cirrhotic patients, early TIPS decreased 1-year mortality (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49–0.96; p = 0.03) and 1-year rebleeding (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.20–0.40; p < 0.001) with no significant difference in hepatic encephalopathy at 1 year (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.72–2.56; p = 0.34). Our systematic review of 11 studies did not demonstrate increased rates of hepatic encephalopathy (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.72–2.56); in patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) greater than 20 or significant hepatic encephalopathy, consider the use of TIPS on a case-by-case basis.

### Detection of minimal hepatic encephalopathy: normalization and optimization of the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score. A neuropsychological and quantified EEG study [^68b85f7b]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) and EEG are used to detect minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). We aimed at standardizing PHES in Italy and comparing Italian, German and Spanish norms in EEG characterized cirrhotic patients.

Methods

PHES was standardized on 228 normal individuals. Repeatability was studied in 128 individuals. One hundred patients with liver cirrhosis underwent EEG and PHES which was computed on the Spanish, German and the Italian norms.

Results

Age and education levels were predictors of psychometric tests; therefore, adjusted Z scores were calculated. Practice effect (p < 0.01) was detected. In the patients, the Italian norms were closer to the Spanish norms (difference −0.14 ± 1.32, p = 0.29) than to the Germans ones (difference 1.97 ± 2.07, p < 0.001). The PHES calculated on the Italian norms was correlated with the EEG mean dominant frequency more closely than the ones calculated on the German and Spanish norms (r = 0.38, r = 0.31, r = 0.33, respectively -p < 0.01). The detection of MHE on the basis of PHES and EEG showed limited agreement (73%, Cohen's K = 0.32).

Conclusions

(i) Valid norms for PHES were produced, (ii) clues for the use of common norms in Latin Countries were found, (iii) different findings between PHES and EEG possibly reflect various features of MHE.

### Loss of skeletal muscle mass affects the incidence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy: a case control study [^33e85bdc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of liver cirrhosis, and reduces quality of life (QOL) for the patient. Minimal HE (MHE) is a neuropsychiatric abnormality without clinical overt symptoms of HE, and is diagnosed using sensitive neuropsychological and neurophysiological examinations. Difficulty in diagnosing MHE aggravates not only QOL, but also prognosis for patients. To improve these outcomes, early detection of MHE is needed.

Ammonia is a typical molecule inducing encephalopathy. In cirrhotic patients, ammonia metabolism is attenuated in the liver. On the other hand, muscle plays an important role in ammonia decomposition. Loss of muscle mass would thus presumably induce deteriorations in ammonia metabolism. In addition, ammonia itself reportedly inhibits protein synthesis in muscle. Sarcopenia is thus an unfavorable condition in terms of ammonia metabolism, since it involves losses of both mass and strength in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, sarcopenia affects clinical outcomes in various liver diseases. The frequency of sarcopenia increases with the progression of liver disease.

Although HE is associated with sarcopenia and muscle mass loss, whether MHE is associated with sarcopenia and/or muscle mass loss remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between MHE and sarcopenia and muscle mass loss in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Psychometric testing strategies for MHE/CHE — Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) is a battery consisting of five paper-pencil tests evaluating cognitive and psychomotor processing speed and visuomotor coordination, and the PHES sum is the total of all subsets; the Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) test defines the threshold as the frequency at which a fused light presented from 60 Hz downward appears to flicker and requires several trials, intact binocular vision, absence of red-green blindness, and specialized equipment; the Continuous Reaction Time (CRT) test relies on repeated registration of motor reaction time to auditory stimuli.

### The ongoing debate of serum ammonia levels in cirrhosis: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^6a6dbffc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum ammonia testing in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been long debated in the field of hepatology. Although central to the pathophysiology of HE, serum ammonia testing is fraught with complexities that can lead to challenges in laboratory collection and interpretation. Although there is some disagreement across guideline organizations regarding routine testing of ammonia in HE, all acknowledge that normal values, although possible in HE, may warrant reconsideration of the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a nuanced approach to ammonia testing in HE. Serum ammonia testing provides little additional benefit in clinical scenarios with a high or low pretest probability for HE. However, if the pretest probability for HE is uncertain, a low ammonia level may reduce the posttest probability of HE. In this scenario, other etiologies of altered mental status should be explored. Future research should focus on developing a standardized approach to serum ammonia collection, processing, and interpretation.
