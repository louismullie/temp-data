## Question

What is treatment for Ureaplasma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for Ureaplasma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism and its clinical significance across populations. Then, I should verify which patient scenarios warrant treatment versus observation. Next, I will review antibiotic options, dosing, and resistance considerations. After that, I need to check special populations such as pregnancy, neonates, and immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I will synthesize practical, scenario-based recommendations and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the organism and its clinical relevance. Ureaplasma species, primarily U. urealyticum and U. parvum, are Mollicutes that lack a cell wall, making them inherently resistant to beta-lactams and vancomycin; they commonly colonize mucosal surfaces of the genital and respiratory tracts and are often commensals, yet in certain contexts they can be pathogenic, particularly in pregnancy, preterm infants, and immunocompromised hosts, and they have been associated with nongonococcal urethritis, chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, though causality remains debated in some settings [^6ec002c4] [^28ce81a5] [^127e8e8b] [^4a950107].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating everyone who tests positive. I need to check when treatment is actually indicated. Routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic colonization are not recommended in general adult populations because colonization is common and clinical disease is not inevitable; treatment is reserved for symptomatic infections or when Ureaplasma is implicated in specific syndromes such as nongonococcal urethritis, invasive disease in immunocompromised hosts, or selected perinatal scenarios where benefits may outweigh risks, whereas asymptomatic colonization in pregnancy or in men with leukocytospermia should not trigger routine therapy without a compelling indication [^127e8e8b] [^39c70fd7] [^ce5dee60] [^d53bf962].

> Next, I should review first-line antibiotic classes and mechanisms. Because Ureaplasma lacks a cell wall, agents that target protein synthesis are key: macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones are the mainstays; macrolides bind the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, tetracyclines inhibit the 30S subunit, and fluoroquinolones inhibit DNA gyrase/topoisomerase IV; susceptibility can vary by species and geographic region, so I need to ensure I consider local patterns and, when available, susceptibility data [^ecad2a7c] [^c98a5a8f] [^105bc52f] [^4a950107].

> I will now examine adult urogenital infections. For symptomatic nongonococcal urethritis where Ureaplasma is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days is a standard regimen with reasonable efficacy; azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or 500 mg once then 250 mg daily for 4 days is an alternative, though persistent detection after therapy is not uncommon and may reflect colonization or tolerance rather than treatment failure, so I should confirm symptoms and consider repeat testing only if symptoms persist or if a high organism load is suspected [^37368640] [^85b4e71b] [^8c767605]. Wait, let me verify the FDA-labeled indication for doxycycline; yes, doxycycline is indicated for nongonococcal urethritis caused by U. urealyticum, which supports its use when Ureaplasma is the target pathogen in NGU [^105bc52f].

> For pregnancy, I need to be cautious. Tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated due to fetal risks, so macrolides are the only feasible class; azithromycin is preferred over erythromycin because of better tolerability and fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is commonly used for preterm premature rupture of membranes where Ureaplasma coverage is desired, though evidence that treating asymptomatic vaginal colonization prevents preterm birth is limited and conflicting, so treatment should be guided by clinical context rather than colonization alone [^32845ac6] [^b4cfe7db] [^937e4cc4]. Let me reconsider whether routine screening helps; large reviews suggest insufficient evidence for routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic vaginal Ureaplasma to prevent preterm birth, reinforcing a selective approach tied to PPROM or symptomatic infection rather than colonization alone [^b4cfe7db] [^937e4cc4].

> Now, neonatal care is where the signal is strongest but also most controversial. In extremely preterm infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization, a short course of intravenous azithromycin at 20 mg/kg daily for 3 days achieved high rates of microbiologic eradication and improved Ureaplasma-free survival in a phase IIb RCT, with a signal toward improved physiological BPD-free survival in the subgroup with lower tract involvement; however, long-term follow-up did not show clear benefits in composite pulmonary or neurodevelopmental outcomes, so routine universal prophylaxis is not supported and treatment should be reserved for colonized infants with lower respiratory tract involvement or high-risk features pending larger trials [^4fea26e0] [^42267525] [^450092c5] [^5acf4889]. Hold on, I should verify dosing and safety; the 3-day IV regimen was well tolerated in the trial, but neonatal azithromycin exposure has been associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in some contexts, so risk-benefit must be individualized and monitored closely in this population [^db22c013].

> For immunocompromised hosts, I need to ensure I do not miss invasive disease. Disseminated Ureaplasma can cause severe infections including hyperammonemia, abscesses, and CNS disease; in these cases, combination therapy with a macrolide plus a tetracycline or a fluoroquinolone is reasonable, and case series and reports support regimens such as doxycycline plus moxifloxacin or doxycycline plus ciprofloxacin, with clinical improvement documented when therapy is directed at Ureaplasma; early suspicion and empiric therapy while awaiting diagnostics are critical given the organism's fastidious nature and frequent culture negativity [^49b5d1ac] [^5803875c] [^f625be9b] [^4a950107]. Let me double-check CNS penetration; doxycycline achieves therapeutic levels in CSF and has been used successfully in neonatal and adult CNS infections, supporting its inclusion when CNS involvement is suspected [^bcc573a5] [^2443ac89].

> I should confirm diagnostic nuances because treatment decisions hinge on accurate detection. Culture is insensitive due to fastidious growth requirements, so PCR is preferred when available; in neonates, sampling both nasal and oral sites early and again around days 7–10 improves detection, and tracheal aspirates better reflect lower respiratory tract involvement; in adults, NAATs on first-void urine or swabs are appropriate when Ureaplasma is suspected in NGU or invasive disease, but routine screening of asymptomatic individuals is discouraged [^30612007] [^ce5dee60] [^39c70fd7]. But wait, what if cultures are negative and suspicion remains high? Metagenomic sequencing has identified Ureaplasma in culture-negative severe infections, suggesting a role for advanced diagnostics in select refractory cases, though this remains investigational and not first-line [^d1fa553d].

> Next, I should review resistance and treatment failure. Persistent detection after therapy is relatively common and may reflect colonization, biofilm phenotypes, or true resistance; macrolide resistance via 23S rRNA mutations occurs and can confer cross-resistance, so if symptoms persist or organism burden is high, switching class or using combination therapy is reasonable, particularly in invasive disease or immunocompromised hosts where failure carries high morbidity [^ecad2a7c] [^c98a5a8f] [^4a950107]. I need to ensure I do not overinterpret persistence as failure in asymptomatic colonization, where retreatment may not change outcomes and could drive resistance [^ce5dee60].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations by scenario. For symptomatic adult NGU, treat with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days or azithromycin 1 g once or 500 mg then 250 mg daily for 4 days, recognizing that Ureaplasma contributes to a subset of NGU and that M. genitalium is a more common and treatment-resistant cause of persistent NGU; if symptoms persist, evaluate for M. genitalium and resistance patterns before repeating antibiotics [^37368640] [^127e8e8b]. For pregnancy with PPROM, azithromycin is appropriate as part of standard PPROM regimens to prolong latency and reduce infectious morbidity, but treating asymptomatic vaginal colonization alone is not recommended to prevent preterm birth outside of PPROM protocols [^32845ac6] [^b4cfe7db]. For extremely preterm infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization, consider a 3-day course of IV azithromycin 20 mg/kg daily in consultation with neonatology, acknowledging that long-term outcome benefits remain unproven and that trials are ongoing [^4fea26e0] [^42267525]. For immunocompromised patients with suspected invasive Ureaplasma, start empiric doxycycline plus a fluoroquinolone such as moxifloxacin while arranging PCR diagnostics, and tailor based on response and susceptibilities [^4a950107] [^5803875c].

> Finally, I should double-check key uncertainties and research gaps so we do not overstate conclusions. The causal role of Ureaplasma in BPD remains debated, with eradication trials showing microbiologic clearance but inconsistent clinical outcome benefits; long-term neurodevelopmental effects of neonatal azithromycin exposure are not yet defined; and optimal screening strategies, timing, and thresholds for treatment in preterm infants still need larger, multicenter trials before routine adoption [^28ce81a5] [^450092c5] [^5acf4889]. Until then, treatment should be individualized to patients with compatible clinical syndromes, high organism burden, or invasive disease, while avoiding reflexive therapy for asymptomatic colonization [^ce5dee60].

---

Treatment for Ureaplasma depends on the clinical context: **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** is first-line for symptomatic urogenital infections in adults [^105bc52f] [^37368640]; **azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose** or 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily on days 2–5 is an alternative, especially if doxycycline is unsuitable [^37368640] [^f64620c2]. In pregnancy, **azithromycin is preferred** because doxycycline and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated; treat only when symptomatic or when there is a clear obstetric indication, as routine screening is not recommended [^39c70fd7] [^b4cfe7db]. For neonatal colonization or infection, **azithromycin 20 mg/kg IV daily for 3 days** eradicates Ureaplasma but does not consistently reduce BPD; reserve for symptomatic or high-risk infants [^4fea26e0] [^42267525] [^450092c5]. Beta-lactams are ineffective; **always consider local resistance patterns** and use susceptibility testing when available [^4a950107] [^105bc52f].

---

## Antibiotic susceptibility and resistance

Ureaplasma lacks a cell wall, rendering **beta-lactam antibiotics ineffective** [^4a950107]. Susceptibility varies by species and geographic region, so therapy should be guided by local resistance data and susceptibility testing when available [^105bc52f].

| **Antibiotic class** | **Agents** | **Susceptibility** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tetracyclines | - Doxycycline <br/> - Minocycline | High susceptibility | First-line for urogenital infections [^105bc52f] [^37368640] |
| Macrolides | - Azithromycin <br/> - Erythromycin | Moderate susceptibility; resistance emerging | Alternative or adjunctive therapy [^37368640] [^ecad2a7c] |
| Fluoroquinolones | - Moxifloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin | Moderate susceptibility | Reserved for refractory cases [^4a950107] [^8c767605] |
| Clindamycin | Clindamycin | Limited susceptibility | Not routinely recommended |

## Treatment recommendations by clinical scenario

---

### Urogenital infections in adults

- **First-line therapy**: Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^105bc52f] [^37368640].
- **Alternative therapy**: Azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily on days 2–5 [^37368640] [^f64620c2].
- **Persistent or recurrent infections**: Consider moxifloxacin 400 mg orally daily for 7–10 days, guided by susceptibility testing [^4a950107] [^8c767605].

---

### Pregnancy

- **Preferred agent**: Azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily on days 2–5.
- **Rationale**: Doxycycline and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal risks.
- **Indications**: Treat only symptomatic infections or when there is a clear obstetric indication (e.g. PPROM); routine screening is not recommended [^39c70fd7] [^b4cfe7db].

---

### Neonatal colonization and infection

- **Azithromycin**: 20 mg/kg IV daily for 3 days [^4fea26e0] [^42267525].
- **Clinical evidence**: Eradicates Ureaplasma but does not consistently reduce BPD; reserve for symptomatic or high-risk infants [^450092c5] [^5acf4889].
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances and QT prolongation [^db22c013].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **combination therapy** with doxycycline plus a fluoroquinolone (e.g. moxifloxacin) is recommended for severe or disseminated infections [^4a950107] [^5803875c]. Therapy should be individualized based on susceptibility testing and clinical response [^105bc52f].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence

Clinical cure rates vary by antibiotic and patient population: **doxycycline achieves ~76–80% cure** in urogenital infections, whereas azithromycin is slightly less effective due to emerging resistance [^85b4e71b] [^8c767605]. Recurrence is common, particularly in pregnancy and immunocompromised hosts, necessitating close follow-up and repeat testing when symptoms persist [^2768f647] [^5803875c].

---

## Safety considerations and side effects

- **Doxycycline**: Gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, contraindicated in pregnancy and children under 8 years.
- **Azithromycin**: Gastrointestinal disturbances, QT prolongation, hepatotoxicity.
- **Fluoroquinolones**: QT prolongation, tendon rupture, CNS effects; use cautiously in elderly patients and those with cardiac risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Diagnostic testing**: PCR is the most sensitive method for detection; culture is slow and less reliable [^30612007] [^d1fa553d].
- **Resistance monitoring**: Increasing macrolide resistance has been reported, necessitating susceptibility testing in refractory cases [^32845ac6] [^ecad2a7c].
- **Public health**: Sexual partners of symptomatic patients should be notified and treated to prevent reinfection and transmission [^notfound].

---

Treatment for Ureaplasma should be **tailored to the clinical context**, with doxycycline as first-line therapy for adult urogenital infections and azithromycin preferred in pregnancy. Neonatal and immunocompromised cases require specialized regimens and close monitoring.

### Perinatal infections with Ureaplasma [^6ec002c4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma species are increasingly recognized as relevant pathogens in prenatal, perinatal and postnatal morbidity. They are commonly found as commensals on the mucous membranes of the lower urogenital tract of pregnant women, but when ascending, they can cause bacterial vaginosis, chorioamnionitis, premature birth and postnatal morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and early-onset neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The detection of Ureaplasma species is challenging and is not covered by routine diagnostics, and current empiric antibiotic treatment in neonates suspected of infection is not directed against Ureaplasma species. The aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiology of Ureaplasma infections, the clinical consequences and the current difficulties in diagnosis and treatment by providing an overview of the current literature.

### Ureaplasma infection and neonatal lung disease [^a76defe9]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Infection with the ureaplasmas may occur in utero or perinatally in prematurely born infants. For some infants, infection with these organisms triggers a vigorous pro-inflammatory response in the lungs and increases the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). At present, there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to determine whether antibiotic treatment of Ureaplasma has any influence on the development of BPD and its comorbidities. Future investigation in the context of well-designed, adequately powered controlled clinical trials should focus on determining whether treatment of ureaplasmal infection lessens lung inflammation, decreases rates of BPD, and improves long-term, neurodevelopmental outcome.

### Ureaplasma – are you sitting comfortably? [^384ceec5]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The role of Ureaplasma spp. in human disease has been controversial, as these bacteria are commonly isolated as part of the normal genital tract flora. Ureaplasma has been shown to have a causal role in urogenital infections and is associated with significant foetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when infection occurs during the perinatal period. Although rare, invasive Ureaplasma infection (meningitis, renal abscess, mediastinitis and arthritis) has also been reported in both adults and children. This review outlines the unique microbiological features and various clinical presentations of Ureaplasma infection. It also discusses the treatment options, which in the neonatal period can be particularly challenging.

### Antibiotics for Ureaplasma in the vagina in pregnancy [^937e4cc4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a significant obstetric problem in high-income countries. Genital infection including ureaplasmas are suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes and results in prolongation of pregnancy and lowers the risks of maternal and neonatal infection. However, antibiotics may be beneficial earlier in pregnancy to eradicate potentially causative agents.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess whether antibiotic treatment of pregnant women with ureaplasma in the vagina reduces the incidence of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (April 2003).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared any antibiotic regimen with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with ureaplasma detected in the vagina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

One trial involving 1071 women was included. Of these, 644 randomly received antibiotic treatment (174 erythromycin estolate, 224 erythromycin sterate, and 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) and 427 received placebo. This trial did not report data on preterm birth. Incidence of low birthweight less than 2500 grams was only evaluated for erythromycin (combined) (n = 398) compared to placebo (n = 427) and there was no statistically significant difference between those treated and those not treated (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). In regards to side-effects sufficient to stop treatment, data were available for all women, and there were no statistically significant differences between any antibiotic (combined) and the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to show whether giving antibiotics to women with ureaplasma in the vagina will prevent preterm birth.

### The role of Ureaplasma species in prenatal and postnatal morbidity of preterm infants: current concepts [^28ce81a5]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma species are considered commensals of the adult urogenital tract. Yet, in pregnancy, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum have been associated with chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. In preterm infants, Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization has been correlated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other complications of prematurity. Controversies on the impact of Ureaplasma exposure on neonatal morbidity, however, remain, and recommendations for screening practices and therapeutic management in preterm infants are missing.

Summary

In this review, we outline clinical and experimental evidence of Ureaplasma-driven fetal and neonatal morbidity, critically examining inconsistencies across some of the existing studies. We explore underlying mechanisms of Ureaplasma-associated neonatal morbidity and discuss gaps in the current understanding including the interplay between Ureaplasma and the maternal urogenital tract and the preterm airway microbiome. Ultimately, we highlight the importance of adequate diagnostics and review the potential efficacy of anti-infective therapies.

Key Messages

There is strong evidence that perinatal Ureaplasma exposure is causally related to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and there are conclusive data of the role of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of neonatal central nervous system infection. Observational and experimental findings indicate immunomodulatory capacities that might promote an increased risk of secondary infections. The burden of Ureaplasma exposure is inversely related to gestational age - leaving the tiniest babies at highest risk. A better knowledge of contributing pathogen and host factors and modulating conditions remains paramount to define screening and treatment recommendations allowing early intervention in preterm infants at risk.

### And its role in adverse perinatal outcomes: a review [^6d8b5784]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Human Ureaplasma species are the most common microbes found in amniotic fluid and in the placenta after preterm birth, and have previously been correlated with chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, among other adverse birth and neonatal outcomes. Although these correlations exist, there still remains little explanation as to whether Ureaplasma plays a pathogenic role in the development of neonatal disease. In addition, Ureaplasma species are not usually identified on routine culture as they require special culture methods because of their fastidious growth requirements. Treatment of Ureaplasma with macrolides has been shown to effectively eradicate the bacteria in pregnant women and infants. However, it is unclear whether this leads to improved neonatal morbidity and mortality, or whether these generally represent commensal organisms. This review will synthesize the current perspectives about the proposed mechanisms of pathogenicity of Ureaplasma bacteria, its links to poor neonatal outcomes, and the role of screening and treatment in current clinical practice.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^4fea26e0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Respiratory tract colonisation with the genital mycoplasmas Ureaplasma parvum and U. urealyticum is an independent risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low gestational age infants.
The azalide antibiotic azithromycin has anti-inflammatory properties and exhibits high potency against Ureaplasma isolates in vitro.
Open-label pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics studies of single and multiple dose aizithromycin indicate that 20 mg/kg × 3 days was most effective in eradicating respiratory tract Ureaplasma in preterms.

What this study adds?

In this randomised clinical trial that included 121 infants < 29 weeks' gestation, Ureaplasma -free survival was significantly higher in the azithromycin compared with the placebo group.
Ureaplasma was eradicated in all colonised infants assigned to azithromycin compared with 16% in colonised infants assigned to placebo.
Since neonatal mortality and morbidity was concentrated in infants with lower respiratory tract Ureasplasma colonisation, this population should be targeted in future phase III randomised controlled trial.

### Efficacy of standard therapies against Ureaplasma species and persistence among men with non-gonococcal urethritis enrolled in a randomised controlled trial [^8c767605]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), but not Ureaplasma parvum (UP), has been associated with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), but little is known about species-specific responses to standard therapies. We examined species-specific treatment outcomes and followed men with treatment failure for 9weeks.

Methods

From May 2007 to July 2011, men aged ≥ 16 attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (urethral discharge or urethral symptoms plus ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leucocytes /high-powered field) enrolled in a double-blind, randomised trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1g) + placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100mg twice a day ×7days) + placebo azithromycin. Ureaplasma were detected in culture followed by species-specific PCR. Outcomes were assessed at 3, 6 and 9weeks. At 3weeks, men with persistent Ureaplasma detection received 'reverse therapy' (e.g., active doxycycline if they first received active azithromycin). At 6weeks, persistently positive men received moxifloxacin (400mg×7days).

Results

Of 490 men, 107 (22%) and 60 (12%) were infected with UU-2 and UP, respectively, and returned at 3weeks. Persistent detection was similar for UU-2-infected men initially treated with azithromycin or doxycycline (25% vs. 31%; p = 0.53), but differed somewhat for men with UP (45% vs. 24%; p = 0.11). At 6weeks, 57% of UU-2-infected and 63% of UP-infected men who received both drugs had persistent detection. Failure after moxifloxacin occurred in 30% and 36%, respectively. Persistent detection of UU-2 or UP was not associated with signs/symptoms of NGU.

Conclusions

Persistent detection after treatment with doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin was common for UU and UP, but not associated with persistent urethritis.

Trial Registration Number

NCT00358462.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^b18cd813]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Infection — although organisms such as Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, chlamydia, Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus have been identified more frequently in women with sporadic miscarriages, there are no convincing data that infections cause RPL; therefore there are no clear indications for routine testing for these organisms in the RPL evaluation, and given the lack of prospective studies linking any infectious agent to recurrent early pregnancy loss, any use of antibiotics is not supported by the evidence.

### Antibiotics for Ureaplasma in the vagina in pregnancy [^b4cfe7db]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem contributing to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Heavy vaginal ureaplasma colonisation is suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat infections and have been used to treat pregnant women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, resulting in some short-term improvements. However, the benefit of using antibiotics in early pregnancy to treat heavy vaginal colonisation is unclear.

Objectives

To assess whether antibiotic treatment of pregnant women with heavy vaginal ureaplasma colonisation reduces the incidence of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic regimen with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with ureaplasma detected in the vagina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included one trial, involving 1071 women. Of these, 644 women between 22 weeks and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to one of three groups of antibiotic treatment (n = 174 erythromycin estolate, n = 224 erythromycin stearate, and n = 246 clindamycin hydrochloride) or a placebo (n = 427). Preterm birth data was not reported in this trial. Incidence of low birthweight less than 2500 grams was only evaluated for erythromycin (combined, n = 398) compared to placebo (n = 427) and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.07). There were no statistically significant differences in side effects sufficient to stop treatment between either group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.85).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to assess whether pregnant women who have vaginal colonisation with ureaplasma should be treated with antibiotics to prevent preterm birth. Preterm birth is a significant perinatal problem. Upper genital tract infections, including ureaplasmas, are suspected of playing a role in preterm birth and preterm rupture of the membranes. Antibiotics are used to treat women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes; this may result in prolongation of pregnancy and lowers the risks of maternal and neonatal infection. However, antibiotics may be beneficial earlier in pregnancy to eradicate potentially causative agents.

### The significance of Ureaplasma urealyticum as a pathogenic agent in the paediatric population [^a71e252e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ureaplasma urealyticum is a frequent commensal in the lower genital tract of sexually active women. It may be transmitted perinatally from the colonized mother to her offspring, often resulting in prematurity and neonatal disease. The microorganism also sustains a causative role for infectious diseases in older children.

Recent Findings

U. urealyticum infection can be diagnosed by culture, polymerase chain reaction, and the detection of specific antibodies. Neonatal infection has been implicated in various pathological conditions including pneumonia, chronic lung disease, central nervous system disorders, sepsis, osteomyelitis and even death. Older children may present with wheezing, pneumonitis, pertussis-like syndrome and different forms of arthritis. Large well-designed trials have demonstrated that the regular administration of antibiotics to vaginally colonized women are not beneficial in terms of preventing preterm labour. Macrolide-containing antibiotic regimens are, however, recommended for preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Erythromycin treatment of ureaplasma respiratory colonized premature infants shows no reduction in the incidence of chronic lung disease. Treatment of central nervous system infections, sepsis and arthritides includes tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively.

Summary

This review covers recent evidence concerning the role of U. urealyticum as a pathogen during childhood. It also includes an evaluation of contemporary diagnostic techniques and optimal therapeutic approaches.

### Ureaplasma: pathogen or passenger in neonatal meningitis? [^42a29941]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The significance of Ureaplasma species as pathogens in neonatal meningitis remains contentious. Using an illustrative case of a premature infant with Ureaplasma parvum meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid cultures and both specific and 16s rDNA polymerase chain reaction, we discuss the epidemiology of Ureaplasma species, the difficulties involved in diagnosis and establishing pathogenicity, and the challenges in defining appropriate treatment.

### Chorioamnionitis: from pathogenesis to treatment [^ff3dc5f5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Chorioamnionitis refers to inflammation of the amniochorionic membrane, and is a significant cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity. Chorioamnionitis most often occurs as a result of ascending infection, and is commonly associated with premature rupture of the membranes. Chorioamnionitis is generally the result of a polymicrobial infection, with Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Gram-negative anaerobes being frequent causative organisms. The mainstay of treatment includes antimicrobial agents, antipyretics, expedition of delivery and supportive care. Further research is required to identify mechanistic pathways and early biomarkers that accurately predict women at higher risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and that can thus lead to the development of additional treatment and prevention strategies.

### Diagnostic value of metagenomic next generation sequencing for Ureaplasma urealyticum infection: a case report [^d1fa553d]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma urealyticum has high nutritional requirements for culture, and it requires special tools for identification. Theoretically, metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) can be used to detect many pathogens in clinical specimens, especially for complex infectious diseases with rare and atypical causes. Here, our patient developed severe pneumonia caused by U. urealyticum infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the etiology is unclear. After continuous negative culture, U. urealyticum was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by mNGS, and azithromycin was used. Because of the difficulty in its diagnosis, diagnosis and treatment of extragenital U. urealyticum infection is challenging. In addition, many broad-spectrum antibiotics are ineffective against this pathogen because it lacks a cell wall. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing further complications and deaths.

### Disseminated Ureaplasma infection as a cause of fatal hyperammonemia in humans [^49b5d1ac]. Science Translational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia syndrome is a fatal complication affecting immunosuppressed patients. Frequently refractory to treatment, it is characterized by progressive elevations in serum ammonia of unknown etiology, ultimately leading to cerebral edema and death. In mammals, ammonia produced during amino acid metabolism is primarily cleared through the hepatic production of urea, which is eliminated in the kidney. Ureaplasma species, commensals of the urogenital tract, are Mollicutes dependent on urea hydrolysis to ammonia and carbon dioxide for energy production. We hypothesized that systemic infection with Ureaplasma species might pose a unique challenge to human ammonia metabolism by liberating free ammonia resulting in the hyperammonemia syndrome. We used polymerase chain reaction, specialized culture, and molecular resistance profiling to identify systemic Ureaplasma infection in lung transplant recipients with hyperammonemia syndrome, but did not detect it in any lung transplant recipients with normal ammonia concentrations. Administration of Ureaplasma-directed antimicrobials to patients with hyperammonemia syndrome resulted in biochemical and clinical resolution of the disorder. Relapse in one patient was accompanied by recurrent Ureaplasma bacteremia with antimicrobial resistance. Our results provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between Ureaplasma infection and hyperammonemia, suggesting a need to test for this organism and provide empiric antimicrobial treatment while awaiting microbiological confirmation.

### An unusual and difficult to detect cause of infection in two trauma patients [^4a950107]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding optimal antimicrobial selection is limited by lack of standardized methods and clinical breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Additionally, clinical data on the treatment of these organisms are limited to case reports and series, with limited data on clinical or microbiological response. Beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin are inactive because they target the cell wall. Myoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. are generally susceptible to agents that inhibit protein synthesis. Fluoroquinolones, which are bactericidal against mycoplasmas should be considered for empiric treatment. Doxycycline should also be considered, although resistance may be increasing. It is reasonable to use combination therapy (eg, moxifloxacin and doxycycline).

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^d53bf962]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Similarly, asymptomatic carrying of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and Mycoplasma hominis (MH) is common, most people will not develop into diseases, and there is not enough evidence to prove that it is beneficial to detect and treat these infections, so it is not recommended to carry out routine detection and treatment for asymptomatic or symptomatic men and women. On the other hand, some studies suggest that the presence of UU and MH is related to the abnormal sperm parameters, sperm vitality and Progressive motility of UU infected men were significantly lower than those of uninfected men, and the mean sperm concentration was also lower. The relationship between UU infection and sperm quality or male fertility is also debated.

Therefore, we designed this study to find more evidence of the effect of asymptomatic leukocytospermia and UU infection on sperm quality and whether antibiotic therapy is beneficial.

### Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma screening for pregnant individuals who are at high risk for preterm birth [^2768f647]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to examine gestational age at delivery according to Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma cervical culture results and whether pregnant individuals received antibiotics.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study at a single academic institution where all pregnant individuals with risk factors for preterm birth including those with a history of preterm birth, recurrent pregnancy loss, or pregnancy requiring cervical cerclage were included. We plotted Kaplan-Meier curves to investigate the association between the gestational age at delivery and Ureaplasma culture results (negative; positive and treated; or positive but did not receive the treatment). A Cox proportional regression model was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), controlling for confounders. The main outcome was age at delivery. Analyses were repeated for Mycoplasma culture.

Results

Of 607 individuals, 258 (42.5%) had a negative Ureaplasma culture, 308 (50.7%) had a positive Ureaplasma culture and received treatment, and 41 (6.8%) had a positive Ureaplasma culture and did not receive treatment. Compared with those who had a positive Ureaplasma culture but did not receive treatment, those who had a negative Ureaplasma culture did not have a decreased risk (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.74–1.44). Compared with those who had a positive Ureaplasma culture but did not receive treatment, those who had a positive Ureaplasma culture and received treatment did not have a decreased risk (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.66–1.27). The treatment failure rate of Ureaplasma after treatment was 78.6% (95% CI: 72.8–83.7%). Overall, the findings of Mycoplasma were similar.

Conclusion

Routine ureaplasma/mycoplasma cervical culture is not recommended for pregnant individuals who are at high risk for preterm birth.

Key Points

· Ureaplasma/mycoplasma species are isolated in patients with preterm birth. · High ureaplasma/mycoplasma recurrence rate despite treatment with antibiotics. · Treatment of patient and partner did not improve gestational age at delivery.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^42267525]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test whether azithromycin eradicates Ureaplasma from the respiratory tract in preterm infants.

Design

Prospective, phase IIb randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Seven level III–IV US, academic, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

Patients

Infants 24 0–28 6 weeks' gestation (stratified 24 0–26 6; 27 0–28 6 weeks) randomly assigned within 4 days following birth from July 2013 to August 2016.

Interventions

Intravenous azithromycin 20 mg/kg or an equal volume of D5W (placebo) every 24 hours for 3 days.

Main outcome measures

The primary efficacy outcome was Ureaplasma -free survival. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, Ureaplasma clearance, physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, comorbidities of prematurity and duration of respiratory support.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one randomised participants (azithromycin: n = 60; placebo: n = 61) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (mean gestational age 26.2 ± 1.4 weeks). Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive (azithromycin: n = 19; placebo: n = 25). Ureaplasma -free survival was 55/60 (92% (95% CI 82% to 97%)) for azithromycin compared with 37/61 (61% (95% CI 48% to 73%)) for placebo. Mortality was similar comparing the two treatment groups (5/60 (8%) vs 6/61 (10%)). Azithromycin effectively eradicated Ureaplasma in all azithromycin-assigned colonised infants, but 21/25 (84%) Ureaplasma -colonised participants receiving placebo were culture positive at one or more follow-up timepoints. Most of the neonatal mortality and morbidity was concentrated in 21 infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation. In a subgroup analysis, physiological BPD-free survival was 5/10 (50%) (95% CI 19% to 81%) among azithromycin-assigned infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation versus 2/11 (18%) (95% CI 2% to 52%) in placebo-treated infants.

Conclusion

A 3-day azithromycin regimen effectively eradicated respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation in this study.

### Mycoplasma genitalium-STI treatment guidelines… [^4cccc100]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

697, 702, 945–953). Treatment with azithromycin alone has been reported to select for resistance, with treatment of macrolide-susceptible infections with a 1-g dose of azithromycin resulting in selection of resistant-strain populations in 10%–12% of cases. Two-stage therapy approaches, ideally using resistance-guided therapy, are recommended for treatment. Resistance-guided therapy has demonstrated cure rates of > 90% and should be used whenever possible; however, it requires access to macrolide-resistance testing. As part of this approach, doxycycline is provided as initial empiric therapy, which reduces the organism load and facilitates organism clearance, followed by macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium infections treated with high-dose azithromycin; macrolide-resistant infections are treated with moxifloxacin. M.

genitaliumResistance Testing is Available If macrolide sensitive: Doxycycline100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin1 g orally initial dose, followed by 500 mg orally once daily for 3 additional days. If macrolide resistant: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days M. genitaliumResistance Testing is Not Available If M. genitalium is detected by an FDA-cleared NAAT: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by. moxifloxacin400 mg orally once daily for 7 days Although the majority of M. genitalium strains are sensitive to moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and adverse side effects and cost should be considered with this regimen.

In settings without access to resistance testing and when moxifloxacin cannot be used, an alternative regimen can be considered, based on limited data: doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin and a test of cure 21 days after completion of therapy.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^3a9bf3e3]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection, as well as asymptomatic leukocytospermia, whether it has effect on semen parameters and whether it needs screening and treatment is still a confusing and controversial topic for clinicians.

Methods

Among 1530 adult males who visited Guilin People's Hospital due to infertility, 295 were diagnosed with asymptomatic leukocytospermia, and 95 were further screened for UU-positive. 81 UU-positive asymptomatic leukocytospermia patients received 7-day or 14-day treatment plan with doxycycline, and 70 cases were cured. The semen parameters of non-leukocytospermia, leukocytospermia, UU-positive leukocytospermia and UU-negative leukocytospermia groups were compared, and the differences between the two treatment plans and the semen parameters before UU treatment and 1 month after UU-cured were compared.

Results

Compared with non-leukocytospermia patients, the sperm concentration, progressive motility (PR), and normal morphology of patients with leukocytospermia decreased, while those with UU-positive leukocytospermia performed more significantly. The PR, total motility, and normal morphology of UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were significantly lower than those of UU-negative leukocytospermia patients (all p < 0.001). The UU cure rates of the 7-day and 14-day treatment plan with doxycycline was 84.62% and 89.66% (p = 0.738), respectively, and the sperm concentration, PR, total motility, and normal morphology of the cured UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were all increased after 1 month (p = 0.001, p = 0.022, p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively).

Conclusions

It is significant to screen and treat UU infection in asymptomatic leukocytospermia for improving sperm quality. Where appropriate, the 7-day treatment plan with doxycycline may be a good choice.

### Method for identification and bacterial count quantification in a case of Ureaplasma meningitis [^abdf0f35]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine Ureaplasma infection is associated with chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. The difficulty of detecting Ureaplasma species by conventional culture methods makes definitive diagnosis of clinical infection challenging. Thus far, quantitative tests for Ureaplasma have been performed using adult cervical samples, amniotic fluid, and pediatric bronchial secretions, but quantification of bacterial count in central nervous system infections caused by Ureaplasma species has not been unreported. We report a case of culture-negative Ureaplasma meningitis in a preterm infant in whom novel techniques to identify this pathogen and quantify bacterial count were effective. We suspected meningitis based on a sustained reduction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose levels. Multiple CSF cultures were sterile. We confirmed infection by Ureaplasma species using the melting temperature mapping method. Treatment with erythromycin and ciprofloxacin resulted in a gradual decrease in the bacterial count in the CSF to 0. Our study highlights the potential utility of the melting temperature mapping method as a new diagnostic tool for culture-negative Ureaplasma meningitis and establishes the utility of serial quantification of bacterial count to monitor response to therapy.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^fa4fb868]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Asymptomatic leukocytospermia may have some effect on sperm parameters, which seem to be mainly manifested in sperm concentration. When patients with asymptomatic leukocytospermia are infected with UU at the same time, the effect on sperm quality is more obvious and serious, which can involve multiple aspects of semen parameters such as PR, total motor ability and normal morphological. It is significant to screen and treat UU infection in asymptomatic leukocytospermia for improving sperm quality. Where appropriate, we recommend the 7-day treatment plan with doxycycline.

### Advances in the understanding and treatment of male urethritis [^dd9deeeb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are well-documented urethral pathogens, and the literature supporting Mycoplasma genitalium as an etiology of urethritis is growing. Trichomonas vaginalis and viral pathogens (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and adenovirus) can cause urethritis, particularly in specific subpopulations. New data are emerging regarding the potential role of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria in urethritis, although results are inconsistent regarding the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma urealyticum in men. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma parvum do not appear to be pathogens. Men with suspected urethritis should undergo evaluation to confirm urethral inflammation and etiologic cause. Although nucleic acid amplification testing would detect N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis (or T. vaginalis if utilized), there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical test for M. genitalium available in the United States at this time. The varied etiologies of urethritis and lack of diagnostic options for some organisms present treatment challenges in the clinical setting.

### Use of microbial cultures and antibiotics in the prevention of infection-associated preterm birth [^cc9edf91]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to summarize recent evidence regarding infection-associated preterm birth and to make appropriate recommendations. Antepartum treatment of lower genital tract infection or bacterial colonization has been found to reduce the incidence of preterm birth in the case of asymptomatic bacteriuria and bacterial vaginosis in selected patients but has been proved to be ineffective for vaginal colonization with organisms such as Ureaplasma urealyticum and group B streptococcus.

Study Design

This is a clinical opinion based on a review of recent data related to 1) the association between lower genital tract infection and preterm birth and 2) antibiotic trials to prevent preterm birth.

Results

Antepartum treatment of lower genital tract infection or bacterial colonization has been found to reduce the incidence of preterm birth in the case of asymptomatic bacteriuria and bacterial vaginosis in selected patients, but has been proven to be ineffective for vaginal colonization with organisms such as Ureaplasma urealyticum and group B streptococcus. Large well-designed trials have shown that the routine administration of antibiotics to women with preterm labor and intact membranes is not beneficial; however, antibiotic regimens including macrolides are recommended for preterm premature rupture of the membranes.

Conclusion

Large well-designed trials have shown that the routine administration of antibiotics to women with preterm labor and intact membranes is not beneficial; however, antibiotic regimens that include macrolides are recommended for preterm premature rupture of the membranes.

### Urethritis and cervicitis-STI treatment guidelines… [^37368640]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment Ideally, treatment should be pathogen based; however, diagnostic information might not be immediately available. Presumptive treatment should be initiated at NGU diagnosis. Doxycycline is highly effective for chlamydial urethral infections and is also effective for chlamydial infections of the rectum; it also has some activity against. Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days Azithromycin 1 g, orally in a single dose OR Azithromycin 500 mg orally in a single dose; then 250 mg orally daily for 4 days. To maximize compliance with recommended therapies, medications should be dispensed on-site at the clinic, and, regardless of the number of doses involved in the regimen, the first dose should be directly observed. Erythromycin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its gastrointestinal side effects and dosing frequency. Levofloxacin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its inferior efficacy, especially for M. genitalium. If M.

genitalium resistance testing is available it should be performed, and the results should be used to guide therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days should be used. The rationale for this approach is that although not curative, doxycycline decreases the M. genitalium bacterial load, thereby increasing likelihood of moxifloxacin success. Higher doses of azithromycin have not been effective for M. genitalium after azithromycin treatment failures. Men with persistent or recurrent NGU after treatment for M. genitalium or T. vaginalis should be referred to an infectious disease or urology specialist. Treatment Multiple factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for.

Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days * Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high. Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^c1394b3f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Efficacy analysis

The Ureaplasma -free survival was higher in the azithromycin group (92% (95% CI 82% to 97%)) compared with the placebo group (61% (95% CI 48% to 73%)) (p < 0.001) (table 2) and was sustained in analyses stratified by race (online supplementary table 1). For Ureaplasma -positive infants, Ureaplasma -free survival was higher in the azithromycin group (16/19 (84%), (95% CI 60% to 97%)) than in the placebo group (3/25 (12%), (95% CI 3% to 31%)) (p < 0.001) (table 2). The proportion of infants who survived until discharge was similar in each treatment group (92% vs 90%, table 2). All follow-up cultures were negative in the azithromycin group, but 21/25 (84%) of colonised placebo subjects were culture positive at one or more follow-up time point (online supplementary figure S2). Seven azithromycin-assigned participants were PCR positive, but culture-negative post-treatment.

Secondary outcomes

Two-thirds (12/19) of participants who met criteria for RAC, failed and were classified as physiological BPD. Three infants did not have a RAC completed so they could not be classified. There were no significant differences between treatment groups for the entire cohort or stratified by Ureaplasma colonisation status (table 2) or race (online supplementary table 1S) in overall survival, physiological BPD-free survival, frequency BPD by any classification or other secondary outcomes.

### Prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in women with chronic urinary symptoms [^f9bcb12b]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the prevalence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in women experiencing chronic urinary symptoms.

Methods

Urine, vaginal, and urethral samples obtained from 153 women presenting with chronic voiding symptoms were tested for the presence of pathogens including U. urealyticum and M. hominis. Patients with positive cultures for Mycoplasma were treated with a single dose of 1 g azithromycin and followed up 1 month after therapy. Patients with persistent infection received 100 mg doxycycline orally, twice daily for 7 days, according to the results of the susceptibility test. The patients were asked to rate the severity of their symptoms at their initial visit and after treatment.

Results

U. urealyticum was detected from ≥ 1 site in 81 women (52.9%), and M. hominis was detected in 5 patients (3.3%), always in association with U. urealyticum. At follow-up, 77 patients (95.1%) initially positive for Mycoplasma had negative cultures; the cultures of 4 (4.9%) remained positive for U. urealyticum and became negative after the second therapeutic regimen. A significant improvement in all symptoms was observed in women with positive cultures for Mycoplasma after therapy.

Conclusions

A high prevalence of U. urealyticum was observed in women with unexplained chronic voiding symptoms. Testing for the presence of U. urealyticum and M. hominis in the urogenital tract could prove valuable for the management of a significant percentage of chronic urinary symptoms in women through appropriate treatment.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^6863f480]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with a reduced risk of BPD. These sort of contradictory findings indicate that azithromycin treatment might work by other mechanisms than eradicating Ureaplasma, including but not strict to the anti-inflammatory effect of azithromycin. Viscardi et al. had previously reported that administration of azithromycin at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg for three days effectively eradicated Ureaplasma from the respiratory tract and tended to reduce BPD. However, the effect was not statistically significant, which could be attributed to the under power of the study. The same authors reported an increased rate of death or serious respiratory morbidities in Ureaplasma positive infants (58%) compared to negative infants (21%) in a 2-years-follow-up study of the trial, indicating a compromised lung function in Ureaplasma positive infants.

We acknowledge that the clinical setting regarding Ureaplasma, azithromycin and BPD is highly complicated. The complicated issues include the association between Ureaplasma and BPD, azithromycin and pneumonia resolution, the influence of pneumonia on BPD, the effect of azithromycin on the development of BPD, etc. Addressing these issues would be challenging even in a series of well-designed prospective studies. However, we hope the findings in our study could add to the body of evidence regarding these topics. There could be some confounders compromising the accuracy of CXR assessment. A severe RDS might interfere with the initial assessment of CXR (20% in this cohort), while other concurrent pulmonary infections and PDA might impede the second accurate assessment of CXR. Furthermore, sampling from tracheal aspirates would be more accurate than nasopharyngeal swabs in PCR testing for Ureaplasma.

In summary, we found that radiographic improvement following azithromycin treatment was associated with a reduced risk for BPD in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants. However, these data need to be interpreted with caution since potential confounders might affect the accuracy of the CXR evaluation.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^ec0d1737]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication in premature infants and remains prevalent in extremely preterm infants despite great advances in perinatal care. The pathogenesis of BPD is unclear and multifactorial, including but not restricted to oxygen toxicity, mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury and infection/inflammation. Ureaplasma spp. has been reported as one of the earliest microbiotas colonized in the airway of premature infants, potentially contributing to the inflammatory and fibrotic profile of BPD. Ureaplasma spp. has two species, Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum, with 14 known serovars. Both species were linked with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), chorioamnionitis and preterm labor. The association between Ureaplasma and BPD was first discussed by Holtzman et al. in 1989, who concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove the association. Several studies also investigated the association between Ureaplasma and BPD, yielding conflicting findings. Castro-Alcaraz and colleagues found the pattern of Ureaplasma colonization may be related to BPD, given that infants with persistent Ureaplasma had an increased risk of BPD. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, pulmonary colonization with Ureaplasma increased the risk of BPD by three folds in premature infants. However, a recent randomized trial reported that the eradication of Ureaplasma by azithromycin failed to decrease the risk of BPD. Although the trial was underpowered to detect a difference in BPD due to funding problems, it indirectly supports the idea that Ureaplasma was not associated with BPD. Noticeably, the detection and diagnosis criteria of Ureaplasma and BPD vary greatly among these studies, which may partially explain the elusive association between Ureaplasma and BPD.

In clinical practice, we observed that infants at a radiographically infectious status display a different respiratory clinical course than those with colonization alone. Inspired by Castro-Alcaraz and colleagues who found the pattern of Ureaplasma colonization was essential, this study aims to investigate the association between the proven infection of Ureaplasma with BPD and to evaluate the effect of azithromycin treatment on BPD.

### Do we need to reconsider our antibiotic regimen for preterm premature rupture of membranes? Pathogens and perinatal outcome in PPROM [^32845ac6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The third relevant pathogen in our cohort were Ureaplasma species. They were by far the most common pathogens in the vaginal swab, detected in every fourth woman with PPROM < 34 + 0 and in every fifth woman with PPROM ≥ 34 + 0 weeks of gestation. Additionally, they were the most frequently detected pathogens in the placental swab in case of chorioamnionitis. The role of Ureaplasma species in human disease is controversial as it is considered to be part of the normal urogenital flora. In non-pregnant women routine testing or treatment in case of asymptomatic carriage is not recommended. However, today there is considerable evidence linking the detection of Ureaplasma species in pregnant women with adverse outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, PPROM and chorioamnionitis. The detection of Ureaplasma species is not only to be understood in the sense of a co-pathogen that can be detected together with the causative agent, but the presence of Ureaplasma species themselves in the amniotic fluid or placental tissue can lead to synthesis and release of prostaglandins and metalloproteases by stimulating cytokine production and chemotaxis of neutrophils, which subsequently leads to cervical ripening, PROM and preterm labor. In addition, through either intrauterine infection or intrapartum transmission, neonates can acquire Ureaplasma infection, which is associated with several serious sequelae. Thus, our findings underline the importance of administering macrolides such as azithromycin in case of PPROM. In recent years, increasing antimicrobial resistance to standard antibiotic therapies (including macrolides) has also been reported for Ureaplasma species. In our cohort, Ureaplasma species could be detected in placental swabs despite an antibiotic therapy with azithromycin after diagnosis of PPROM. However, while Ureaplasma species were the most frequently detected pathogens in vaginal swabs (in 25% of cases of PPROM < 34 + 0 weeks and 20.8% of cases of PPROM ≥ 34 + 0 weeks), they were only detected in 8.8% and 7.1% of cases of PPROM < 34 + 0 weeks and ≥ 34 + 0 weeks, respectively, in placental swabs. This suggests at least some efficacy of the administered azithromycin. In general, four classes of antibiotics are recognized for the treatment of Ureaplasma infections, namely tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and chloramphenicol. Given the teratogenic risk of tetracyclines and the potential fetal toxicity of fluoroquinolones and chloramphenicol, therapeutic options in pregnant women are mainly restricted to macrolides, especially as first-line choice. Regarding whether one macrolide is superior to another in case of PPROM, Seaman et al. found in their systematic review and meta-analysis that the administration of azithromycin was associated with a similar latency period but a lower rate of clinical chorioamnionitis than the administration of erythromycin. The AWMF-guideline, the guideline of the German-speaking countries, recommends the administration of azithromycin in case of PPROM. In view of the reported increasing resistance rates of Ureaplasma species to macrolides a recently performed systematic review and meta-analysis found that azithromycin has a positive therapeutic effect on Ureaplasma infection and that there is no correlation with the azithromycin dose, regardless of whether it is a single dose of 1 g or a multiple-dose regimen.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^5d78768e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia and azithromycin treatment affect the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants who tested positive for Ureaplasma within 72 h after birth in a tertiary unit. Chest X-ray (CXR) and laboratory test were performed before and after azithromycin treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent association between BPD and Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia, as well as BPD and effective azithromycin treatment.

Results

A total of 118 infants were included in the current study, of whom 36 developed BPD (defined as supplemental oxygen needed at postmenstrual age 36 weeks or discharge). The rate of BPD was significantly higher in infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia (44.6%) compared to infants with Ureaplasma colonization (17.7%, P = 0.002). After adjusting for confounders, an effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with reduced risk of BPD [odd ratio (OR) 0.011; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.000–0.250), whereas Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was not significantly associated with BPD (OR 1.835; 95% CI: 0.548–6.147).

Conclusion

Effective Azithromycin treatment in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants was associated with a reduced risk of BPD.

### Ureaplasma and BPD [^88bcfabe]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Ureaplasma is an organism with low virulence and is a commensal of the lower genito-urinary tract in females. From here, it can gain entry in the amniotic fluid to cause inflammation in the amniotic compartment during pregnancy. Ureaplasma spp. are the most common organisms isolated from women with chorioamnionitis. Ureaplasma spp. are associated with increased risk for preterm labor and morbidity in the preterm neonate. However, there is some controversy regarding the importance of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This article will review the microbiology of Ureaplasma, host innate immune responses, and the pathology of lung injury in animal models of Ureaplasma chorioamnionitis. We will review epidemiological studies of Ureaplasma and BPD in preterm infants and efficacy of antibiotics in preventing preterm labor and BPD.

### Doxycycline [^105bc52f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Treatment:

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.
Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydophila psittaci.
Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence.
Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.
Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis.

Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms:

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^9919e545]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), usually considered as a conditional pathogen, belongs to the genus Ureaplasma and the family Mycoplasmataceae in the order Mycoplasmatales. A meta-analysis found that UU, but not undifferentiated Ureaplasma infections or U. parvum, has been shown to be the pathogen of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). Moreover, UU is easy to be implanted in urethra, but not necessarily cause urethritis, quite a few patients with these infections are not aware of their infections because they may be asymptomatic, even whether it is pathogenic and the impact on fertility is still uncertain. The incidence of UU was reported inconsistently, a study of 19,098 infertile men and 3368 fertile men found that 10.22% and 3.65% of UU infertile and fertile men's urethra specimens, and 3.16% and 0.89% of MH specimens, UU infection will significantly affect sperm quality, and there is a significant relationship between UU infection and male infertility. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that there was a significant relationship between UU and Mycoplasma hominis with male infertility, and compared with the global average, the UU-positive rate was significantly higher in both the infertility group and the control group in China, while the positive rate was significantly lower in Mycoplasma hominis. Similarly, UU infection can directly affect sperm, cause leukocyte-mediated inflammatory response, and affect sperm by producing ROS.

We report an infant with a mixed Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma brain abscess who was successfully treated with intravenous doxycycline and erythromycin. Therapeutic concentrations of doxycycline were demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid. This report is evidence of the potential for Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma to produce focal central nervous system infection, as well as meningitis, in neonates and that use of doxycycline can be efficacious in the therapy of such infections.

### Lethal hyperammonemia in a CAR-T cell recipient due topneumonia: a case report of a unique severe complication [^5803875c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Learning points

Infection with urea-producing organisms (ie, Ureaplasma) can develop in immunocompromised patients, particularly recipients of organ and bone marrow transplantation, and present with sepsis and/or encephalopathy.
Ureaplasma infection should be suspected in patients with hyperammonemia who do not have liver disease and who have a low likelihood of inborn errors of metabolism (ie, adult patients).
If Ureaplasma infection is suspected, empirical antimicrobials should be started as detection of Ureaplasma requires Mycoplasma -specific media or PCR testing.
Treatment of Ureaplasma requires macrolides, tetracyclines and/or fluoroquinolones along with multiple simultaneous interventions to reduce ammonia levels and the cerebral oedema that may develop.

Discussion

This study showed that Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia before treatment was not independently associated with BPD development in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants, despite a remarkably higher rate of BPD in infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia compared to those with colonization (44.6% vs. 17.7%). In contrast, an effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with decreased risk for BPD in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants [OR 0.011, 95% CI (0.000, 0.250)].

Ureaplasma is smaller than bacteria in diameter and colonizes in the genitourinary tract of pregnant women. Ureaplasma might transmit to the new-borns respiratory tract in the uterus or during delivery, causing interstitial pneumonia and closely associated BPD in premature infants. Some speculations are proposed on the role of Ureaplasma in the pathogenesis of BPD. Phospholipase released by Ureaplasma has long been considered as the virulence factor causing epithelium necrosis. Infants who died from Ureaplasma pneumonia exhibited severe fibrosis, indicating fibroblast involvement. Besides, Ureaplasma infection increased the infiltration of inflammatory cells, releasing cytokines of interleukin 6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF α) and contributing to late-onset sepsis (LOS). These pathophysiological processes justify using interstitial pneumonia as an essential parameter for Ureaplasma infection in the current study. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a persistent association between Ureaplasma and BPD in preterm infants. However, our findings suggest that an infective pattern of Ureaplasma was not independently associated with the onset of BPD.

Since Ureaplasma in broncho alveolar lavage fluids was first reported in 1988, the role of Ureaplasma in morbidities of prematurity, especially in BPD, has drawn the great interest of neonatologists. However, infants tested positive for Ureaplasma are not routinely treated in NICUs, given that no evidence supports that eradication of Ureaplasma reduces the risk for BPD. Several researchers speculated that the pattern of Ureaplasma infection might determine its contribution to BPD. Castro-Alcaraz et al. reported that only persistent Ureaplasma colonization was associated with BPD. Maternal Ureaplasma abundance might increase the risk of BPD. In the current study, we found Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was not significantly associated with a higher risk of BPD, despite a striking clinical effect being noticed.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^2e02db0f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Infection and preterm birth

Microbiological studies suggest that intrauterine infections account for 25–40% of preterm births; but this is likely to be an under-estimate because intrauterine infection is difficult to detect with conventional culture techniques. The mechanisms by which intrauterine infections lead to preterm labour relate to activation of the innate immune system. Microorganisms are recognised by pattern-recognition receptors which in turn elicit the release of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Microbial endotoxins and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the production of prostaglandins, other inflammatory mediators, and matrix-degrading enzymes. Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractility and initiate labour, while degradation of extracellular matrix in the fetal membranes leads to preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes.

Recognition that it is ascending infection that leads to preterm birth has led to a number of studies that have evaluated the treatment of vaginal infection in pregnancy to reduce preterm birth. To date, most of the intervention trials have found little effect on the rate of preterm birth. Antibiotics prior to pregnancy do not reduce preterm birth. A Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis to prevent prematurity concludes that there is "little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis will prevent preterm birth and its consequences". Similarly, antibiotic treatment of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis have not significantly reduced preterm birth rates. Finally, there is a possibility that the use of metronidazole to treat trichomoniasis in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of prematurity.

In contrast to these negative results, a recent randomised controlled trial of antenatal screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and/or trichomoniasis in early pregnancy (15–19 weeks gestation) among over 4 000 asymptomatic pregnant women reduced the spontaneous preterm birth rate by 46%. The benefit appeared to be limited to those women who were treated for asymptomatic candidiasis, however this interpretation is based on post-hoc subgroup analysis of this trial. On the other hand, two observational studies that included Candida in pregnancy, conducted in low socioeconomic populations in the USA in the 1980 s, found no association with preterm birth although one found a significantly increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation among women with candidiasis (aOR 1.94, 95%CI 1.2–3.1). Importantly, in the latter, studies screening was performed later in pregnancy (22–30 weeks gestation) and did not include women with low-level Candida colonisation. Such conflicting results emphasise the need to evaluate interventions with appropriately designed randomised clinical trials.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^604725ac]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Study participants

Infants were recruited from seven sites over 37 months (July 2013–August 2016). A total of 982 patients were screened, of whom 434 (44%) were eligible (online supplementary figure 1S). Of 121 randomised, 60 were assigned to azithromycin and 61 were assigned to placebo; 119 (98%) received at least one dose of assigned treatment, one in each treatment group did not receive any doses of assigned treatment and treatment was discontinued in four azithromycin participants (one parent request and three clinical team request). All participants who received < 3 doses were Ureaplasma negative. One placebo-assigned infant who was nasopharyngeal Ureaplasma positive received a single dose of azithromycin due to pharmacy error.

The baseline characteristics of randomised patients and stratified by Ureaplasma status are summarised in table 1. An imbalance in race distribution occurred with 40% non-white in the azithromycin versus 75% in the placebo group. Other baseline characteristics were similar comparing treatment arms for the entire study cohort and when stratified by Ureaplasma colonisation status.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the study participants for the total cohort and stratified by Ureaplasma status

Forty-four of 121 participants (36%) were Ureaplasma positive at one or more time points with 19 (32%) randomised to azithromycin and 25 (41%) to placebo (table 1 and online supplementary figure 2S). Ureaplasma prevalence was higher in the 24 0–26 6 weeks' gestation stratum compared with 27 0–28 6 weeks (36/83 (43%) vs 8/38 (21%), p = 0.02). Ureaplasma parvum was the most common species detected in both treatment arms (U. parvum, n = 33 (75%); U. urealyticum n = 7 (16%); both species, n = 3 (7%); untyped n = 1 (2%)). The Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 and MIC 90 for Ureaplasma isolates were 2 µg/mL and 4 µg/mL, respectively. No tested isolate was resistant to azithromycin (MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL).

Azithromycin treatment strategies

VLBW infants were routinely screened for Ureaplasma after admission. The testing result was available within 48–72 h. The treatment was initiated shortly after doctors received the results. There is no current census on azithromycin treatment for Ureaplasma in preterm infants. For infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia, azithromycin was administered orally at a daily dose of ten mg/kg for a week followed by five mg/kg for the next week. This regimen was modified from Ballard et al. where they used ten mg/kg of azithromycin daily for seven days, followed by five mg/kg of azithromycin for an additional five weeks. We shortened the course on consideration of the potential side effect of azithromycin. For infants with Ureaplasma colonization, ten mg/kg azithromycin was administered orally daily for three days, suspended for four days, then repeated for three days. Dosage of azithromycin for Ureaplasma colonization was modified from a local consensus. Eleven infants in Ureaplasma colonized group completed half the treatment course (ten mg/Kg for three days) due to clinical sepsis and feeding intolerance. They were included in the analysis. No RT-PCR test for Ureaplasma was performed after azithromycin treatment. The efficacy of azithromycin treatment was thus assessed based on radiographic improvement and laboratory tests.

Statistics

The sample size was calculated based on a pilot study, where the rate of BPD was 48% in Ureaplasma-associated pneumonic infants, and the rate was 20% in Ureaplasma colonized VLBW infants. At an 80% power and an α = 0.05, 42 infants in each group would be sufficient to detect a significant difference. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0. In the univariate analysis, the chi-square test was used to analyse categorical variables, the nonparametric McNemar test was used for comparison of paired categorical variables, and the Student t-test was used for normally distributed continuous variables. Data were reported as numbers (%), the mean ± standard deviation, and IQR, respectively. Variates with a P -value < 0.1 were included in the multivariate logistic analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed by binary logistic regression and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^0b46a450]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition

The primary outcome is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), diagnosed as an oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or discharge. Secondary outcomes included hospital death, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), duration of invasive and non-invasive ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen and hospitalization. Chest-X-ray (CXR) score, assessed by the total score of three aspects: diffuse granularity, interstitial changes, and emphysema, was used to assess the pulmonary infection status in Ureaplasma positive VLBW infants (Table 1). Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was defined as Ureaplasma Rt-PCR positive with clinical manifestation of CXR score ≥ 2 (Table 1) and an increased leukocyte ≥ 25 × 10⁹ /L. Ureaplasma colonization was defined as Ureaplasma Rt-PCR positive with no or mild CXR score < 2, or leukocyte < 25 × 10⁹ /L. Effect of azithromycin treatment was defined as improvement in both CXR (decrease in score) and laboratory leukocyte (less than 20 × 10⁹ /L). The diagnostic criteria of Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia are summarized in Table 1. The CXR was assessed by one neonatologist and one radiologist, who was blinded to the study design. The representative photos of CXR were displayed in the Supplemental figure.

Table 1
Algorithm for Ureaplasma associated pneumonia

Diffuse granularity, interstitial changes, and emphysema were assessed independently as none (score 0), mild (score 1), and severe (score 2). A total score was defined as the sum of scores from the three aspects. An infant with a total Chest X-Ray score of more than 2 and a leukocyte more than 25 × 10⁹ /L was defined as Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia otherwise was colonization. Be noted that this assessment was performed in infants tested Ureaplasma positive by RT-PCR

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^592f5723]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Leukocytospermia is an abnormal laboratory finding defined by the World Health Organization as the presence of 1 × 10⁶ seminal leukocytes per mL in human ejaculate, It is generally accepted that leukocytospermia may indicate infection or inflammation of the male urogenital and sex glands tract, and it is a poor marker for either bacteriospermia or impaired semen quality, which has a negative impact on spermatogenesis or maturation, and is related to the decrease of semen parameters such as sperm concentration, motility, normal morphology and DNA fragmentation index. A prospective, controlled, blinded study suggests that leukocytospermia has a significant effect on sperm dynamic motility patterns, DNA and chromosome integrity in infertile men, and the pregnancy rate of patients cured with antibiotics is significantly higher than that of patients with persistent leukocytospermia. Studies showed that antibiotics might improve the rate of resolution of leukocytospermia, the bacteriologic cure rate, and even improve sperm parameters to increase pregnancy rate. A meta-analysis of 12 studies showed that using broad spectrum antibiotics in the treatment of patients with leukocytospermia might be useful in improving sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. But a number of studies have shown that there is no correlation between elevated levels of semen leukocytes and bacteriospermia, and evidence from an RCT study also suggests that antibiotic therapy is not beneficial for the treatment of asymptomatic leucocytospermia, even in infertile men, leukocytospermia does not affect the success rate of IVF or ICSI. Although a large number of studies have proved the relationship between semen leukocytosis and bacterial infection, sperm quality, and even the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment, the conflicting results are not convincing, the association of leukocytospermia with semen quality or male fertility and the significance of antibiotic therapy are still under debate.

### Do we need to reconsider our antibiotic regimen for preterm premature rupture of membranes? Pathogens and perinatal outcome in PPROM [^b207c968]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results of our study with predominantly aminopenicillin-resistant E. coli and CoNS as well as Ureaplasma species as the currently most relevant pathogens in PPROM underline the need to reconsider our standard antibiotic regimen with a combination of an aminopenicillin and a macrolide as it is recommended in most guidelines today. To cover Ureaplasma species, macrolides such as azithromycin should continue to be administered, but aminopenicillins no longer appear to be the optimal choice. Currently, the optimal antibiotic regimen is simply unknown. Due to the changes in pathogen spectrum and antimicrobial resistance in recent decades, the results of the larger part of performed studies are outdated and the latest evidence is poor and, so far, insufficient to support a different regimen. Thus, further research is necessary and should focus on conducting randomized controlled trials with comparison of aminopenicillins to antibiotics with better coverage of the currently relevant pathogens such as co-amoxiclav or cephalosporins.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^db22c013]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin side effects are infrequent in adults and children. A recent study demonstrated an association of IHPS with oral azithromycin exposure in the first 14d of life in termand preterms 33–36 weeks' gestation but not ≤ 32 weeks' gestation. In addition, azithromycin is proarrhythmogenic with prior reports of occurrences of QT-interval prolongation and torsades de pointes in adults. Although there were no reported incidences of IHPS or QT interval prolongation in the infants in the current trial, adverse events must be monitored closely in any subsequent trial of azithromycin in the ELGAN population.

Study limitations

Since Ureaplasma spp. lack cell walls, they are susceptible to drying and heat contributing to false negatives, so that some affected infants may have been missed. We made efforts to avoid this misclassification by providing central laboratory culture medium, collection procedures optimised for organism recovery, multiple sampling sites at timepoints before and after study treatment and inclusion of PCR methods to better detect Ureaplasma. The race imbalance in randomisation did not influence the primary outcome, Ureaplasma -free survival, but influenced some secondary clinical outcomes. Future trials should consider stratifying on race. Brain imaging prior to randomisation was not required for this trial but, due to the observed differences in PHH, may be warranted in any future trial to better delineate the timing of IVH in relation to treatment.

Study implications summary

The results of this trial demonstrate the efficacy of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma in ELGAN infants but do not support treatment of all ELGAN infants with azithromycin. Perinatal mortality and prolonged respiratory support are concentrated in ELGANs who have Ureaplasma in the lower respiratory tract. A phase III clinical trial in ELGAN infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma would determine whether or not a 3-day course of azithromycin is of clinical benefit.

### Azithromycin for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants: a cohort study [^5529d2ee]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a significant pulmonary morbidity affecting approximately 48%−60% of extremely preterm infants (EPI). Factors contributing to BPD include, but not limited to, antenatal and post‐natal infections, receipt of mechanical ventilation, presence of inflammation, and hyperoxia‐induced injuries. Despite advancements in perinatal care such as antenatal steroids, surfactant replacement, optimized ventilation strategies, and postnatal steroids use, the incidence of BPD has shown minimal change, underscoring the need for innovative interventions in BPD management.

Aberrant regulation of lung inflammation has been considered the most important mechanism for BPD. Thus, anti‐inflammatory therapies offer the potential of preventative and reparative treatment for infants with BPD. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that exhibits both antimicrobial and anti‐inflammatory properties and been used extensively to eradicate Ureaplasma species in preterm infants. Although azithromycin has been proven effective in the treatment of other inflammatory lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its efficacy on BPD is inconclusive. A meta‐analysis reported azithromycin was associated with a significant reduction in BPD and the duration of supplemental oxygen, however, recent clinical trials have failed to confirm this effect. This discrepancy may be due to the confounding influence of Ureaplasma species infection status in preterm infants. We and others have previously found that different infection statuses of Ureaplasma species might be associated with varying BPD outcomes. Previous studies did not account for the infection status of Ureaplasma species, which may have led to the protective effects of azithromycin being concealed by Ureaplasma species infection, particularly in infants with severe Ureaplasma pneumonia.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the protective effect of azithromycin treatment on BPD in a "clean" cohort, consisting of Ureaplasma species negative infants and those classified as having Ureaplasma species colonization while excluding infants with Ureaplasma species pneumonia.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^27ef5a66]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

According to the antibiotic sensitivity test of UU, the top three susceptible antibiotics were Cyclolipoerythromycin, Minocycline and Doxycycline, and because doxycycline is inexpensive and easy to obtain, we prefer to choose doxycycline in clinic. According to the results of the 7-day and the 14-day treatment plan, there is no significant difference in cure rates, and there is no significant difference in the effect of the two plans on the sperm quality of UU cured leukocytospermia patients. If patients are susceptible to doxycycline and have no history of allergies and contraindications, we think that the doxycycline 7-day treatment plan is a good choice and this antibiotic treatment is meaningful. From our results, the semen parameters such as sperm concentration, PR, total motility, and normal morphology of UU-positive leukocytospermia patients were significantly improved 1 month after UU was cured. Unfortunately, some patients also received antioxidant and other treatments after our observation period, and no correct pregnancy rate was observed. However, our research shows that screening and treating UU in asymptomatic leukocytospermia is meaningful, not only can improve sperm quality but also save a lot of resources and costs, reduce the use of antibiotics, which seems to be an efficient diagnosis and treatment program.

This study has some limitations. Since more pathogens such as chlamydia or mycoplasma have been tested only in symptomatic leukocytespermia rather than asymptomatic leukocytospermia, this may miss some pathogens. In addition, some patients received additional treatments later, and we were unable to follow up with the UU-cured patients for longer periods to obtain more data.

Discussion

Leukocytospermia or pyospermia is still a confusing and controversial topic for clinicians. Although it has been proposed by the World Health Organization as an indicator of reproductive tract infection and inflammation, the evidence is not convincing. The frequency of leukocytospermia among infertile males is quite wide, and the reliable incidence is about 30%. Some pathophysiological views recognize that bacteria and infiltrating leukocytes, two major inflammatory mediators, directly or indirectly affect human sperm function, However, most leukocytospermia is not caused by bacterial infection or bacteriospermia, or there is no evidence of microbial infection, this may be because the invasion of male reproductive tract by microorganisms may be divided into three different stages. In the first stage, bacterial infection can be induced by microorganisms, and pathological bacterial strains can be observed in semen, without attracting a large number of white blood cells; in the second stage, activated white blood cells appear in ejaculation; in the third stage, bacteria are removed, usually with isolated leukocytospermia as the representative. Bacteria are mainly involved in the intrinsic and mitochondrial dependent apoptosis cell death, while oxidative stress may play a role in reducing the conventional sperm parameters in leukocytospermia, and the combined effect of bacteria and leukocytes accelerated the apoptosis and necrosis of sperm. The increased seminal leukocytes may mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by direct cell–cell contact or soluble products released by leukocytes. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Case–Control Studies indicated that patients with leukocytospermia showed lower sperm concentration and lower progressive motility compared to men without leukocytospermia, however, the significant differences disappeared, along with the large inter-study heterogeneity, when analyses were restricted to studies clearly reporting the inclusion of men without clinical evidence of seminal tract infection. It seems that the clinical evidence of seminal tract infection is the key to sperm quality decline, and clinical studies have also found that compared with some pathogenic bacterial strains, the direct contact between conditioned pathogenic bacteria and sperm may play a greater role in promoting apoptosis.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) — etiology and epidemiology in men are summarized: The presence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) or purple intracellular diplococci (MB or GV) on urethral smear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, whereas NGU is diagnosed when microscopy indicates inflammation without GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, and C. trachomatis causes 15%–40% of cases with a lower proportion among older men. Documentation of chlamydial infection as NGU etiology is essential because of the need for partner referral for evaluation and treatment to prevent complications, and complications among males include epididymitis, prostatitis, and reactive arthritis. M. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU cases in the United States, with detection among symptomatic men reported as 11% in Australia, 12%–15% in the United Kingdom, 15% in South Africa, 19% in China, 21% in Korea, 22% in Japan, and 28.7% in the United States (range: 20.4%–38.8%). Data are inconsistent regarding other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species as etiologic agents of urethritis, and the majority of men with Ureaplasma infections do not have overt disease unless a high organism load is present.

Materials and methods

Study design

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a level three neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), from June 2017 and October 2019. During the study period, preterm infants with a birth weight less thn 1500 g were routinely screened for Ureaplasma within 12 h after admission using a commercial kit (Rendu Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs. The RT-PCR assay detects both U. urealyticum and U. parvum, and Ureaplasma was used in the following text. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the institute Ethical Committee. Written informed consent from the participants' legal guardian/next of kin was not required in this study in accordance with the national legislation and the institutional requirements.

### Immune regulation, maternal infection, vaccination, and pregnancy outcome [^9a8a2568]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus

Currently, no safe or effective treatments exist for maternal HCMV infection to prevent fetal transmission. Recommendations include universal screening, prevention, hygiene education, and diagnosis of maternal HCMV infection to mitigate the significant consequences for the fetus. Although no vaccines exist currently for HCMV, modification of the most efficacious MF59-adjuvanted glycoprotein B (gB) protein subunit vaccine (gB/MF59) is underway in preclinical models.

Herpes simplex virus

HSV neonatal infection is rare but can result in fetal neurological impairment. Maternal transfer of immunoglobuloin G antibodies crossing the placenta offers a natural form of protection to the fetus; the highest risk to the fetus occurs when maternal infection and shedding are active close to delivery. Clinical trials for HSV vaccines have failed to meet their endpoint for the prevention of adult-to-adult transmission, but evidence suggests that maternal vaccination might protect infants from infection. Studies in mice using a replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine candidate, dl5–29, protected pups from infection after intranasal HSV challenge 1–2 days postpartum.

Ureaplasma

Potential causes for virulence and intra-amniotic infection with Ureaplasma are changes in the lipoprotein multiple-banded antigen isolates detected in preterm birth. Imbalance of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract increases vaginal pH, promoting infections from the vagina into the amniotic cavity. Such isolates as Ureaplasma urealyticum with higher urease activity increase pH, causing infections locally.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^450092c5]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary pulmonary outcome

The primary composite pulmonary outcome of death prior to 22–26 months corrected age or serious respiratory morbidity was similar in the AZM (34.8%) compared to the placebo (30.4%) group (risk difference 4%, 95% confidence interval −14 to 21%, p = 0.67; Table 2) and in analyses stratified by race (Supplemental Table 1). The distribution of the components of the serious respiratory morbidity outcome was similar between the treatment groups (Supplemental Fig. 1). There were no differences in PMA at the time of discharge to home or when supplemental oxygen was discontinued. Among those positive for Ureaplasma, AZM-assigned participants had similar mortality (16% both groups) but significantly higher incidence of serious respiratory morbidity than placebo-assigned participants (45 vs 15%) (p = 0.036; Table 2). There was no difference in incidence of serious respiratory morbidity in Ureaplasma -negative infants. Parental report of chronic cough or wheezing was similar in both the treatment groups. Use of one or more respiratory medication during any interval in the first 2 years was high in both the groups (AZM, 65%; placebo, 62%), with nebulized albuterol as the most frequent medication used in both the groups. There were no appreciable differences in percentage of children who were hospitalized one or more times for respiratory illness between treatment arms and when stratified by Ureaplasma status.

### Severeinfection in a patient with ocrelizumab-induced hypogammaglobulinaemia [^f625be9b]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Infections caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum in immune-competent people are typically simple and uncomplicated. However, in cases of immunosuppression, severe disseminated infections can occur. This case report describes the case of a severe, disseminated infection caused by U. urealyticum in a young female with unacknowledged humoral immunosuppression due to treatment with ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis. The patient was admitted due to a recurrent episode of a tubo-ovarian abscess. Throughout the following 2months of hospitalisation, treatment with several types of antibiotics and the placement of various drains led to no improvement. As extensive investigations indicated hypogammaglobulinaemia, U. urealyticum was suspected, and tests came back positive. Treatment with doxycycline and moxifloxacin led to a full recovery. This demonstrates how humoral immunosuppression is a risk factor for severe disseminated infections and how these may be avoided through monitoring of immunoglobulin levels in patients treated with ocrelizumab.

### Treatment of genital Mycoplasma in colonized pregnant women in late pregnancy is associated with a lower rate of premature labour and neonatal complications [^ac927a3a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma spp. may colonize the human genital tract and have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm labour and preterm premature rupture of membranes. However, as these bacteria can reside in the normal vaginal flora, there are controversies regarding their true role during pregnancy and so the need to treat these organisms. We therefore conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the treatment of genital mycoplasma in 5377 pregnant patients showing symptoms of potential obstetric complications at 25–37 weeks of gestation. Women presenting with symptoms were routinely screened by culture for the presence of these bacteria and treated with clindamycin when positive. Compared with uninfected untreated patients, women treated for genital mycoplasma demonstrated lower rates of premature labour. Indeed preterm birth rates were, respectively, 40.9% and 37.7% in women colonized with Ureaplasma spp. and M. hominis, compared with 44.1% in uncolonized women (Ureaplasma spp., p 0.024; M. hominis, p 0.001). Moreover, a reduction of neonatal complications rates was observed, with 10.9% of newborns developing respiratory diseases in case of Ureaplasma spp. colonization and 5.9% in the presence of M. hominis, compared with 12.8% in the absence of those bacteria (Ureaplasma spp., p 0.050; M. hominis, p < 0.001). Microbiological screening of Ureaplasma spp. and/or M. hominis and pre-emptive antibiotic therapy of symptomatic pregnant women in late pregnancy might represent a beneficial strategy to reduce premature labour and neonatal complications.

### Azithromycin, Ureaplasma and chronic lung disease of prematurity: a case study for neonatal drug development [^54190f7b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Ureaplasma has received intermittent attention over the last two decades as a possible contributory factor. In addition, pulmonary inflammation is associated with the development of CLD. The macrolide azithromycin provides an attractive option to determine if it can decrease the development of CLD as it has both anti-inflammatory and anti-infective properties. In this article, the authors review the evidence for the role of Ureaplasma in the development of CLD and the obstacles faced in the development of a drug before it reaches clinical practice.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^bf91b823]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic sensitivity test showed that the susceptible rate of Cyclolipoerythromycin was 94.74%, Minocycline was 93.68%, and doxycycline was 92.63% (Fig. 1), As doxycycline is inexpensive and easily available, we usually recommend doxycycline for patients who are susceptible to doxycycline and have no history of allergies or contraindications, and choose 7-day or 14-day treatment plan according to the patient's wishes. As a result, 14 UU-positive patients were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons, and 81 UU-positive patients received doxycycline treatment. We collected 52 patients with a 7-day treatment plan and 29 patients with a 14 day treatment plan with doxycycline, the cure rates were 84.62% and 89.66% respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two treatment plans (p = 0.738). (Table 2). At the same time, we also found that the two treatment plans have no significant difference in semen volume, PH, sperm concentration, PR, total motility and normal morphology for UU cured patients (p = 0.490, p = 0.529, p = 0.995, p = 0.592, p = 0.486 and p = 0.293, respectively).

### Ureaplasma parvum prosthetic joint infection detected by PCR [^9214880f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

We describe the first reported case of Ureaplasma parvum prosthetic joint infection (PJI) detected by PCR. Ureaplasma species do not possess a cell wall and are usually associated with colonization and infection of mucosal surfaces (not prosthetic material). U. parvum is a relatively new species name for certain serovars of Ureaplasma urealyticum, and PCR is useful for species determination. Our patient presented with late infection of his right total knee arthroplasty. Intraoperative fluid and tissue cultures and pre- and postoperative synovial fluid cultures were all negative. To discern the pathogen, we employed PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). Our patient's failure to respond to empirical antimicrobial treatment and our previous experience with PCR/ESI-MS in culture-negative cases of infection prompted us to use this approach over other diagnostic modalities. PCR/ESI-MS detected U. parvum in all samples. U. parvum-specific PCR testing was performed on all synovial fluid samples to confirm the U. parvum detection.

### Investigation of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species using a molecular method in male patients suffering from urethritis symptoms: a cross-sectional study in the city of antalya [^4576df46]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) spread predominantly through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. More than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites are transmitted through sexual contact. The characteristic findings of urethritis include urethral discharge, dysuria, itching, and burning in the anterior urethra. However, not all men with urethritis present with symptoms.

Infectious urethritis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen; thus, most cases occur in sexually active young men. The most common cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is Chlamydia (C) trachomatis, followed by Mycoplasma (M) genitalium. Ureaplasma (U) spp. and M. hominis may occur as commensals in the lower genital tract in many healthy sexually active adults. The role of ureaplasmas in NGU has long been controversial. U. urealyticum in high bacterial loads might cause a small proportion of male NGU cases, but in most men with U. urealyticum infection/colonization, NGU does not develop. Evidence that M. hominis and U. parvum cause NGU is lacking. Furthermore, almost half of all NGU cases have no specific etiology.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the fastest and sensitive diagnostic method for gonococcal urethritis and NGU. It allows the use of noninvasive samples, such as first-void urine samples and self-collected swabs. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV recommends the use of nucleic acid amplification tests as the only useful diagnostic method for M. genitalium infection in clinical samples.

Empirical treatment of NGU usually involves doxycycline or as an alternative azithromycin therapy. It is recommended that M. genitalium infection be considered in all patients with persistent urethritis despite initial empirical therapy, and if possible, a test to detect macrolide resistance should be performed. The prevalence of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium limits the usefulness of azithromycin-based regimens.

The main aim of this study was to determine the presence of M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and U. parvum in male patients with symptoms of urethritis using molecular methods. In addition, this study investigated macrolide resistance in M. genitalium –positive samples. Other pathogenic agents of urethritis, such as Neisseria (N) gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas (T) vaginalis, were also examined in the samples.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^5acf4889]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We conducted 22–26-month corrected age follow-up for this Phase IIb RCT to assess the potential impact of AZM therapy on long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. We have previously published the primary efficacy outcome analysis showing that intravenous AZM 20 mg/kg for 3 days effectively eradicates Ureaplasma respiratory colonization. In the follow-up study, we did not find strong evidence for an impact of neonatal exposure to AZM on later pulmonary and neurodevelopment outcomes. Based on the 95% confidence interval (−14 to 21%), our data do not rule out either a moderately reduced or moderately increased risk of death or serious respiratory morbidity at 22–26 months corrected age in those receiving AZM relative to placebo. Similarly, the 95% confidence interval for difference in death or NDI between treatment groups is broad (−2 to 34%). Importantly, we observed that infants who had lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization in the neonatal period had persistent adverse pulmonary outcomes, including greater risk for the composite outcome death or serious respiratory morbidity, suggesting that these infants should be targeted in future trials.

Since the widely used BPD definitions are poor predictors of subsequent respiratory illness later in childhood, consensus is lacking among neonatologists on which clinically meaningful short- and long-term endpoints should be targeted in clinical trials of BPD prevention.– In the current follow-up study, we chose the composite outcome of death or serious respiratory morbidity defined by Jensen et al.as the primary outcome. The components of the serious respiratory morbidity definition could be ascertained from the electronic medical records for the majority of subjects and they represent meaningful clinical outcomesand are factors that impact parents' perceptions of quality of life for their childrenand inform healthcare providers. Jensen et al.determined that a revised BPD definition that categorized lung disease severity according to mode of respiratory support at 36 weeks PMA rather than supplemental oxygen best predicted serious respiratory morbidity in the first 2 years of life in preterm infants born < 27 weeks gestation.

### The effect of screening and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection on semen parameters in asymptomatic leukocytospermia: a case-control study [^76785795]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed adult males who visited Guilin People's Hospital due to infertility and performed routine semen analysis and UU screening and treatment for patients with leukocytospermia from April 2017 to December 2019. After excluded patients with systemic diseases, cryptorchidism, chromosome abnormalities, varicocele, male azoospermia, bacteriospermia, as well as patients who drank excessively, smoked heavily, had symptoms of genitourinary tract infection or a history of antibiotic use in recent 4 weeks, 1530 patients and medical records were finally collected. Among them, 295 cases were diagnosed with leukocytospermia, 95 cases were further screened for UU-positive, 81 cases were treated with doxycycline, and 14 cases were treated with other sensitive antibiotics due to antibiotic sensitivity tests showing doxycycline resistance or intermediate sensitivity, or for other reasons. The semen parameters of non-leukocytospermia, leukocytospermia, UU-positive leukocytospermia and UU-negative leukocytospermia groups were compared, and the differences between two treatment plans with doxycycline and the semen parameters before UU treatment and 1 month after UU-cured were compared. The study was approved by the ethical review committee.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^606294df]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Post hoc analyses

We had previously observed that Ureaplasma -free survival, overall survival, and physiologic BPD-free survival were lower and durations of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen, and postnatal steroid exposure were higher in intubated patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization compared to intubated infants without lower tract involvement or non-intubated infants. At follow-up, differences in unfavorable pulmonary outcomes persisted in children who had lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization. Tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive infants were discharged to home and supplemental oxygen was discontinued at later PMA and they experienced a higher frequency of the composite outcome death or serious respiratory morbidity at 22–26 months corrected age than tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -negative infants and non-intubated infants (Table 4). There were no differences among the three groups for death or moderate-to-severe NDI. To assess the long-term effect of neonatal lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization in the absence of treatment, we compared outcomes of placebo-treated tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive and Ureaplasma -negative infants (Supplemental Table 2). Placebo-treated tracheal aspirate Ureaplasma -positive infants were discharged to home at a later PMA. Although the differences were not statistically significant, all-cause mortality (36 vs 9%, p = 0.07) and mortality from respiratory causes (18 vs 0%, p = 0.098) was greater in the Ureaplasma -positive group than for infants assigned to placebo. In patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization, death or serious respiratory morbidity was 60% (6/10) in AZM-treated vs 56% (6/11) in placebo-treated infants (p = 0.61; Table 5).

### Standard treatment regimens for nongonococcal urethritis have similar but declining cure rates: a randomized controlled trial [^85b4e71b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Azithromycin or doxycycline is recommended for nongonococcal urethritis (NGU); recent evidence suggests their efficacy has declined. We compared azithromycin and doxycycline in men with NGU, hypothesizing that azithromycin was more effective than doxycycline.

Methods

From January 2007 to July 2011, English-speaking males ≥ 16 years, attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (visible urethral discharge or ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field [PMNs/HPF]) were eligible for this double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1 g) + placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) + placebo azithromycin. Urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Clinical cure (< 5 PMNs/HPF with or without urethral symptoms and absence of discharge) and microbiologic cure (negative tests for CT, MG, and/or UU-2) were determined after 3 weeks.

Results

Of 606 men, 304 were randomized to azithromycin and 302 to doxycycline; CT, MG, TV, and UU-2 were detected in 24%, 13%, 2%, and 23%, respectively. In modified intent-to-treat analyses, 172 of 216 (80%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 74%-85%) receiving azithromycin and 157 of 206 (76%; 95% CI, 70%-82%) receiving doxycycline experienced clinical cure (P = 0.40). In pathogen-specific analyses, clinical cure did not differ by arm, nor did microbiologic cure differ for CT (86% vs 90%, P = 0.56), MG (40% vs 30%, P = 0.41), or UU-2 (75% vs 70%, P = 0.50). No unexpected adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

Clinical and microbiologic cure rates for NGU were somewhat low and there was no significant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline. Mycoplasma genitalium treatment failure was extremely common. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT00358462.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^17edeeb2]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Characteristics of the study population

Of the 121 ELGAN infants randomized, 60 were assigned to AZM and 61 to placebo; 119 (98%) received at least one dose of the assigned treatment (Fig. 1). One placebo-assigned infant who was nasopharyngeal Ureaplasma positive received a single dose of AZM due to pharmacy error. The baseline characteristics of the study cohort and when stratified by Ureaplasma colonization status were similar between treatment arms, except for an imbalance in race distribution that occurred with 40% non-white in the AZM vs 75% in the placebo group (Table 1). Forty-four of the 121 (36%) participants were Ureaplasma positive at one or more timepoints with 19 randomized to AZM and 25 to placebo (Table 1).

One participant in each treatment arm did not receive assigned treatment. Asterisk (*): one participant assigned to the placebo group, received one dose of azithromycin due to investigational pharmacy error but received placebo for other 2 doses. All participants were included in intent-to-treat analysis.

Table 1
Characteristics of the study infants for the total cohort and stratified by Ureaplasma status.

Eleven participants died prior to discharge from the NICU (AZM, N = 5; placebo, N = 6) and 1 AZM-assigned participant died after discharge and prior to 22–26-month corrected age. At least one post-discharge questionnaire was completed for 105/109 survivors (96%). At 22–26 months corrected age, 94 (86%) completed pulmonary assessments and 95 (87%) completed neurodevelopmental assessments (Fig. 1). Socioeconomic factors such as frequency of medical assistance insurance and maternal education and environmental factors such as daycare attendance and tobacco smoke exposure were similar between treatment arms. Family history of asthma and atopy was common for participants in both treatment arms.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^8d1acf60]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Questionnaires that rely on parental recall of respiratory symptoms, medication use, and physician visits have been commonly used in studies of pulmonary outcomes in preterm infants. The potential for parental recall bias of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing has been debated in previous studies. To reduce recall bias in the current study, we used the validated Tucson Children's Respiratory Study questionnaires administered by trained personnel at 4 timepoints during the first 2 years of life. Approximately two-thirds of parents reported family history of asthma and/or atopy. Respiratory medication use prevalence was ~65% in surviving children in both treatment arms with nebulized albuterol the most frequently reported medication. Respiratory medication use was similar to rates reported in other ELGAN cohorts during the first few years of life. Whether these medications were prescribed for BPD or viral infection-related wheezing is not known.

Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization has been proposed as an etiologic factor in reactive airway disease in young infants. Wheezing in infants and children < 3 years of age has been associated with isolation of Ureaplasma from the upper respiratory tract. There was no significant difference in parental-reported chronic cough or wheezing in children who were Ureaplasma tracheal aspirate positive compared to those children who had been tracheal aspirate negative or never intubated. In post hoc analysis of placebo-treated intubated infants with and without lower tract Ureaplasma colonization, Ureaplasma -colonized infants were discharged to home at later PMA, suggesting a more complicated NICU course in colonized infants.

We examined the impact of AZM treatment in the first few days of life on later NDI, a treatment effect that has not been previously reported. The rate of death or moderate-to-severe NDI in the current study cohort is similar to rates reported in other neonatal cohorts. Although AZM has been proposed as a neuroprotective agent in neonatal animal models, there was no apparent benefit in neurodevelopmental measures by treatment group or when stratified by Ureaplasma status. Despite worse pulmonary morbidity, infants with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma infection had similar rate of death or moderate–severe NDI as intubated infants without lower tract involvement or non-intubated infants. In multiple previous studies, BPD severity was a risk factor for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, in a recent single-center birth cohort, BSID-III cognitive scores were not associated with BPD severity.

### Erythromycin (erythromycin ethylsuccinate) [^f64620c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.

Legionnaires' Disease caused by Legionella pneumophila. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, in vitro and limited preliminary clinical data suggest that erythromycin may be effective in treating Legionnaires' Disease.

Prophylaxis:

Prevention of Initial Attacks of Rheumatic Fever:

Penicillin is considered by the American Heart Association to be the drug of choice in the prevention of initial attacks of rheumatic fever (treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections of the upper respiratory tract, e.g., tonsillitis or pharyngitis). Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients.4The therapeutic dose should be administered for 10 days.

Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever:

Penicillin or sulfonamides are considered by the American Heart Association to be the drugs of choice in the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever. In patients who are allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides, oral erythromycin is recommended by the American Heart Association in the long-term prophylaxis of Streptococcal pharyngitis (for the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever).4

### Randomized clinical trial of extended spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis with coverage for Ureaplasma urealyticum to reduce post-cesarean delivery endometritis [^22798a79]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if extended spectrum prophylactic antibiotic treatment (with efficacy against Ureaplasma urealyticum) reduces post-cesarean delivery clinical endometritis.

Methods

After cord clamping at cesarean delivery, subjects received prophylaxis with cefotetan. Subjects were then simultaneously randomized (double blind) to receive doxycyline plus azithromycin versus placebo. Post-cesarean delivery endometritis was defined clinically as fever of 100.4F or higher with one or more supporting clinical signs or a physician diagnosis of endometritis plus the absence of a nonpelvic source of fever.

Results

A total of 597 women were enrolled, 301 in the doxycycline/azithromycin group and 296 in the placebo group. The study population was 56% black, 25.5 ± 6.2 years of age, and 43% nulliparous. The groups were similar (P > .05) for black race, parity, maternal age, and most risk factors for post-cesarean delivery endometritis. The frequency of post-cesarean delivery endometritis (16.9% versus 24.7%, P = 0.020), wound infections (0.8% versus 3.6%, P = 0.030), and a combination of these two outcomes (19.0% versus 27.8%, P = 0.019) were significantly lower in the doxycycline/azithromycin group compared with the placebo-treated group. The doxycycline/azithromycin versus placebo groups were dissimilar for maternal leukocytosis (24.9% versus 12.5%, P = 0.042) and frequency of classic uterine incision (7.6% versus 12.5%, P = 0.048). Adjusting for these factors did not alter the risk ratio for post-cesarean delivery endometritis in the active versus placebo-treated group (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.43, 0.98). Length of stay was longer in the placebo group overall (104 ± 56 versus 95 ± 32 hours, P = 0.016) and among women with endometritis (146 ± 52 versus 127 ± 46 hours, P = 0.047).

Conclusion

Extended spectrum prophylactic antibiotic treatment (with presumed efficacy against U urealyticum) given to women undergoing cesarean delivery at term shortens hospital stay and reduces the frequency of post-cesarean delivery endometritis and wound infections.

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^f1d9c778]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome for the follow-up phase of the trial was the composite outcome of death prior to 26 months corrected age or serious respiratory morbidity, defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following: tracheostomy; continued hospitalization for respiratory reasons at or beyond 50 weeks PMA, use of supplemental oxygen or respiratory support at 22–26 months corrected age, or ≥ 2 rehospitalizations for respiratory illness. The secondary outcome was the composite outcome of death prior to 26 months corrected age or moderate-to-severe NDI at 22–26 months corrected age defined as any one of the following: BSID-III cognitive composite score < 85 or ASQ score > 2 SD below the mean on any domain, GMFCS score ≥ 2, moderate or severe CP, blindness, and/or severe hearing impairment that cannot be corrected by amplification. Other secondary outcomes included mortality, the components of the pulmonary and neurodevelopmental composite outcomes, parental report of chronic wheezing or cough, doctor/ER visits for respiratory illness, and respiratory medication use during the first 22–26 months corrected age.

Statistical analysis

For the efficacy analysis, we compared the composite outcome death or serious respiratory morbidity at 22–26 months corrected age and other outcomes among all randomized participants according to the principle of intention-to-treat and in the subgroups of Ureaplasma -positive and negative participants. To account for possible correlation between outcomes in twins, we used generalized estimating equationsand multiple outputation to calculate p values and confidence intervals. When observed counts were small, we used exact methods without accounting for twinning to calculate p values.

We did not collect a 22–26 month lung assessment for 15 of the children. To retain these children in the analyses described above, we multiply imputed the outcomes based on information gathered in the 6- and 12-month follow-up surveys and on respiratory variables observed prior to discharge. Binary outcomes were imputed based on their estimated probability. Twenty-five data sets with imputations were created and the final results were combined using Rubins approach.

Treatment groups were compared with respect to the median value of several quantitative outcomes, including PMA at discharge to home and when supplemental oxygen was discontinued. To include children who died during the NICU hospitalization in the analysis appropriately, we used a rank-based (Wilcoxon test) analysis and gave these children the worst ranks.

In post hoc analyses, we explored the impact of upper and lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonization on the follow-up primary and major secondary outcomes.

All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.

### Association of Ureaplasma infection pattern and azithromycin treatment effect with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma positive infants: a cohort study [^847a12d4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

During the study period, 812 VLBW infants were admitted to the NICU. In these infants, 121 (14.9%) were tested positive for Ureaplasma. Three infants were excluded due to death before 14 days. A total of 118 infants are included in the final analysis (Fig. 1), of which 30.5% (36/118) developed BPD. The clinical characteristics of these infants were summarized in Table 2.

Infants with Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia had significantly higher risk of BPD (44.6% vs. 17.7%, P = 0.002), longer invasive ventilation (1.0 vs 0.0 day, P = 0.004], longer non-invasive ventilation (37.0 vs 19.5 days, P < 0.001), longer oxygen support (58.0 vs 33.0 days, P < 0.001) and longer hospital stay (74.0 vs 50.0 days, P < 0.001, Table 3).

We further analysed the association between Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia and BPD, as well as the association between effective azithromycin treatment and BPD, in the multivariate logistic analysis. Univariate analysis was shown in supplemental Table 1. Although a higher rate of Ureaplasma-associated pneumonia was observed in BPD infants compared with those without BPD (58.6% vs. 24.7%), the association did not reach statistically significant after adjustment [OR 1.835, 95%CI (0.548, 6.147), Table 4]. An effective azithromycin treatment was significantly associated with a reduced risk for BPD [OR 0.011, 95% CI (0.000, 0.250), Table 4].

### Optimum detection of Ureaplasma in premature infants [^30612007]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma spp. is a known risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Emerging research suggests treatment with azithromycin or clarithromycin in the first days of life (DOLs) reduces bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Ureaplasma spp. positive infants. Side effects of these antibiotics make it imperative to optimize reliable noninvasive screening procedures to identify infants who would benefit from treatment.

Methods

The aim of this study was to determine the best site and time to screen for Ureaplasma spp. in 24- to 34-week premature infants. Oral, nasal, gastric and tracheal cultures were collected and placed immediately in 10B broth media. Polymerase chain reaction verified culture results and identified the Ureaplasma spp.

Results

Cultures yielded a Ureaplasma spp. incidence of 80/168 = 47.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 40–56]. Nasal cultures had greater sensitivity to detect Ureaplasma spp. than oral cultures (P = 0.008): however, a significant proportion of infants with Ureaplasma spp. would have been missed (12/79 = 15.2%, 95% CI: 8%-25%, P < 0.001) if oral cultures were not obtained. For all sites, the collection at DOL 7–10 were more likely to be positive than the collection at DOL 1–2: however, a significant proportion (5/77 = 6.5%, 95% CI: 2–15, P < 0.001) of infants with Ureaplasma spp. would have been missed if the DOL 1–2 cultures were not obtained.

Conclusions

For optimal Ureaplasma spp. detection in 24- to 34-week premature infants, cultures need to be taken both early and late in the first 10 DOLs both from nasal and oral secretions.

What is the diagnosis?

Answer:

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species infections.

Case 1 had a Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum pelvic collection and metalware infection, and left hip septic arthritis (culture and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] positive). We propose that instrumentation of the genitourinary tract with a urinary catheter led to hematogenous metastatic seeding of these organisms. He was managed with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, and his fevers subsided and pain improved.

Case 2 had a M. hominis and Ureaplasma species retroperitoneal urinoma likely secondary to the ongoing urinary leak. The patient was commenced on doxycycline and demonstrated clinical improvement.

### Transition of the genital mollicutes from the second to the third trimester of pregnancy and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM women: a prospective, single-center cohort study from China [^5e6119bc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Based on this pregnancy cohort study, we found no statistically significant association between Molicutes infection and transition and adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM patients. However, when assessing for the first time the relationship between ureaplasma load variation and adverse pregnancy outcomes, we found that among GDM women with infection in both trimesters, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was significantly increased in GDM pregnant women with increased ureaplasma load from the second to the third trimester. This study highlights the need for quantitative screening for vaginal infections at different weeks of pregnancy in persistently infected GDM women and for careful personalized fertility treatment during perinatal period.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^fd74e7a4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Post hoc analyses

Patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation (n = 21) were of lower gestation and birth weight than TA-negative intubated participants (n = 52) and non-intubated infants (n = 47) (table 3). In 5/52 (10%) TA-negative and 18/47 (38%) non-intubated neonates, one or more nasopharyngeal samples were Ureaplasma positive. Outcomes including Ureaplasma -free survival, overall survival, physiological BPD-free survival, durations of hospitalisation, mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and postnatal steroid exposure were less favourable in patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation than intubated infants without lower tract involvement or non-intubated patients (table 3). In patients with lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation, physiological BPD-free survival was 50% (5/10), (95% CI 19% to 81%) in azithromycin-treated versus 18% (2/11), (95% CI 2% to 52%) in placebo-treated infants (p = 0.18) (table 4).

Safety

Common morbidities of prematurity occurring after randomisation and prior to hospital discharge were similar between treatment groups (table 5) and when stratified by race (online supplementary table 2S). Posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) was more common in the azithromycin-assigned compared with the placebo group (6 vs 0). Prior to dosing, IVH status was unknown in 4/6 of these infants; 1/6 had grade 2 IVH; and 1/6 received no azithromycin. Among those assigned to azithromycin, 11/56 (20%) had retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) > stage 2 compared with 4/56 (7%) assigned to placebo. ROP was more common in white infants in both treatment groups than non-white infants, which appears to explain most of this difference (online supplementary table 2S). There were no reported cases of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) or QT-interval prolongation.

### Maternal azithromycin therapy for Ureaplasma parvum intraamniotic infection improves fetal hemodynamics in a nonhuman primate model [^290f80c7]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureaplasma parvum infection is a prevalent cause of intrauterine infection associated with preterm birth, preterm premature rupture of membranes, fetal inflammatory response syndrome, and adverse postnatal sequelae. Elucidation of diagnostic and treatment strategies for infection-associated preterm labor may improve perinatal and long-term outcomes for these cases.

Objective

This study assessed the effect of intraamniotic Ureaplasma infection on fetal hemodynamic and cardiac function and the effect of maternal antibiotic treatment on these outcomes.

Study Design

Chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys were assigned to control (n = 6), intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum (10⁷ colony-forming units/mL, n = 15), and intraamniotic infection plus azithromycin treatment (12.5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously, n = 8) groups. At approximately 135 days' gestation (term = 165 days), pulsed and color Doppler ultrasonography was used to obtain measurements of fetal hemodynamics (pulsatility index of umbilical artery, ductus venosus, descending aorta, ductus arteriosus, aortic isthmus, right pulmonary artery, middle cerebral artery and cerebroplacental ratio, and left and right ventricular cardiac outputs) and cardiac function (ratio of peak early vs late transmitral flow velocity [marker of ventricular function], Tei index [myocardial performance index]). These indices were stratified by amniotic fluid proinflammatory mediator levels and cardiac histology.

Results

Umbilical and fetal pulmonary artery vascular impedances were significantly increased in animals from the intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum group (P < .05). Azithromycin treatment restored values to control levels. Amniotic fluid prostaglandin F2 alpha levels were significantly higher in animals with abnormal umbilical artery pulsatility index (> 1.1) than in those with normal blood flow (P < .05; Spearman ρ = 0.6, P < .05). In the intraamniotic inoculation with Ureaplasma parvum group, left ventricular cardiac output was significantly decreased (P < .001), and more animals had abnormal right-to-left ventricular cardiac output ratios (defined as > 1.6, P < .05). Amniotic fluid interleukin-6 concentrations were elevated in cases of abnormal right-to-left ventricular cardiac output ratios compared with those in normal cases (P < .05).

Conclusion

Fetal hemodynamic alterations were associated with intraamniotic Ureaplasma infection and ameliorated after maternal antibiotic treatment. Doppler ultrasonographic measurements merit continuing investigation as a diagnostic method to identify fetal cardiovascular and hemodynamic compromise associated with intrauterine infection or inflammation and in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions or clinical management of preterm labor.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^39c70fd7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cervicitis — diagnostic evaluation and testing — because cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract infection, women should be assessed for signs of PID and tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) with nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples, and women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis; because sensitivity of microscopy for detecting Trichomonas vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet mount should receive further testing (NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared test). Testing for Mycoplasma genitalium with the FDA-cleared NAAT can be considered, while although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown, and testing for Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital culture for group B streptococcus is not recommended. Leukorrhea, defined as > 10 WBCs/HPF on microscopic examination of vaginal fluid, might be a sensitive indicator of cervical inflammation with a high negative predictive value.

### The value of Ureaplasma urealyticum tracheal culture and treatment in premature infants following an acute respiratory deterioration [^2b704bca]. Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), found at the time of an acute respiratory deterioration, decreases the incidence of chronic lung disease (CLD) in very low birth weight infants (VLBW).

Study Design

Between 1996 and 1999, medical records of all mechanically ventilated VLBW infants, who had an acute respiratory deterioration, were reviewed for gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), gender, presence of CLD, Uu tracheal cultures, and erythromycin treatment.

Results

A total of 100 patients met our inclusion criteria (GA: 26.2 ± 1.7 weeks, BW: 737 ± 167.1 g (mean ± SD)). Uu was present in 46.3% (38/82) of patients with CLD versus 50% (9/18) of patients without CLD (odds ratio 0.86 (CI: 0.31 to 2.39); p = 0.77). Erythromycin treatment was not found to be protective against the development of CLD (odds ratio: 1.46 (CI: 0.25 to 8.31); p = 0.66).

Conclusion

Following an acute respiratory deterioration, tracheal isolation, and treatment of Uu may not decrease the incidence of CLD in VLBW infants.

### Randomised trial of azithromycin to eradicatein preterm infants [^05670593]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

To accomplish an analysis according to the principle of intention to treat and avoid treating death as a good or neutral outcome, we defined our primary outcome as Ureaplasma -free survival (ie, survival to NICU discharge with three negative cultures post-treatment). Secondary outcomes were mortality, Ureaplasma clearance, physiological BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) determined by a room air challenge (RAC), comorbidities of prematurity and duration of respiratory support. Participants were assessed at 36 ± 1 weeks' PMA and physiological BPD classified as present if they were receiving positive pressure respiratory support, nasal cannula flow ≥ 4 liters per minute (LPM or effective fractional inspired oxygen > 0.3or failed a RAC. To compare with BPD rates in other neonatal trials, participants were also classified according to the BPD severityand the modified Shennan classificationthat assigned infants on supplemental oxygen at 36 0 week as BPD present regardless of respiratory support and infants discharged home on room air < 36 weeks' PMA as BPD absent.

Sample size and statistical analysis

Using a two-sided α level of 0.05 and assuming an 80% overall survival rate in both groups, 20% twins and a 25% placebo clearance rate, the study would have power of 0.8 to detect an absolute 40% difference in the primary outcome of Ureaplasma -free survival with enrolment of 30 Ureaplasma -positive infants in each group. With an expected 45% respiratory prevalenceand 5% drop-out rate, we planned to enrol 140 participants. The principal investigator (RV) ended recruitment without any information on the unblinded treatment comparisons when 121 neonates had been randomised because of interruption to funding.

For the efficacy analysis, we compared Ureaplasma eradication and other outcomes among all randomised participants according to the principle of intention to treat and in the subgroups of Ureaplasma -positive and Ureaplasma -negative participants to estimate the extent to which azithromycin had efficacy beyond clearance. To account for possible correlation between outcomes in twins, we used generalised estimating equationsand multiple outputation. When observed counts were small, we used exact methods without accounting for twinning to calculate p values and CIs. Additional details of the statistical analysis plan are described in the online supplementary file 1.

In post hoc analyses, we explored the impact of lower respiratory tract Ureaplasma colonisation on the primary and major secondary outcomes.

All analyses were performed using SAS V.9.4.

Etiology

C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology of cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. Trichomoniasis, genital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or M. genitalium (,–) also have been associated with cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no organism is isolated, especially among women at relatively low risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g. women aged > 30 years). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent douching might cause cervicitis. The majority of persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might be involved (e.g. persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, M. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical irritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of ectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between group B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis. No specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or Ureaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis.

Diagnostic Considerations

Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract infection (e.g. endometritis), women should be assessed for signs of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae with NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV and trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for detecting T. vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e. NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) (see Trichomoniasis). Testing for M. genitalium with the FDA-cleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e. PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. Testing for U. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital culture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^a204a136]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

ASB and struvite stones — management of urease-producing bacteriuria: Certain bacteria (most commonly P. mirabilis) produce urease and are associated with infection (struvite) stones, and when infection stones are present, complete removal of the stones is required to eradicate the associated UTI. However, there is no clear evidence that identification and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) caused by urease-producing organisms prevents struvite stone formation, and for these reasons the Panel does not recommend the routine treatment of urease-producing bacteriuria (including P. mirabilis) in the absence of UTI symptoms or documented urinary tract stones. In certain patients with recurrent struvite stones, screening for and treating urease-producing bacteriuria may be indicated if other measures have not been able to prevent stone formation.

Recruitment and collection of baseline data

The study procedure is feasible as it draws on usual antenatal care in pregnancy, and is similar to the Kiss trial (see Table 1). The research nurse will ask eligible women to participate, explain the trial and obtain informed consent, collect baseline data and ask women to self-collect a vaginal swab. This is only a minor departure from current practice.

Table 1
Trial Schema

* primary outcome data (preterm birth rates) will be obtained for all women screened regardless of the result

As women of child-bearing age are known to be very mobile, participants will be asked to provide their parents and other alternative contact details (eg friend or relative) to enhance subsequent follow-up. Women will also be asked to specify their preferred method of contact - women in our pilot study have shown a strong preference for email contact. Self-collection of vaginal swabs is commonly used for screening in pregnancy. We have also successfully used this method of specimen collection in a study of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum colonisation in pregnancy and in our pilot study. The detection rate of Candida using self-collection is not different from techniques that are more invasive, requiring the use of a speculum.

Randomisation

Eligible women who are culture positive for Candida will be randomised to receive active treatment with clotrimazole or usual care. The randomisation schedule will be prepared and centrally administered by a researcher not involved in patient care. A computer random number generator will be used to prepare the randomisation schedule with permuted blocks and 1:1 randomisation. The women randomised to open-label clotrimazole treatment will be notified by phone by a research nurse. A central pharmacy will be responsible for dispensing the study medication which will be sent to participants by mail from the coordinating centre. This approach has been acceptable and successful in the pilot study.

Specimen collection and transport

Surveillance for Candida isolates will be conducted at 12–19 weeks of pregnancy. A vaginal swab will be self-collected and inoculated immediately into Amies Transport Media, stored at room temperature and transported to Royal North Shore Hospital (Sydney) within 24 hours. All swabs will be identified with date of collection, patient's study number, packaged according to IATA guidelines, and transported to Pacific Laboratory Medicine Service (PaLMs), Royal North Shore Hospital.

### The role of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma in adverse pregnancy outcomes [^57bdcbd9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Genital mycoplasmas are frequently found in the vaginal flora across socioeconomic and ethnic groups and have been demonstrated to be involved in adverse perinatal outcomes. Both Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp cause inflammation potentially leading to spontaneous preterm birth and PPROM as well as postdelivery infectious complications and neonatal infections. Herein we have provided an overview of the existing literature and supportive evidence for genital mycoplasma's role in perinatal complications. Future research will need to focus on clearly delineating the species, allowing for discrimination of their effects.

Sexually transmitted diseases

HIV–AIDS

HIV‐positive pregnant women demonstrate a 3–4‐fold increased risk of preterm birth compared to HIV‐negative counterparts. The role of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly protease inhibitor‐based regimens (e.g. ritonavir‐boosted), in this association remains controversial, with several studies suggesting increased risk of preterm delivery. Timing of ART initiation is a potential confounder due to selection bias. Ongoing investigations are evaluating vaginal progesterone supplementation as a preventive intervention in women on protease inhibitor‐based ART.

Syphilis

Despite widespread screening availability, Treponema pallidum infection persists globally and has resurged in prevalence. Congenital syphilis is associated with preterm birth and other adverse outcomes. Early detection via routine and preconception visits remains a critical prevention strategy.

Hepatitis B virus infection

Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is associated with a 16% increased risk of preterm birth, rising to 21% among HBsAg+/HBeAg+ women, with findings corroborated by more recent data. Preventive strategies include vaccination and preconception screening.

Human papilloma virus

Evidence on the link between human papilloma virus (HPV) and preterm birth is mixed. Persistent HPV infection, especially types 16 and 18, has been associated with increased risk of preterm birth, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM), and neonatal mortality. The risk is higher in women with treated high‐grade CIN. Detection of HPV in both the cervix and the placenta correlates with adverse outcomes, including miscarriage. These observations underscore the need for further studies into HPV pathophysiology and vaccine impact during pregnancy.

Trichomonas vaginalis

Meta‐analyses confirm associations with low birth weight, preterm birth, and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). Coinfection with bacterial vaginosis is common (40%–60%) and might increase susceptibility. Considering that Trichomonas vaginalis infection can be easily diagnosed and treated, it should be regarded in everyone of reproductive age.

Ureaplasma colonization

A meta‐analysis involving 11 990 pregnant women found that Ureaplasma colonization increased the risk of preterm birth (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.63–4.68), chorioamnionitis (OR 2.71, 95% CI 2.02–3.64), and PROM (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.34–3.58). However, due to low‐quality evidence, well‐designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSBphenotype).

Antimicrobial Activity

Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus
Streptococcus agalactiae
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus pyogenes

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Haemophilus ducreyi
Haemophilus influenzae
Moraxella catarrhalis
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Other Bacteria

Chlamydophila pneumoniae
Chlamydia trachomatis
Mycoplasma pneumoniae

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Beta-hemolytic streptococci (Groups C, F, G)
Viridans group streptococci

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Bordetella pertussis
Legionella pneumophila

Anaerobic Bacteria

Prevotella bivia
Peptostreptococcus species

Other Bacteria

Ureaplasma urealyticum

### Randomized trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respiratory colonization in preterm infants: 2-year outcomes [^c64e57d6]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurodevelopmental outcomes

NDI classification was successfully assigned for 93/109 (85%) survivors (BSID-III, N = 43; ASQ3, N = 44; and medical record review, N = 6; Table 3). The observed frequency of the composite outcome of death or moderate-to-severe NDI was 47% for the AZM treatment and 33% for the placebo arms for the entire cohort with risk difference 16% after adjusting for twins (95% confidence interval −2 to 34%, p = 0.11). There were no significant differences in composite outcome of death or moderate–severe NDI when stratified by Ureaplasma respiratory colonization status (Table 3) or race (Supplemental Table 1). There were no significant differences between treatment arms for the individual components of NDI, including the frequency of BSID-III composite cognitive score < 85 or ASQ3 > 2 SD below the mean in any domain and moderate–severe CP or GMFCS score ≥ 2. In addition, there was no difference between groups for BSID-III cognitive composite score using cutoff < 70. Of note, infants who had any grade IVH had a significantly increased risk for moderate-to-severe NDI and cognitive impairment than infants without IVH after controlling for treatment in logistic regression analysis (p = 0.024) (Supplemental Fig. 2). No surviving participant was blind or had disabling hearing impairment.

Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) testing and screening — M. genitalium is a recognized pathogen causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in males and cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, with 15%–25% of infections due to this organism; NAATs are the best option for detection. Currently, 2 NAATs for M. genitalium are FDA cleared (Hologic Aptima M. Gen Assay and Abbott's Alinity STI assay) for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, and vaginal swab samples. Routine screening is not recommended in asymptomatic men or women, and testing should be considered in persistent NGU or PID. Molecular tests for resistance markers to macrolides and fluoroquinolones are not commercially available in the United States, and culture or NAATs for Ureaplasma are not recommended because of the high prevalence of colonization in asymptomatic, sexually active people.
