## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what point the physician should initiate a discussion regarding advance directive planning for a 68-year-old woman newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and which option among the provided choices best aligns with guideline-based care and patient-centered practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prognostic context of pancreatic cancer and how that informs timing. Then, I should verify what major oncology guidelines say about when to discuss goals of care and advance directives. Next, I will review patient preference data on who should initiate and when. After that, I should weigh the risks of delaying versus the risks of early discussion. Finally, I will apply a communication framework to tailor the approach and choose the best option, correcting any misconceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Pancreatic cancer is typically advanced at diagnosis and carries a poor 5-year survival, with most patients presenting with unresectable or metastatic disease and median survival often measured in months, not years; this materially shortens the window for effective advance care planning if we wait for deterioration, so timing matters substantially here [^112Zt65z] [^116C6uEX].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on timing. ASCO's 2020 metastatic pancreatic cancer guideline explicitly recommends that goals of care — including discussion of an advance directive — be addressed with every patient and their caregivers, alongside patient preferences and support systems, and this should be done early rather than deferred to later in the disease course; I should confirm that this applies broadly, not only to metastatic cases, given the overall prognosis profile of pancreatic cancer, and indeed ASCO also advises comprehensive symptom, psychosocial, and support assessments early, ideally at the first visit, reinforcing early ACP as a standard element of care [^111XRb3C] [^112QrbkZ] [^11572JqS].

> Hold on, I should verify what NCCN says as well. NCCN recommends early, routine palliative care involvement for pancreatic cancer and encourages advance care planning; while some phrasing uses "consider", the weight of consensus is to integrate ACP into multidisciplinary care early, and multidisciplinary care is itself emphasized as standard in pancreatic cancer pathways, which practically embeds ACP early by default [^112zxVxK] [^1155iqWP] [^114ckA1L].

> I will now examine patient preference data. Wait, let me verify who patients want to initiate these discussions. Studies show most cancer patients accept or prefer that clinicians initiate ACP conversations when appropriate, with roughly 58–75% endorsing physician initiation; moreover, qualitative work indicates patients value relationship-based communication and may be more receptive when trusted clinicians normalize ACP as part of good care, even if they initially defer documentation or decision-making [^117EU6Jm] [^1172Zzsr].

> Let me consider the risks of delaying. I should double-check the harms of waiting until hospice. Patients who enter ACP late are more likely to receive unwanted aggressive care, have poor symptom control, and experience higher family distress; documentation often clusters near the end of life or even the last week, which is too late to guide decisions meaningfully, and crises can erode capacity and surrogate clarity, making goal-concordant care harder to achieve [^112CBzEL] [^117BWiqL].

> But wait, what if I overgeneralize from metastatic disease to earlier stages? Let me reconsider and anchor to shared decision-making principles. Even for potentially curable presentations, ASCO recommends early assessment of symptoms, psychosocial needs, and supports, and it advises integrating palliative care early in disease; the principle of early, iterative ACP holds across stages because illness trajectories can change quickly and patients benefit from having a surrogate identified and values clarified in advance [^111dYbBX] [^1125ayKQ] [^111XRb3C].

> I need to ensure the approach is sensitive and individualized. The Ask-Tell-Ask framework helps me gauge readiness and titrate information; if the patient is overwhelmed, I can defer documentation but not the identification of a surrogate and a preliminary values discussion, returning to complete formal directives as readiness evolves; I should confirm this iterative model aligns with best-practice communication in serious illness, which it does [^116mUZjN] [^114HwMac] [^113HSXgP].

> Now, I should evaluate each option against this evidence. Option A, "speaking about advance directives is no longer an option now that she is ill", is incorrect; serious illness is precisely when ACP is most important and beneficial, and guidelines endorse early discussion, so I should reject this outright [^111XRb3C]. Option C, "wait until hospice", is too late and contradicts guidance to initiate early; ACP and palliative care are not synonymous with hospice, and deferral risks missed opportunities and crisis-driven decisions, so this is not appropriate either [^1125ayKQ]. Option D, "only if she initiates", places an undue burden on patients who may be uncertain or deferential; patient preference studies and guideline expectations support clinician initiation with careful communication, so I should not rely on patient initiation alone [^117EU6Jm] [^111XRb3C].

> Option B, "at this visit", aligns with guideline timing and patient-centered care principles; let me confirm the practical steps I would take now. I would introduce ACP as a routine part of high-quality cancer care, ask who she would want to make decisions if she cannot, and begin to elicit values and goals; I would avoid forcing immediate documentation if she is not ready, but I would document the surrogate and the start of the conversation, and I would offer early palliative care referral to support symptom control and ongoing ACP, clarifying that palliative care is not hospice and can proceed alongside disease-directed therapy [^111XRb3C] [^1125ayKQ] [^1156FbHQ].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the final choice and rationale. The best answer is B, initiate the discussion at this visit, because pancreatic cancer's poor prognosis and unpredictable trajectory make early ACP essential; major guidelines explicitly recommend early goals-of-care and ACP discussions, patient preference data support clinician initiation, and delaying until hospice or relying on patient initiation risks goal-discordant care and missed opportunities for peace of mind and family preparation [^111XRb3C] [^117EU6Jm] [^117BWiqL].

---

The correct answer is **B. At this visit**. For patients with pancreatic cancer, advance directive planning should begin **immediately at diagnosis** [^111XRb3C] because of the disease's aggressive course and poor prognosis [^112Zt65z]. Early discussions ensure **goal-concordant care** [^117H6EQA], reduce unwanted interventions, and support patients and families through the illness trajectory [^117Ew2ML]. Waiting until hospice or only if the patient initiates risks missed opportunities and distress at the end of life [^112CBzEL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ASCO guidelines**: Discuss goals of care, including advance directives, with all patients with pancreatic cancer and their caregivers at diagnosis [^111XRb3C] [^112QrbkZ].
- **NCCN guidelines**: Encourage advance care planning for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [^112zxVxK].
- **ESMO guidelines**: Emphasize early palliative care and advance care planning in advanced pancreatic cancer [^notfound].

---

## Benefits of early advance directive planning

Early advance directive planning provides several **benefits**:

- **Goal-concordant care**: Ensures care aligns with patient preferences and values [^117H6EQA].
- **Reduced stress**: Decreases decisional burden and stress for patients and families [^1172Zzsr] [^113USzrx].
- **Improved quality of life**: Facilitates timely palliative care and symptom management [^notfound].
- **Avoidance of unwanted interventions**: Reduces aggressive, non-beneficial treatments [^113USzrx].

---

## Risks of delayed advance directive planning

Delaying advance directive planning can lead to **missed opportunities** for timely, goal-concordant care and increase the likelihood of aggressive, non-beneficial interventions [^112CBzEL]. It also heightens stress and anxiety for patients and families facing uncertainty and complex decisions, and may result in care that does not reflect patient preferences, causing regret and distress [^112CBzEL].

---

## Patient preferences and communication strategies

Patients generally prefer that clinicians initiate advance directive discussions, using **clear, empathetic communication** [^117EU6Jm] [^1172Zzsr]. The Ask-Tell-Ask framework and shared decision-making support patient engagement and understanding [^116mUZjN] [^1144iLtx].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given pancreatic cancer's aggressive course, **advance directive planning should begin at diagnosis** [^111XRb3C]. Early discussions ensure goal-concordant care, reduce stress, and improve quality of life [^1156FbHQ]. Clinicians should initiate these conversations using clear, empathetic communication and shared decision-making [^112kDVEj].

It has been two decades since advance directives have become an integral part of health care. Impediments to their optimal usage are common and multifactorial. Decisions commonly have to be made when patients are unable to do so or choose not to participate in decision making, often at the end of life. The use of two questions, 1) "If you cannot, or choose not to participate in health care decisions, with whom should we speak?" and 2) "If you cannot, or choose not to participate in decision making, what should we consider when making decisions about your care?", may accomplish the major goals of an advance directive.

### Definition and recommendations for advance care planning: an international consensus supported by the European association for palliative care [^113HSXgP]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Advance care planning (ACP) is increasingly implemented in oncology and beyond, but a definition of ACP and recommendations concerning its use are lacking. We used a formal Delphi consensus process to help develop a definition of ACP and provide recommendations for its application. Of the 109 experts (82 from Europe, 16 from North America, and 11 from Australia) who rated the ACP definitions and its 41 recommendations, agreement for each definition or recommendation was between 68–100%. ACP was defined as the ability to enable individuals to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these goals and preferences with family and health-care providers, and to record and review these preferences if appropriate. Recommendations included the adaptation of ACP based on the readiness of the individual; targeting ACP content as the individual's health condition worsens; and, using trained non-physician facilitators to support the ACP process. We present a list of outcome measures to enable the pooling and comparison of results of ACP studies. We believe that our recommendations can provide guidance for clinical practice, ACP policy, and research.

Advance care planning (ACP) discussions aim to ensure goal-concordant care for patients with serious illness, throughout treatment and especially at the end of life. But recent literature has forced the field of palliative care to wrestle with the definition and impact of ACP. Are ACP discussions worthwhile? Is there a difference between ACP discussions early in a patient's illness versus discussions occurring later when a concrete medical care decision must be made? Here, we identify elements needed to answer these questions and describe how a multisite initiative will elucidate the value of discussing and documenting what matters most to patients.

### Beyond advance directives: importance of communication skills at the end of life [^115VsTkC]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Patients and their families struggle with myriad choices concerning medical treatments that frequently precede death. Advance directives have been proposed as a tool to facilitate end-of-life decision making, yet frequently fail to achieve this goal. In the context of the case of a man with metastatic cancer for whom an advance directive was unable to prevent a traumatic death, I review the challenges in creating and implementing advance directives, discuss factors that can affect clear decision making; including trust, uncertainty, emotion, hope, and the presence of multiple medical providers; and offer practical suggestions for physicians. Advance care planning remains a useful tool for approaching conversations with patients about the end of life. However, such planning should occur within a framework that emphasizes responding to patient and family emotions and focuses more on goals for care and less on specific treatments.

In 2016, the American Society of Clinical Oncology published a guideline recommending that all patients with advanced cancer be referred to palliative care providers. This recommendation was based on a series of trials showing that palliative care, when added to standard oncology treatment, improves outcomes, including quality of life. Here, 2 oncologists, 1 of whom is also a palliative care specialist, debate the guideline and discuss how best to care for a 71-year-old woman with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma who has a short life expectancy but feels well and has no symptoms related to her cancer or chemotherapy.

### Patient engagement with early stage advance care planning at a comprehensive cancer center [^112widqu]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advance care planning (ACP) is valued for promoting patient autonomy at the end-of-life, to support goal-concordant care. Contingent upon expert communication, ACP involves sharing knowledge related to prognosis, treatment options, and the patient's values, goals, and care preferences among patients, family members, and clinicians. An available, capable Medical Power of Attorney (MPOA) supports early engagement in and is foundational to ACP, as many individuals lose the capacity for medical decision-making toward the end-of-life. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of ACP and the need for surrogate decision-makers to support goal-concordant care.

As national priority, ACP is an important determinant of patient and family satisfaction with care and is linked with improved bereavement, resource utilization, and reimbursement outcomes. For individuals with serious medical illnesses, establishing care preferences is integral to treatment planning. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends documentation of advance directive (AD) discussions by the 3rd office visit for patients diagnosed with cancer, consistent with patients' preferences for physician ACP discussion in the outpatient setting.

### Factors impacting informed decision-making for patients with pancreatic cancer: a qualitative study [^116mUZjN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

An additional challenge is understanding how much information patients are interested in receiving and titrating discussions appropriately for each patient based on individual information preferences. As our study highlights, there is a spectrum of information needs among patients, with some patients wanting as much information as possible, and others wanting just enough to make treatment decisions. One proposed solution is to incorporate the Ask-Tell-Ask framework into treatment discussions. This is a process in which a provider first explores the patient's baseline knowledge and information needs, then provides information based on the initial assessment, and then follows up with the patient to identify if any information gaps remain. An alternative solution that can be employed before the clinical encounter is pre-visit preference assessments. These are short surveys that can help elicit a patient's treatment goals before discussion with the medical team, allowing providers to tailor discussions based on a patient's responses. Within prostate cancer, the implementation of a pre-visit preference assessment was associated with improved satisfaction with care and treatment decisions and reduced decisional regret. Such processes have not been directly examined within pancreatic cancer and warrant further investigation.

### How to communicate with patients about future illness progression and end of life: a systematic review [^1113fYd6]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

There is consensus that people who are frail or have a specific terminal diagnosis should be provided with opportunities to discuss their future care and treatment preferences. Conversations about these matters form part of advance care planning discussions — these aim to help individuals anticipate how their condition may affect them in the future and, if they wish, to set on record their preferences, choices and advance decisions to refuse treatment. However, there is evidence that in practice, patients and healthcare professionals rarely discuss future difficulties and plans. Surveys of clinicians have found that they report lack of confidence, skills and knowledge about how to initiate such discussions, making them reticent to do so. Clinicians also report that these conversations can be uncomfortable and challenging, with difficulties including ascertaining patients' preferences, and deciding on the 'right time' to raise such matters. These challenges are exacerbated by patients' and their companions' own reticence and ambivalence with regard to initiating these conversations. Clinicians wantand needmore evidence-based guidance on optimal strategies for communicating about these matters with patients and their significant others. While practitioners are encouraged to provide those who consult them with opportunities to engage in advance care planning, guidelines also stress that this should be a voluntary engagement, and there is evidence that some patients strongly prefer not to discuss such matters. Practitioners thus also need to know how to sensitively ascertain and respond to patients' preferences in this regard.

### Documentation of discussions about prognosis with terminally ill patients [^116LF7rT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous studies have suggested the importance of communicating with patients about prognosis at the end of life, yet the prevalence, content, and consequences of such communication have not been fully investigated. The purposes of this study were to estimate the proportion of terminally ill inpatients with documented discussions about prognosis, describe the nature and correlates of such discussions, and assess the association between documented discussions about prognosis and subsequent advance care planning.

Subjects and Methods

Inpatients (n = 232) at least 65 years old who had brain, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, or inoperable lung cancer were randomly selected from six randomly chosen community hospitals in Connecticut. The presence and content of discussions about prognosis, advanced care planning efforts, and sociodemographic and clinical factors were ascertained by comprehensive review of medical records using a standardized abstraction form.

Results

Discussions about prognosis were documented in the medical records of 89 (38%) patients. Physicians and patients were both present during the discussion in 46 (52%) of these cases. Time until expected death was infrequently documented. Having a documented discussion about prognosis was associated with documented discussions of life-sustaining treatments (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8 to 12.0) and having a do-not-resuscitate order (adjusted OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1 to 4.2).

Conclusions

Among terminally ill patients with cancer, discussions about prognosis as documented in medical charts are infrequent and limited in scope. In some cases, such documented discussions may be important catalysts for subsequent discussions of patient and family preferences regarding treatment and future care.

### Discussions of life expectancy and changes in illness understanding in patients with advanced cancer [^112UM1GH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Results of this study demonstrate how poorly patients with advanced cancer understand their prognoses and how effective recent prognostic discussions are to improve illness understanding by patients. All enrolled patients in this study had incurable cancer that was at an advanced stage (eg, late, stage IV gastrointestinal cancer) and a life expectancy of months, not years. A small minority of patients accurately, and completely, understood the gravity of their illnesses (eg, 5% endorsed each element of the terminal prognosis at study entry); approximately one in four (23%) reported only recent or recent and past discussion of prognosis with the oncologist. Patients who reported at least a recent discussion about prognosis with the oncology provider exhibited significant improvements in illness understanding. These results highlight the need for timely (ie, current) prognostic disclosures to terminally ill patients who meet the criteria used for this study. The results also suggest that oncologists should discuss prognosis on an ongoing basis, and as frequently as appropriate, with their terminally ill patients. If this occurred, patients would likely have better illness understanding and, thus, make more informed decisions about their end-of-life care.

These results are consistent with, and advance, the existing literature on illness understanding, prognostic disclosure, and advance care planning. The effect of recently reported prognostic discussions on improvements in illness understanding by patients is in line with the advance care planning strategy to regularly and dually address both dynamic medical situations and individual patient goals. This approach encourages medical decisions to be made in the momentinstead of on the basis of advance directive documents, which can sometimes be nonspecific, outdated, or unavailable. Consideration of prognostic understanding as an evolving awareness of one's changing health empowers patients, their loved ones, and their healthcare team to make informed decisions. Furthermore, recognition of the need to update patients frequently about a prognosis may help patients and families who struggleto come to terms with the terminal nature of a disease.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114WRYPh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Patient and clinician communication — goals, testing, and shared decision-making emphasizes that patients should fully understand the goals of care before making decisions about somatic and germline testing, treatment, and care, and that the importance of both somatic and germline testing and the implications of testing on treatment options is a conversation that should be had soon after the patient's diagnosis is confirmed. For patients to make informed decisions, providers should describe the potential impact of the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer on the patient and his or her family, and providers should ask patients about their personal goals and preferences. Providers should also describe the potential impact (both medical and emotional aspects) of genetic testing on both the patient with pancreatic cancer and their family. Clinicians should clearly explain all potential treatment options, the specific somatic and germline testing needed to determine the appropriateness of those treatment options, the potential outcomes of each, and possible adverse events so that patients understand the benefits and drawbacks of each option and can make an informed decision, and treatment discussions should include relevant clinical trials at every stage of treatment. Patients should have the opportunity to participate in trials for their own treatment and be given the opportunity to contribute to research.

### Contemporary patterns of end-of-life care among Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer [^115Cj6an]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US, with more than 611 720 cancer deaths in 2024. For patients with advanced cancers, the goal of care at end of life (EOL) is to maximize remaining quality of life. Optimal EOL care emphasizes symptom management and palliation, including hospice for patients ineligible for care with curative intent. Contrary to this goal, historical evidence has shown that patients with advanced cancer often receive potentially aggressive care at EOL, such as late initiation of systemic therapies and/or acute care use.,

Clinicians and professional societies have dedicated considerable efforts to improve the quality of EOL care in oncology in the past decade. From 2009 to 2017, new quality measures and guidelines on EOL care were established by the National Quality Forum and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), recommending early integration of palliative care and discontinuation of life-extending therapies. These efforts are situated within the Choosing Wisely initiative, a large campaign aimed at raising awareness of the harms of aggressive medical care. Moreover, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services began reimbursing advanced care planning (ACP) conversations in 2016 to further the goals of high-quality, patient-centered EOL care. Whether EOL care patterns shifted in response to these efforts is unknown because much contemporary evidence on this topic preceded these efforts.,

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of EOL care patterns in older, fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries dying of cancer between 2014 and 2019, incorporating the most recent sample of Medicare decedents from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare data linkage (at the time of study initiation). We examined a comprehensive set of measures to investigate care quality, including receipt of acute care, systemic therapies, palliative care (PC) and hospice care (HC), and ACP. We focus on patients originally diagnosed with distant-stage female breast, prostate, pancreatic, or lung cancer, for whom the quality of EOL care is a salient concern given poor prognosis at diagnosis.

### Factors impacting informed decision-making for patients with pancreatic cancer: a qualitative study [^115AogMP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Need support with information processing

The decision-making process occurs when patients are handling a new PC diagnosis, one well-known to be associated with poor outcomes and survival. Patients recognize that during these initial discussions, they are not at their sharpest and often will miss information presented to them or not recall the information at a later point. Several patients highlighted the importance of having a support network with them during clinic visits to capture the necessary information and be their spokesperson:

If it weren't for my [child], I wouldn't have remembered half the things I was told. You just get overwhelmed…

Beyond just emotional support, friends and family often serve as active participants in the clinical encounter, such as taking notes, asking clarifying questions, and ensuring that key information is understood and retained. Additionally, they may directly assist in the decision-making process for the patient, helping patients identify treatment options that align with their preferences:

[My significant other] did more research than anybody I've ever seen. She had all kinds of information, and if she didn't have it, the doctor had it. It was great to have her there to help me decide on what's the best treatment.

ASCO palliative care guideline — trial findings on early palliative care timing across cancer types indicate heterogeneous effects: "in a study assessing the effectiveness of palliative care within 8 weeks of diagnosis of incurable noncolon GI and lung cancer, early palliative care led to improvements in QOL and depression at 12 and 24 weeks versus usual oncology care in patients with lung cancer but not GI cancers". In breast cancer, "patients… evaluated within 8 weeks of one or more of several indicators of poor prognosis" had "a greater likelihood of documenting end-of-life discussions but without a difference in QOL or mood versus standard care". A surgical trial reported specialized palliative care "did not improve QOL", whereas "in a trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer… with a clinical prognosis of approximately 1 year, early specialized palliative care improved QOL versus standard oncology care". Notably, "the evidence has not shown any adverse events from palliative care interventions".

### Should this patient Be screened for pancreatic cancer? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^112Zt65z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Because pancreatic cancer is typically advanced at the time of diagnosis, it has a very low 5-year survival rate and may become the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A screening program to find early-stage pancreatic cancer is needed but has been challenging to develop because of the lack of an effective screening test. In 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force performed an evidence review and updated its guidance, confirming its 2004 "D" recommendation against routine screening for average-risk patients. Here, 2 experts review the updated guideline and recent evidence and discuss whether a patient with a family history of pancreatic cancer should undergo screening.

### Factors impacting informed decision-making for patients with pancreatic cancer: a qualitative study [^116wQ9cW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Opportunities for informed decision-making

Participants were asked how they felt a decision aid would affect their decision-making and whether it was something that should be offered to patients. Participants identified several opportunities for improved IDM by utilizing a decision aid, including suggesting how the decision aid should be incorporated into the current treatment discussion and what content would be valuable. The following sections offer a more in-depth exploration of these opportunities, with Table 3 presenting additional relevant quotations about the highlighted opportunities.

Table 3
Opportunities to improve informed decision-making

Decision aid — reference document

While generally receptive to the idea of a decision aid, interviewees differed in the ways they described how such a tool could help. For instance, some patients stated that having a decision aid that acted as a reference document could be useful, particularly in helping them remember key points regarding their treatment options:

In the beginning, you're still in shock… You're introduced to this whirlwind of appointments, and this is how this is going to work, and here's what we're going to be doing. You don't necessarily hear everything. But if they are given something to review after time, I think that they would go back to their documentation and review it.

This connects back to those patients who had a sense of information overload during the first consultation, often feeling that they could not remember important details regarding their diagnosis or treatment plan.

Content — what questions to ask

Participants reportedly wanted time to deliberate over their available options and not feel rushed to come to a decision. However, these interviewees also conveyed trust in their care team and noted feeling that they were receiving the best medical care with their best intentions in mind, regardless of whether they were deferring decision-making to the clinician. As one patient put it:

I didn't feel compelled to question what they were expressing to me because… I had this feeling of trust about it all…

This is not to say that participants were not interested in being involved in their care, as several participants expressed interest in their treatment plans, but many interviewees reflected that they were not well-equipped for these discussions. Participants noted that they often did not know what questions would be relevant or important in deciding a treatment plan:

At the beginning, I was so overwhelmed that there were a lot of things I didn't think to ask…

For some participants, a decision aid reportedly might have been useful prior to their clinic appointments as a way to help guide them through the discussion.

Content — supportive care resources

One area of content that participants thought would be useful in a decision aid was supportive care resources. For some patients, just being given the information can make all the difference:

I got a flyer that had all kinds of different things that were available and that kind of stuff… it really made a difference to me when the music therapist and the art therapist came and saw me and talked about what's available and how they can help.

One aspect of supportive care that would benefit from further explanation is palliative care, as many patients acknowledged being confused by the term or associating palliative care with only end-of-life or hospice care. Some patients were altogether unfamiliar with the term, as highlighted by one interviewee who stated:

I'm not even sure what the word [palliative care] means…

One avenue to invite discussion regarding palliative care would be through a decision aid. Some patients suggested that discussing palliative care earlier could be beneficial for future patients,

The more information (about Palliative Care) a patient has, the better. And I think if you give people in that position, let them know what their options are, here's the choices… I think that would be helpful

Correspondingly, for patients who are not ready or are uninterested in early discussions regarding supportive care, a decision aid could act as a reference document, available when the patient becomes more receptive to receiving the information.

### Redefining the "planning" in advance care planning: preparing for end-of-life decision making [^113Bp8fW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The traditional objective of advance care planning has been to have patients make treatment decisions in advance so that clinicians can attempt to provide care consistent with their goals. The authors contend that the objective for advance care planning ought to be the preparation of patients and surrogates to participate with clinicians in making the best possible in-the-moment medical decisions. They provide practical steps for clinicians to help patients and surrogate decision makers achieve this objective in the outpatient setting. Preparation for in-the-moment decision making shifts the focus from having patients make premature decisions based on incomplete information to preparing them and their surrogates for the types of decisions and conflicts they may encounter when they do have to make in-the-moment decisions. Advance directives, although important, are just one piece of information to be used at the time of decision making.

### What clinicians and researchers should know about the evolving field of advance care planning: a narrative review [^111MnGaC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

What ACP Tools Can Clinicians Use to Support Patients?

There are several resources for clinicians, from all interdisciplinary backgrounds, to start ACP discussions in an efficient way. These include easy-to-use, step-by-step scripts for clinicians, as well as online and other trainings.– We recommend beginning by asking all patients: (1) if they have identified a surrogate decision-maker whom they trust to make decisions in the event they are unable to make decisions for themselves; and (2) what they have already discussed with their surrogate in terms of their role and current medical preferences (Table 2). This provides helpful information including whether the individual is socially isolated (and needs additional help focusing on AD completion and other planning) or whether the person has begun to prepare their surrogate decision-maker through discussions about their goals, values, preferences, and what quality of life means to them. Based on these responses, a tailored approach can then be made based on patients' readiness and life course (Fig. 1)and using the aforementioned communication guides. Working with interdisciplinary team members can also provide valuable assistance. This step-by-step, team-based approach to ACP can help make the process less daunting and time consuming for any one individual team member in busy outpatient practices.

### What are cancer patients' preferences about treatment at the end of life, and who should start talking about it? A comparison with healthy people and medical staff [^117EU6Jm]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Goals Of The Work

In order to strengthen cancer patients' autonomy and to improve quality of palliative care, it is necessary to know what are the patients' preferences for treatment at the end of life, whether they accept the idea of advance directives, and who should initiate the process of fulfilling such a document.

Patients and Methods

We compared cancer patients' preferences with respect to particular treatment options at the end of life, acceptance of the idea of advance directives, and preferences for whom should initiate writing such a document with that of healthy controls, nursing staff, and physicians (n = 100 each group) using a structured questionnaire.

Results

Cancer patients wanted treatment with antibiotics and infringing treatments such as chemotherapy and dialysis significantly more often than healthy controls, nursing staff, and physicians (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Determinants associated with the wish to opt for these treatments were reduced health condition and older age. The groups did not differ with respect to their acceptance of advance directives; 58–75% of all those surveyed wanted their physicians to initiate a discussion about writing such a document if they thought it appropriate.

Conclusions

Cancer patients' preferences for treatment at the end of life significantly differ compared to other groups. Oncologists should initiate a discussion about an advance directive when/if the course of the illness seems to make this appropriate, which corresponds to the wish of the majority of cancer patients, healthy controls, and medical staff.

### Advanced practice nurse-led early palliative care: a novel model for improved access to care [^116xHigG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial consultation

The initial consultation is modelled after the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association (CHPCA) guidelines for palliative care and the WHO definition of palliative care. Each consultation is tailored to the needs of the patient and family/caregivers and is cognizant that each patient may be in a different stage of diagnostic workup. The consult is structured to include a discussion of patient and family/caregiver understanding of diagnosis and prognosis, pain and symptom management, medication review, emotional wellbeing, coping, general review of disease-specific treatment options where appropriate, goals of care discussion, advance care planning, patient and family/caregiver education, and suggested referrals (see Table 1).

Table 1
Description of the components of the early palliative care intervention, adapted from Kim CA, Lelond S, Daeninck PJ, Rabbani R, Lix L, McClement S, Chochinov HM, Goldenberg, BA (2022) The impact of early palliative care on the quality of life of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: The IMPERATIVE case-crossover study. Support Care Cancer 31:250

Prior to the initial EPC consult, the case has been reviewed by the DSG triage physician, who is a medical oncologist with expertise in pancreatic and liver cancers, and may have been reviewed in multidisciplinary rounds, by a hepatobiliary surgeon, a gastroenterologist, or other medical specialty. During the initial EPC consult, the advantages and disadvantages of relevant procedures (e.g. imaging-guided biopsy or endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy) and consults (e.g. medical oncology consultation to discuss systemic therapy options) are reviewed alongside a goals of care discussion. If a patient expresses a reasonable preference to forego upcoming diagnostic procedures, an oncology consultation, or cancer-directed therapy, along with a desire for referral to a community palliative care program, this is then reviewed with the DSG triage physician. Upon agreement, a referral is made to the local community palliative care program, and any unwanted upcoming appointments are cancelled. A plan for follow up and next steps is made at the end of the CNS consultation.

The CNS consult letter is sent to the primary care provider and copied to the referrer and all other relevant healthcare providers. This letter provides a summary of the consult, including symptom management recommendations, goals of care, advance care plan status, and substitute decision makers identified. It also identifies any additional referrals made as part of the CNS consult, the follow up plan and next steps, and any further requests required of the primary care provider.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1125ayKQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Patient and clinician communication — supportive care and quality-of-life guidance states that clinicians should also consider and proactively discuss quality-of-life issues, including dietary concerns, pain, and fatigue, and that referral to a registered dietitian and/or gastroenterologist with early intervention can be of great benefit; clinicians should also consider the use of, and discuss the possible need for, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Referral to palliative care services can facilitate addressing non–treatment-related issues, and this referral should be offered to all patients with pancreatic cancer, regardless of the stage of disease or expected prognosis; patients should understand that referral to a consultation for palliative care services is not synonymous with a referral to hospice care. Additionally, clinicians should support a patient's desire to get a second opinion, and clinicians should address the costs of care and offer referrals to specialists within the health care system who can discuss in more detail what a patient should expect as well as resources and information about managing the costs related to cancer care.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma carries a poor prognosis. Throughout the course of the disease and its management, patients experience a variety of symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life. It is paramount that palliative care is integrated early in the management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

### Factors impacting informed decision-making for patients with pancreatic cancer: a qualitative study [^116C6uEX]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patient-centeredness has been a key tenet of high-quality cancer care since its introduction in the 1960 s. Though varying definitions exist, the basis of patient-centered care is a partnership between a patient and a clinician that incorporates the patient's values, needs, and preferences into decision-making about healthcare choices. Several vital elements of patient-centered care include patient individuality, communication, empowerment, and respect, with shared decision-making (SDM) between the patient and clinician recognized as the crux of patient-centered care.

SDM refers to the collaboration between the patient and clinician to create treatment plans that align with a patient's goals, an alignment that is also referred to as goal-concordant care. For SDM to occur, patients and their caregivers must be well-informed regarding the nature of the disease, as well as about treatment options, including risks, benefits, and uncertainties (i.e. informed decision-making [IDM]). Particularly for patients with advanced cancer, prior studies have identified opportunities for improvements in SDM and IDM. One such example is the development of care plans for patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). With a 5-year survival rate of only 13% and limited treatment options, as less than one-fifth of patients are eligible for curative-intent resection, a PC diagnosis poses obstacles to decision-making. PC thus requires complex multidisciplinary treatment, which can further complicate the SDM and IDM processes as more clinicians are included in care teams.

Previous studies have identified the lack of available treatment choices as a barrier to IDM among patients with PC. However, the specific barriers and facilitators to effective IDM, and therefore SDM, in patients with PC are not fully understood. Furthermore, the use of decision aids, tools designed to assist patients in understanding their treatment options and what matters most to them, has been underexplored within PC, with limited patient input on their value. Therefore, the purpose of our qualitative study was to explore patients' perspectives about various aspects of IDM, focusing on topics related to their information needs, their understanding of treatment options, their involvement in the decision-making process, and suggestions about how a decision aid may improve the process.

### How should end-of-life advance care planning discussions Be implemented according to patients and informal carers? A qualitative review of reviews [^1172Zzsr]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

The goal of advance care planning (ACP) is to help ensure that the care people receive during periods of serious illness is consistent with their preferences and values. There is a lack of clear understanding about how patients and their informal carers feel ACP discussions should be implemented.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to synthesize literature reviews pertaining to patients' and informal carers' perspectives on ACP discussions.

Methods

This is a systematic review of reviews.

Results

We identified 55 literature reviews published between 2007 and 2018. ACP discussions were facilitated by a diverse range of formats and tools, all of which were acceptable to patients and carers. Patients and carers preferred health professionals to initiate discussions, with the relationships they had with the professionals being particularly important. There were mixed feelings about the best timing, with many people preferring to defer discussions until they perceived them to be clinically relevant. ACP was felt to bring benefits including a greater sense of peace and less worry, but it could also be disruptive and distressing. Patients and carers perceived many benefits from ACP discussions, but these may differ from the dominant narratives about ACP in health policy and may move away from the narratives of RCTs and standardization in research and practice.

Conclusion

Researchers and clinicians may need to adjust their approaches as current practices are not aligned enough with patients' and carers' preferences. Future research may need to test implementation strategies of ACP interventions to elucidate how benefits from standardization and flexibility might both be realized.

### End-of-life care: guidelines for patient-centered communication [^116PRrzf]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

When patients are diagnosed with cancer, primary care physicians often must deliver the bad news, discuss the prognosis, and make appropriate referrals. When delivering bad news, it is important to prioritize the key points that the patient should retain. Physicians should assess the patient's emotional state, readiness to engage in the discussion, and level of understanding about the condition. The discussion should be tailored according to these assessments. Often, multiple visits are needed. When discussing prognosis, physicians should be sensitive to variations in how much information patients want to know. The challenge for physicians is to communicate prognosis accurately without giving false hope. All physicians involved in the patient's care should coordinate their key prognosis points to avoid giving the patient mixed messages. As the disease progresses, physicians must reassess treatment effectiveness and discuss the values, goals, and preferences of the patient and family. It is important to initiate conversations about palliative care early in the disease course when the patient is still feeling well. There are innovative hospice programs that allow for simultaneous curative and palliative care. When physicians discuss the transition from curative to palliative care, they should avoid phrases that may convey to the patient a sense of failure or abandonment. Physicians also must be cognizant of how cultural factors may affect end-of-life discussions. Sensitivity to a patient's cultural and individual preferences will help the physician avoid stereotyping and making incorrect assumptions.

### Decision making at a time of crisis near the end of life [^114NQDW6]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

As patients approach the end of life, their disease process may create an immediate life-threatening emergency, yet invasive interventions may be less likely to provide benefit while carrying the same or greater risks. Knowing when it is time to shift from life-prolonging to more palliative approaches, focused on quality of life and comfort, is emotionally and clinically challenging for patients, families, and physicians. Key factors in the decision process include prognosis, risk-benefit analysis of the proposed intervention, current symptom burden, temporal pattern of the illness, patient's age and life stage, and the patient's goals of care. A structured approach to decision making includes assessing the patient's physical, psychological, and spiritual needs; assessing the patient's support system; discussing prognosis; and assessing patient-specific goals. Physicians can best help patients decide which treatments are appropriate by taking the necessary time to explore all curative and palliative care options, providing honest and timely prognostic information, making clear recommendations, facilitating patient-family discussions, and affirming patient choices.

### Paradoxes in advance care planning: the complex relationship of oncology patients, their physicians, and advance medical directives [^111Mw4Vm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many seriously ill patients with cancer do not discuss prognosis or advance directives (ADs), which may lead to inappropriate and/or unwanted aggressive care at the end of life. Ten years ago, patients with cancer said they would not like to discuss ADs with their oncologist but would be willing to discuss them with an admitting physician. We assessed whether this point of view still held.

Patients and Methods

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 75 consecutively admitted patients with cancer in the cancer inpatient service.

Results

Of those enrolled, 41% (31 of 75) had an AD. Nearly all (87%, 65 of 75) thought it acceptable to discuss ADs with the admitting physician with whom they had no prior relationship, and 95% (62 of 65) thought that discussing AD issues was very or somewhat important. Only 7% (5 of 75) had discussed ADs with their oncologist, and only 23% (16 of 70) would like to discuss ADs with their oncologist. When specifically asked which physician they would choose, 48% (36 of 75) of patients would prefer their oncologist, and 35% (26 of 75) would prefer their primary care physician.

Conclusion

Fewer than half of seriously ill patients with cancer admitted to an oncology service have an AD. Only 23% (16 of 70) would like to discuss their ADs with their oncologist but nearly all supported a policy of discussing ADs with their admitting physician. However, fully 48% (36 of 75) actually preferred to discuss advance directives with their oncologist if AD discussion was necessary. We must educate patients on why communicating their ADs is beneficial and train primary care physicians, house staff, hospitalists, and oncologists to initiate these difficult discussions.

Path B

Following a knee replacement surgery five years ago, the patient's PCP helped identify a surrogate decision-maker and gave her patient-friendly ACP materials. At the time of her cancer diagnosis, her oncologist discussed how ACP could help her and her family prepare for medical decision-making and answered her questions. This allowed the patient to have several conversations with her sister and daughter. The patient had been seen by her oncologist and PCP several times over the last year where they provided support for serious illness understanding and helped her and her family cope with her cancer. They made sure to set time aside to rediscuss her ACP wishes with the primary care social worker. During her hospitalization, she decompensates, and the hospitalist goes to the ACP dashboard in the electronic health record to pull open the most recently documented discussion from the primary care social worker. It notes the patient's sister as her decision-maker, and that if she got so sick that she might die, the most important thing would be to be surrounded by her family and "not hooked up to machines like my mom was in the end". The hospitalist calls the sister who tearfully confirms they had spoken about this before and that she has a copy of an advance directive listing her as the durable power of attorney. The sister requests that the patient be made as comfortable as possible while she gathers the patient's daughter and other family members to come in. The patient is placed on high-flow oxygen, the palliative care team is called, and the medical teams prioritize her comfort and supporting the family at her bedside.

### Do patients with lung cancer recall physician-initiated discussions about planning for end-of-life care following disclosure of a terminal prognosis? [^111CnTVf]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2019). High credibility.

Background

Communicating with patients about their prognosis and goals of care, including offering opportunities to engage in advance care planning (ACP) is widely recognised as best practice. Little is known about terminally ill patients' perceptions of communication and ACP practice following disclosure of their terminal prognosis.

Objectives

To examine whether terminally ill patients with lung cancer and their relatives recall conversations with disclosing physicians, about their concerns, goals of care or any offers to engage in ACP.

Methods

Qualitative study using semistructured interviews with patients and their family members. The study setting was a cancer centre and cancer unit in northern England.

Results

25 patients with advanced lung cancer (18 men and 7 women, aged 47–85) and 19 family members, mainly from lower social economic classes, took part in the study. Participants had little or no recall of physicians initiating discussions about their concerns, or goals of care and did not perceive that they had been provided with either information about or opportunities to engage in ACP. Some participants reported a sense of abandonment following the disclosure of a terminal prognosis. This sense was compounded by a range of difficult emotional experiences following the disclosure.

Conclusions

It may be inappropriate to initiate discussions about end-of-life care planning immediately following the disclosure of a terminal prognosis. To avoid patients feeling abandoned physicians need to consider how they or another appropriate person can provide information and opportunities for terminally ill patients to engage in a process of ACP.

Decision aid — patient advocate

For some interviewees, the ideal decision aid they described was not a physical document, but rather a person within the healthcare system who could discuss treatment options with them in further detail. As one patient explained:

I think walking me through options, giving me more information… instead of giving me a pamphlet full of papers. You're better at listening to somebody than trying to consume it by reading it… if I had somebody that walked me through it step by step… I don't think I would have changed anything that I've done, but I just think it would have been a little bit more understanding.

Participants were not always looking for additional information in the form of a decision aid but rather wanted the content already presented to them reinforced in a way that was easily comprehensible and could help guide them through their treatment journey. Patients acknowledged that clinicians are not always available to answer their questions, therefore the expectation was that a patient advocate would not necessarily be a clinician but another member of the care team. For some participants, they admitted that their comprehension was much more dependent on discussions rather than reading or watching other information resources.

Content — more information is better

For some participants, any additional information was considered beneficial, regardless of the format in which the information was delivered. These interviewees explained that they were looking for any meaningful tool that could support them with their treatment decisions. As voiced by one participant:

I think every bit of assistance is going to be helpful to me… We want to be informed, and if there was one more way of being able to be informed, one more way to communicate, that it's going to make our lives easier.

In conjunction with the previous section on information overload, this highlights that there is a spectrum of information needs, with some patients wanting the minimum amount of information needed to make decisions and others interested in having all available information.

Metastatic pancreatic cancer — follow-up and surveillance during active therapy specify that for patients on active cancer-directed therapy outside of a clinical trial, imaging to assess first response should be offered at 2 to 3 months from the initiation of therapy, with computed tomography scans with contrast as the preferred modality, and thereafter clinical assessment, conducted frequently during visits for cancer-directed therapy, should supplant imaging assessment. Routine use of positron emission tomography scans for the management of patients with pancreatic cancer is not recommended, and CA19–9 is not considered an optimal substitute for imaging for the assessment of treatment response. No data exist on the duration of cancer-directed therapy, and an ongoing discussion of the goals of care and assessment of treatment response and tolerability should guide decisions to continue or to hold or terminate cancer-directed therapy.

### Hospital care for the dying patient with cancer: does an advance care planning invitation influence bereaved relatives' experiences? A two country survey [^113t98xc]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Good care for the patient with cancer requires knowledge about the expected disease trajectory, the broad spectrum of treatments and the patient's perspectives on treatment and care. The patient's perspective is obtained through shared decision-making, with healthcare personnel and the patient working together to make achievable plans for future treatment and care. This approach is crucial when planning end-of-life (EoL) care, commonly described as advance care planning (ACP). ACP is defined as a process of conversations which 'enables individuals to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these goals and preferences with family and healthcare providers and to record and review these preferences if appropriate'. ACP addresses individuals' concerns across the physical, psychological, social and spiritual domains. Although ACP is used worldwide, the timing and degree of offering such conversations vary, which probably influences patient autonomy and the quality of EoL care.

Argentina and Norway are two countries still without national ACP programmes informing and offering the population to plan ahead in case of serious illness scenarios. A systematic ACP approach for patients diagnosed with serious or advanced disease is also non-existing. Thus, ACP as a concept is not generally known in the population nor among healthcare personnel, even though Argentina has a law that allows people to formulate advance directives. Standardised and easily retrievable ACP documentation about patients' wishes and values is not in use in hospital care. Consequently, ACP conversations are not offered on a regular basis, although there is a growing interest in shared decision-making as part of goals-of-care discussions due to an increasing claim for patient autonomy. This situation allows us to study how different approaches to communication about EoL issues influence the quality of care for dying patients.

Approximately 33,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer are predicted for the U.S. in 2002. Because diagnosis and intervention occur late in the course of this disease, the vast majority of patients already have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. These tumors are relatively resistant to systemic chemotherapy, making pancreatic cancer the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. and the Western world. For these reasons, efforts at identifying and treating disease-related symptomatology are priorities. This update overviews symptom management, supportive care strategies, and both standard and emerging palliative chemotherapy options. The incorporation of molecularly targeted therapies into treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer is reviewed as well. These strategies are of relevance to internists, gastroenterologists, oncologists, and other specialists who care for patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Optimising digital advance care planning implementation in palliative and end-of-life care: a multi-phase mixed-methods national research programme and recommendations [^114KKiCr]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Phase 2: Recognition of the clinical need for conversation and digital advance care planning, and recognising a need to discuss a patient's future wishes and preferences. (Recommendations 10 to 11)

This phase describes activities relating to the initiation of a record as part of a DACP system. All patients with a terminal or life-limiting condition, regardless of disease type, should be offered an opportunity to create a DACP record. People with non-cancer conditions remain less likely to have advance care plans compared to those with cancer, despite making up about half of the palliative care caseload. Patients with shorter prognoses may find it easier to consider documenting wishes and preferences due to the predictability of their condition, whereas those with long-term, progressive disease face more challenges in planning for an uncertain future. There is an opportunity to use community-based resources, including online materials from governmental and charity organisations, to support patients prepare for advance care planning.

Phase 3: Having conversations and documenting decisions (Recommendations 12 to 16)

This phase relates to the engagement of patients in the discussion of advance care planning information and the further digital documentation of preferences. DACP systems should ensure that plans are accessible, up-to-date and integrated across services, such as through summary care records. Patients and carers noted fragmented documentation across various services and often kept home-stored plans that were only accessible to healthcare professionals in person. Health professionals should proactively ask patients about any existing paper or electronic plans to facilitate their integration into digital systems. Assessing healthcare staff competency in advance care planning discussions with patients and subsequent digital documentation is essential. Those who see palliative patients less frequently may benefit from ongoing training updates to maintain their skills. Patients prefer discussing advance care planning with professionals who can dedicate time and understand their values, regardless of clinical background. Local guidelines on which services will access digitally created and stored advance care plans are needed, and this information should be conveyed to the patient so they are informed about who will see their information. Patients welcome the option to verify record accuracy, check who has accessed their information and prompt discussions when needed to reflect evolving care needs. Allowing patients and carers direct access to review and update their digitally stored advance care plans could help ensure that the information held is relevant and up-to-date. DACP systems should also offer secure, flexible login options (e.g. biometrics, security keys) to ensure ease of use without compromising security.

### Evidence-based recommendations for information and care planning in cancer care [^114VYjwo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The practice of oncology is characterized by challenging communication tasks that make it difficult to ensure optimal physician-patient information sharing and care planning. Discussions of diagnosis, prognosis, and patient goals are essential processes that inform decisions. However, data suggest that there are deficiencies in this area. We conducted a systematic review to identify the evidence supporting high-quality clinical practices for information and care planning in the context of cancer care as part of the RAND Cancer Quality-Assessing Symptoms, Side Effects, and Indicators of Supportive Treatment Project. Domains of information and care planning that are important for high-quality cancer care include integration of palliation into cancer care, advance care planning, sentinel events as markers for the need to readdress a patient's goals of care, and continuity of care planning. The standards presented here for information and care planning in cancer care should be incorporated into care pathways and should become the expectation rather than the exception.

### Advance care planning: contemporary issues and future directions [^111KuDpk]. Innovation in Aging (2017). Low credibility.

Despite widespread professional endorsements, public awareness and education campaigns, popular books, and public policies encouraging ACP, formal ACP has well-documented limitations. Criticisms of the living will include: the content may be unclear; one's stated preferences may not be relevant to the patient's condition, especially for dying older adults who drafted their living wills years earlier; and physicians may not have access to the document at the critical decision-making moment. Physicians also may be reluctant to follow the orders stated in the living will for fear of legal liability; in general, physicians believe their liability risk is greater if they do not attempt resuscitation than if they provide it against patient wishes. Family members may not know or agree with the document's content, or may not know how to translate vague preferences into specific clinical practices.

Palliative and supportive care in pancreatic cancer — scope and goals are outlined. A significant subset of patients with pancreatic cancer will require substantial palliative interventions that are, in many respects, unique to the disease. The multidisciplinary management of symptoms due to biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction, and cancer-related pain is of primary importance. The main objective of palliative care is to prevent and ameliorate suffering while ensuring optimal QOL, and palliative surgical procedures are best reserved for patients with longer life expectancies.

### An end-of-life ethics consult in the ICU: who has the final say-the patient or the family? [^113Vi5CH]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

A 72-year-old man with metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted to the ICU with increased oxygen demand and confusion, likely related to pulmonary metastases. In the presence of his son, the health care agent, and the team, the patient requested to be do not attempt resuscitation and do not intubate status before losing decision-making capacity. When the patient's brother and another son heard of the code status change, they insisted on a return to Full Code. Although the youngest son (the health care agent) was present for the patient's request to be do not attempt resuscitation/do not intubate, he declined to represent the patient's wishes and agreed with a return to Full Code. Numerous discussions over subsequent days revolved around the attempt to honor the patient's wishes in the setting of the surrogate's unwillingness or inability to make decisions in alignment with his father's wishes. This case reviews and analyzes the ethical options available to the clinical team in responding to requests for potentially inappropriate treatment at a patient's end of life and explores the roles of relational autonomy, beneficence vs nonmaleficence, and holding the balance of clinicians' and ethicists' professional, legal, and ethical responsibilities.

### Informed decision making in advance care planning: concordance of patient self-reported diagnosis with physician diagnosis [^111XzacZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine the extent to which patients with advanced cancer agree with their physicians regarding their cancer diagnoses prior to engaging in advance care planning (ACP) and whether variables such as age and level of education correlate with the degree of patient-physician concordance.

Methods

One hundred and fifty patients with a diagnosis of cancer and an estimated life expectancy of 18 months or less completed questionnaires about their cancer diagnoses prior to creating an advance directive. A review of the patients' medical records was performed and the physician-designated diagnosis was identified for each patient. Patient-physician agreement on diagnosis was coded based on predetermined study criteria. Concordance rates were expressed in percentages.

Results

The majority of patients (62.2%) were in exact agreement with their physicians; 24.3% were in partial agreement with the patient missing part of the diagnosis, and 9.5% were in partial agreement with the physician missing part of the diagnosis; 4.1% did not agree with their physicians on diagnosis. Age and education level did not correlate with patient-physician concordance rates.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with advanced cancer correctly identified their cancer diagnosis. However, almost 40% were not in full agreement with their physicians regarding diagnosis, a situation that has bearing on efforts to engage in meaningful shared decision making as well as advance care planning.

### Factors impacting informed decision-making for patients with pancreatic cancer: a qualitative study [^112CMXrb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Rushed communication

With a large knowledge gap among patients, participants described the constraints of time imposed by the medical system to obtain all the necessary information. During clinic visits, patients oftentimes felt that the medical team was in a hurry and would move on to their next task unless the patient interjected. As one patient suggested,

It's like they come in, do their thing, and then they're gone…

Several participants reflected that this feeling was strongest at the beginning of their treatment journey and diminished as their rapport with their medical team improved.

Use of jargon

Another concern regarding communication highlighted by participants was the use of medical or scientific terms. Many patients acknowledged feeling at a loss, particularly when discussing chemotherapy regimens because it's a foreign topic to them:

This whole thing was just so new. I mean, I have no perspective… I didn't have any place where I could say… I've researched this and that and expect this…

For some participants, making a medical decision was difficult because the complexity of the jargon and medical terms precluded a satisfactory understanding of their options.

Information overload

While patients were eager to learn more about their diagnosis and treatment options, too much information was often perceived as a burden instead of contributing to the decision-making process. This was impacted by the number and type of resources now available to patients. Patients leaving the clinic with a folder full of information can be overwhelmed by the amount of data they were expected to process and may have overlooked details that were important to them. In reference to treatment guidelines utilized by clinicians, a participant stated:

Honestly, I don't remember anybody speaking to me about them, but I received a lot of information. I mean, I got booklets, I have fliers and tablets of information… it was overwhelming.

### Changing rates of goals of care designations in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer during a multifactorial advanced care planning initiative: a real-world evidence study [^115ZEijv]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Goals of care (GoC) designations are an important part of advanced care planning (ACP) for patients with incurable cancers. Studies of outpatient oncology records show that most patients do not have GoC documented. We performed a retrospective analysis of changes in GoC designations in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in Northern Alberta, Canada, during a system-wide ACP quality improvement initiative.

Methods

Four hundred seventy-one patients with newly diagnosis of advanced, non-neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer between 2010 and 2015 in Northern Alberta, Canada, were included. The ACP initiation launched April 2014, and included educational materials for patients and families, and a coded system of GoC designations describing care philosophies and preferences for resuscitation and medical interventions. Data sources included the Alberta Cancer Registry and oncology-specific electronic medical records.

Results

25.5% of patients had a documented GoC, which increased over the study period (Mantel-Haenszel test-of-trend P < .001; increased from 7.8% in 2010 to 50.0% in 2015). GoC designations occurred later in patients who received palliative chemotherapy versus those who did not (median 130 days from diagnosis [95% CI, 76.019 to 183.981] v 36 days [95% CI, 28.107 to 43.893]; P < .001), and coincided with the end of treatment (median 4.5 days from last treatment). 64.8% of GoC designations were documented by palliative care physicians, but the proportion documented by medical oncologists increased with time (Mantel-Haenszel test-of-trend P = 0.020; increased from 0% in 2010 to 52.1% in 2015).

Conclusion

GoC documentation increased in the outpatient records of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer during the system-wide, multifactorial ACP initiative. GoC documentation by medical oncologists also increased. These data provide real-world evidence supporting the impact of a specific ACP initiative to improve rates of GoC designation in patients with advanced cancer.

### Strategic targeting of advance care planning interventions: the goldilocks phenomenon [^113Gonre]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Strategically selecting patients for discussions and documentation about limiting life-sustaining treatments-choosing the right time along the end-of-life trajectory for such an intervention and identifying patients at high risk of facing end-of-life decisions-can have a profound impact on the value of advance care planning (ACP) efforts. Timing is important because the completion of an advance directive (AD) too far from or too close to the time of death can lead to end-of-life decisions that do not optimally reflect the patient's values, goals, and preferences: a poorly chosen target patient population that is unlikely to need an AD in the near future may lead to patients making unrealistic, hypothetical choices, while assessing preferences in the emergency department or hospital in the face of a calamity is notoriously inadequate. Because much of the currently studied ACP efforts have led to a disappointingly small proportion of patients eventually benefitting from an AD, careful targeting of the intervention should also improve the efficacy of such projects. A key to optimal timing and strategic selection of target patients for an ACP program is prognostication, and we briefly highlight prognostication tools and studies that may point us toward high-value AD interventions.

### Palliative and supportive care for individuals with pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^111Qunok]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Individuals with pancreatic adenocarcinoma experience a complex constellation of palliative and supportive care needs. Notably, when caring for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, clinicians must carefully assess and address these individuals' palliative and supportive care needs, as these can have important implications related to their treatment experience and care outcomes. Importantly, prior research has consistently demonstrated the benefits of palliative and supportive care interventions for patients with cancer to help address symptom burden, illness understanding, coping mechanisms, and informed decision making. However, much of this research did not specifically tailor the interventions to the unique concerns of a pancreatic cancer population. Thus, an urgent need exists to design and conduct rigorous research with the goal of enhancing care delivery and outcomes for the highly symptomatic population of individuals with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

### Advance care planning for the severely ill in the hospital: a randomized trial [^117Ew2ML]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Advance care planning (ACP) has attracted growing attention since the 1990s. ACP describes a structured interactive process involving patients, their loved ones and their care providers to plan future treatments that respect patients' wishes and goals. Over the past 20 years the focus has shifted from completion of advance directives to effective professional communication promoting patient-centred goals-of-care discussions for future care. Several systematic reviews on the effectiveness of ACP strategiesindicate that ACP interventions increase the number of advance directives (ADs) and do-not-attempt-to-resuscitate orders (DNAR). More complex ACP interventions improve the quality of end-of-life care and the concordance of patients' preferences with care. Some studies, mostly of low quality, include encouraging patients to complete ADs or placing DNAR orders without professional communication such as ACP, which is contrary to the core definition of the concept. An additional form of ACP interventions focuses on delivery of information through evidence-based decision aids without offering professional ACP communication. Systematic reviews on ACP decision aids for future caresuggest that patients have less decisional conflict and tend to favour less intensive care similar to the impact of decision aids for current treatment decisions, although studies in the palliative care context are still rare. In none of the complex interventions were the two concepts of ACP facilitation and ACP decision aids combined. However, both concepts are necessary for delivering patient-centred care and improving evidence-based patient choice for future treatments. Although experts in the field consider care consistent with goals as the most important outcome measure of ACP, this has not often been objectively measured. Most commonly this is inferred by asking surrogates if patients' wishes were fulfilled, using proxies such as combined measures of wishes known and fulfilled, or reviewing documentation in medical charts as wish fulfilment without reporting how the patients' wishes were evaluated. ACP experts described this discrepancy as 'a dilemma for our field of research, and potentially setting up a policy dilemma as well'(page 7).

Shared decision-making affords patients and their families the autonomy to make difficult decisions after receiving comprehensive information about medical facts and treatment options. It is essential that patients' values are respected. The essential steps include first informing patients of the need for a decision, then explaining the various facts involved; after which, it is important to elicit patients' preferences and goals. Once the treatment options and outcomes important to patients are identified, an actual decision can be made. This activity is complex and requires a commitment of time and is enhanced through employment of a multidisciplinary team approach.

### Contemporary patterns of end-of-life care among Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer [^113cvWo1]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Considerable efforts have been dedicated to improving the quality of end-of-life care among patients with advanced cancer in the past decade. Whether the quality has shifted in response to these efforts remains unknown.

Objective

To examine contemporary patterns of end-of-life care among patients with advanced cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used a recent linkage of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare data to characterize patterns of end-of-life care. The cohort included fee-for-service Medicare decedents aged 66 years or older who were originally diagnosed with distant-stage breast, prostate, pancreatic, or lung cancers and died between 2014 and 2019. Analyses were conducted between June 1, 2023, and July 31, 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included monthly use of acute care, systemic therapy, and supportive care (ie, palliative and hospice care and advanced care planning) in the last 6 months of life. Additionally, a claims-based indicator was evaluated of potentially aggressive care in the last 30 days of life, defined as experiencing more than 1 acute care visit, in-hospital mortality, late receipt of systemic therapy, or hospice entry.

Results

The study included 33 744 Medicare decedents with advanced cancer (mean [SD] age, 75.7 [6.9] years; 52.1% male). From 6 months before death to month of death, there was an increase in the mean (SE) number of acute care visits (from 14.0 [0.5] to 46.2 [0.5] per 100 person-months), hospice use (from 6.6 [0.4] to 73.5 [0.5] per 100 person-months), palliative care (from 2.6 [0.2] to 26.1 [0.6] per 100 person-months), and advanced care planning (from 1.7 [0.6] to 12.8 [1.1] per 100 person-months). Overall, 45.0% of decedents experienced any indicator of potentially aggressive care.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found persistent patterns of potentially aggressive care, but low uptake of supportive care, among Medicare decedents with advanced cancer. A multifaceted approach targeting patient-, physician-, and system-level factors associated with potentially aggressive care is imperative for improving quality of care at the end of life.

### Advance care planning: challenges at the emergency department of a cancer care center [^113mG6Sj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Code status discussions form an important part of advance care planning (ACP) as it enables physicians to respect the patient's wishes for end-of-life care. However, in some cases, code status discussions can be challenging causing the physician to go against the patient's wishes and the code of medical ethics. This is especially true in an emergency setting. In this paper, we will discuss three cases of advanced cancer patients, where code status discussions posed challenges to healthcare providers.

Case reports

In the first case, the patient was a 26-year-old male diagnosed with advanced osteosarcoma. Code status was discussed with him, while he was still functional, wherein he agreed to a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. However, at the time of end-of-life care, despite of previous code status agreement, the patient's mother insisted on full code. As a result, the DNR order was reverted and the patient was intubated. The second case discusses an 83-year-old female patient with metastatic gastric cancer. Code status was extensively discussed with the patient and her son who agreed to sign a DNR order. This case posed a challenge because when the patient's condition deteriorated, her son demanded cardioversion and other aggressive treatment measures without any chest compressions or intubation. In the third case, the patient was a 40-year-old woman with advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features of the parotid. On admission to the ED, as per the patient's wishes expressed by her husband, a DNR/DNI order was placed. However, this order had to be reverted when the patient's aunt and sister opposed vehemently to the DNR/DNI order.

Conclusion

The three cases demonstrate the challenges that can arise in the implementation of code status order in the ED as it pertains for end-of-life care. In any scenario, respecting the patient's wishes and adherence to the code of medical ethics take precedence over any familial objections arising difficulties with coping.

### Decision aids for advance care planning: an overview of the state of the science [^113USzrx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Advance care planning honors patients' goals and preferences for future care by creating a plan for when illness or injury impedes the ability to think or communicate about health decisions. Fewer than 50% of severely or terminally ill patients have an advance directive in their medical record, and physicians are accurate only about 65% of the time when predicting patient preferences for intensive care. Decision aids can support the advance care planning process by providing a structured approach to informing patients about care options and prompting them to document and communicate their preferences. This review, commissioned as a technical brief by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Effective Health Care Program, provides a broad overview of current use of and research related to decision aids for adult advance care planning. Using interviews of key informants and a search of the gray and published literature from January 1990 to May 2014, the authors found that many decision aids are widely available but are not assessed in the empirical literature. The 16 published studies testing decision aids as interventions for adult advance care planning found that most are proprietary or not publicly available. Some are constructed for the general population, whereas others address disease-specific conditions that have more predictable end-of-life scenarios and, therefore, more discrete choices. New decision aids should be designed that are responsive to diverse philosophical perspectives and flexible enough to change as patients gain experience with their personal illness courses. Future efforts should include further research, training of advance care planning facilitators, dissemination and access, and tapping potential opportunities in social media or other technologies.

Research question 4 — palliative care referral timing and triggers: Initiating timely palliative care is integral to comprehensive cancer management. The 2016 guideline recommended referral to specialist palliative care within 8 weeks of diagnosis of advanced cancer, and, based on the same evidence and workforce issues, the Expert Panel recommended changing the wording to early in the treatment process. In available interventional studies, early has been defined as within 8–12 weeks from diagnosis, but there is no standard time following diagnosis of an advanced cancer in which to refer. In current practice, the Expert Panel recommends that individuals interpret early as not waiting until cessation of antineoplastic-directed therapy but rather focusing on the presence of palliative needs, and early also indicates palliative care engagement in the outpatient setting. In the absence of such assessments, oncology clinicians with patients who experience persistent and distressing symptoms (eg, pain, nausea, or dyspnea, with a pattern of recurrent hospitalizations or emergency department visits because of cancer-related complications and/or who experience a decline in functional status) should refer them to specialty palliative care.

### Let us talk about death: gender effects in cancer patients' preferences for end-of-life discussions [^1167kg6w]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The main factor for receiving EOL care consistent with patients' wishes or preferences is end-of-life discussion (EOLD) with the attending physician, which is also associated with less aggressive end-of-life care. However, the required end-of-life conversations including their formalization are challenging and difficult to conduct. Although it is recommended to start EOLD early, physicians are often uncertain as to the optimal time point or content of EOL discussions. Approximately only 30–40% of terminally ill patients had discussed their end-of-life decisions with their physicians. EOL discussions have therefore often been reported to take place when a medical crisis arises, at hospitalization for severe progression even at the day of death. Besides, in the last decades, it has become evident that it does not suffice to solely focus on the questions of "do not resuscitate" and on the "product" of advanced directives (AD). Instead, EOL discussions have experienced a shift towards a conversation process, better known as advance care planning (ACP). These conversations help patients to formulate goals of care, clarify value sets and wishes to design a corresponding care plan. However, the approach to end-of-life discussions is still challenging. To make matters even more complex, recent research points to gender effects in end-of-life care. Particularly males with advanced cancer are more likely to receive ICU admission, more chemotherapy, and less hospice care near death. Males reporting EOL discussions were less likely to experience an ICU stay compared with those without EOL discussions, while this effect was not observed for females. In the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, female gender was associated with giving thoughts to and having discussion about end-of-life preferences.

### Advance care planning: challenges at the emergency department of a cancer care center [^117NZgXf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Code status discussions form an important part of advance care planning (ACP) as it enables physicians to respect the patient's wishes for end-of-life care. However, in some cases, code status discussions can be challenging causing the physician to go against the patient's wishes and the code of medical ethics. This is especially true in an emergency setting. In this paper, we will discuss three cases of advanced cancer patients, where code status discussions posed challenges to healthcare providers.

Case Reports

In the first case, the patient was a 26-year-old male diagnosed with advanced osteosarcoma. Code status was discussed with him, while he was still functional, wherein he agreed to a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. However, at the time of end-of-life care, despite of previous code status agreement, the patient's mother insisted on full code. As a result, the DNR order was reverted and the patient was intubated. The second case discusses an 83-year-old female patient with metastatic gastric cancer. Code status was extensively discussed with the patient and her son who agreed to sign a DNR order. This case posed a challenge because when the patient's condition deteriorated, her son demanded cardioversion and other aggressive treatment measures without any chest compressions or intubation. In the third case, the patient was a 40-year-old woman with advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features of the parotid. On admission to the ED, as per the patient's wishes expressed by her husband, a DNR/DNI order was placed. However, this order had to be reverted when the patient's aunt and sister opposed vehemently to the DNR/DNI order.

Conclusion

The three cases demonstrate the challenges that can arise in the implementation of code status order in the ED as it pertains for end-of-life care. In any scenario, respecting the patient's wishes and adherence to the code of medical ethics take precedence over any familial objections arising difficulties with coping.

Advance directives and Medical Orders on Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) — clinicians need to be familiar with their state and hospital policies, and hospitals customarily develop a guide to advance directives that includes relevant state laws, key hospital policies, copies of acceptable advance directive forms, answers to commonly asked questions, and a quality improvement process. The quality improvement process targets clinician education and monitors whether actual care provided to a patient is consistent with a patient's documented advance directives.

### Planning the transition to end-of-life care in advanced… [^112CBzEL]. NCI (2014). Low credibility.

- Increased psychological distress.
- Medical treatments inconsistent with personal preferences.
- Utilization of burdensome and expensive health care resources of little therapeutic benefit.
- A more difficult bereavement. Oncologists and patients often avoid or delay planning for the EOL until the final weeks or days of life because of many potential factors. These factors can be at the individual, family, or societal levels. Evidence suggests, however, that many of these factors are not truly barriers and can be overcome. Quality of End-of-Life Care in Patients With Advanced Cancer Patients with advanced cancer, their family and friends, and oncology clinicians often are faced with treatment decisions that profoundly affect the patient's quality of life. Oncology clinicians are obligated to explore, with the patient and family, the potential impact of continued disease-directed treatments or care directed at the patient's symptoms and QOL.

This section summarizes information that will allow oncology clinicians and patients with advanced cancer to create a plan of care to improve QOL at the end of life by making informed choices about the potential harms of continued aggressive treatment and the potential benefits of palliative or hospice care. This section:

- Reviews the concept of quality EOL care.
- Summarizes and evaluates the commonly cited indicators of quality EOL care.
- Explores the concept of a good death.
- Older age.
- Good performance status.
- A survival time longer than 6 months. Patients who were waiting for a new treatment had worse emotional well-being. This experience suggests that QOL is related to factors such as disease progression and its complications, and to patients' goals relative to any treatment they are receiving. In addition, other researchers have reported that family caregivers often report worse scores than patients with advanced cancer in self-assessments of the patients' QOL.
- Indicators are typically measured in a period before death that is defined retrospectively from death. Clinicians cannot predict whether an intervention will be futile in preventing death; consequently, quality concerns may be exaggerated if the indicator is dependent on the time to death.
- Increasing numbers of patients start a new chemotherapy regimen within 30 days of death or continue to receive chemotherapy within 14 days of death.
- Increasing numbers of patients are referred to hospice; however, the length of stay in hospice remains relatively brief, supporting the concern that referrals to hospice may occur too late. For example, a 2011 study of men dying of prostate cancer demonstrated an increased utilization of hospice, but there was also an increase in the proportion of stays shorter than 7 days. 9] However, for inpatient deaths, the median time between signing the DNR and death was 0 days; for outpatient deaths, it was 30 days.

This finding suggests that communication about resuscitation preferences is delayed. This delay may negatively affect patient preparation for the EOL.
- The mental health of the patient and family are essential concerns in providing a good death.
- Health care provider beliefs and attitudes may diminish the chances for a good death if they interfere with adequate pain or symptom control.
- Health care providers may risk medical paternalism if they are not respectful of a patient's perspective and insist on EOL care or refuse to provide comfort measures that may shorten life.
- Religious faith and spiritual beliefs are important for many people near the EOL.
- A good death requires turning one's attention away from prolonging life. Patients with advanced cancer may desire opportunities to prepare for the EOL.

Patient and family preferences may contribute to the observed patterns of care at the EOL. Patient recall of EOL discussions, spiritual care, or early palliative care, however, are associated with less-aggressive EOL treatment and/or increased utilization of hospice. In addition, death in a hospital has been associated with poorer quality of life and increased risk of psychiatric illness among bereaved caregivers. Thus, it is important to help patients and their families articulate their goals of care and preferences near the EOL. For more information, see Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer. This summary provides clinicians with information about anticipating the EOL; the common symptoms patients experience as life ends, including in the final hours to days; and treatment or care considerations. The decisions commonly made by patients, families, and clinicians are also highlighted, with suggested approaches.

The goal of this summary is to provide essential information for high-quality EOL care. In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed. The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults. When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading. Anticipating the End of Life The Final Days to Weeks of Life Providing excellent care toward the end of life requires an ability to anticipate when to focus mainly on palliation of symptoms and quality of life instead of disease treatment. Prognostic information plays an important role for making treatment decisions and planning for the EOL. However, the available literature suggests that medical providers inaccurately predict how long patients will live and tend to overestimate survival times. This appears to hold true even for providers who are experienced in treating patients who are terminally ill. In a multicenter cohort study of 230 hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, palliative care providers correctly predicted time to death for only 41% of patients. Survival time was overestimated in 85% of patients for whom medical providers gave inaccurate predictions, and providers were particularly likely to overestimate survival for Black and Latino patients. Providers attempting to make prognostic determinations may attend to symptoms that may herald the EOL, or they may observe trends in patients' functional status. For more information, see the Impending Death section.

In contrast to the data indicating that clinicians are relatively poor independent prognosticators, a study published in 2019 compared the relative accuracies of the PPS, the Palliative Prognostic Index, and the Palliative Prognostic Score with clinicians' predictions of survival for patients with advanced cancer who were admitted to an inpatient palliative care unit. Impending death is a diagnostic issue rather than a prognostic phenomenon because it is an irreversible physiological process. The ability to diagnose impending death with confidence is of utmost importance to clinicians because it could affect their communication with patients and families and inform complex health care decisions such as:

- Hospital discharge.
- Discontinuation of prescription medications.
- Artificial nutrition.
- Use of life support measures.
- Enrollment on clinical care pathways. 9] Because of low sensitivity, the absence of these signs cannot rule out impending death.
