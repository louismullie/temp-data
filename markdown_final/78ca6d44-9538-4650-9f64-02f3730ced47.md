## Question

Elevated wbc and elevated alt

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate concurrent leukocytosis and elevated ALT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and characterizing the pattern of liver injury. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis for leukocytosis and how it intersects with hepatocellular injury. Next, I will outline the initial workup, including history, examination, and core labs. After that, I need to stratify by severity and urgency, including when to escalate to acute liver failure pathways. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, stepwise plan with red flags and follow-up intervals, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline recommendations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its pattern, because I should not jump to conclusions based on a single report. I need to repeat the liver panel and CBC with differential to verify persistence, then classify the liver injury as hepatocellular (ALT/AST predominant), cholestatic (ALP/GGT predominant), or mixed, and quantify the magnitude of ALT elevation as mild (< 5× ULN), moderate (5–15× ULN), or severe/massive (> 15× ULN or > 10,000 IU/L), since this stratification drives urgency and the differential [^115PkWRv] [^117Nvcr7] [^1155asMt].

> Hold on, let's not conflate ALT with liver function. ALT reflects hepatocellular injury, not synthetic function, so I should also check bilirubin, albumin, and INR to assess hepatic synthetic capacity and screen for acute liver failure, especially when bilirubin is rising and INR is prolonged, which would mandate urgent hepatology referral and transplant center evaluation [^116xdYTr] [^117Nvcr7].

> Next, I should review the leukocytosis pattern carefully. Neutrophilia suggests bacterial infection or a stress response, lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes point toward viral infections like EBV/CMV, eosinophilia raises concern for drug hypersensitivity or parasitic disease, and extreme counts or blasts should prompt hematologic evaluation for leukemia, so I need to ensure a peripheral smear is obtained when the WBC is > 20,000/µL or when cytopenias or blasts are suspected [^114QKP5w] [^1113Q9nd].

> I will now examine the clinical context with a meticulous history and physical, because medications, alcohol, metabolic risk factors, recent infections, travel, transfusions, and family history of liver disease can pivot the workup. On exam, I should look for jaundice, stigmata of chronic liver disease, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly, and I must remember that extrahepatic sources of ALT elevation such as muscle disease or thyroid disease can confound the picture, so I should double-check for myalgias, weakness, and thyroid symptoms before labeling this as purely hepatic [^115PkWRv] [^11799txx] [^1129REvX].

> Let me think about the initial laboratory evaluation. I should obtain a comprehensive metabolic panel including bilirubin, albumin, ALP, GGT, and INR, hepatitis serologies (HBsAg, HCV Ab with reflex RNA if positive, HAV IgM in the right context), an iron panel with ferritin and transferrin saturation, and autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA) if ALT remains elevated beyond 3–6 months or if cholestatic features emerge. I should also add TSH when hyperthyroidism is suspected, and consider HIV testing in at-risk patients, as these are standard elements of the liver aetiology screen [^113z2Ems] [^1127L5Xo].

> Wait, let me verify imaging indications. If ALP is elevated or obstruction is suspected, I should obtain a right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess for biliary dilatation, stones, or masses, and if ultrasound is non-diagnostic and suspicion remains high, proceed to MRCP or ERCP. In parallel, if the leukocytosis is unexplained or extreme, I should review the smear and consider bone marrow evaluation to exclude hematologic malignancy, especially with constitutional symptoms or organomegaly [^116VCtcF] [^113BpbEZ] [^113Y9xBJ].

> I should confirm severity-based next steps. For mild, asymptomatic ALT elevations with reassuring synthetic function, observation with lifestyle modification and removal of hepatotoxins is reasonable, with repeat labs in 3–6 months, whereas moderate to severe elevations, especially with jaundice, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy, require urgent evaluation and often hospitalization. Massive transaminase elevations (> 10,000 IU/L) should trigger immediate consideration of ischemic hepatitis, toxic drug injury, or malignant infiltration, with urgent hepatology input and transplant center notification [^117Nvcr7] [^114WBWDB] [^116AMfR6].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an antithyroid drug? I need to check for agranulocytosis with a differential during febrile illness or pharyngitis and stop the drug if there are signs of hepatic dysfunction, because baseline WBC and liver profiles are recommended before initiating therapy and transaminases more than fivefold above ULN are a contraindication to starting antithyroid drugs. Similarly, nevirapine requires immediate transaminase checks with rash or systemic symptoms due to hepatotoxicity risk, so I should double-check medication timing and CD4 counts in that scenario [^113vmMjL] [^1115dCKb] [^113Rh4ZB] [^114S1Fx4].

> Let me consider special populations. In children, I should maintain a low threshold for referral and broaden the differential to include inborn errors, biliary atresia, and muscle disease, so I need to check CK when ALT/AST are disproportionate and consider a pediatric hepatology pathway. In pregnancy, I must distinguish HELLP, AFLP, and TTP/HUS rapidly using clinical criteria and labs including bilirubin, INR, and platelets. In immunocompromised patients, opportunistic infections and drug-induced liver injury are more common, so I should tailor serologies and imaging accordingly [^115DXKXP] [^1129REvX] [^116FdeMC].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate escalation. Any evidence of acute liver failure (coagulopathy with INR > 1.5, encephalopathy, or rising bilirubin with falling transaminases), severe abdominal pain suggesting biliary obstruction or ischemia, or extreme leukocytosis with blasts should prompt immediate specialty involvement and often transfer to a tertiary center, as delays worsen outcomes in both acute liver failure and hematologic emergencies [^117Nvcr7] [^116AMfR6] [^1113Q9nd].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. If initial evaluation is unrevealing and ALT remains mildly elevated, I should repeat liver chemistries in 3–6 months and reassess lifestyle factors, reserving biopsy for persistent unexplained elevations beyond 6–12 months or when staging is needed. Conversely, if ALT normalizes, I can de-escalate, but I need to ensure ongoing risk-factor modification and alcohol abstinence given the high prevalence of MASLD and alcohol-related disease in this phenotype [^1127L5Xo] [^11799txx].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm and classify the liver injury pattern, characterize the leukocytosis with a differential and smear when indicated, integrate history and exam to prioritize likely etiologies, execute a core laboratory and imaging workup tailored to the pattern, escalate urgently for severe or cholestatic presentations, and individualize management for special populations, all while remembering that ALT is a marker of injury, not function, and that the magnitude of enzyme elevation does not always correlate with disease severity or prognosis [^115PkWRv] [^116xdYTr] [^117VSnab].

Elevated WBC and ALT together most often reflect **infection or inflammation** (bacterial, viral, or drug-induced) [^114QKP5w] [^11799txx], **alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis** [^1127L5Xo], or **hematologic malignancy** (leukemia, lymphoma) [^1113Q9nd]. Other causes include autoimmune hepatitis, biliary obstruction, ischemic hepatitis, and systemic inflammatory states (e.g. sepsis, IBD) [^115AgRSj] [^116VCtcF] [^116AMfR6] [^117NmNr4]. Evaluate with a **focused history, exam, and labs** (CBC with differential, liver panel, viral hepatitis serologies, metabolic panel, autoimmune markers) [^1127L5Xo] and imaging (ultrasound or CT) if indicated [^113XoUqa]. Management targets the underlying cause, with urgent hepatology or hematology referral for severe or persistent abnormalities [^113XoUqa] [^114QKP5w].

## Clinical significance of combined elevation

Combined elevation signals **significant systemic inflammation or organ injury** and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, particularly in infection, sepsis, or malignancy [^111TQ656] [^114QKP5w]. The pattern helps refine the differential: neutrophilia with ALT suggests bacterial infection or inflammatory liver disease, whereas lymphocytosis with ALT points to viral hepatitis or lymphoproliferative disease [^114QKP5w] [^116ncq3D].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical history and physical examination

History should cover recent infections, travel, alcohol/drug use, medications, and autoimmune or hematologic symptoms; the **exam** should assess for jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, rash, and signs of chronic liver disease [^115PkWRv].

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **CBC with differential**: characterize leukocytosis (neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, blasts) [^114QKP5w].
- **Liver panel**: ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, INR [^115Txxj6].
- **Viral hepatitis serologies**: HBsAg, anti-HCV, HAV IgM [^115DXKXP].
- **Autoimmune markers**: ANA, ASMA, AMA, IgG [^113z2Ems].
- **Metabolic tests**: fasting glucose, lipid profile, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin [^112yo3Df] [^1127L5Xo].
- **Additional tests**: HIV, EBV/CMV serologies, LDH, procalcitonin, blood cultures as indicated [^114rkC3H] [^112C87LM].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging should begin with **ultrasound** to evaluate liver parenchyma, biliary tree, and organomegaly; if ultrasound is inconclusive or malignancy is suspected, obtain CT or MRI [^113BpbEZ].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Infectious**: targeted antibiotics for bacterial infections; antiviral therapy for hepatitis B/C; supportive care for EBV/CMV [^116ymMFA].
- **Inflammatory/autoimmune**: corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis, SLE, or IBD [^115AgRSj] [^113CstDc].
- **Hepatic diseases**: alcohol cessation, weight loss, management of metabolic syndrome, supportive care for acute hepatitis [^11799txx] [^1127L5Xo].
- **Hematologic malignancies**: urgent hematology referral, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or stem cell transplantation [^114QKP5w].
- **Drug-induced**: immediate discontinuation of offending agent, supportive care, N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity [^117Nvcr7].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by cause and severity. Persistent elevation confers higher risk of **chronic liver disease**, cirrhosis, and liver failure [^notfound]. Complications include hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, renal failure, and multi-organ failure [^116FdeMC].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Severe elevation**: ALT > 5× ULN or WBC > 50,000/µL.
- **Persistent elevation**: beyond 3 months without clear cause.
- **Red flags**: jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, organomegaly, constitutional symptoms.
- **Suspected malignancy**: hematology/oncology or hepatology referral [^114QKP5w] [^113XoUqa].

---

Elevated WBC and ALT together reflect systemic inflammation or organ injury; a structured evaluation with history, labs, and imaging is essential to identify the cause and guide therapy, with **specialist referral for severe or persistent cases**.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113T9h7b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm3 (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm 3, platelet count 88,000/mm 3, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^1146czSR]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — laboratory evaluation in acute ischemic priapism states that optimal blood tests have not been defined and should be selectively ordered based on specific patient risk factors and clinical suspicion; a complete blood count (CBC) may identify elevated white blood cell counts suggesting malignancy. Among men with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic priapism is associated with lower hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocyte count, white blood cells, and platelet counts, and platelet and eosinophil counts may also be elevated; however, these laboratory values often will not be used to guide treatment of the acute presentation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or similar hemoglobinopathy testing may be appropriate in select clinical scenarios, and electrophoresis and other sickle cell testing should be reserved for select clinical scenarios, while a reticulocyte count will assist in determining the status of a patient with SCD and may be incorporated into the workup along with a CBC. Testing for potential substances may have a high rate of false negativity, and given these associated risks, a thorough medication and social history may provide enough information to determine the underlying cause without collection of these studies.

IRH severity diagnosis and biopsy indication

IRH severity should not be appreciated using CTCAE classification for transaminase increase as it may overestimate the severity of the disease. This is particularly true when it is compared with the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) classification. Indeed, the value of transaminase is not a marker of severity in patients with acute hepatitis, especially in patients with drug-induced liver injury. It remains true in patients with IRH as no association between the degree of lobular damage and the CTCAE grade of transaminase elevation has been demonstrated. Therefore, IRH management should not be based on CTCAE grade but based on severity criteria attesting the liver function: prothrombin time (PT) and bilirubin level recently proposed by our team and others. In the presented case of IRH, PT value was not reported but the patient developed severity criteria through bilirubin level increase. Interestingly, the patient presented an important inflammatory reaction with fever, and an increased CRP level and white blood cell count. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of an association between clinical or biological abnormalities and the development of IRH severity criteria.

The authors decided not to perform a liver biopsy because of hemorrhagic risk. In patients with hemostatic disorders, a transjugular liver biopsy is safe. Moreover, the liver biopsy may confirm the diagnosis of IRH, but may also exclude a differential diagnosis: liver infiltration from melanoma should be ruled out as the presentation is classically an acute liver failure with jaundice and hepatomegaly. It is also important to define the patterns of IRH: The main presentation associates lobular and portal inflammation with lobular granulomas in patients treated with ipilimumab. However, other histological features have been described, such as cholangitis. It is yet not clear whether the management may remain the same between these two entities; therefore, we recommend performing a liver biopsy especially in patients with jaundice.

### A million-dollar work-up for abdominal pain: is it worth it? [^114BdbC7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Pain-predominant-functional gastrointestinal disorders (PP-FGIDs) are common. The diagnosis is clinical and there are no biological markers to characterize these conditions. Despite limited evidence, investigations are commonly performed. The aim of the study was to investigate diagnostic practices, yield, and costs in children with PP-FGIDs.

Patients and Methods

Charts of all of the children older than 4 years diagnosed as having abdominal pain were reviewed. Results and costs of diagnostic investigations were analyzed.

Results

Of 243 children with abdominal pain, 122 (50.2%) had PP-FGIDs (79 girls, mean age 12.7 years). All of the children underwent diagnostic work-up. Complete blood cell count was done in 91.8% of patients. None had elevated white blood cells, platelets, and low albumin. Six had either elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, but none had elevation of both; 4 of these 6 cases underwent endoscopies with normal results in 3 cases; Helicobacter pylori was found in 1 case. One child had elevated tissue transglutaminase 1 only antibodies with normal endoscopy. Amylase, lipase, direct bilirubin, stool cultures, and ova or parasites were always normal. One child had intermittent elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase. There were no significant abnormalities in urinalysis or electrolytes. Abdominal x-rays were done in 38.5%, showing only retained stools in 13% of these patients. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan were done in 23.7% and 9% of cases, respectively, but were of no clinical value; 33.6% patients had esophagogastroduodenoscopy (9.7% abnormal: Helicobacter pylori, chemical gastritis, esophagitis) and 17.2% had colonoscopy (9.5% abnormal: rare fork crypts, lymphoid hyperplasia). Total costs: $744,726. Average cost per patient: $6104.30.

Conclusions

In children with PP-FGIDs, investigations are common, costs are substantial, and yield is minimal.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117Nvcr7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe or massive aminotransferase elevation — initial evaluation and escalation: For aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), stratify into "Severe elevation > 15x ULN" or "Massive elevation ALT > 10,000 U/L". For both branches, perform "History and physical exam", "Discontinue hepatotoxic meds and alcohol", and "Evaluate for signs of acute liver failure", and for massive elevation also "Assess for toxic ingestions, ischemia, and rhabdomyolysis". If "signs of acute liver failure → urgent liver consultation with consideration of referral to a liver transplant center", and if "diagnostic evaluation negative → consideration for diagnostic liver biopsy if medically stable". The pathway advises to "Consider n-acetyl cysteine if any evidence of acetaminophen ingestion".

### Managing hepatic complications of pregnancy: practical strategies for clinicians [^116FdeMC]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AFLP can be challenging to distinguish from HELLP syndrome, as they share many clinical and laboratory features. Women with AFLP are more likely to have synthetic liver dysfunction with coagulopathy, hypofibrinogenaemia, lower cholesterol levels, higher bilirubin levels, hypoglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, hyperammonaemia, DIC and more severe AKI. Other differentials include HUS, TTP, paracetamol toxicity, exacerbation of SLE and overlap with pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome.

The Swansea criterion (box 1) is a validated system to help diagnose AFLP but only in the absence of other liver diseases, such as HELLP syndrome, thus limiting its application. One recent study found that the Swansea criteria were fulfilled in women presenting with any cause of ALF.

Box 1
Swansea criteria for diagnosis of AFLP

Vomiting.

Abdominal pain.

Polydipsia/polyuria.

Encephalopathy.

Elevated bilirubin > 14 µmol/L.

Hypoglycaemia < 4 mmol/L.

Elevated urea > 340 µmol/L.

Leukocytosis > 11×10 6 cells/L.

Elevated transaminases (AST or ALT) > 42 U/L.

Elevated ammonia > 47 µmol/L.

Renal impairment; creatinine > 150 umol/L.

Coagulopathy; PT > 14 s or APTT > 34 s.

Ascites or bright liver on ultrasound scan.

Microvesicular steatosis on liver biopsy.

Management

Delivery is the only curative treatment as liver failure will continue until the fetus has been delivered. Before delivery, maternal stabilisation should be achieved with correction of hypoglycaemia, coagulopathy and hypertension. Maternal intensive supportive care in a multidisciplinary team is required following the delivery. Six-hourly LFTs, renal function and haematological parameters should be performed within the first 24–48 hours after delivery. In non-randomised trials, plasma exchange has been associated with hastening hepatic improvement and decreasing intensive care stay, but not with improved maternal mortality.

Patients with ongoing deterioration in liver function after emergency delivery or patients who develop hepatic rupture should be transferred to a liver transplant centre for assessment. Transplantation should be considered in cases of ALF or hepatic rupture. Elevated lactate with hepatic encephalopathy appeared to be best predictors of maternal death or need of liver transplantation in one retrospective study.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach that incorporates a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis, is crucial. As noted above, the physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and in severe cases may be in respiratory distress.

Laboratory tests

Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactic acid, uric acid and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely to be dilutional, due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases, and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites.

On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are typically elevated, especially in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Serum lipase and amylase levels are often normal or mildly elevated in pancreatic ascites, thereby rendering these tests non-diagnostic.

### Marked elevation of cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count: an unusual case of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, differential diagnosis, and a brief review of current epidemiology and treatment recommendations [^112BAP2M]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is rarely a difficult diagnostic dilemma when a patient presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Unfortunately for the practicing clinician, patients are rarely that straightforward. Patients who are elderly, very young, or immuno-compromised often present with subtle findings, making the correct diagnosis a challenge. In addition, patients being treated with antibiotics may be misleading in their clinical presentation, leading to a missed diagnosis of meningitis. Only when one considers the diagnosis or obtains a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is the correct diagnosis made. Although the clinical scenario may suggest meningitis, it is the cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count that establishes the definitive diagnosis. Despite the advent of systemic antibiotics over 50 years ago, bacterial meningitis continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The following case report details a woman diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis with an extremely high cerebrospinal white blood cell count. Although this is typically thought to be caused by abscesses or malignancy, meningitis alone may cause such an elevation. In addition, a brief review of the current epidemiology and treatment regimens for meningitis is discussed.

### Role of thiopurine metabolite testing and thiopurine methyltransferase determination in pediatric IBD [^113CstDc]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and thiopurine metabolite testing guidance states that TPMT testing is recommended before initiation of thiopurines (TPs) to identify individuals who are homozygous recessive or have extremely low TPMT activity, and those who are homozygous recessive or have extremely low TPMT activity should avoid the use of TPs because of concerns for significant leukopenia. TPMT testing does not predict all cases of leukopenia and has no value to predict hypersensitivity adverse effects such as pancreatitis, and any potential value to reduce the risk of malignancy has not been studied. All individuals taking TPs should have routine monitoring with complete blood cell count and white blood cell count differential to evaluate for leukopenia regardless of TPMT testing results. Metabolite testing can be used to determine adherence with TP therapy and to guide dose increases or modifications in patients with active disease, with consideration including either increasing the dose, changing therapy or, for those with elevated transaminases or an elevated 6-MMP, using adjunctive allopurinol to help raise 6-thioguanine metabolites and suppress formation of 6-MMP. Routine and repetitive metabolite testing has little or no role in patients who are doing well and taking an acceptable dose of a TP.

### Update in COVID-19 2020 [^1176eHbj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Common COVID-19 symptoms include fever, dyspnea, cough, and fatigue. Dyspnea is often reported by those who develop critical illness and correlates with a worse prognosis. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis ranges between 4 and 8 days, with hospital admission around Day 6. The average age of hospitalized patients is 54 years, with increased risks of severe disease and mortality in older patients. The median age for patients requiring ICU care is 61–64 years, with higher percentages of patients older than 75 developing critical illness. Every 10-year age increase is associated with an additional 58% relative risk of death.

Most patients have normal or low white blood cell counts; lymphopenia or relative lymphopenia is a feature of COVID-19. In contrast to classic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19 ARDS is characterized by severe lymphopenia and delayed lymphocyte activation. In addition, anemia and thrombocytopenia are common. Neutrophilia with evidence of emergency myelopoiesis is also frequently observed. Evidence of coagulopathy is common, and many patients demonstrate elevated aminotransferases. Patients with severe illness have higher C-reactive protein, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, LDH, myoglobin, and D-dimer than those with moderate illness. In addition, patients with critical illness may have evidence of myocardial dysfunction illustrated by higher troponin, serum creatine kinase–myocardial band, and brain natriuretic peptide compared with those with less severe disease. Largely analogous to ARDS, levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and soluble TNF receptor 1 are elevated in COVID-19 and are even higher in those requiring ICU care. In this latter group, elevated ratios of IL-6 and IL-1β to the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 are observed, patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrate increased AAT (alpha-antitrypsin) levels, and patients with lower IL-6 to AAT ratios exhibit improved outcomes. Neutrophils have a key role in producing IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and metabolic reprogramming in severe COVID-19 is likely due to the combined effects of proinflammatory mediators and severe hypoxemia. For adequate recovery, T-cell immunity remains essential but requires sufficient neutralizing antibody production to achieve disease resolution. Recent clinical phenotyping and peripheral blood analysis results suggest a COVID-19–specific state of immune system dysregulation. To determine the cellular composition and immune signatures within the alveolar space, BAL fluid from over 300 patients with severe pneumonia, 88 of whom had severe COVID-19, were examined. This revealed an enrichment in alveolar T cells and monocytes in COVID-19 and uncovered that IFN-γ–producing T cells formed positive feedback loops with infected macrophages in the alveolar space, driving the spatially restricted alveolitis characteristic of COVID-19 pneumonia.

American Thyroid Association — baseline laboratory assessment before starting antithyroid drugs (ATDs) should be considered, with thresholds that should prompt serious reconsideration of initiating therapy. Low white blood cell (WBC) counts are common, including in African Americans (10% of whom have a neutrophil count under 2000), and the task force states that a baseline absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 or liver transaminase enzyme levels elevated more than 5-fold above the upper limit of normal should prompt serious reconsideration of initiating ATD therapy.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^113tHbyY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### Consider muscle disease in children with elevated transaminase [^1129REvX]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are markers of hepatocellular injury but are highly concentrated in muscle cells. Consequently, muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, lead to hypertransaminasemia. Elevation in ALT and AST is most striking during the early stages of disease, before onset of or when only subtle signs of muscle disease are present. Thus, the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST may be the presenting sign of muscle disease in many children and provides an opportunity for early diagnosis. Many physicians, however, pursue extensive workup for liver disease in children who present with the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST. This results in delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment and increased expense and may lead to unnecessary invasive procedures. We report 12 patients with muscle disease who presented with a variety of symptoms and were found to have an incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST. We propose a rapid screening process for evaluating children with the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST to shorten the time to diagnosis of muscle disease.

### Expanding the differential diagnosis for transaminitis in patients with anorexia nervosa [^1119cKf1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aminotransferase elevations have been described in patients with anorexia nervosa. Hypothesized etiologies have included ischemic hepatitis, refeeding-induced transaminitis, and the process of autophagy. Supervised enteral nutrition is the mainstay of treatment for severe anorexia, but an increase in aminotransferase levels after initiation of enteral feeding presents clinicians with a diagnostic dilemma. We present a 31-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa (body mass index [BMI] of 13.5 kg/m 2) who experienced a worsening of aminotransferase elevations even after the initiation of enteral feeding. Despite nutritional supplementation, the patient's weight continued to fall for 6 days. Peak aminotransferase concentrations correlated with the patient's lowest weight and improved only after an increase in BMI was eventually achieved. Secondary causes of severe transaminitis were investigated, and after no cause was found, a liver biopsy was performed. Pathology was consistent with liver injury secondary to severe malnutrition rather than from refeeding syndrome. This case highlights malnutrition as an important cause of aminotransferase elevations and underscores the need for judicious early weight restoration in patients with anorexia and abnormal liver chemistry.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### Leukemia cutis simulating drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms following β-lactam antibiotic use [^117KpDYV]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 41-year-old woman was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service for a 2-day history of a pruritic eruption involving the face, neck, trunk, and bilateral upper extremities. The patient was febrile (up to 38.6 °C) and reported facial swelling with a sore throat. Four days prior to hospital admission, the patient completed a 1-week prophylactic course of cefalexin following a double mastectomy for recently diagnosed stage IA breast cancer.

Numerous erythematous macules and papules involving the face, neck, trunk, upper extremities, and proximal thighs were present (Fig 1). Physical examination was also significant for cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy and facial edema.

Fig 1
Diffuse erythematous macules and papules symmetrically distributed on the face and neck (A), flank (B), and forearm (C).

Initial laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 66.1 × 10 3 /μL), eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count of 990 cells/μL), monocytosis (17%), elevated creatinine (1.31 mg/dL), and mild transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 57 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 92 U/L). Serological testing for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, Treponema palladium IgG, and hepatitis B and C were negative. A peripheral blood smear showed atypical lymphocytes.

Based on the clinical and laboratory findings, the differential diagnosis included DRESS, favored based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings with a latency of 1 week following beta-lactam administration. The patient had a calculated RegiSCAR score of 7 at the time of presentation, indicating a "definite case" of DRESS (Table I). However, the patient's hyperleukocytosis prompted further workup to rule out other disease etiologies, including an underlying hematologic malignancy.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### Diagnosis of atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis [^117LBFg8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The variable manifestations of infectious mononucleosis rarely cause clinicians to suspect primary Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infection; consequently, costly diagnostic tests and unnecessary treatments are undertaken. Seventeen cases of clinically atypical and 11 cases of clinically typical infectious mononucleosis were diagnosed through screening for atypical and apoptotic lymphocytes in the peripheral blood samples by means of an automated hematologic analyzer. Atypical and typical cases did not differ significantly with respect to peripheral white blood cell counts; percentages of lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, CD4(+) lymphocytes, human leukocyte antigen — DR positivity in CD3 lymphocytes, or apoptotic cells in blood smear after incubation; or levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Only the percentage of CD8(+) lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with typical infectious mononucleosis than it was in patients with atypical infectious mononucleosis. Because certain atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis display laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of typical infectious mononucleosis, enhanced awareness can help in the diagnosis.

Pregnancy — initial presentation and differential diagnosis of Wilson disease require vigilance. WD may first become clinically apparent during pregnancy: timely diagnosis is complicated but essential. The differential diagnosis includes conditions that are more commonly found during pregnancy: hemolysis — elevated liver enzymes — low platelets syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, antiphospholipid syndrome, and flare of systemic lupus erythematosus. Adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with undiagnosed WD.

### DRESS syndrome presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and delayed eosinophilia [^115sPNuC]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Investigations

Initial laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count, normal platelet count and no atypical lymphocytes on the white blood cell differential. Eosinophilia was absent on admission; however, the patient developed eosinophilia 2 weeks after initial presentation, on hospital admission day 14, with eosinophils noted to be elevated at 1.1 k/uL at that time. Eosinophils remained elevated for the rest of the patient's hospital stay. Urine microscopic analysis was notable for few bacteria and elevated white blood cells. Liver tests on admission were notable for an elevated aspartate aminotransferase to 74 and an elevated alanine aminotransferase to 234. Creatine kinase was normal. Aldolase was checked 2 weeks into admission and was elevated to 10.9. Procalcitonin was normal. A chest X-ray on admission showed hazy opacities bilaterally (figure 1). CT of the chest showed ground-glass opacities with emphysematous changes (figure 2). One day later, a repeat chest X-ray was notable for worsening hazy and interstitial pulmonary opacities likely due to worsening inflammatory lung disease (figure 3). Using the RegiSCAR scoring system, this patient was placed in the 'possible case' category with a score of 4 (table 1). He was classified with atypical DRESS using the Japanese DIHS criteria given the lack of HHV-6 reactivation, lack of fever and lack of blood cell count abnormalities. The patient met Bocquet's criteria given the presence of a rash consistent with reaction, internal organ involvement and eosinophilia, although the presence of eosinophilia was delayed.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^11799txx]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Approximately 10% to 20% of the general population has elevated liver chemistry levels, including aspartate and alanine transaminases. Elevated transaminase levels may be associated with significant underlying liver disease and increased risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality. The most common causes of mildly elevated transaminase levels (two to five times the upper limit of normal) are metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, chronic hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes are alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic causes are celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, rhabdomyolysis, and pregnancy-associated liver disease. Initial laboratory testing assesses complete blood cell count with platelets, blood glucose, lipid profile, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin. If MASLD is suspected, the FIB-4 Index Score or NAFLD Fibrosis Score can be used to predict which patients are at risk for fibrosis and may benefit from further testing or referral to a hepatologist. All patients with elevated transaminases should be counseled about moderation or cessation of alcohol use, weight loss, and avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs.

It is not unusual to encounter abnormal liver enzyme levels on routine blood tests. When the abnormal elevation in aminotransferases persist, they require prompt and appropriate investigations as liver diseases in children are often insidious in onset and clinically silent. This article aims to provide (1) an explanation to the aetiologies of elevated aminotransferases; (2) an investigational approach to these children and (3) an insight into further investigations performed at a liver centre.

### Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen [^114kp2NL]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: from aetiopathogenesis to therapeutic approaches [^112EaWKQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent history of gastrointestinal or urinary infection, gut inflammation confirmed by elevated fecal calprotectin levels, sacroiliitis with inflammatory spinal changes and enthesitis detected by MRI support diagnosis of ERA. Subclinical gut inflammation has also been identified in older-onset of psoriatic JIA.

The diagnosis of sJIA in accordance with ILAR criteria requires arthritis and fever within the last 2 weeks, and one of the following criteria: rash, generalised lymphadenopathy, enlargement of liver or spleen, or serositis. Common laboratory abnormalities suggestive of systemic inflammation include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, platelet count, ferritin, transaminases, aldolase and d-dimers help to define the activity of the disease. Laboratorial analysis of patients with active sJIA may reveal granulocytosis, thrombocytosis, anaemia, upregulation of acute phase reactants (elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which are typical findings but not so essential for diagnosis in comparison with the life-threatening complication of MAS that include pancytopaenia, increased levels of ferritin, liver enzymes (aspartate and alanine transaminases), triglycerides, d-Dimers and hypofibrinogenemia. Clinical findings of MAS include high non-remitting fever, generalised lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, central nervous system dysfunction and hemorrhagic manifestations.

### Differentiating diagnosis of COVID-19 or influenza in patients based on laboratory data during flu season [^115a62mh]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Both coronaviruses and influenza A viruses (IAVs) are general pathogens which are responsible for the seasonal cold. However, a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is pulling the world into the torment of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the SARS-CoV-2 is still circulating in almost every continent with its ability for airborne and asymptomatic transmission, it would be very likely that the COVID-19 pandemic will overlap with the influenza epidemic in the coming winter. COVID-19 shares many clinical symptoms with pneumonia caused by IAVs, but its fatality rate is much higher than that of seasonal flu. Therefore, to precisely treat patients with respiratory diseases during the epidemic season, it would be very important that doctors are able to differentiate COVID-19 from seasonal influenza based on laboratory data as early as possible.

Currently published clinical and laboratory data on COVID-19 are limited to studies with small sample sizes mostly originating from China. In the study, Ji et al. in Northwestern University reveals significant differences in laboratory parameters between hospitalized COVID-19 and influenza patients in the US, with a sample size of more than 1000 cases. Instead of comparing clinical endpoints to evaluate risks, they compiled and temporally tracked all available laboratory results of the hospitalized patients from the day of presentation to day 14.

Compared to influenza patients, the most significant differences over the course of 14 days of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients were faster worsening anemia and leukocytosis, and a more rapid increase in-dimer, BUN, and ALT. The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly higher in patients with influenza. However, the most commonly reported laboratory abnormalities in COVID-19 include lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and elevated LDH.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^116AMfR6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Table 5 (continued) — Ischemic liver injury and malignant infiltration clinical features and prognosis — Ischemic liver injury presents acutely, often in the setting of congestive heart failure, sepsis, traumatic injury, or major surgery, with a predominantly hepatocellular pattern and marked AST elevation > 10,000 IU/L; bilirubin and INR may worsen despite improving transaminases, and prognosis is favorable with restoration of hemodynamic stability. Malignant infiltration presents acutely, commonly from lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer, or colon cancer, with abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatomegaly; labs show a mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and marked transaminase elevation approximately 40× ULN; diagnosis often relies on liver or bone marrow biopsy, and prognosis is poor.

Background

A 45-year-old white female was admitted to hospital with a 1-week history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, progressive tiredness and jaundice. Physical examination confirmed jaundice and revealed mild epigastric tenderness. Laboratory test results revealed an extremely elevated alanine aminotransferase concentration, a high bilirubin concentration, the presence of HCV RNA, and a significantly elevated antinuclear antibody titer.

Investigations

History and physical examination, laboratory investigations (including complete blood counts, liver function tests, electrolyte analysis, serological and genetic tests), Doppler ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen, and liver biopsy.

Diagnosis

Acute infection with HCV genotype 1a.

Management

Supportive care, which included monitoring vital signs and laboratory test results, and management of acute symptoms.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Factors contributing to diagnostic delay of caroli syndrome: a single-center, retrospective study [^116k98t3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Laboratory findings at diagnosis included decreased peripheral white blood cell count (n = 11), anemia (n = 11), and decreased platelet count (n = 10). Ten patients had pancytopenia. Some patients had abnormal liver function, with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (n = 2), elevated serum bilirubin (n = 2), decreased serum albumin (n = 2), and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (n = 5). Of note, the two patients with elevated ALT had cholangitis when admitted, and their ALT levels returned to normal after anti-microbial treatment. Two patients had increased serum creatinine levels, both of whom had multiple renal cysts.

Positive autoantibodies were present in four CS patients: antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were tested in ten patients and two were positive; anti-mitochondrial antibodies (M2 subtype; AMA-M2) were tested in seven patients and two were positive; and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) were tested in seven patients and one was positive. Two patients were initially misdiagnosed as having autoimmune disease. The first misdiagnosed patient was a 21-year-old man with positive ANA and slightly elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), who was misdiagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and was treated with corticosteroids and azathioprine for 1 month. There was no clinical improvement, and histopathological examination of his liver biopsy secured a diagnosis of CS. The other misdiagnosed patient was a 33-year-old woman who presented with low-grade fever and abdominal distention who had positive ANA and AMA-M2 and slightly elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). She was initially misdiagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and treated with corticosteroids and ursodeoxycholic acid for 3 months. Again, there was no clinical improvement and she developed recurrent cholangitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed, and the diagnosis of CS was made according to typical imaging findings. Her symptoms were soon controlled with antibiotics, and her GGT and ALP returned to normal.

### Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae infection in Eastern central China: a case series [^116QD3Gz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Human infection with Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae (CRT) was first reported in northeastern China in 2012.

Objective

To describe the clinical spectrum and laboratory findings of patients infected with CRT in eastern central China.

Design

Case series.

Setting

A sentinel hospital for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in eastern central China in 2014.

Participants

Hospitalized patients with SFTS-like illness.

Measurements

Molecular and serologic tests were performed to diagnose CRT infection. Data about clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were retrieved from medical records.

Results

56 of 733 assessed patients had CRT based on polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. All patients presented with nonspecific manifestations, including fever (96%), malaise (88%), myalgia (57%), cough (25%), and dizziness (14%). Only 2 patients had rash. Further, 16% had eschar, 29% had lymphadenopathy, 100% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 34% had neurologic symptoms, 43% had hemorrhagic manifestations, and 23% had signs of plasma leakage. Thrombocytopenia was observed in 70%, leukopenia in 59%; lymphopenia in 45%; and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase in 82%, aspartate aminotransferase in 70%, alanine aminotransferase in 54%, and creatinine kinase in 46%. Co-infection with SFTS virus was documented in 66% patients, and 8 of the 56 patients died.

Limitations

Patients with CRT were not treated for infection because they were retrospectively identified. This was not a population-based study, and the results cannot be generalized to all patients with CRT.

Conclusion

Candidatus R tarasevichiae infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients with SFTS-like illness in endemic areas.

### Epstein-Barr in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant pain: a case report from the emergency department [^116ymMFA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and elevated cholestasis blood tests are usually associated with bacterial calculous cholecystitis. However, viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also manifest with a similar clinical picture and is an important differential diagnosis.

Case Report

This case report discusses a young woman presenting to the emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The initial assessment revealed a positive Murphy's sign, elevated white blood count, and a cholestatic pattern on liver function tests, leading one to suspect bacterial calculous cholecystitis and initiating antibiotic therapy. However, clinical examination also revealed tonsillar exudates and differential white blood cell count revealed monocytosis and lymphocytosis rather than a high neutrophil count. The patient tested positive for EBV. Furthermore, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed gallbladder wall edema with no gallstones, leading one to conclude that the clinical manifestation and laboratory results were due to an EBV infection. Antibiotic therapy was ceased and the patient did not require surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Calculous bacterial cholecystitis usually entails antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of EBV, as it usually does not require either of these and resolves spontaneously.

### Combination of white blood cell count with liver enzymes in the diagnosis of blunt liver laceration [^1119nSfp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is sometimes difficult to decide whether to perform abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans for possible liver laceration in patients who have sustained less severe or minor blunt abdominal trauma. This study was conducted to find out whether the basic laboratory workup could provide information of possible liver laceration in blunt abdominal trauma patients and act as an indication for CT scans.

Methods

In this retrospective case-control study, we included 289 patients who had sustained blunt abdominal injury for which they received abdominal CT scans in our emergency department. Of the 289 patients, the study group (n = 42) included patients who had been found to have liver lacerations after obtaining the CT; the controls (n = 42) were those not found to have such injuries by the same method with matching of age and sex.

Results

In patients with blunt abdominal injuries, there is a strong difference in liver laceration between elevation of white blood cell (WBC) counts (P = 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P < .001), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P < .001). A logistic regression model demonstrated that WBC count and AST were independently associated with liver laceration. With elevations of serum AST greater than 100 IU/L, ALT greater than 80 IU/L, and WBC count greater than 10000/mm(3), we found a sensitivity and specificity of 90.0% and 92.3%, respectively, in the 42 liver laceration victims.

Conclusion

In patients with blunt abdominal trauma, elevated WBC counts together with elevated AST and ALT are strongly associated with liver laceration and warrant further imaging studies and management.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### Evaluation of elevated serum transaminase levels… [^115KFSKf]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best approach to the evaluation of patients with elevated serum transaminase levels. Evidence-Based Answer The evaluation of patients with elevated transaminase levels should be individualized based on the presence of symptoms or physical examination findings that suggest serious disease or hepatic decompensation. The initial evaluation should determine specific etiologies, such as exposure to alcohol or hepatotoxic medications, viral hepatitis, or hemochromatosis. In patients with reassuring initial test results, lifestyle modification can reverse presumed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common cause of persistently elevated liver transaminase levels. Transaminase levels that are elevated for longer than six months warrant additional investigation, which may include ultrasonography, additional serology, and possible liver biopsy. Compared with those in the control group, fewer patients in the exercise groups had elevated alanine transaminase levels after three months. ALT levels decreased by an average of 19 U per L in the moderate-intensity group, 15 U per L in the low-intensity group, and 7 U per L in the control group.
3. A case series with 81 adult patients who had persistently elevated ALT without serologic explanation found that 90 percent had steatosis or steatohepatitis on liver biopsy.

7 All patients had negative serum tests for infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, or hereditary liver disease; no history of alcohol or hepatotoxic drug use; and no signs of chronic liver disease.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN guideline — Additional testing for chronic liver diseases in children with suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) lists the following: screening labs (complete blood count [CBC] with differential, AST, bilirubin [total, conjugated], alkaline phosphatase, GGT, international normalized ratio [INR], albumin, total protein, hemoglobin A1c); exclude infections (eg, hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, other chronic viral infections); exclude endocrine disorders (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], free thyroxine [T4]); exclude autoimmune causes of ALT elevation (total IgA, total IgG and tissue transglutaminase antibody, antinuclear antibody, antismooth muscle antibody, anti–liver-kidney microsomal antibody); exclude genetic causes (ceruloplasmin and/or 24-hour urine copper, lysosomal acid lipase, alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype); imaging (abdominal ultrasound to rule out anatomical abnormalities or assess features of portal hypertension, magnetic resonance imaging, or spectroscopy to measure hepatic fat); liver biopsy (histology, copper measurement, stain for microvesicular fat, assess fibrosis); and red flags for advanced liver disease including chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, jaundice, splenomegaly, firm liver on examination, enlarged left lobe of the liver, low platelets, low white blood cell count, elevated direct bilirubin, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), and long history of elevated liver enzymes (> 2 years).

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

Hepatitis — workup and evaluation outlines monitoring and diagnostic steps: "Monitor pattern of abnormal liver blood tests: AST, ALT, and bilirubin before each infusion and/or consider weekly if grade 1 LFT elevations. No treatment is recommended for grade 1 LFT abnormality". Medication review and metastasis assessment are advised, and "Liver biopsy should be considered if the patient is steroid-refractory or if concern for other differential diagnoses that would alter medical management". For higher grades, "Workup for other causes of elevated liver enzymes… by doing blood work and imaging (ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging). If suspicion for primary autoimmune hepatitis is high, can consider ANA/ASMA/ANCA. If patients with elevated ALKP alone, GGT should be tested. For isolated elevation of transaminases, consider checking CK for other etiologies".

### Profound thrombocytopenia and dyspnea 11 Days after cardiac surgery [^1145h5sR]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Her leukocytosis/neutrophilia was consistent with either infection or physiological "stress" (dyspnea, anemia). Given the normoblastemia, the hematologist considered a consumptive thrombocytopenia including DIC states or the coagulation‐activating adverse drug reaction, HIT, within the differential diagnosis. This is because normoblastemia is common in conditions of bone marrow stress including lactic acidemia with DIC and severe, symptomatic anemia. The hematologist ordered markers of hypoperfusion (serum lactate, liver enzymes as markers of acute ischemic hepatitis ["shock liver"]) and also screened for DIC (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], fibrinogen,‐dimer). Testing for HIT antibodies was requested.

Chemistry showed normal lactate 1.9 mmol/L (RR, 0.7–2.1), but elevated ALT 148 U/L (RR, 0–34) and AST 81 U/L (RR, 18–34); the LDH was also elevated at 338 U/L (RR, 120–250). The PT was 14.3 s (RR, 9.4–12.5) with a corresponding international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3 (RR, 0.8–1.1); the APTT measured 24 s (RR, 25–37), fibrinogen 670 mg/L (RR, 200–390), and the‐dimer (HemosIL‐Dimer HS 500 assay performed on ACL TOP Family 50 series instrument; Werfen, Bedford, MA, USA) measured 18 630 μg/L FEU (RR, < 500). Blood cultures were drawn. Rapid HIT testing was not available at this hospital, thus screening PF4/polyanion enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results were pending. Since the patient presented on Friday afternoon, these HIT antibody test results were not expected until Monday afternoon.

### Prolonged febrile illness and fever of unknown origin in adults [^114rkC3H]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin has been described as a febrile illness (temperature of 101°F [38.3°C] or higher) for three weeks or longer without an etiology despite a one-week inpatient evaluation. A more recent qualitative definition requires only a reasonable diagnostic evaluation. Although there are more than 200 diseases in the differential diagnosis, most cases in adults are limited to several dozen possible causes. Fever of unknown origin is more often an atypical presentation of a common disease rather than an unusual disease. The most common subgroups in the differential are infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous. Clinicians should perform a comprehensive history and examination to look for potentially diagnostic clues to guide the initial evaluation. If there are no potentially diagnostic clues, the patient should undergo a minimum diagnostic workup, including a complete blood count, chest radiography, urinalysis and culture, electrolyte panel, liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level testing. Further testing should include blood cultures, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies. Human immunodeficiency virus and appropriate region-specific serologic testing (e.g., cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, tuberculosis) and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography or computed tomography are commonly performed. If the diagnosis remains elusive, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography plus computed tomography may help guide the clinician toward tissue biopsy. Empiric antibiotics or steroids are generally discouraged in patients with fever of unknown origin.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^113Hh4eT]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Graves' disease (GD) — management when antithyroid drugs are used: Methimazole should be used in virtually every child who is treated with antithyroid drug therapy. Pediatric patients and their caretakers should be informed of side effects of antithyroid drugs and the necessity of stopping the medication immediately and informing their physician if they develop pruritic rash, jaundice, acolic stools or dark urine, arthralgias, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, fever, or pharyngitis. Prior to initiating antithyroid drug therapy, we suggest that pediatric patients have, as a baseline, complete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential, and a liver profile including bilirubin, transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase. Beta adrenergic blockade is recommended for children experiencing symptoms of hyperthyroidism, especially those with heart rates in excess of 100 beats per minute. Antithyroid medication should be stopped immediately, and white blood counts measured in children who develop fever, arthralgias, mouth sores, pharyngitis, or malaise. When propylthiouracil is used in children, the medication should be stopped immediately and liver function and hepatocellular integrity assessed in children who experience anorexia, pruritis, rash, jaundice, light-colored stool or dark urine, joint pain, right upper quadrant pain or abdominal bloating, nausea or malaise. Persistent minor cutaneous reactions to methimazole therapy in children should be managed by concurrent antihistamine treatment or cessation of the medication and changing to therapy with radioactive iodine or surgery, and in the case of a serious allergic reaction to an antithyroid medication, prescribing the other antithyroid drug is not recommended.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

### Propylthiouracil [^113Rh4ZB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (anorexia, pruritus, jaundice, light colored stools, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, etc.), particularly in the first six months of therapy. When these symptoms occur, measurement should be made of liver function (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and hepatocellular integrity (ALT/AST levels).

Patients who receive propylthiouracil should be under close surveillance and should be counseled regarding the necessity of immediately reporting any evidence of illness, particularly sore throat, skin eruptions, fever, headache, or general malaise. In such cases, white blood cell and differential counts should be obtained to determine whether agranulocytosis has developed. Particular care should be exercised with patients who are receiving concomitant drugs known to be associated with agranulocytosis.

Information for Patients

Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant while taking an antithyroid drug, they should contact their physician immediately about their therapy.

Patients should report immediately any evidence of illness, in particular sore throat, skin eruptions, fever, headache, or general malaise. They also should report symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (anorexia, pruritus, right upper quadrant pain, etc.).

Inform patients that cases of vasculitis resulting in severe complications and death have occurred with propylthiouracil. Inform patients to promptly report symptoms that may be associated with vasculitis including new rash, hematuria or decreased urine output, dyspnea or hemoptysis (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Laboratory Tests

Because propylthiouracil may cause hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding, monitoring of prothrombin time should be considered during therapy with the drug, especially before surgical procedures.

Thyroid function tests should be monitored periodically during therapy. Once clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism has resolved, the finding of an elevated serum TSH indicates that a lower maintenance dose of propylthiouracil should be employed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for CAR T-cell therapy-related toxicities, more specifically with respect to evaluation for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, ASCO 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain the following laboratory tests for the evaluation for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis:

- CBC with differential and coagulation studies, including PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer

- LFTs, including ALT, AST, GGT, TBIL, albumin, and LDH

- fasting serum triglycerides

- serum ferritin

- sIL-2R alpha and/or CXCL9.

### Haemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis-an underrecognized hyperinflammatory syndrome [^115FwLM4]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing HLH

HLH causes a constellation of non-specific findings, including persistent fever, altered mental state, rash, cytopenias affecting all cell lines (often with thrombocytopenia initially), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and transaminitis. Typically patients have hyperferritinaemia (highly elevated ferritin > 10 000 μg/l may be pathognomic of HLH in some contexts) with elevated triglycerides and decreasing fibrinogen. However, often one or more of these abnormalities is not seen.

Key to early detection of HLH before the 'tipping point' into hyperinflammation is interpretation of patterns of results rather than absolute values and recognizing worrying trends (e.g. decreasing ESR in a patient with a known chronic disease).

The absence of haemophagocytosis on bone marrow can be falsely reassuring. The test is not 100% sensitive, and it may not be present in up to 30% of cases or only appear on repeat testing. Furthermore, haemophagocytosis on bone marrow, or in other tissues, is not binary, nor is it sufficient to make the diagnosis of HLH — some degree of haemophagocytosis can be present in the marrow of patients without HLH. Close collaboration with haematologists when managing HLH is therefore essential.

In the paediatric and adult populations, hyperferritinaemia is shown to be both sensitive and specific as a marker for HLH and MAS in 'at-risk' patients and a marker of response to treatment. Diagnostic algorithms have been developed utilizing ferritin, given its wide availability and low cost. Hyperferritinaemia is not specific for HLH in the adult population as a whole, being seen in a number of other conditions including renal failure, liver failure, and iron overload.

pHLH has an established set of diagnostic criteria — the Histiocyte Society's HLH-2004 criteria [see Table 1]. These criteria have been extrapolated to the diagnosis of sHLH; however, there is concern that this leads to underrecognition. For instance, features well recognized in adults [such as elevated LDH and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] are not included in the diagnostic criteria, and some of the variables measured in the HLH-2004 criteria are not readily available in many hospitals.

Laboratory characteristics

Serum studies at presentation were characterized by a median leukocytosis of 13,000 cells/mL 3 (IQR = 8,000–16,000 cells), low end of normal sodium levels (median = 135 mmol/L, IQR = 133–138 mmol/L), normal platelet counts (median = 187,000 cells/mL 3, IQR = 158,000–236,000 cells/mL 3), and normal aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase (table 1). All patients had a lumbar puncture performed within 3 days of presentation. The CSF was characterized by a pleocytosis with a median white blood cell (WBC) count of 369 cells/mL 3 (IQR = 185–831 cells/mL 3) (table 1); the majority (n = 14; 82%) of CSF samples contained less than 1,000 WBC/mL 3 (figure 1A). The median CSF WBC count in the 3 pediatric cases was 324 WBC/mL 3 compared with 680 WBC/mL 3 in adults. It is challenging to make definitive comparisons given the small sample size, but consistent with historical data, there is no apparent difference in CSF WBC count between children and adults.CSF protein was elevated to a median of 100 mg/dL (IQR = 75–145 mg/dL), and CSF glucose was normal (median = 65 mg/dL, IQR = 57–78 mg/dL) (figure 1, B and C). A total of 79% (n = 11/14 with differential) of patients had a neutrophilic predominance (60.6% of WBC, SD = 22.8) in their CSF (figure 1D). Two patients had a repeat lumbar puncture within 1–3 days of their initial lumbar puncture and showed a shift to an increased lymphocyte fraction. During admission, 29% of patients developed myelosuppression with leukopenia (n = 1; 6%), thrombocytopenia (n = 1; 6%), or both (n = 3; 18%).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111r7Nsc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

General health — baseline laboratory evaluation at initiation of care — includes that a complete blood count with differential white blood cell count and a chemistry panel with electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, calculated creatinine clearance (or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), blood urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and urinalysis should be obtained upon initiation of care, and because many ARV drugs, the HIV infection, and host factors are associated with abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels, a lipid profile should be obtained upon initiation of care and repeated fasting, if appropriate; kidney function is abnormal in up to 30% of persons with untreated HIV.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

### Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection presenting with fever, elevated amylase / lipase, and hematologic abnormalities [^1136A6kr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Many cases of acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) present to the Emergency Department (ED). Early diagnosis allows a patient to modify their behavior and seek early treatment. The Emergency Physician should know that the antibody response may be absent.

Objective

We report a case of AHI and review its presentation to increase the awareness of this important diagnosis.

Case Report

A 20-year-old black man who had a history of sex with men initially presented to the ED with a chief complaint of blood per rectum when he passed stool, and chills for the prior few days. His work-up was normal, including a rapid HIV screen, and he was discharged. He returned 2 weeks later with constipation, fatigue, myalgias, decreased urination, chills, and a productive cough. His physical examination was unremarkable, HIV antibody test was negative, but his laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase, amylase, and lipase. His blood count showed a normal hematocrit and white blood cell count, but there were juvenile and vacuolated white cells and giant platelets reported. HIV viral load was reported as > 1,000,000 copies/mL.

Conclusions/Summary

This case illustrates that AHI can present as a non-specific illness. Patients at risk should be screened for HIV. However, AHI can occur before there is a significant antibody response. In such cases, a viral load test may help make the diagnosis, allowing for early treatment and patient counseling.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^112nLmed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings

Below we describe the findings for tests assessed in four or more studies: white blood cell count increase and decrease, neutrophil count increase and decrease, monocyte count increase, lymphocyte count decrease, platelets decrease, alanine aminotransferase increase, aspartate aminotransferase increase, albumin decrease, total bilirubin, CRP increase, procalcitonin increase, IL‐6 increase, creatine kinase increase, serum creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase increase. See Table 4 for an overview of tests and cut‐off values per study. Table 1 shows the summary of findings for the individual tests, including sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs). All HSROC curves were close to the non‐informative diagonal, with DORs varying between 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.78) and 4.53 (95% CI 1.89 to 10.88). As an indication, a test with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 70% has a DOR of 5.0.

### Green neutrophilic inclusions in liver disease [^1167Qupv]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute hepatic failure is traditionally diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, historical information, and a collection of abnormal laboratory findings including elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, serum bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein. Non-specific haematological findings such as anaemia, thrombocytopenia and changes in erythrocyte morphology are well documented in patients with liver failure. It is believed, however, that there are no specific morphological findings on peripheral blood smears directly linked to liver failure. This report describes two patients diagnosed with acute hepatic failure, both having coarse, bright-green cytoplasmic inclusions identified within their neutrophils. One previous case of a patient with similar neutrophil findings and concurrent liver disease has been reported in the literature; however, a direct relationship to liver failure was not proposed. It is suggested that the findings may be directly related to liver failure and may also serve as a prognostic indicator of impending death.

### Preliminary analysis of the impact of lab results on large language model generated differential diagnoses [^112qFc2d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

For a subset of LLM predictions, we asked LLM to generate the reasoning behind each prediction and asked clinicians to evaluate it. Clinicians assessed whether the provided reasoning was logical and whether it supported the accuracy of the diagnosis. For the "Guillain-Barr Syndrome following acute hepatitis E diagnosis", it correctly predicted, "Acute hepatitis E complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS)". The model provided the reason for the prediction as: " Initial and subsequent lab tests showed elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), and very high bilirubin levels, which are indicative of acute liver injury. The serology tests confirmed the presence of HEV antibodies (both IgM and IgG). The prolonged presence of IgM anti-HEV indicates a sustained immune response to the infection. The development of lower limb weakness progressing to severe muscle weakness represents a rare but recognized neurological manifestation associated with HEV infection. The rapid progression and the timing of these symptoms during the course of the liver disease further link them to the HEV infection". The reasoning was evaluated by the clinician as "solid decision making". Another example is for the final diagnosis "Aspergillus fumigatus infection with liver failure", and the model predicted "Acute liver failure complicated by invasive pulmonary aspergillosis". The model reasoning was that ' the thoracic CT scan showing bilateral pulmonary high-density shadows suggests a significant pulmonary involvement, which is not typical of liver diseases alone and the markedly elevated bilirubin levels and liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) indicate acute liver injury. The progression to a high INR (International Normalized Ratio) and worsening bilirubin levels despite treatment suggest acute liver failure'. The reasoning was also deemed correct by the clinician.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^112C87LM]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory marker thresholds and adjunct testing — 8 to 21 days: Laboratory inflammatory markers are considered elevated at procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 20 mg/L, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 4000 to 5200 per mm3, and although "we recommend all infants in this age group have a complete sepsis workup, receive parenteral antimicrobial agents, and be monitored in a hospital", IM results can guide decisions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, glucose, protein, bacterial culture, and enterovirus PCR (if available) if pleocytosis is present and during periods of increased local enterovirus prevalence. HSV should be considered when there is a maternal history of genital HSV infections or fevers from 48 hours before to 48 hours after delivery and in infants with vesicles, seizures, hypothermia, mucous membrane ulcers, CSF pleocytosis in the absence of a positive Gram stain result, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated alanine aminotransferase levels; recommended HSV studies are CSF PCR; HSV surface swabs of the mouth, nasopharynx, conjunctiva, and anus for an HSV culture (if available) or PCR assay; alanine aminotransferase; and blood PCR.

### A systematic review of clinical and laboratory parameters associated with increased severity among COVID-19 patients [^113jkBib]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an extremely difficult pandemic to contain and it has affected more than 148 countries worldwide. The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive summary of clinical and laboratory parameters that are associated with and indicative of increased severity among COVID-19 patients.

Material and Methods

All the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19 were retrieved and evaluated for inclusion.

Results

As per our review, the mean age of patients in the severe group was 59.3 years compared to 46.5 years in non severe group. COVID-19 was more severe among men than women. Clinical presentation was variable among different studies. and dyspnea was the factor indicating severe disease. Laboratory parameters associated with increased severity were lymphopenia < 0.8 × 10 9 /L, thrombocytopenia 100 × 10 9 /L, leucocytosis TC > 11 × 10 9 /L, procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL, d dimer > 2 mcg/mL, aspartate transaminase elevation > 150U/L, LDH > 250U/L.

Conclusion

This systematic review suggests that COVID-19 is a disease with varied clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. The commonest clinical symptoms were fever, cough and dyspnea. The laboratory parameters associated with severe disease were lymphopenia, elevated LDH, D dimer and Procalcitonin.

### Nevirapine (viramune) [^114S1Fx4]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.4), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment.

The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+cell counts less than 250 cells/mm3(11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3(6% versus 1% for men with CD4+cell counts less than 400 cells/mm3). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT.

### Evaluating elevated liver chemistry test results… [^112LzhZW]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Because normal values for serum biochemical tests are defined by the mean of the distribution plus or minus two standard deviations among a healthy population, 2. 5 percent of healthy persons will have abnormal test elevations. In addition, because a normal value does not exclude the possibility of hepatic disease, test results must be interpreted in the context of the individual patient, and a detailed history, physical examination, and medication review are required. Important factors in this evaluation include risk factors for liver disease, medications associated with liver chemistry abnormalities, comorbid conditions, alcohol consumption, and other evidence of liver disease. This information base may appropriately direct the examination toward establishing specific diagnoses. When no clues exist or a diagnosis cannot be confirmed, an algorithm for evaluation of liver test abnormalities can be useful.

Elevated serum aminotransferase levels indicate the need to test for common hepatic diseases with noninvasive testing. If these results are negative, further testing should be based on the clinical situation. Clinical follow-up and serial serum liver chemistry testing is important. If aminotransferase elevations are persistent or marked, or if there is evidence of liver disease, a more complete diagnostic effort is required, which may include radiologic testing and liver biopsy. Hyperbilirubinemia can be caused by hepatocellular, cholestatic, or metabolic diseases and requires further evaluation. Initial evaluation should identify whether hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia in an asymptomatic patient may indicate Gilbert's syndrome, hemolysis, or a medication adverse effect.

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the presence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level warrants evaluation for biliary obstruction with ultrasonography. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level in the presence of normal aminotransferase levels warrants testing of γ-glutamyl-transferase or 5-nucleotidase testing. If these results are negative, some other etiology should be sought for the elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level outside of the hepatobiliary tract. If these results are positive, further testing is necessary to look for biliary obstruction, medication adverse effects, or primary biliary cirrhosis. The authors conclude that mild liver abnormalities found in patients who appear to be healthy can be followed up closely if initial testing for common liver disease is negative. Further evaluation is essential in patients who have significant symptoms, chronic or serious liver disease, and marked laboratory abnormalities.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Elevated liver enzymes as a manifestation of haff disease [^111esdQV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Haff disease is a rare syndrome of rhabdomyolysis thought to be caused by a heat-stable toxin associated with the consumption of seafood from fresh or brackish water.

Case Report

We present the case of a patient with Haff disease who presented to the emergency department with nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias after a seafood buffet. Initially, he was treated with i.v. fluids and antiemetics for presumed gastroenteritis, but his symptoms did not improve. He was found to have elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, normal point-of-care ultrasound, urinalysis with large blood and no red blood cells, and an elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK). He was admitted to the hospital to receive ongoing fluid resuscitation for rhabdomyolysis presumed to be from fish. Liver enzymes and CPK downtrended, and patient was discharged on hospital day 3. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Undiagnosed Haff disease has important clinical implications, including multi-organ failure and death. Always maintain a high level of suspicion for Haff disease in patients with symptoms suggestive of gastroenteritis, but complicated by minor liver function test elevations and dipstick positivity for heme, without significant numbers of red blood cells per high-power field, in the setting of recent seafood ingestion.

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

Chest CT findings at presentation (A) and 6-month follow-up (B)

The patient arrived to our institution on day eight of illness and was noted to be afebrile, continued to have normal oxygen saturations on room air, and his physical exam was largely unremarkable with good aeration in all lung fields and no crackles or focality on auscultation, normal neurologic status, no abnormal skin findings, and reassuring cardiac exam. He was placed on airborne precautions due to previous positive COVID-19 PCR, and COVID-19 PCR screening again returned positive on admission. Initial laboratory testing showed depressed white blood cell count (WBC) at 2.91 × 10 3 /uL, hemoglobin normal at 14.2 g/dL, and a normal platelet count of 369 × 10 3 /uL. His kidney function was normal with creatinine of 0.74 mg/dL and patient had normal electrolytes with only slight elevation in alanine transaminase level (ALT) to 35.8 U/L. Inflammatory markers were elevated with C - reactive protein (CRP) found to be 4.52 mg/dL and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 55 mm/hr. Urinalysis was negative for protein, WBCs, and blood. Due to broad infectious differential, patient was placed on vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and completed a 48-h rule-out. From an infectious standpoint, patient had testing return negative for HIV, tuberculosis, aspergillus, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, and blood cultures remained negative throughout his hospital course, from illness day eight through day eleven. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not tested on presentation. With embolic phenomena on the differential, patient had a normal echocardiogram performed and upper/lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were negative for deep venous thrombosis. Additionally, with MIS-C on the differential, ferritin, d-dimer, fibrinogen, and troponin levels were obtained. Ferritin, d-dimer, and fibrinogen levels were slightly elevated consistent with an inflammatory process, but with normal troponin levels, normal echocardiogram, lack of hypotension, and downtrend of fever curve without treatment, concern for MIS-C decreased substantially. With a largely reassuring work-up and improvement in fever curve, the patient was discharged from his hospitalization on day eleven of illness.

Differential diagnosis

Based on the hypertension condition with mean arterial pressure more than 120 mm Hg and we found proteinuria followed by increasing LDH level, we first suggested this patient got pre-eclampsia condition compounded by HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme and low platelet) syndrome. Nevertheless, there was no increasing of AST/ALT level in this patient and her platelet count still in normal limit, the diagnosis can be eliminated. We also found her blood glucose increased to 143 mg/dL but we thought it as reactive hyperglicemia condition because the blood glucose level was decreasing after we did re-evaluation.

Moreover, the patient came to the hospital with dyspnoea, with her respiratory rate 40 times/min and her oxygen saturation 95% in room air. In this pandemic condition, initially we suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, without any previous coughing, fever symptom, her antigen swab of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM showed non-reactive result and her chest X-ray represented cardiomegaly with lung oedema appearance compounded by suspected bilateral pleural effusion, we temporarily set aside this differential diagnosis until the PCR swab result come out.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, AAFP 2014 guidelines recommend to suspect common causes such as infection, inflammation, and stress response when evaluating a patient with leukocytosis. Obtain peripheral blood smear in patients with a WBC count > 20, 000/mcL and with associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes, or constitutional symptoms.

Switching disease-modifying therapy (Recommendation 5) — Clinicians should monitor laboratory abnormalities found on requisite laboratory surveillance (as outlined in the medication's package insert) in people with MS who are using a DMT (Level B), and clinicians should discuss switching DMT or reducing dosage or frequency when laboratory abnormalities occur. The rationale states that persistent laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated liver enzymes and decreased white blood cell counts, may prompt a discussion about switching DMT.
