## Question

what is the average weight gain with abilify?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the average weight gain is with aripiprazole (Abilify) across short-term monotherapy, adjunctive use with antidepressants, longer-term treatment including long-acting injectables, and how this compares with other antipsychotics, with practical interpretation of the variability observed in trials and labels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the short-term oral monotherapy data from placebo-controlled trials. Then, I should verify the adjunctive-to-antidepressant data. Next, I will review longer-term oral data and reconcile it with long-acting injectable findings. After that, I need to place aripiprazole in comparative context versus higher-risk agents like olanzapine and consider switch data. Finally, I should consider pediatric patterns, individual variability, and monitoring or management implications based on guidelines and high-quality syntheses [^11236qsx] [^114aki4D].

> Let me first confirm the short-term monotherapy signal. In pooled placebo-controlled trials of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with a median exposure of about 3–4 weeks, aripiprazole produced a mean weight change of approximately +0.3 kg versus –0.1 kg with placebo, which is clinically minimal; I should double-check that this reflects the labeled pooled estimate and not a single study artifact, and the FDA label indeed reports these pooled means, supporting a low short-term weight liability with oral monotherapy [^11236qsx] [^114aki4D].

> Next, I should review the adjunctive-to-antidepressant data because that context often shows a different pattern. Over 6 weeks of adjunctive treatment added to ongoing antidepressants, the mean weight change was about +1.7 kg with aripiprazole compared with +0.4 kg with adjunctive placebo; hold on, let me verify denominators and duration, and yes, the label specifies N = 347 for aripiprazole and N = 330 for placebo over 6 weeks, which suggests a modest but clinically noticeable early gain in this augmentation setting [^11236qsx].

> Now, I will examine longer-term oral data. Wait, the label notes that at 24 weeks the aripiprazole group showed a mean weight change of −1.5 kg compared with −0.2 kg on placebo; I need to check sample sizes and context because a mean weight loss could reflect selective retention or other biases in small samples, and indeed the denominators are small (n = 73 vs n = 46), so while this suggests weight neutrality or slight reduction over time for some cohorts, I should be cautious not to overgeneralize from this single longer-term dataset [^11236qsx].

> Let me consider long-acting injectable formulations because clinicians often ask whether LAIs behave differently. In one 12-week, placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in schizophrenia, the mean change was about +3.5 kg versus +0.8 kg on placebo; but wait, I should verify longer horizons to see whether this persists, and in a 52-week open-label bipolar I study after initiation of Abilify Maintena the mean increase was about +1.0 kg, with 21.4% experiencing ≥ 7% weight gain and 15.4% experiencing ≥ 7% weight loss, underscoring heterogeneity across individuals and time frames [^112yUP2D].

> I should now place this in comparative context. A head-to-head, 26-week randomized trial in schizophrenia showed a mean −1.37 kg change with aripiprazole versus substantial gain on olanzapine, with clinically significant ≥ 7% weight gain in 14% on aripiprazole versus 37% on olanzapine; I need to ensure the threshold definition is consistent, and yes, the trial defined ≥ 7% as significant and found differences from week 1 onward, highlighting aripiprazole's lower weight liability compared with olanzapine [^112vhtAa]. Complementing this, a dose–response meta-analysis across randomized trials found aripiprazole's mean weight gain versus placebo to be mild at all doses (≤ 1 kg), supporting an overall low risk profile relative to many SGAs, although early gains can occur and curves may plateau with higher doses for several antipsychotics; I should confirm aripiprazole's positioning among "mild gain" agents, which the meta-analysis does affirm [^114aki4D]. Additionally, switching meta-analyses suggest that moving to aripiprazole can reduce weight compared with remaining on higher-risk agents, with significant reductions in weight, fasting glucose, and triglycerides in switch-versus-stay comparisons, which is clinically useful when mitigating antipsychotic-induced weight gain, although individual responses vary [^113d24pr].

> But wait, what about pediatric and adolescent trajectories, since growth confounds interpretation. In a 26-week open-label extension enrolling adolescents with schizophrenia and pediatric patients with bipolar disorder, about 32.8% had ≥ 7% weight gain without growth adjustment, prompting the need to use z-scores to normalize for expected growth; I should emphasize that weight monitoring against pediatric growth norms is recommended whenever aripiprazole is used in youth, given the higher prevalence of ≥ 7% changes and developmental variability [^115aHsFg].

> Let me synthesize and double-check internal consistency. Across contexts, aripiprazole is associated with minimal mean gain in short-term monotherapy (~+0.3 kg in 3–4 weeks), modest early gain when used adjunctively with antidepressants (~+1.7 kg over 6 weeks), and generally neutral to small average changes over longer-term oral use, while long-acting injectables can show an initial several-kilogram rise in short placebo-controlled windows but average to roughly +1 kg over a year, with a substantial minority gaining or losing ≥ 7% body weight; this profile aligns with meta-analytic findings of ≤ 1 kg mean gain versus placebo across doses and underscores notable interindividual variability, especially early in treatment when weight trajectories are most dynamic [^11236qsx] [^112yUP2D] [^114aki4D] [^111yvk18].

> Hold on, I should verify that my clinical takeaways reflect both trial means and real-world dispersion. The consistent themes are that aripiprazole's average weight effect is low compared to many SGAs, particularly olanzapine, that early weight changes in the first weeks to months are most prognostic for longer-term cardiometabolic risk, and that individual outcomes range from loss to clinically significant gain, necessitating routine monitoring and personalized mitigation strategies; these points are supported by FDA labeling, head-to-head and dose–response meta-analyses, and early-weight-change literature [^11236qsx] [^112vhtAa] [^114aki4D] [^111yvk18].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical guidance is explicit. I would monitor baseline weight, BMI, and waist circumference, then track weight at least monthly for the first 3 months and quarterly thereafter, with earlier intervention if weight rises > 3% in the first year; if clinically meaningful gain emerges or the patient is high risk, consider strategies such as switching from higher-risk agents to aripiprazole when feasible and adding metabolic therapies per guidelines, where metformin and GLP-1 receptor agonists are supported for antipsychotic-associated weight gain depending on access and patient factors, keeping in mind that aripiprazole already sits at the lower end of weight liability among SGAs [^111yvk18] [^115adYcW] [^1146EHFC] [^112hD56s].

Abilify (aripiprazole) causes **minimal average weight gain** in adults [^114aki4D], with a mean change of +0.3 kg in short-term trials and –1.5 kg at 24 weeks [^11236qsx]. In pediatric patients, **average weight gain is higher** — about 2.4 kg over 8 weeks — and 32.8% gain ≥ 7% of baseline weight by 26 weeks. Clinically significant **weight gain (≥ 7% of baseline)** occurs in about 8% of adults and 32.8% of pediatric patients. The risk is lower than with many other antipsychotics [^112vhtAa] [^111fT88G], but monitoring and early intervention are still recommended [^117WXyyf] [^111yvk18].

## Average weight gain in adults

- **Short-term trials**: In 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (median exposure 21–25 days), the mean weight change was +0.3 kg (N = 1673) [^11236qsx] vs –0.1 kg with placebo (N = 1100).

- **Longer-term trials**: At 24 weeks, mean weight change was –1.5 kg (n = 73) [^11236qsx] vs –0.2 kg with placebo (n = 46).

- **Adjunctive antidepressant trials**: After 8 weeks of antidepressant lead-in, 6 weeks of adjunctive aripiprazole led to +1.7 kg (N = 347) [^11236qsx] vs +0.4 kg with placebo (N = 330).

- **Clinically significant gain**: ≥ 7% weight gain occurred in 8% of adults on aripiprazole vs 3% on placebo.

---

## Average weight gain in pediatric patients

- **Short-term trials**: In two 8-week placebo-controlled trials, mean weight gain was 2.4 kg (N = 381) vs 0.2 kg with placebo (N = 187).

- **Longer-term trials**: At 26 weeks, 32.8% gained ≥ 7% of baseline weight (not adjusted for growth) [^115aHsFg].

- **Growth-adjusted gain**: After 9 months, 21.8% had a z-score increase ≥ 0.5 SD, and 7.1% had ≥ 1.0 SD.

## Weight gain with long-acting injectable formulations

With long-acting injectables, **Abilify Maintena** in a 12-week placebo-controlled trial showed a mean weight change of +3.5 kg (N = 99) [^112yUP2D] vs +0.8 kg with placebo (N = 66). In a **long-term bipolar study**, the 52-week mean weight increase was 1.0 kg [^112yUP2D]; 21.4% had ≥ 7% gain, and 15.4% had ≥ 7% loss.

---

## Factors influencing weight gain

Aripiprazole-associated weight gain is influenced by **dose and duration** [^113YijcK]; higher doses and longer exposure increase risk [^114aki4D]. Younger age, **lower baseline BMI**, and **first-episode psychosis** [^111yvk18] also raise risk [^115vtrnX]. Genetic polymorphisms, such as MC4R variants, may predispose to weight gain [^111DnuzE].

---

## Comparison with other antipsychotics

Aripiprazole has a **lower weight-gain risk** than many other antipsychotics [^114aki4D] [^112vhtAa] [^111fT88G]:

| **Measure** | **Aripiprazole** | **Olanzapine** | **Risperidone** | **Quetiapine** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Short-term mean weight gain | +0.3 kg (short-term) [^11236qsx] | +2.6 kg (6 weeks) | +2.0 kg (3–8 weeks) | +2.3 kg (6 weeks) [^113koHv1] |
| Long-term mean weight gain | –1.5 kg (24 weeks) [^11236qsx] | +5.6 kg (48 weeks) [^115PLFJp] | +4.3 kg (24 weeks) [^115Vft9t] | +4.5 kg (4 years) |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the lower but non-negligible risk, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor weight**: Regularly track weight, BMI, and metabolic parameters [^111yvk18].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Use diet and exercise to limit gain [^116sTGgN].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Consider metformin [^113iVRLy] or GLP-1 agonists if gain occurs [^11157g45] [^11522jww].

- **Switching strategies**: Switch to lower-risk agents [^113d24pr] if gain is significant.

### Abilify [^11236qsx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, primarily from pooled schizophrenia and bipolar disorder studies with a median exposure of 21 to 25 days, the mean change in body weight in Abilify-treated patients was +0.3 kg (N = 1673) compared to –0.1 kg (N = 1100) in placebo-treated patients. At 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in body weight for Abilify-treated patients was –1.5 kg (n = 73) compared to –0.2 kg (n = 46) in placebo-treated patients.

In trials adding Abilify to antidepressants, patients initially received 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment followed by 6 weeks of adjunctive Abilify or placebo in addition to their ongoing antidepressant treatment. The mean change in body weight for patients receiving adjunctive Abilify was +1.7 kg (N = 347) compared to +0.4 kg (N = 330) for patients receiving adjunctive placebo.

### Abilify [^115aHsFg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Table 13 shows the percentage of pediatric and adolescent patients with weight gain ≥ 7% of body weight by indication.

In an open-label trial that enrolled patients from the two placebo-controlled trials of adolescents with schizophrenia (ages 13 to 17) and pediatric patients with bipolar disorder (ages 10 to 17), 73.2% of patients (238/325) completed 26 weeks of therapy with Abilify. After 26 weeks, 32.8% of patients gained ≥ 7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of pediatric patients and adolescents by comparisons to age- and gender-matched population standards.

- **Weight gain monitoring**: When treating pediatric patients for any indication, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth.

- **Pathological gambling and other compulsive behaviors**: Postmarketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges have been reported.

### Aripiprazole dose associations with metabolic adverse effect: Results from a longitudinal study [^113YijcK]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to examine whether aripiprazole dosage is associated with an increase in metabolic parameters such as weight gain, blood lipids, and glucose dysregulation. The study investigates the associations between aripiprazole dose and changes in weight, blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure.

Methods involved selecting 422 patients who had been taking aripiprazole for a minimum of three weeks to one year from the PsyMetab and PsyClin cohorts. Linear mixed-effect models were used to examine the associations between aripiprazole dose and metabolic outcomes.

Results indicated that aripiprazole dose was associated with weight change when considering its interaction with treatment duration (interaction term: -0.10, p < 0.001). Initially, higher doses resulted in greater weight gain compared to lower doses. However, this trend reversed at approximately five months, with low doses then being associated with greater weight increase than high doses. LDL and HDL cholesterol levels showed associations with aripiprazole dose over five months, independent of treatment duration, with increases of 0.06 and 0.02 mmol/l for each 5 mg increment (p = 0.033 and p = 0.016, respectively). Additionally, mean dose increases were linked to a 30% greater likelihood of clinically relevant weight gain (i.e. ≥ 7%) over one year (p = 0.025).

In conclusion, the study found that aripiprazole dose was associated with one-year weight changes, particularly concerning its interaction with treatment duration. Increasing the dose could potentially lead to metabolic worsening over the first five months of treatment.

### Managing weight gain and metabolic issues in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics [^117WXyyf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The proven efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) has led many clinicians to switch patients from a conventional antipsychotic to an SGA. However, SGAs may be associated with weight gain, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and ultimately with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of patients' individual risk factors for developing these illnesses and should carefully screen for changes in weight, body mass index, waist size, or lipid levels that could be potentially harmful and increase the risk for a more serious illness.

### A comparison of weight change during treatment with olanzapine or aripiprazole: results from a randomized, double-blind study [^112vhtAa]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). High credibility.

Weight gain is a side effect of therapy with many atypical antipsychotics and may have important clinical repercussions regarding long-term health and treatment compliance. The primary objective of this double-blind study was to compare the safety and tolerability of aripiprazole and olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia, as evidenced by the percentage of patients exhibiting significant weight gain.

- **Method**: This was a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who were in acute relapse and required hospitalization. Significant weight gain was defined as a ≥ 7% increase in body weight from baseline. Assessments of body weight, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I) were performed at baseline and at regular intervals during the study. The study period was from April 2000 through June 2001.

- **Results**: 317 patients were randomly assigned to aripiprazole (N = 156) or olanzapine (N = 161). Compared with those treated with aripiprazole, a greater proportion of patients treated with olanzapine exhibited clinically significant weight gain during the trial. By week 26, 37% of olanzapine-treated patients had experienced significant weight gain compared with 14% of aripiprazole-treated patients (p < .001). Statistically significant differences in mean weight change were observed between treatments beginning at week 1 and sustained throughout the study. At week 26, there was a mean weight loss of 1.37 kg (3.04 lb) with aripiprazole compared with olanzapine.

### Behavioral interventions for antipsychotic induced appetite changes [^116sTGgN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding the potential drivers of antipsychotic-induced weight gain involves identifying the receptors that facilitate this change. Of the first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), low-potency phenothiazines like chlorpromazine carry the highest risk of increasing weight. Furthermore, chlorpromazine may raise the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the risk of weight gain is relatively low with high-potency FGAs such as perphenazine, fluphenazine, and haloperidol.

Among the second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), clozapine and olanzapine are most likely to increase weight and appetite and to stimulate overeating. These drugs also elevate the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Other SGAs such as quetiapine, risperidone, paliperidone, asenapine, iloperidone, and sertindole can also increase weight, albeit to a lesser extent, and are not currently linked with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome.

Ziprasidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, and possibly lurasidone belong to a third category of antipsychotics, where the risk of weight gain and appetite increase tends to be low or negligible.

The blockade of dopamine (D2 and D3), serotonin (5HT2c), muscarinic (M3), and histamine (H1) receptors have all been implicated in increasing appetite. The liability for weight gain appears inversely related to the specificity of the receptor profile of antipsychotic drugs; the more receptors targeted, the less specific the drug and the higher the likelihood of weight gain. It is the non-specificity of an individual drug, rather than its categorization into FGAs and SGAs, that predicts weight gain liability or metabolic risk.

### Olanzapine [^115PLFJp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In long-term studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) with a median exposure of 573 days, across 2,021 participants. The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32%, and 12%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

- **Table 6 analysis**: Table 6 includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent those patients who completed treatment periods of the specified durations.

- **Dose group differences**: Differences with respect to weight gain have been observed. In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 mg/day (N = 199), 20 mg/day (N = 200), and 40 mg/day (N = 200) of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, mean baseline to endpoint weight increase was 1.9 kg for 10 mg/day, 2.3 kg for 20 mg/day, and 3 kg for 40 mg/day, with significant differences observed between 10 mg/day and 40 mg/day.

### Risperdal [^115Vft9t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use, and clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.

Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of 7% or greater of body weight, from seven placebo-controlled, 3- to 8-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, were mentioned in the text but referred to Table 6 which is not included here.

In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies, Risperdal was associated with a mean weight change of +4.3 kg at Week 24 (n = 395) and +5.3 kg at Week 48 (n = 203). Similarly, data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting the criterion of ≥ 7% gain in body weight from nine placebo-controlled, 3- to 8-week, fixed-dose studies in children and adolescents, with conditions including schizophrenia (13–17 years of age), bipolar mania (10–17 years of age), autistic disorder (5–17 years of age), or other psychiatric disorders (5–17 years of age), were referred to in Table 7, which is also not included here.

In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label extension pediatric studies, Risperdal was associated with a mean change in weight of +5.5 kg at Week 24 (n = 748) and +8.0 kg at Week 48 (n = 242).

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^111yvk18]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain can be substantial and rapid early in the course of psychosis, with the first year of treatment being critical. A naturalistic cohort study found that individuals with first-episode psychosis gained an average of 3.46 ± 7.81 kg of weight following a mean of 44.6 days of treatment. The trend in weight gain and change in BMI during the first weeks of treatment has been identified as the most clinically significant factor influencing the longer-term risk of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. In the case of BMI, there is moderate certainty evidence for this association.

- **Eating behavior and early appetite increases**: Early increases in appetite or changes in eating behavior may predict the risk of weight gain; however, the certainty of evidence is low and inconsistent. One study found that increased appetite at 4 weeks was associated with significantly greater weight gain at 12 weeks, with a mean difference of 2.67 kg (95% CI 1.20 to 4.15), P < 0.0001. Eating behavior and elevated blood glucose levels were identified as potential predictors of weight gain.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs against antipsychotic-induced weight gain: potential physiological benefits [^11522jww]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs have been investigated for their potential in managing weight gain associated with the use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). These medications, while effective for psychiatric symptoms, often lead to significant weight gain, contributing to conditions like increased body mass index (BMI) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

- **Potential physiological benefits**: GLP-1 analogs may offer a novel approach by mitigating weight gain and improving metabolic parameters. This intervention could play a crucial role in enhancing patient outcomes given the long-term health risks associated with SGA-induced weight gain.

Further exploration into the mechanisms and long-term effects of GLP-1 analogs on weight and metabolic health is essential to fully understand their potential benefits in clinical practice.

### Amisulpride, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (BeSt InTro): A pragmatic, rater-blind, semi-randomised trial [^111fT88G]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Amisulpride, aripiprazole, and olanzapine are first-line atypical antipsychotics that have not previously been compared head-to-head in a pragmatic trial. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of these agents in a controlled trial.

- **Methods**: This pragmatic, rater-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in three academic centers of psychiatry in Norway and one in Austria. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (F20–29), and had symptoms of active psychosis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral amisulpride, aripiprazole, or olanzapine, with treatment allocation open to patients and staff. Starting dose and treatment adjustments were at the discretion of the treating physician. Independent statisticians prepared computer-generated randomisation lists for each study center. Patients were followed up for 52 weeks post-random assignment, with assessments conducted eight times by researchers masked to treatment. The primary outcome was the reduction of the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 52 weeks, and primary analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446328.

- **Findings**: Between October 20, 2011, and December 30, 2016, we assessed 359 patients for eligibility. A total of 215 patients were excluded (107 did not meet inclusion criteria, 82 declined to participate, 26 for other reasons). Ultimately, 144 patients (mean baseline PANSS total estimated score 78.4 [SD 1.4]) were randomly assigned.

### Does switching antipsychotics ameliorate weight gain in patients with severe mental illness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113d24pr]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Obesity and adverse metabolic outcomes in patients with severe mental illness are clinically significant yet potentially preventable. The evidence regarding switching antipsychotics to reduce cardiometabolic burden remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate this.

- **Method**: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane were searched from inception to March 8, 2020. Articles reporting weight and metabolic changes after switching antipsychotics versus staying on the previous medication were meta-analyzed both across and within groups.

- **Results**: Of 61 identified studies, 59 were meta-analyzed, with 40% rated as high quality. In the switch-versus-stay pairwise meta-analyses, only aripiprazole significantly reduced weight (-5.52 kg, 95% CI -10.63, -0.42, P = .03), while olanzapine significantly increased weight (2.46 kg, 95% CI 0.34, 4.57, P = .02). Switching to aripiprazole also significantly improved fasting glucose (-3.99 mg/dl, 95% CI -7.34, -0.64, P = .02) and triglycerides (-31.03 mg/dl, 95% CI -48.73, -13.34, P = .0001). Dropout and psychosis ratings did not differ between switch and stay groups for aripiprazole and olanzapine. In before-to-after switch meta-analyses, aripiprazole (-1.96 kg, 95% CI -3.07, -0.85, P < .001) and ziprasidone (-2.22 kg, 95% CI -3.84, -0.60, P = .007) were associated with weight loss, whereas olanzapine (2.71 kg, 95% CI 1.87, 3.55, P < .001) and clozapine (2.80 kg, 95% CI 0.26, 5.34, P = .03) were associated with weight gain. No significant weight or other cardiometabolic changes were observed when switching to amisulpride, paliperidone/risperidone, quetiapine, or lurasidone.

### Antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114aki4D]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). High credibility.

Weight gain is among the most important side effects of antipsychotics. It is, however, unclear whether it is associated with antipsychotic doses. We aimed to fill this gap with a dose-response meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple electronic databases (last updated in June 2021) for all fixed-dose studies that investigated 16 second-generation antipsychotics and haloperidol in adults with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or with negative symptoms. We estimated the dose-response curves by conducting random-effects dose-response meta-analyses. We used the restricted cubic spline to model the dose-response relationship. The primary outcome was mean weight gain in kg from baseline to endpoint, while the secondary outcome was the number of patients with clinically important weight gain.

- **Findings**: Ninety-seven studies with 333 dose arms (36,326 participants) provided data for meta-analyses. Most studies were short-term, with a median duration of 6 weeks (range 4 to 26 weeks). In patients with acute exacerbation, amisulpride, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, haloperidol, lumateperone, and lurasidone produced mild weight gain in comparison to placebo (mean difference at any dose ≤ 1 kg), while more significant weight gain was observed with all other drugs. For most drugs, dose-response curves showed an initial dose-related increase in weight, which plateaued at higher doses. For others, there was no plateau and some even had bell-shaped curves, indicating lesser weight gain associated with higher doses.

### Abilify asimtufii [^112yUP2D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended. In one short-term, placebo-controlled trial involving adult patients with schizophrenia treated with Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing), the mean change in body weight at Week 12 was +3.5 kg in the Abilify Maintena-treated patients (N = 99) and +0.8 kg in the placebo-treated patients (N = 66).

- **Weight gain statistics**: During a 52-week, open-label bipolar I disorder study in patients who initiated Abilify Maintena, 1.8% discontinued the treatment due to weight increase. Abilify Maintena was associated with a mean increase from baseline in weight of 1.0 kg at Week 52. In this trial, 21.4% of patients demonstrated a ≥ 7% increase in body weight, while 15.4% demonstrated a ≥ 7% decrease in body weight.

- **Pathological gambling and other compulsive behaviors**: Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients may experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and an inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Less frequently reported compulsive urges include sexual urges, shopping, eating, or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. As patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, and other such behaviors.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^113koHv1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The weight gain in individuals who were initiated on a high dose of antipsychotics was greater than in those initiated on a low dose. When olanzapine was initiated at a high dose (> 5 mg), women gained +0.534 kg/week (+3.2 kg over 6 weeks), and men +0.743 kg/week (+4.5 kg over 6 weeks), compared with a low-dose gain of +0.314 kg/week (+1.9 kg over 6 weeks) for women and +0.425 kg/week (+2.6 kg over 6 weeks) for men.

The short-term effect of initiation of quetiapine was also stronger for those given high doses (> 75 mg), with women gaining +2.3 kg and men gaining +1.6 kg, both over 6 weeks, compared to low doses where women gained +0.7 kg and men +0.5 kg, both over 6 weeks. However, there was a relatively small difference for those initiated on risperidone, with low doses (≤ 2 mg) resulting in +1.0 kg over 6 weeks for both women and men, and high doses resulting in +1.1 kg for women and +1.9 kg for men, both over 6 weeks.

In the short-term, those given low doses of olanzapine tended to gain more weight as their weight at baseline was lower. There was a correlation between intercept and slope for women (−0.155, 95% CI: −0.230 to −0.078) and for men (−0.135, 95% CI: −0.235 to −0.033).

### A new genetic locus for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: A genome-wide study of first-episode psychosis patients using amisulpride (from the OPTiMiSE cohort) [^111DnuzE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The amount of weight gain during antipsychotic treatment is associated with the type of antipsychotic, pre-treatment body mass index (BMI), sex, symptom reduction, and age. Beside these variables, substantial interindividual differences in antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AiWG) hint at the involvement of genetic mechanisms in AiWG. A monozygotic twin study confirms this notion by showing a greater similarity of AiWG profiles in monozygotic twins compared to same-sex siblings, resulting in a very high estimated heritability (h²) of 0.8 for AiWG. Several studies have been conducted to discover and replicate genetic markers subtending AiWG. A few genetic loci have been associated with AiWG through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), with rs489693 nearby the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R) and rs10977144 on the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D gene (PTPRD) exceeding the genome-wide significance threshold. Although results on PTPRD were not replicated in European and Afro-American populations, these findings hint that GWAS is a powerful approach to disentangle genetic polymorphisms underlying AiWG. Understanding the genetics of AiWG carries the potential to predict the risk of AiWG before treatment inception in the future, ultimately promoting compliance and quality of life.

Importantly, all previous AiWG GWASs have been performed in subjects using a range of atypical agents (e.g. quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole), with most study populations comprising different patient subgroups (e.g. pediatric patients and non-medication naïve patients).

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^113iVRLy]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

In addition to addressing the key health questions, the guideline also includes essential prescribing information, such as common side effects and monitoring recommendations. The scope of this guideline is limited to the use of metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). However, the guideline development group recognizes the availability of more effective treatments for individuals living with overweight or obesity.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists have shown a larger effect size than metformin when treating overweight or obesity, including cases caused by antipsychotics (MD −6 kg; 95% CI, −10.8 kg to −1.36 kg). Failing to include this information could lead to hesitancy in effectively managing existing overweight or obesity in people living with severe mental illness (SMI). It is essential that these treatments be equally accessible to individuals with SMI as they are to the general population.

Therefore, the guideline includes a recommendation to initiate GLP-1 agonists in accordance with the licensed indication. This recommendation is supported by high-certainty evidence and is included in national obesity guidelines in Canada and Ireland. However, supply problems, cost, and prescribing restrictions in certain countries can create challenges in accessing these treatments. Consequently, the guideline also recommends starting metformin if access to GLP-1 agonists is problematic.

### Weight change with atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia [^115vtrnX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Weight gain is a common complication of antipsychotic treatment; its consequences include decreased self-esteem, reduced quality of life, reduced adherence with medication, and increased morbidity and mortality. Most studies that assess weight change are short-term. Among the atypicals, mean weight gain is greatest with olanzapine and clozapine, and least with aripiprazole and ziprasidone. Mean weight change obscures the marked individual variation in weight change that occurs during antipsychotic treatment; i.e. irrespective of the antipsychotic, some subjects lose weight, some maintain their weight, and some gain weight.

In several long-term naturalistic studies (> 6 months), mean weight gain is less marked than in randomized controlled trials of a shorter or comparable duration. This may reflect selective prescribing, the effect of weight management interventions, and differences in the statistical analysis employed. With most antipsychotics, weight stabilizes in the short to medium term, but with clozapine, it may continue beyond the first year. With some drugs, clinical improvement is associated with short-term weight gain.

Predictors of long-term weight gain include lower body mass index, increased appetite, and rapid initial weight increase. Weight gain is greater in first-onset patients due to the lack of prior antipsychotic exposure and associated weight gain. The potential for weight gain should be discussed with patients before starting antipsychotic treatment, and weight should be monitored regularly during treatment. It may be possible to predict weight gain before an antipsychotic is fully administered.

### Patient attitudes toward weight gain with medications [^114NGAGN]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine patient attitudes toward weight gain with medications under four conditions: medical vs. psychiatric and life-threatening vs. non-life-threatening.

In a suburban primary care practice, 241 patients completed surveys that explored these four study conditions and the amount of weight, ranging from 0 to 20 or more pounds, they were willing to gain on medication.

Participants were willing to gain an average of 5.51 lb for a non-life-threatening medical condition, 5.37 lb for a non-life-threatening psychiatric condition, 13.30 lb for a life-threatening medical condition, and 12.70 lb for a life-threatening psychiatric condition. Participants were willing to gain significantly more weight with a medical vs. psychiatric condition and with a life-threatening vs. non-life-threatening condition. There were no significant gender differences in responses.

There appear to be distinct patterns of acceptability of weight gain with medications. This information may enhance prescribers' ability to strategize medication compliance among patients.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^1146srg2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapine-treated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure of 6 weeks. Additionally, 22.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure to the event of 8 weeks. Furthermore, 4.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure to the event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2% of olanzapine-treated patients and in 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In long-term studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) with a median exposure of 573 days among 2021 subjects. The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32%, and 12%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

The data includes adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials, representing data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the specified durations. Dose group differences with respect to weight gain have been observed in a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study.

### Is clozapine-induced weight gain dose-dependent? Results from a prospective cohort study [^1168Khmo]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Low credibility.

The study examined whether clozapine-induced weight gain is dose-dependent. Table 1 compares clinical variables between patients whose total average dose during the follow-up was < 200 mg/day or ≥ 200 mg/day. Patients receiving higher doses were more likely to be smokers (P = .001), diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (P < .001), had a higher weight at baseline (P = .02), and were younger (P < .001). It was found that most adults (64.8%) taking doses ≥ 200 mg/day contrasted with older patients, who mainly took doses < 200 mg/day (60.7%).

- **Treatment duration and dose association**: Treatment duration and dose were significantly associated with weight change over one year, with a 0.50% increase in weight for each additional month (P < .001) and a 0.48% increase in weight for each 100 mg dose increase (P = .004).

- **Analysis using piecewise function**: Applying the piecewise function at a dose level of 200 mg/day, the weight increase for each additional 100 mg was +0.59% for doses ≥ 200 mg/day, such as dose increases from 300 to 400 mg/day (P = .001), and +1.12% for doses < 200 mg/day, such as dose increases from 20 to 120 mg/day (P = .003). Since rapid weight gain can occur in the first three months of treatment, the piecewise function was also applied to the treatment duration covariate at three months. The dose effects were evaluated before and after this cutoff.

- **Estimated weight increase**: The estimated weight increase for each additional month was +0.47% for treatment duration values greater than three months and +0.84% for treatment duration values up to three months (P < .001). The dose was significantly associated with weight change for treatment duration values.

### Weight gain as a prognostic indicator of therapeutic improvement during acute treatment of schizophrenia with placebo or active antipsychotic [^114ZzATs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent weight gain may be a general marker of therapeutic improvement, even when improvements occur in the absence of active antipsychotic treatment. The study investigates the association between treatment-emergent weight gain and therapeutic improvement across placebo and active treatments and examines the association between reported treatment-emergent weight changes and the treatments' reported efficacy.

Data from a randomized, double-blind trial comparing treatment of schizophrenia with placebo and olanzapine were used to correlate weight change and change in psychopathology. Additionally, effect sizes of the efficacy of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, and placebo (reported in meta-analytical reviews) were correlated with their reported weight changes. Weight gain significantly correlated with clinical improvements for placebo and olanzapine. The correlation between the treatments' efficacy and corresponding weight changes was high (r 0.88, p 0.05). Treatment-emergent weight gain appears to be an important marker of symptom reduction and may not be exclusively attributable to pharmacological perturbations.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^115YkHE1]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

- **Baseline subject characteristics**: Prior to and after 9 days of olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo administration.

- **Body weight, activity levels, hunger, and food intake**: Body weight was measured on the first (pre) and last day (post) of the study after subjects were administered either olanzapine (A), aripiprazole (B), or placebo (C) for 9 days. Activity levels were determined by the average number of steps taken during 5 days of free-living monitoring (solid bar) compared to 12 inpatient days (hatched bar). Hunger was assessed by summing numerical scores from hunger ratings throughout each inpatient day across the intervention arms: olanzapine (solid line, solid square), aripiprazole (dashed line, solid circle), and placebo (dotted line, solid triangle). Fewer hunger ratings were administered on test days (days 1–3 and 10–12), resulting in lower mean scores. Mean kilocalorie intake was measured ad libitum on day 2 before drug administration (solid bar) and on day 11, the 8th day of drug administration (hatched bar). No significant differences were found on any of these variables. Values are reported as means ± SEM, with n = 10 for each study arm.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^11591QNH]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) medications, which have revolutionized the treatment of mental illness, have become stigmatized by metabolic side effects, including obesity and diabetes. It remains controversial whether these defects are treatment-induced or disease-related. Although the mechanisms underlying these metabolic defects are not understood, it is assumed that the initiating pathophysiology is weight gain, secondary to centrally mediated increases in appetite.

To determine if AAPs have detrimental metabolic effects independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or a placebo for nine days to healthy subjects (n = 10 in each group) under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining activity levels. Prior to and after the interventions, we conducted a meal challenge and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.

We found that olanzapine, an AAP highly associated with weight gain, causes significant elevations in postprandial insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon coincident with insulin resistance compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, induces insulin resistance but has no effect on postprandial hormones. Importantly, the metabolic changes occur in the absence of weight gain, increases in food intake and hunger, or psychiatric disease, suggesting that AAPs exert direct effects on tissues independent of mechanisms regulating eating behavior.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^1174okBm]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

	- **Effect of AAP administration on body weight, food intake, and hunger**: The final number of participants was 30, consisting of 7 men and 3 women in each experimental condition. None of the subjects dropped out due to study-related adverse events. The primary side effect of olanzapine was drowsiness. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different among the groups prior to interventions. After olanzapine administration, no significant changes were observed in any variables except for an increase in fasting plasma insulin (P < 0.05). Aripiprazole had no effect on any variables, except for an increase in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo.

	- No significant weight change was observed after olanzapine (Fig. 1A) or aripiprazole (Fig. 1B) compared with placebo (Fig. 1C). However, a trend toward a decrease in weight was evident in the aripiprazole group (P < 0.08), resulting in a significant difference in weight change compared with olanzapine (P < 0.05).

	- Figure 1D illustrates the mean number of steps taken over 5 days prior to hospital admission compared with the mean number during the 12-day inpatient period. No differences were found, suggesting the study successfully maintained activity levels. Figure 1E shows the cumulative daily score of the hunger ratings (four per day except for metabolic testing days) over the course of the study. No significant differences in hunger ratings were found among the interventions.

	- **Ad libitum food intake**: Further details are required as this section seems incomplete.

### Lyrica [^115d798x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Weight gain**: LYRICA treatment may cause weight gain. In LYRICA controlled clinical trials involving adult patients for up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of LYRICA-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with LYRICA (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. LYRICA-associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of LYRICA-associated weight gain are unknown.

	- Among diabetic patients, LYRICA-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received LYRICA for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

	- While the effects of LYRICA-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open-label clinical trials with diabetic patients, LYRICA treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

- **Tumorigenic potential**: In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of LYRICA, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology].

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^1116VLwn]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

We demonstrate that short-term administration of the antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and aripiprazole induces insulin resistance in healthy subjects. However, only olanzapine leads to significant changes in postprandial metabolism following a mixed-meal challenge. Olanzapine was observed to cause hyperinsulinemia, acute increases in postprandial GLP-1, and small elevations in glucagon concentrations. This rapidly induced metabolic dysregulation occurs without weight gain or psychiatric disease and is independent of changes in hunger or food intake, as indicated by our behavioral and metabolic data. These results confirm that olanzapine directly affects insulin-sensitive tissues and suggest that the mechanisms regulating the increase in food intake may differ from those mediating the metabolic abnormalities.

Unique to the study is the use of the mixed-nutrient meal challenge to reveal olanzapine-induced changes in postprandial responses. One notable finding is the magnitude and consistency of postprandial hyperinsulinemia. Nine out of ten subjects exhibited an increase in postprandial insulin AUC compared with baseline, with six out of ten subjects doubling their insulin response. Although olanzapine-induced increases in postprandial insulin have not previously been documented, past investigations have been limited by insufficient postmeal sampling frequency or a lack of use of a mixed-nutrient stimulus.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^113r8Gz8]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, we have demonstrated that olanzapine induces insulin resistance and postprandial metabolic dysregulation in response to the real-life stimulus of meal ingestion. Postprandial hyperinsulinemia may be one of the early precipitating factors in the pathophysiology of olanzapine administration contributing to fat deposition. We have also shown that aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic (AAP) considered metabolically sparing, has modest effects on insulin sensitivity. These data suggest direct and differential effects of the AAPs on insulin-sensitive tissues in the absence of psychiatric disease, weight gain, or increases in hunger. The rapidly induced metabolic impairments are likely mediated by mechanisms separate from those regulating food intake as we did not observe increases in food intake, hunger, or the hunger-related hormone ghrelin.

With longer olanzapine administration, AAP-induced central nervous system effects would likely mediate the increased food intake necessary for the known weight gain, and this would then exacerbate the metabolic effects reported here. Our findings suggest that interventions inhibiting weight gain in AAP-treated patients may be only partially effective in preventing metabolic disease since the drugs are exerting direct effects on tissue function. Developing AAPs without the debilitating metabolic side effects will depend on the individual contribution of the different neurotransmitters and also on the complex interaction between the peripheral and central nervous system and their effects on behavior and metabolism.

### Weight gain and antipsychotic medication: Differences between antipsychotic-free and treatment periods [^111GmLyE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective analysis of data involving 121 inpatients to examine the rate of weight gain during antipsychotic-free periods and during treatment with various antipsychotic drugs.

- **Method**: Data were analyzed to determine differences in weekly weight change during antipsychotic-free (N = 65), typical antipsychotic (N = 51), or atypical antipsychotic (N = 130) treatment periods. Atypical antipsychotic treatment periods were further subdivided into olanzapine (N = 45), clozapine (N = 47), or risperidone (N = 36) treatment periods. A paired comparison was conducted on 65 patients who had an antipsychotic-free treatment period preceding or following a neuroleptic drug treatment period. In addition, patients were classified as either non-obese or obese (with a body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30.0 kg/m²) to test whether the rate of weight gain during treatment periods was related to initial BMI.

- **Results**: Across all treatment periods, weekly weight gain was as follows: 0.89 lb/wk (0.40 kg/wk) on atypical antipsychotic medication, 0.61 lb/wk (0.27 kg/wk) on typical antipsychotic medication, and 0.21 lb/wk (0.09 kg/wk) on no antipsychotic medications. The atypical antipsychotic versus antipsychotic-free comparison was significant (F = 3.51; df = 2,231; p = .031), while the typical antipsychotic versus antipsychotic-free comparison was not significant. Among the individual atypical antipsychotic medications, significantly more weight gain occurred during olanzapine treatment (1.70 lb/wk [0.76 kg/wk]) than with either clozapine (0.50 lb/wk [0.22 kg/wk]).

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^116fjjWG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Cumulative weight gain in the long term was particularly high in patients prescribed olanzapine. However, for any drug, people did not, on average, lose the extra weight they gained during the short term. For example, after four years from the first olanzapine prescription, a typical woman gained 2.3 kg (short term, 95% CI: 1.9–2.7 kg) + 2.8 kg (long term, 95% CI: 2.2–3.5 kg) = 5.1 kg (total), whereas a typical man gained 3.4 kg (short term, 95% CI: 3.0–3.8 kg) + 1.7 kg (long term, 95% CI: 0.9–2.4 kg) = 5.1 kg (total) of antipsychotic-induced extra weight.

The prescribed dose of olanzapine was also critical, particularly for women in the long term. For example, given a low dose (5 mg), women gained 3.2 kg + 2.9 kg = 6.1 kg. A similar impact of higher doses was observed for quetiapine and risperidone.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotic treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^113x1BJB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Our study does have a number of potential limitations. Information on possible time-varying confounders, such as symptom levels or illness severity, was not included. However, it is reasonable to assume limited variation from patients' baseline values for unmeasured confounders. Treatment initiation has been defined using the first prescription date in general practice. For some individuals, the first prescription date might occur while they are under the care of secondary care mental services (these data are not recorded in primary care). It is most likely these patients have a first prescription date very close to the one in primary care. Thus, no major impact on estimates is expected.

We did not control for drugs prescribed to reduce antipsychotic-induced weight gain or for multiple prescriptions of other drugs that could potentially affect weight as well. However, we know that drugs prescribed for ameliorating weight gain would only reduce the estimate of the real weight gain of the target population. Thus, we are not overestimating the weight gain effect. We did not assess weight gain associated with other antipsychotic medications, as there were not enough data on them. However, the three drugs included in this study are the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medications in the UK and have previously been associated with weight gain. The weight gain trajectories we described are averages, so they should be interpreted as typical patient trajectories. In practice, individual patients' weight gain will vary from these average trajectories.

### Centrally-acting opioid receptor antagonists as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trial data [^115kesfS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

Our findings indicate that olanzapine/samidorphan partially mitigates AIWG when compared against olanzapine. We did not find any effect of naltrexone alone or in combination with bupropion on AIWG.

The effect on reducing weight gain appears smaller than comparable treatment options, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and metformin, at face value. However, this difference may be related to study design factors, and direct head-to-head trials would be beneficial.

Overall, our findings potentially point to CORA only having a narrow use case in AIWG in the presence of other available options. While treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists and metformin may be better established, the former is administered by injection, and both are medication groups not typically prescribed by psychiatrists. Instead, they typically fall into the domain of endocrinologists and general practitioners, who prescribe them for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This may limit access to those medications without the involvement of the appropriate specialists.

Furthermore, there is developing concern regarding the development of suicidal ideation among patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists; though such links remain unproven, with surveillance remaining ongoing. Aripiprazole — whether as adjunct or in place of the patient's regular antipsychotic — is another option described in guidelines by the British Association of Psychopharmacology, Maudsley,… However, this may involve either reducing/discontinuing the patient's regular antipsychotic or exposing the patient to high comb.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^116tYHMB]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

By administering the drugs to healthy volunteers, researchers can determine whether metabolic effects are independent of disease. A handful of studies have used this approach, reporting either no effect or decreases in insulin sensitivity in the presence of modest weight gain after short-term administration (10–15 days) of olanzapine compared with other atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) or placebo. Weight-independent effects in control subjects have only been reported in two studies, with olanzapine decreasing insulin sensitivity and increasing fasting glucose and leptin after an oral glucose tolerance test. Furthermore, the effects of AAPs on hormonal responses to the "real-world" stimulus of a mixed-nutrient meal challenge have not been thoroughly investigated, and no study has been conducted in an in-patient setting where activity is controlled.

We hypothesized that meal ingestion, which elicits both neural and incretin-mediated hormonal responses, would be more likely to reveal olanzapine-induced changes in meal-related metabolism compared to traditional measurements used to assess insulin secretion and sensitivity, typically involving intravenous glucose administration and bypassing the activation of the brain-gut-pancreas axis. We also expected that detrimental effects on metabolism would be specific to olanzapine and that a comparator AAP, such as aripiprazole, would not differ from placebo. To address these hypotheses, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo for 9 days to healthy subjects under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining their activity levels.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^115B2M6t]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Previous studies have suggested that olanzapine is associated with significant short-term weight gain, whereas risperidone and quetiapine have a moderate effect on weight. In the long term, contrary to one previous finding, we observed that weight gain did not stabilize during the four years of follow-up. However, our finding of the long-term effect of weight gain is consistent with previous studies; we are able to quantify the effect more accurately.

Previous research has indicated that women's weight is more affected by antipsychotic exposure. However, we found that only olanzapine (in the long term) and quetiapine (in both the long and short term) induced more weight gain in women. Since our study population comprises both naïve and re-antipsychotic consumers, short- and long-term weight gain in olanzapine-naïve individuals and long-term weight gain in risperidone-naïve individuals may be higher than the weight gain reported by us. Risperidone seemed to be associated with greater weight gain in men than in women in both the short and long term, and men prescribed olanzapine gained more weight in the short term.

Regarding dosage, one recent study reanalyzed the results of 14 clinical trials to explore variations in weight gain across doses of olanzapine and risperidone. Their conclusions regarding olanzapine are consistent with our results, showing that the excess risk of at least 7% weight gain is 16.1% for low doses (0–10 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose) and 46.8% for high doses (0–20 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose). They could not be conclusive about the effects of risperidone.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^1161WBy2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Baseline characteristics of patients from olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone cohorts were stratified by sex. From height onwards, some continuous variables changed their scale as labeled below their names.

In both the short term (< 6 weeks) and long term (≥ 6 weeks to ≤ 4 years), individuals treated with any of the three antipsychotic drugs gained weight, especially those prescribed olanzapine. Pre-treatment weight change was negligible for quetiapine (in both women and men) and risperidone (men only) cohorts, and slightly negative for the other cohorts.

In the short term after olanzapine initiation:

- **Men's weight**: Increased by 0.569 kg/week (3.4 kg over the first six weeks).
- **Women's weight**: Increased by 0.382 kg/week (2.3 kg over the first six weeks).

Individuals initiated on quetiapine and risperidone also gained weight shortly after the initiation of treatment, but to a lesser extent. Figures and tables referenced (Tables 1, Figure 2) illustrate weight trends.

In the long term, individuals continued to gain weight, though at a slower rate than during the first six weeks. For example, for women initiated on olanzapine:

- **Long-term weight gain**: Estimated at 0.014 kg/week (0.7 kg per year).

Women initiated on olanzapine were generally slightly lighter (69.7 kg) than those initiated on risperidone (73.3 kg) and quetiapine (70.1 kg), whereas there was little baseline weight difference among men. Women with lower weight before starting olanzapine gained more weight in the short term compared to women with higher initial weights, correlating with the relationship between intercept and slope.

### ZyprexaRelprevv [^115L5zrQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Olanzapine monotherapy in adults - In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapine-treated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure of 6 weeks. Notably, 22.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. The median exposure to this event was 8 weeks. Furthermore, 4.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure to this event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline body mass index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2% of olanzapine-treated patients, while no placebo-treated patients discontinued for this reason.

In long-term studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb), with a median exposure of 573 days (N = 2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32%, and 12%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^1146EHFC]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, more specifically related to the management of drug side effects, AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with medium-risk antipsychotics (quetiapine, paliperidone, or risperidone) to prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain in patients with cardiometabolic risk factors or aged 10–25 years.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^117T8nRh]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) medications, which have revolutionized the treatment of mental illness, have become stigmatized due to metabolic side effects, including obesity and diabetes. There is ongoing controversy over whether these defects are treatment-induced or disease-related. Although the mechanisms behind these metabolic defects are not well understood, it is assumed that the initiating pathophysiology is weight gain, secondary to centrally mediated increases in appetite.

To determine if AAPs have detrimental metabolic effects independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo for 9 days to healthy subjects (n = 10, each group) under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining activity levels. Prior to and after the interventions, we conducted a meal challenge and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.

We found that olanzapine, an AAP highly associated with weight gain, causes significant elevations in postprandial insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon coincident with insulin resistance compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, induces insulin resistance but has no effect on postprandial hormones. Importantly, the metabolic changes occur in the absence of weight gain, increases in food intake and hunger, or psychiatric disease, suggesting that AAPs exert direct effects on tissues independent of the mechanisms regulating eating behavior.

### Weight gain changes in patients with aripiprazole monotherapy compared with aripiprazole-antidepressant polypharmacy in an outpatient sample [^113wfd1U]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

This study seeks to evaluate the weight gain effect within a community-based population of patients with diagnoses of depression, mood disorder, and schizophrenia receiving aripiprazole over a period of at least six months.

The four million members of Kaiser Permanente of Southern California (KPSC) were queried for a four-year period between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013. The initial cohort comprised 25,682 KPSC members who received at least one dispense of aripiprazole. This initial cohort was split into those who received aripiprazole as a monotherapy ("Alone" group) and those who were given aripiprazole as part of a combination therapy. The group of patients that received aripiprazole and an antidepressant with high serotonin reuptake inhibition was called the "High" group, while the group receiving the aripiprazole and bupropion combination was called the "Low" serotonin group. We compared the primary endpoint of mean percent weight change from baseline after 180 days of continuous treatment between the three groups. Three pairwise comparisons were made: High versus Alone, Low versus Alone, and Low versus High, using adjusted and unadjusted linear regression models.

Within this population, patients on aripiprazole monotherapy showed statistically significant weight gain in all three groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference in weight gain between the aripiprazole monotherapy, the high serotonergic combination group, and the low serotonergic combination group. This finding applied even within the subset of patients.

### Lyrica CR [^111zvqJ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lyrica CR treatment may cause weight gain. In LYRICA CR controlled trials for pain indications, weight gain was experienced by 4% of LYRICA CR-treated patients during the single-blind phase. Adverse events of weight gain were observed in 3.7% of LYRICA CR-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients during the double-blind phase.

In LYRICA controlled clinical trials of up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of LYRICA-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with LYRICA (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. In studies with LYRICA, associated weight gain was related to pregabalin dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies with LYRICA, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, LYRICA-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received LYRICA for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open-label clinical trials with diabetic patients, further evaluation is warranted.

### Lyrica [^117Se7eQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Weight gain**: Lyrica treatment may cause weight gain. In Lyrica-controlled clinical trials in adult patients lasting up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of Lyrica-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with Lyrica (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. Lyrica-associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not seem to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

	- Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of Lyrica-associated weight gain are unknown. Among diabetic patients, Lyrica-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg) compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received Lyrica for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

	- While the effects of Lyrica-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open-label clinical trials with diabetic patients, Lyrica treatment did not appear to be associated with a loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

- **Tumorigenic potential**: In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of Lyrica, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

### Risperdal [^116MPJ9X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain has been observed in children and adolescents during treatment with Risperdal. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended during treatment. Data derive from short-term placebo-controlled trials and longer-term uncontrolled studies in pediatric patients (ages 5 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autistic disorder, or other psychiatric disorders. In the short-term trials (3 to 8 weeks), the mean weight gain for Risperdal-treated patients was 2 kg, compared to 0.6 kg for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, approximately 33% of the Risperdal group had weight gain ≥ 7%, compared to 7% in the placebo group. In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label pediatric studies, the mean weight gain was 5.5 kg at Week 24 and 8 kg at Week 48 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Somnolence**: Somnolence was frequently observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials of pediatric patients with autistic disorder. Most cases were mild or moderate in severity. These events were most often of early onset with peak incidence occurring during the first two weeks of treatment, and transient with a median duration of 16 days. Somnolence was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in the clinical trial of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, as well as in the schizophrenia trials in adolescents. As was seen in the autistic disorder trials, these adverse reactions were most often of early onset and transient in duration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)].

### Weight gain in antipsychotic-naive patients: A review and meta-analysis [^1163Tura]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Weight gain is a long-recognized side-effect of antipsychotic (AP) drugs and a major health concern in the treatment of psychosis. The strength of the causal relationship between AP drug exposure and weight gain can only be gauged by drug trials conducted on AP-naive patients.

- **Method**: We conducted a review of the literature regarding the amount of weight gain induced by APs in AP-naive patients and carried out a meta-analysis of mean weight gains.

- **Results**: We found 11 primary studies reporting the effects of APs on body weight or body mass index (BMI) in AP-naive patients. The mean body weight and BMI gains in AP-naive patients were highly significant from the first weeks of treatment. When we limited the analysis to studies conducted on patients hospitalized and without any adjunctive treatment potentially affecting weight, the resultant sample showed less heterogeneity and confirmed the final picture of weight gain at around 3.8 kg and 1.2 points BMI.

- **Conclusions**: Weight gain associated with AP therapy in AP-naive patients occurs rapidly in the first few weeks and continues during the following months. Clinicians should be aware of the high probability of causing weight gain in AP-naive patients and should strictly monitor such patients.

### Exploring weight gain in year before treatment for binge eating disorder: A different context for interpreting limited weight losses in treatment studies [^115fe9rC]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine weight changes in obese patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) during the year before seeking treatment and to explore correlates of weight changes.

Seventy-eight consecutive, treatment-seeking, obese BED patients were assessed with structured interviews and self-report questionnaires. Overall, participants reported a mean weight gain of 15.1 pounds during the 12 months before treatment. This overall weight gain comprised remarkable heterogeneity, ranging from a 30-pound loss to a 53-pound gain. The subgroup of participants who reported gaining weight (76% of the sample) reported gaining an average of 22.2 pounds during the 12 months before treatment. Weight change was associated with significantly more frequent binge eating and overeating during breakfasts.

Treatment-seeking obese patients with BED reported having gained substantial amounts of weight during the previous year. These findings provide an important context for interpreting the modest weight losses typically reported by treatment studies of BED.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^113pGaeW]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Study design and experimental procedures: Subjects were admitted into CTRC for 12 nights and randomly assigned to one of three arms. Subjects and study personnel were blinded as to the assignment. Vital signs and weight were measured daily prior to breakfast, and subjects were supervised on a daily walk to maintain activity levels. Subjects ate ad libitum throughout the inpatient stay. Visual analog scales for ratings of hunger and satiety were given daily before and after each meal and snack. Subjects received daily symptom questionnaires to evaluate side effects of drug administration.

- **Meal challenge and monitoring**: On days 1 and 3, following the administration of a standardized meal the evening before an overnight fast, subjects underwent either a meal challenge or a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in a randomized order. On day 2, unknown to the subjects, food intake was monitored. Food items selected from the metabolic kitchen menu were provided in excess and weighed before and after each meal.

- **Drug administration**: On days 4 and 5, subjects were given 5 mg of the drug or placebo in the morning to determine drug tolerability. On days 6–12, subjects were administered 10 mg of olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo each evening until the end of the study. On days 10 and 12, the metabolic challenges were repeated, and food intake was monitored on day 11. Upon discharge, subjects were given 5 mg of the drug to take for the next two evenings, followed by follow-up calls to ensure no adverse effects.

### Review of atypical antipsychotics and weight gain [^117JG9XR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Prescribing an antipsychotic for a patient with schizophrenia requires a careful risk-benefit analysis. Recently, weight gain has become a significant concern due to reports that two atypical antipsychotic agents, clozapine and olanzapine, are associated with a higher risk of causing excessive weight gain than other drugs. Some degree of weight gain may occur with any atypical antipsychotic agent, particularly early in treatment.

A more important consideration is the long-term effects of these agents on body weight, as many patients require chronic therapy. This is crucial because weight gain is an adverse effect linked to non-compliance and medical issues. In this article, recent reports on the weight effects of different atypical antipsychotic drugs are reviewed.

To accurately understand the impact of atypical antipsychotic agents, data analyses should include both short-term and long-term findings, the relationship of changes in body weight to pretreatment body mass index (BMI), the relationship to dose, both intent-to-treat and complete analyses, and the presentation of both mean and median changes in weight. It is also important to know the study setting, as institutionalized patients may be less likely to exhibit weight increases. Such comprehensive information and multidimensional analysis would minimize confusion about the true nature of a drug's impact on body weight.

### Substantial weight gains are common prior to treatment-seeking in obese patients with binge eating disorder [^116ZcK8p]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

This study examined weight trajectories in obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED) during the year prior to treatment initiation and explored potential correlates of these weight changes. One hundred thirty (N = 130) consecutive, treatment-seeking, obese patients with BED were assessed with structured interviews and self-report questionnaires. Eighty-three percent (83%; n = 108) of these patients gained weight, and 65% (n = 84) gained a clinically significant amount of weight (greater than or equal to 5% body weight) in the year preceding treatment.

Overall, participants reported a mean weight gain of 8% (16.6 pounds) during the 12 months prior to treatment, with a wide range of weight changes across participants (from a 52% weight gain to a 13% weight loss).

- **High weight gainers**: Defined as gaining more than 10% of body weight during the previous year, 35% of patients reported gaining an average of 16.7% of body weight.

- **Low weight gainers**: Defined as gaining greater than 5% but less than 10%, these comprised 29% of the sample, characterized by a mean gain of 6.9% of body weight.

- **Weight maintainers/losers**: Defined as having maintained or lost weight during the 12 months prior to treatment, comprising 17% of the sample, these patients reported losing on average 2.8% of body weight.

These three groups did not differ significantly in their weight and eating behaviors or eating disorder psychopathology. The majority of treatment-seeking obese patients with BED reported having gained substantial amounts of weight.

### A new genetic locus for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: A genome-wide study of first-episode psychosis patients using amisulpride (from the OPTiMiSE cohort) [^1152X9u2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Boxplot of weight gain in kilograms (kg) per rs78310016 genotype is presented in Figure 3. Due to the underrepresentation of the GG genotype (n = 1), it was merged with the AG genotype (n = 27). G-allele carriers (n = 28) gained on average 5.04 kg (SD = 3.76) compared to the non-carrier group (n = 178), which gained 2.56 kg (SD = 3.39) (F ANOVA = 12.49, p = 5.06 × 10^-4).

G-allele carriers gained on average twice as much weight after one month of amisulpride treatment compared to non-carriers: 5.04 kg (SD = 3.76, n = 28) versus 2.56 kg (SD = 3.39, n = 178) (F ANOVA = 12.49, p = 5.06 × 10^-4). Moreover, G-allele carriers had an odds ratio (OR) of 3.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.75–9.06, p = 1.0 × 10^-3) for clinically meaningful antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AiWG) greater than 7%. The number of G-carriers (n = 28) transitioning from normal BMI to overweight was 14.3%, while in the non-G-carriers (n = 178) group, it was 5.1% (n = 9). G-carriers had an OR of 3.13 (95% CI = 0.89–10.96) for shifting from normal to overweight compared to non-carriers. No baseline characteristics group differences were observed between rs78310016 risk allele carriers (i.e. one or more G alleles) and non-carriers.

### Weight effects associated with antipsychotics: A comprehensive database analysis [^117PrdLg]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

Available data on atypical antipsychotic-induced weight gain are limited by a number of methodological factors. The objective of this report is to evaluate short-term (N = 1742) and long-term (N = 1649) weight effects in patients receiving standard doses of amisulpride, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, and placebo based on 21 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies from an integrated clinical trial database.

- **Method**: Analyses of the integrated ziprasidone schizophrenia trials database were performed to estimate the weighted average of weight change and the percentage of subjects experiencing weight gain (or weight loss) across studies for each agent studied, based on fixed- and random-effects models. Durations of treatment exposure in long-term trials were controlled by well-defined time windows (6 months: 150 to 210 days; 1 year: 330 to 390 days). Weight gain or loss was defined using a 7% change from baseline threshold.

- **Results**: During long-term therapy with 1-year treatment duration, the incidence of weight gain for subjects treated with ziprasidone (17%) was not significantly different from the placebo (13%) or haloperidol (41%) groups based on a 95% confidence interval. In contrast, a significantly greater weight gain incidence was observed for the olanzapine (57%) and risperidone (39%) groups compared to placebo. Median weight change of +0.49, -0.18, +1.50, and +0.55 lb/month was observed for haloperidol, ziprasidone, olanzapine, and risperidone subjects, respectively, indicating differential weight change patterns compared to placebo.

### Weight gain in smokers after quitting cigarettes: Meta-analysis [^111whjoj]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Most trials aimed at preventing weight gain typically enrolled women concerned about their weight but did not provide clear evidence that this group was at risk of greater weight gain. This result might seem surprising, as people concerned about weight may have experienced excessive weight gain in previous quit attempts. Excessive gain is associated with greater weight gain in a quit attempt. However, the association between weight concerns and weight gain after cessation is unclear. Furthermore, nearly all such trials recruited exclusively women, whereas trials targeting the general population included both sexes. Consequently, the data were inevitably confounded and not precise enough to exclude a difference between populations concerned about weight and those not specifically concerned about weight gain.

Our estimates provided the difference between starting weight and weight up to one year later. The mean weight of a population is likely to increase over one year independently of a smoking cessation attempt. The Lung Health Study showed that continuing smokers gain an average of 0.3 kg per year for men and 0.5 kg per year for women. Another study estimated a gain of about 0.3 kg per year for both sexes, indicating that roughly 4.3 kg of the mean weight gain at 12 months in our analysis was due to cessation.
