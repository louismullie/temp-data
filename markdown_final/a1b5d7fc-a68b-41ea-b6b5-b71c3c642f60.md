## Question

Bilateral joint pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate bilateral joint pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage and red flags. Then, I should characterize the pain phenotype and pattern. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis by inflammatory versus noninflammatory and symmetric versus asymmetric patterns. After that, I need to outline targeted diagnostic testing, including labs and imaging. Then, I will consider special populations and mimics. Finally, I will synthesize a management framework and highlight pitfalls and pearls, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and guidelines where possible.

> Let me first confirm the immediate safety issues and red flags because bilateral joint pain can occasionally herald systemic infection, malignancy, or catastrophic bone disease. I need to check for fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, unremitting pain, inability to bear weight, or neurologic deficits, and I should not delay urgent workup if any are present, as these features push me toward septic arthritis, malignancy, or acute spinal pathology that require expedited imaging and specialty input [^1124uUZ4] [^11263BfY].

> Next, I should review the pain phenotype carefully. I need to ask about symmetry, number of joints, morning stiffness duration, inflammatory features like warmth and swelling, onset and tempo, and whether pain is axial versus appendicular, because symmetric bilateral pain with prolonged morning stiffness suggests inflammatory arthritis, whereas symmetric bilateral pain without inflammatory signs and brief stiffness points toward osteoarthritis, and axial pain with bilateral buttock or low back features may implicate sacroiliac or facet sources [^1124uUZ4] [^111v6fgu] [^111L8CGt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the differential diagnosis systematically, starting with noninflammatory causes such as osteoarthritis, which is common and often bilateral in knees and hands, and can be asymmetric in hips, and I must remember that OA pain mechanisms are complex and not solely driven by cartilage, with synovitis and bone marrow lesions contributing and central sensitization variably present, which can blur phenotype boundaries [^114off2h] [^115VKbRK] [^114P7xfi].

> I will now examine inflammatory etiologies. Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with symmetric bilateral small joint involvement and prolonged morning stiffness, whereas polymyalgia rheumatica in adults over 50 manifests with bilateral shoulder and pelvic girdle pain and stiffness with elevated ESR/CRP and a dramatic glucocorticoid response, and I should double-check that I am not conflating early seronegative RA with PMR, as both can present with proximal girdle pain but synovitis and small joint disease favor RA [^1124uUZ4] [^113SU3FH] [^113NBoSM].

> But wait, what if the pattern is axial and bilateral? Facet joint pain is frequently bilateral and multilevel, and diagnosis relies on controlled diagnostic blocks rather than imaging or exam alone, while sacroiliac joint pain is often unilateral but can be bilateral and is suggested by three or more positive provocative tests and confirmed by at least 75% pain relief with image-guided intraarticular injection, so I should confirm these with appropriately performed blocks before labeling them as pain generators [^111e3MJQ] [^1163Hizf] [^111L8CGt].

> Let me consider crystal and infectious arthropathies. Gout and CPPD can be polyarticular and bilateral, and although axial involvement is less common, spinal gout and pseudogout of facet joints do occur, so I should keep a high index of suspicion when imaging shows erosive or calcific changes, and I must not forget that septic arthritis can rarely be bilateral, particularly in shoulders, where early arthrocentesis is critical to avoid joint destruction [^112KmsjV] [^111ExioL] [^116yt2gs].

> I need to ensure I account for biomechanical and neurogenic contributors. Chronic knee pain increases the risk of bilateral shoulder pain over time, plausibly mediated by leg weakness and altered loading, and bilateral widespread pain sensitivity can accompany unilateral focal pathology such as carpal tunnel syndrome, reflecting central sensitization, so I should assess for weakness, gait asymmetry, and neuropathic features when the clinical picture seems discordant with local anatomy [^113vy9Db] [^115TXXCs].

> Next, I should review targeted diagnostic testing. Basic labs such as ESR and CRP help screen for inflammation, RF and anti-CCP support RA, and uric acid supports gout but does not exclude it, while synovial fluid analysis is mandatory when infection or crystal disease is suspected, and for imaging, conventional radiographs are first-line for suspected OA or RA, ultrasound can detect synovitis and guide aspiration, and MRI is preferred for early inflammatory arthritis, suspected osteonecrosis, or when red flags are present [^1124uUZ4] [^111v6fgu] [^1141uHVS].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and mimics. In children, bilateral joint pain mandates evaluation for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other rheumatologic diseases, and TMJ arthritis in JIA is often silent on exam, requiring MRI for detection, whereas in older adults, adhesive capsulitis can be bilateral and is associated with diabetes, and medication-induced bone pain or atypical femur fractures from bisphosphonates can present with bilateral thigh or groin pain, so medication reconciliation and targeted imaging are essential [^1163gY3g] [^111iooTm] [^11149ejf].

> I will now examine the management framework. For suspected OA, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically, initiate core treatments such as weight loss, exercise, and NSAIDs per VA/DoD guidance, and escalate to intraarticular corticosteroids or consider joint replacement if refractory, whereas for suspected inflammatory arthritis, I should refer urgently to rheumatology, start DMARDs if RA is confirmed, and treat PMR with low-dose glucocorticoids while monitoring for relapse and giant cell arteritis, and for facet or SIJ pain, I should confirm with controlled blocks before proceeding to radiofrequency ablation or SIJ fusion, recognizing that sham-controlled data have challenged the efficacy of SIJ fusion [^114off2h] [^113SU3FH] [^114qLZdU] [^117QSsdV].

> Wait, let me verify a few pitfalls. Relying on MRI to diagnose facet pain is a mistake because imaging correlates poorly with pain generators, and assuming unilateral symptoms imply unilateral pathology can be misleading since bilateral MRI abnormalities are common even in patients with unilateral shoulder or knee pain, so I should anchor diagnosis in clinical phenotype and, when appropriate, confirm with diagnostic blocks rather than imaging alone [^114qLZdU] [^115ociuN] [^116yBSSW].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure coherence. Bilateral joint pain requires a structured, reference-aware pathway that starts with red flags, then maps the pain phenotype, then prioritizes the differential by inflammatory status and symmetry, then deploys targeted labs, synovial fluid analysis, and imaging, and finally tailors management to the confirmed etiology while avoiding premature closure, and I should double-check at each step that my conclusions are supported by the clinical pattern and the best available evidence [^1124uUZ4] [^111v6fgu].

Bilateral joint pain most often reflects **symmetric inflammatory arthritis** (RA, SLE, psoriatic arthritis) [^111v6fgu] or **degenerative disease** (OA, facet arthropathy) [^114off2h] [^114qLZdU], but it can also signal systemic disease (PMR, fibromyalgia, gout, infection) or biomechanical overload [^113SU3FH] [^113vy9Db]. A **focused history and exam** — including pattern, morning stiffness, systemic features, and risk factors — guides the differential [^111v6fgu]. Initial labs (ESR/CRP, RF/anti-CCP, uric acid, CBC) and imaging (plain radiographs, ultrasound/MRI as indicated) help confirm the diagnosis and direct management [^1141uHVS] [^1124uUZ4]. Red flags (fever, rapid swelling, neurologic deficits) require urgent evaluation for infection or malignancy [^11263BfY].

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical history and physical examination

- **Onset and duration**: Acute vs chronic; symmetric vs asymmetric [^114pobUv].
- **Morning stiffness**: Duration (> 1 hour suggests inflammatory arthritis) [^notfound].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, fatigue, skin rash [^113SU3FH].
- **Risk factors**: Age, obesity, occupational/repetitive stress, family history [^114off2h].
- **Physical exam**: Joint swelling, warmth, erythema, deformity, range of motion, gait analysis [^111v6fgu].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Inflammatory markers**: ESR, CRP [^11263BfY].
- **Autoimmune serology**: RF, anti-CCP, ANA [^11263BfY].
- **Uric acid**: Suspected gout [^notfound].
- **CBC**: Anemia of chronic disease, infection [^notfound].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging should be tailored to the suspected diagnosis: **plain radiography** is first-line for OA and inflammatory arthritis [^1124uUZ4]; **ultrasound** detects synovitis and erosions in early inflammatory arthritis [^notfound]; and **MRI** characterizes soft tissue, bone marrow lesions, and early inflammatory changes [^111aBpdr].

---

## Management strategies

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **physical therapy** to improve joint function, strength, and flexibility [^114off2h]; **weight loss** to reduce joint load, particularly in OA and obesity-related pain [^117Lky79]; and **patient education** on joint protection, activity modification, and self-management [^111v6fgu].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for pain and inflammation [^notfound].
- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen for mild pain [^notfound].
- **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**: Methotrexate, leflunomide for RA and other inflammatory arthritis [^notfound].
- **Biologic agents**: TNF inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors for refractory inflammatory arthritis [^notfound].
- **Corticosteroids**: Short-term for flares; intra-articular injections for localized inflammation [^111e3MJQ].

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgical options include **joint replacement** for advanced OA or refractory inflammatory arthritis [^114off2h] and **arthroscopy** for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in selected cases [^1141N7uT].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by underlying cause, disease severity, and treatment response; **chronic pain and disability** are common in OA and inflammatory arthritis [^114off2h] [^1174zNze]. Complications include **joint deformity, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life** [^111v6fgu].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate attention

- **Fever, chills, or systemic illness**: Suspect infection or malignancy [^11263BfY].
- **Rapid joint swelling or severe pain**: Suspect septic arthritis or acute gout [^notfound].
- **Neurologic deficits**: Suspect spinal cord compression or nerve root involvement [^notfound].

---

Bilateral joint pain spans inflammatory, degenerative, systemic, and biomechanical etiologies. A **structured approach** — history, exam, labs, and imaging — enables accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy, with management combining non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies and surgery reserved for refractory cases [^1124uUZ4].

Facet joint pain — history, physical examination, and imaging are used to screen and inform testing, but clinical criteria have limited diagnostic accuracy. Many researchers have attempted to develop a series of diagnostic clinical criteria to establish the diagnosis of facet joint pain as cause of axial spinal pain, including unilateral or bilateral axial spinal pain associations, pseudoradicular pain, morning stiffness, pain on extension and rotation, negative neurological examination, and normal gait; however, the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria are very low. Even then, history and physical examination continue to be the fundamental for screening patients with low back pain, even though they cannot establish facet joint diagnosis as the specific cause of the pain, but provide suspicion of the diagnosis. Imaging is not very useful in identifying facet pain; however, imaging is necessary and useful in identifying red flags, disc herniation, and discogenic pain. A systematic review and pilot study to create a clinical diagnosis scale included 6 phases, utilizing a total of 36 signs and symptoms, and a total of 12, with 8 symptoms and 4 signs were included in the final survey.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaChronic extremity joint pain-suspected inflammatory arthritis [^1141uHVS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Evaluation for suspected inflammatory arthritis as a cause for chronic extremity joint pain often relies on imaging. This review first discusses the characteristic osseous and soft tissue abnormalities seen with inflammatory arthritis and how they may be imaged. It is essential that imaging results are interpreted in the context of clinical and serologic results to add specificity as there is significant overlap of imaging findings among the various types of arthritis. This review provides recommendations for imaging evaluation of specific types of inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, gout, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate disease (or pseudogout), and erosive osteoarthritis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines facet joint interventions 2020 guidelines [^111xPhpC]. Pain Physician (2020). High credibility.

Non-interventional diagnosis of facet joint pain — accurate diagnosis of underlying causes is a prerequisite for successful therapy of low back pain. Assessment of a patient with spinal pain starts with patient self-report questionnaire items and history taking, followed by physical examination to help clinicians generate a probable hypothesis to differentiate musculoskeletal pain from non-spinal or serious spinal pathology. In other areas of medicine this paradigm has been shown to be valid, or is assumed to be so; however, in spinal pain, the reliability of history and physical examination in detecting sources of spinal pain is less certain.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^111iu92R]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic neck pain without disc herniation or radiculitis — an algorithmic approach to diagnosis and interventional management is outlined, including controlled diagnostic blocks and facet joint evaluation. The current evidence of diagnostic utility of controlled diagnostic blocks shows the prevalence of 36% to 67% with an average prevalence of 49% with a false-positive rate of 27% to 63% (average 49%) with single diagnostic blocks with good evidence, and the current evidence of cervical discography as a diagnostic test for chronic pain is limited. If there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, spondylotic myelopathy, post surgery syndrome, or other demonstrable causes resulting in radiculitis, an interventionalist may proceed with therapeutic epidural injections, and the current evidence for interlaminar epidural injections is good for radiculitis secondary to disc herniation and fair for axial or discogenic pain, pain of central spinal stenosis, and pain of post surgery syndrome. In contrast, cervical transforaminal epidural injections have been associated with high risk and without evidence either for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes; thus, an algorithmic approach should include the diagnostic interventions with facet joint blocks, the therapeutic epidural injections, and evaluation for other causes. Controlled studies have illustrated the presence of facet joint pain on average in 40% to 50% of cases, ranging from 36% to 67% of the patients and 39% in a large study, and consequently the investigation of facet joint pain is considered as a prime investigation ahead of disc stimulation. Multiple studies have indicated the facet joint pain to be bilateral in 69% to 72% of cases and involving at least 3 joints in 50% to 85% of patients. The diagnostic blocks must be performed under controlled conditions using 2 separate local anesthetics with a small volume of injectate, and a positive diagnosis is made with 75% relief and the ability to perform previously painful movements with concordant responses with 2 different local anesthetics.

### Possible factors influencing on the effect of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion-a call for further research and discussion [^116nrUTK]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The threshold SIJ pain for inclusion of patients, NRS ≥ 5 (or VAS ≥ 50), was similar in all three RCTs. Altering the NRS threshold needed to "diagnose" bilateral complaints in our trial alters the percentage with bilateral complaints, exemplified as follows; using NRS ≥ 5.43% had bilateral complaints, with NRS ≥ 7.17% had bilateral complaints. Considering the lack of reported numbers, alteration in percentages related to different thresholds and the lack of a diagnostic definition, the percentage of bilateral complaints between the three RCTs may be less different than initially observed.

Our trial was not powered to evaluate individual response and strict adherence to the predefined statistical analysis plan is highly recommended to avoid non-preplanned analyses producing misleading data. As more granular data may increase the understanding of the effect of SIJ fusion, individual level data for the primary outcome of our trial are presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Individual change in sacroiliac joint pain from baseline to 6 months. Figure 1 demonstrates individual change in sacroiliac joint pain measured by change in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain) from baseline to 6 months follow-up.

All diagnostic procedures and diagnostic blocks in Norway were performed and evaluated collectively by two spine surgeons (first and last author) with more than 5 years' experience on diagnosing SIJ pain. All patients in Sweden underwent CT-guided diagnostic blocks performed by a radiologist. Patients in Sweden were clinically evaluated by the Swedish surgeon (second author). Pain relief of the diagnostic blocks were evaluated with patient reported pain (NRS 0–10) levels and clinical examination before, and 1 h after injection.

### Multiple nodules on the bilateral aspect of the upper extremities [^112QkPhd]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Rheumatoid nodules – Incorrect. Although the nodule distribution and clinical findings in this patient are similar to those of rheumatoid nodules, rheumatoid nodules are associated with rheumatoid arthritis. This patient had no history of arthralgias or joint stiffness; therefore, he is less likely to have rheumatoid arthritis.
B. Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) – Correct. EED is a type of chronic leukocytoclastic vasculitis that presents most frequently with bilateral, symmetric, periarticular nodules on the dorsal aspect of the upper extremities. Although its etiology is unclear, it has been shown to be associated with malignancies, infections (HIV and hepatitis), and autoimmune connective tissue diseases.
C. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis – Incorrect. This condition is associated with destructive arthropathy, which would have been evident by this point in this patient's lengthy course. The lesions tend to be skin-colored, pink, red-brown, or yellow and range up to 2 cm in diameter on the head, hands, ears, and joints. Small coalescing papules can create a "coral bead" appearance in the periungual region. The chronicity of this patient's disease and the lack of destructive arthropathy make this diagnosis unlikely.
D. Tuberous xanthomas – Incorrect. Tuberous xanthomas are skin-colored papules and nodules that favor the elbows and knees and develop in association with disorders of lipid metabolism. Their diagnosis can be made clinically, but additional testing is definitive. Tuberous xanthomas are usually painless, unlike the painful nodules in this case.
E. Enchondromas – Incorrect. Enchondromas are benign cartilage-producing tumors that develop in long bones, particularly those of the hand. Multiple enchondromas are associated with Maffucci syndrome and Ollier disease, which present most commonly in childhood or adolescence, unlike the presentation in adulthood seen in this case.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^111v6fgu]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Arthritis, defined as joint inflammation, affects nearly 1 in 4 adults in the United States. 1 Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0. 25% of adults worldwide. 2 Most people in the United States with arthritis have osteoarthritis, which is a noninflammatory condition. Although inflammatory arthritis is uncommon, studies show that adults presenting to primary care with musculoskeletal symptoms often report joint pain, stiffness, or swelling that could be consistent with inflammatory arthritis. Physical Examination Assessment for warmth, redness, and swelling in addition to joint pain is important on examination of a joint. Redness is frequently seen with crystalline and infectious arthritis. Patients with arthritis may also have limited range of motion in the joint as well as decreased muscle strength around the joint.

Patients with joint inflammation may hold the joint in partial flexion to reduce the joint volume and thus pain in the joint. The fingers should be examined for bony enlargement at the proximal interphalangeal joints and distal interphalangeal joints that indicate osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are often found where there are pressure points. Tophi are found in the soft tissues, including the helix of the ear and around articular structures. On palpation, synovitis will consist of boggy swelling over the joint.
23. Synovitis of the metacarpophalangeal joints can be detected on ballottement with a two-finger approach, which detects a dorsal boggy swelling between the palpating fingers
24. Passive and resisted active range of motion tests can be performed to help localize pathology to intra-articular or extra-articular structures, respectively.
11.

Radiographic findings suggestive of osteoarthritis include marginal osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and joint space narrowing. 43 Early changes of RA include soft tissue swelling and juxta-articular osteopenia. The earliest erosions in the metacarpophalangeal joints occur where the joint capsule synovium directly contacts the bone, often referred to as a marginal erosion 44. Late changes include diffuse osteoporosis, large subchondral erosions, uniform joint space loss, and joint subluxation. 45.

Materials and Methods

Ethics Approval

This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the West China Hospital of Stomatology (WCHSIRB-2020–378). All participants or their legal guardians provided fully informed consent prior to the study.

Study Population and Sample Selection

Patients who sought treatment at the Temporomandibular Joint Department of West China Hospital of Stomatology between December 2021 and December 2023 were recruited in the study for selection according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria as follows. The inclusion criteria comprised: 1. Individuals diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral TMD according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD);2. Participants with complete bilateral TMJ MRI records and TMJ VAS pain scores; 3. Patients with full demographic information record and valid responses to JFLS-8. Whereas the exclusion criteria included: 1. Patients with a history of TMJ-related surgeries or invasive treatments, TMJ trauma/tumors/extensive deformities; 2. Patients diagnosed with autoimmune or systemic diseases; 3. Patients with long-term use of opioids, steroids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); 4. The pain reported by patients was verified to derive from myalgia or TMD headache.

Sample Size Calculation

The sample size was calculated through an appropriate calculator based on similar previous studies. Assuming a confidence level of 95%, a margin of error of 5%, and a population proportion of 50%, the minimum sample size required was determined to be 92 participants.

Data Collection

MRI Protocol

MRI images were obtained using MRI scanners with settings the same as a previous study. Scans were taken in the closed mouth position and T2 weighted images on the oblique sagittal plane were utilized.

### SPECT / CT for discrimination between active and inactive Os trigonum in posterior ankle syndrome [^115fN4Ff]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

[99m Tc]-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid bone scintigraphy was used to differentiate between posterior impingement syndrome and Haglund syndrome in a 34-y-old man with unclear right-sided ankle pain. The patient had an accessory os trigonum bilaterally, and previous x-ray, MRI, and CT were inconclusive. Using SPECT/CT with new iterative reconstruction algorithms based on CT images, the pathologic activation of bone metabolism at the right-sided os trigonum and the adjacent talus joint was revealed. Other causes of posterior ankle pain were ruled out, and posterior impingement syndrome was diagnosed.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^1169R1EL]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Arthritides in heel pain (Pathway 4) — systemic causes and adjunct testing may be relevant: Most cases of heel pain encountered in clinical practice are likely to have a biomechanical etiology and respond to recommended therapy, but the clinician should consider that various systemic arthritides are also capable of presentation as heel pain, including the seronegative arthritides, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's disease, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and gout. Patients with arthritides and heel pain may have other joint symptoms and should be questioned regarding concomitant arthralgias, and careful radiographic evaluation and laboratory testing may assist in determining the correct diagnosis and proper treatment for these unresponsive patients. Occasionally, scintigraphy may be useful in the diagnosis process because a pattern of joint involvement will be evidenced; radiographs of the heel may show erosions or proliferative changes specific to one of these diseases, and rheumatologic consultation may be useful in determining the diagnosis and treatment.

### Pain reporting at different body sites is explained by a single underlying genetic factor [^1165FTnN]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our results show considerable clinical overlap between pain reporting at different sites, and indicate that a single, genetically determined, common pain factor accounts for the tendency to report musculoskeletal pain. This is in stark contrast to our OA findings from a subset of the same group of twins, which reveal that radiographic OA at different anatomical sites is determined by genetic factors that are specific to the individual joint site.

The interpretation of these findings needs to take into account the relatively low response rate to the questionnaire. However, there were no systematic differences between responders and non-responders with respect to age and gender and, of importance with respect to interpreting the genetic influence, there were no detectable differences between MZ and DZ twins. Our questionnaire contained a commonly used format for capturing the report of pain in community-based studies. It was not our aim to address the nature of the pain in further detail or its causes.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin. Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement. In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### Bilateral painful snapping elbows triggered by daily dumbbell exercises: a case report [^112LnsWs]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

We treated a 64-year-old female with bilateral painful snapping elbows due to synovial folds. Resection of the bilateral synovial folds resulted in relief from pain and snapping, and resulted in patient satisfaction. Daily dumbbell exercises of the bilateral elbows starting at an elderly age may have led to the bilateral snapping. Painful snapping elbow is a relatively rare condition, which usually occurs in a unilateral elbow of a younger patient. To our knowledge, bilateral painful snapping elbows triggered by daily dumbbell exercises in older patients have not been previously reported.

### Chronic tophaceous gout mimicking widespread metastasis [^112KmsjV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Gout is a common crystal-induced arthropathy affecting mainly the joints of the appendicular skeleton; however, rarely this condition affects the axial skeleton as well. Spinal gout can cause radiculopathy, cord compression, canal stenosis and discitis. We describe a case of a 71-year-old woman where the initial presentation of destructive arthropathy and spinal masses secondary to axial gout was mistaken for a metastatic malignancy. Despite chronic polyarthropathy and bilateral subcutaneous gouty tophi, spinal gout was not considered a differential diagnosis during initial assessment. The patient was managed conservatively with pharmacological treatment resulting in improvement of her upper limb radiculopathy and systemic joint pain, although little improvement in mobility. Such extensive involvement is rare and the masses can mimic an underlying metastatic disease. Careful history and clinical examination recognising polyarthropathy and subcutaneous tophi can aid the clinician to make the right diagnosis and institute correct treatment. Delay in recognising gout as a differential diagnosis can lead to marked morbidity as illustrated in our case.

### Bilateral 11th rib disarticulation and resection for chronic rib pain: a case report [^116Akged]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Axial CT scan showing unremarkable insertion of the 11th rib on the vertebral body.

Central Message

We report the unusual case of unrelenting chronic pain at the bilateral 11th costovertebral joints that responded to disarticulation and partial rib resection of the affected ribs on each side.

Multitudinous causes, both traumatic and atraumatic, as well as the management of chronic rib pain have been discussed. Painful rib syndrome and slipping rib syndrome are well-recognized entities resulting in chronic rib pain. Chronic pain related to the costovertebral joint, however, is less well understood and described. This report introduces the first documented case of bilateral costovertebral joint pain using partial rib resection as successful treatment for this obscure condition.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115LGMDt]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Interventional treatment — SPECT-positive low back pain (LBP): Patients received intra-articular (n = 23) or medial branch nerve blocks (n = 23), with pain and disability measured after the injection and after 12 weeks; the intra-articular group experienced significantly greater improvements, and the authors concluded that intra-articular lumbar facet joint injections are more effective than medial branch nerve blocks in SPECT-positive patients. In critique, the work group downgraded this potential Level I study as the diagnostic utility of SPECT imaging was negated by injecting bilateral joints and/or bilateral medial branch blocks in every patient, and this study provides Level II evidence that intra-articular injection of steroid provides at least a 50% reduction in pain in roughly 60% of patients while steroid injection around the medial branch nerves provides at least a 50% reduction in pain in roughly 25% of patients.

### Pain trajectory defines knee osteoarthritis subgroups: a prospective observational study [^1174zNze]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, we found that functional limitations followed identical development to pain, indicating that people experienced these 2 outcomes very similarly or could not distinguish between them. Some studies examined functional limitation in knee OA, but none of these did not look into interplay between pain and functional limitation over time. Although the first 3 phenotypes were responsive to currently available analgesics, the fourth was not. OA phenotypes were not significantly associated with knee replacement during a 3-year follow-up because only a few replacements took place during the period. However, in the longer term — as the number of replacements increased — mild-increasing and moderate-treatment-sensitive phenotypes but not severe-treatment-insensitive had significant odds of having knee replacement when compared to the mild-fluctuating one. The severe-treatment-insensitive phenotype in the OAI study included the youngest women with the highest BMI and depression score, with more comorbidities, using analgesics, but without pain relief. The left and right knee trajectories and their dual model showed that most people develop the same pain pattern irrespective of laterality, probably due to central pain processing. The overlapping group percentage was likely lower due to individuals' unilateral pathologies.

The baseline clinical and lifestyle factors in our study were modest in differentiating the phenotypes. Overall, the variable with a consistently positive relationship to pain seemed to be BMI, indicating metabolic differences between phenotypes. The age effect was transposed between study samples. As previously discussed, the exclusion criteria in the OAI study likely led to a healthier population being selected. More generally, age effect can be a random observation unrelated to pain phenotypes, instead indicating time-dependent exposure and a molecular process to be detected. Interestingly, 75% of the fourth phenotype were women, indicating a sex-specific mechanism of severe-treatment-insensitive pain. Finally, the 9-year follow-up is the longest regular/annual follow-up so far in knee OA, and it has given us better insights into long-term pain, the slow-progressing character of OA, and its relation to OA end-stage.

### Possible factors influencing on the effect of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion-a call for further research and discussion [^1161iZQx]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We thank Kampkuiper et al. and Dr Capel, for their comments and questions regarding our double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion to sham surgery. Our response focuses on five main points: bilateralism of SIJ symptoms; individual response to SIJ fusion; diagnostic procedures; per-protocol treatment and post-intervention care procedures; and bias and generalizability.

Bilateralism of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain can complicate the evaluation of improvement in SIJ pain and disability. To our knowledge no international consensus, definition of, or "diagnosis" of bilateralism of SIJ pain exists, especially based on reported pain or disability outcomes. Our trial was not designed nor powered to evaluate the impact of bilateralism on MIS SIJ fusion. When defining bilateral pain as NRS > 2 in the contralateral SIJ our trial reported a larger population with bilateral complaints than the two former RCTs from Europe and the United States. No criteria for defining bilateral complaints were provided in either two former RCTs. In the European RCT, 35% of patients in the fusion group received a diagnosis of bilateral complaints. An indication for bilateral SIJ fusion was found in only 13%, indicating only 39% of patients with bilateral complaints were candidates for bilateral fusion. In the American RCT, 25.5% of patients received a same-day or staged bilateral procedure, the total amount of patients with bilateral complaints was not reported. The actual proportion of patients with bilateral complaints could be suspected to be much higher when considering the numbers from the European RCT. Based on the numbers presented in the European RCT, it appears that not all patients with bilateral symptoms are candidates for bilateral surgery, meaning that not all bilateralism of symptoms will influence the end result after SIJ fusion.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^113SU3FH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

There is no gold standard for diagnosing PMR, and unlike many other rheumatic syndromes, there are no specific clinical manifestations, serology or other laboratory findings in PMR. As a result, diagnosis of PMR can be challenging with a considerable number of conditions in the list of differential diagnoses. However, in daily practice, the diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on the following combination of principles: new‐onset symptoms of both morning stiffness and pain in the shoulder and pelvis girdle in a person aged 50 years or older, evidence of systemic inflammation with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and or CRP, no other disease that would explain the clinical presentation better and finally abrupt response to GCs. In some diagnostic criteria, there are other specific requirements, such as a 2‐week duration of symptoms or negative tests for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.

The diagnosis of PMR should be considered clinically. The typical case is an elderly woman with early morning bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness. Similar symptoms often occur in the pelvic girdle. Typically, the symptoms ease during the day. Systemic manifestations such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss may occur in about a third of the patients. In addition, there is almost always an elevation of inflammatory parameters, especially ESR and/or CRP. Other inflammatory parameters can be elevated as white blood cell or platelet count and sometimes liver enzymes or alkaline phosphatase may be elevated as a sign of systemic inflammation. On clinical examination, tenderness with deep palpation of the muscles around the shoulders and thighs is often noted. In addition, there is usually restricted mobility in the shoulders, without muscle atrophy or weakness. Occasional signs of synovitis in the shoulders, wrist joints and the knees can be seen. PMR can be diagnosed in combination with GCA, especially in those with a cranial phenotype, that is, TA. Although temporal biopsy may be positive in a minority of patients with PMR, it is not included in the currently recommended investigation of the disease, unless there are concomitant cranial GCA symptoms. Finally, in PMR, most patients will respond rapidly and dramatically to GCs and according to some criteria, this response is required for diagnosis.

### Bilateral shoulder septic arthritis in a fit and well 47-year-old man [^116yt2gs]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Bilateral septic arthritis of the shoulder is uncommon in the immunocompetent patient with no previous risk factors for joint infection, and is thus easily missed. Septic arthritis is associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and management is the key to a favourable outcome; septic arthritis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in the unwell patient presenting with shoulder pain and reduced range of joint movement. We present a case of a 47-year-old previously fit and well man with bilateral shoulder septic arthritis. We will also review the current literature on management and long-term outcomes of patients with septic arthritis of the glenohumeral joint.

### Buprenorphine management in the perioperative period: educational review and recommendations from a multisociety expert panel [^116oqgpq]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cervical facet joint pain — proposed examination protocols outline four maneuvers: cervical spine range of motion (ROM), extension-rotation (ER) testing, manual spinal examination (MSE), and palpation for segmental tenderness (PST). ROM is measured with the patient seated and pain responses are categorized as increased, decreased, or no change in baseline cervical pain; ER testing is positive when baseline cervical spine pain is provoked at end-range. For MSE, a posterolaterally directed force is applied over the articular pillars from C2–3 to C6–7 on each side, with a positive test defined as worsening baseline or referred pain when moderate or marked resistance to motion is perceived. For PST, the assessor palpates levels overlying the facet joints (C2–3 to C6–7) bilaterally, with a positive test defined as increased pain compared with baseline, either localized or referred; paraspinal tenderness was reported to be predictive of a positive response to cervical medial branch RFA in one study.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^116PQ8NZ]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

The ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria outline the cardinal features of the TN phenotype. However, the clinician's appreciation of the detailed phenotype aids the diagnostic process particularly with regard to alerting to atypical features that warrant consideration of other diagnosis or further investigations.

Laterality and site of pain

The right side of the face (60%) is affected more than the left side. Bilateral simultaneous pain in TN is rare (1.7%–5%) and more often these patients experience side-alternating unilateral pain paroxysms. In view of its rarity, bilateral simultaneous or side-alternating trigeminal paroxysmal pains should raise concern about an underlying neurological disorder or a non-neurological disorder affecting the cranium. It therefore warrants careful exclusion of secondary pathology. If investigations are normal, then idiopathic cases of constant or long-lasting bilateral trigeminal pain include: temporomandibular joints dysfunction, persistent idiopathic facial pain and rarely migraine with facial pain. In cases with paroxysmal short-lasting pain episodes, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias such as short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNHA) should be considered if pain is associated with cranial autonomic symptoms or idiopathic stabbing headache if the pain is predominantly in the ophthalmic (V1) trigeminal distribution.

The pain of TN most frequently affects the distribution of the maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions of the trigeminal nerve, though approximately a quarter of the cases have ophthalmic (V1) division involvement.

### Spondyloarthritis: a gouty display [^116VmEy2]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Gout is a systemic, metabolic disease that typically affects the peripheral joints. We describe an unusual presentation of gout affecting the facet joints and costovertebral joints in the thoracic and lumbar spine. A 54-year old man presents to the emergency department with increasing swelling and pain at the left elbow for one week and difficulty ambulating. The imaging work-up included plain radiographs of the left elbow, left wrist, and chest with subsequent admission for possible septic arthritis. MRI of the elbow showed olecranon bursitis and an erosion of the lateral epicondyle. CT scan demonstrated lytic cloud-like lesions localized to the facet joints and costovertebral joints of the thoracic and lumbar spine as well as bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. Possible hyperparathyroidism manifestations (including Brown tumors and medullary nephrocalcinosis) were evaluated with plains films of the hands; x-rays instead showed classic gouty arthritis. Our report reviews the disease, epidemiology, classic radiologic findings, and treatment of gout.

### Chronic exertional compartment syndrome requiring bilateral fasciotomy: an atypical complication of familial stiff skin syndrome in a father and son [^116fFwcb]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Stiff skin syndrome (SSS) is a rare cutaneous disorder characterized by cutaneous fibrosis resulting in the early onset of thickened and indurated skin, joint mobility restrictions, and contractures. We describe a father and son with familial SSS who presented with bilateral exertional pain and a confirmed diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome on 4-compartment pressure testing. Patients experienced restored functionality with bilateral 4-compartment fasciotomy. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with SSS and chronic pain of the lower limbs.

### Contrasting results in sacroiliac joint fusion studies: the role of bilateral complaints [^115JP2PB]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Randers et al. conducted a double-blind randomized sham surgery-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF). In their study, 72% of the patients in the surgery group and 65% in the sham group had bilateral complaints. This contrasts with the European RCT where only 35% of surgery group patients had bilateral complaints. Notably, the European RCT reported 39% of surgery group patients with bilateral complaints underwent bilateral SIJF. These differences might explain the contradictory results. Moreover, patients may be able to accurately describe the dominant painful sacroiliac joint (SIJ) preoperatively, though due to the proximity of the dorsal ligaments, it raises doubts about their ability to differentiate pain between the operated and contralateral side. Therefore, it would be interesting to see whether patients who had unilateral SIJ pain respond differently compared to patients with bilateral SIJ pain who also received unilateral SIJF. Unfortunately, we cannot find this distinction in the results for both the primary and secondary outcomes.

Based on the currently presented results with means and confidence interval of the mean, it is impossible to identify whether there are individual patients who experienced a substantial decrease in pain. It would be of additive value to provide these numbers. Furthermore, the paper and supplementary data do not provide more quantifiable outcomes, such as the pre- and postoperative clinical provocative tests on the operated side.

We genuinely hope the authors will reply to our remarks. We are looking forward to the crossover results and follow up studies.

Lumbar facet joint injections — Fuchs et al randomized trial of sodium hyaluronate versus triamcinolone acetonide: Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of sodium hyaluronate or 10 mg of triamcinolone acetonide per facet joint; bilateral joints at levels L5-S1, L5-L4, and L4–3 were treated once per week under CT guidance, with effects assessed at 3 and 6 months by VAS, RMQ, ODQ, LBOS, and SF‑36; pain relief of 50% or greater occurred only in the triamcinolone group with a reduction of 51.7% versus 45.1% in the sodium hyaluronate group, and functional scores showed reductions in sodium hyaluronate of 43.2%, 39.1%, and 43.9% versus 33.4%, 29.5%, and 34.8% with triamcinolone; because no controlled diagnostic blocks were used and at least an 80% relief after a diagnostic block was not documented, this study was excluded from the final evaluation.

### Posterior epidural migration of sequestrated lumbar disc fragments into the bilateral facet joints: case report [^116SxMKF]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Importance

Symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is common. Migration of a free disc fragment is usually found in rostral, caudal, or lateral directions. Posterior epidural migration is very rare. We report the first case with posterior epidural migration and sequestration into bilateral facet joints of a free disc fragment.

Clinical Presentation

A 78-year-old female presented with low back pain and right leg pain. Plain radiographs showed lumbar spondylolisthesis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a posterior epidural mass and intrafacet mass, which was hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The lesion in the left L3–4 facet joint had rim enhancement, whereas the right one was not contrasted after gadolinium injection. Preoperative differential diagnosis included abscess, tumor, hematoma, or synovial cyst. An interbody cage fusion at L3–4 and L4–5 for spondylolisthesis was performed, and a hybrid technique was applied with the Dynesys flexible rod system at L3-S1 for multisegment degenerative disc disease. The lesion proved to be an epidural disc fragment with sequestration into bilateral facet joints.

Conclusion

A free disc fragment should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior epidural lesions, and even in the facet joint.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^1163Hizf]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain diagnosis without disc herniation — algorithmic approach — commences with clinical questions, physical findings, and radiological investigations, and an algorithmic approach should include diagnostic interventions with facet joint blocks and sacroiliac joint injections, followed by discography; if there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, or other demonstrable causes resulting in radiculitis, one may proceed with diagnostic transforaminal or therapeutic epidural injections. Among lumbosacral diagnostic approaches, medial branch blocks have the best evidence of accuracy, and controlled studies have illustrated the prevalence of lumbar facet joint pain in 15% to 45% of patients and a false-positive rate of 27% to 45% of patients with chronic low back pain, with a systematic review showing an average prevalence of 31% (95% CI; 28% - 33%) and a false-positive rate of 30% (95% CI; 27% - 33%). Facet joint pain may be bilateral in 60% to 79% of cases and involve 3 joints in 21% to 37% of patients. Diagnostic blocks must be performed under controlled conditions; in the United States they are often accomplished with 2 separate local anesthetics as controlled comparative local anesthetic blocks with a small volume of local anesthetic, and a positive diagnosis is made if a patient experiences at least 75% relief with the ability to perform previously painful movements within an appropriate timeframe for the local anesthetic and commensurate duration of relief across the two blocks.

### Patient-specific factors predicting outcome of temporomandibular joint arthroscopy: a 6-year retrospective study [^1141N7uT]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although indications for the surgical treatment of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and the choice of treatment are debated, arthroscopy seems generally accepted as a minimally invasive alternative. The objective of this study was to investigate various factors and their possible correlation with an unsuccessful outcome of arthroscopic lysis and lavage in patients diagnosed with chronic closed lock, arthralgia with or without concomitant osteoarthritis of the TMJ, or systemic rheumatologic disease with involvement of the TMJ.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis of 224 operations was conducted to identify pre-, peri-, and postoperative factors correlated with an adverse outcome. Criteria for success were maximum interincisal opening (MIO) of at least 35 mm and self-graded joint pain on a 10-point visual analog scale no higher than 3.

Results

Surgical outcome was graded as successful (n = 150; 67%), improved (n = 16; 7%), minor or no improvement (n = 55; 25%), or worse (n = 3; 1%). Preoperative factors that correlated with a negative outcome were the presence of psychiatric disorders (P = 0.0333), high self-graded global pain (P = 0.0320), bilateral muscle tenderness at palpation (P = 0.0309), and small MIO (P = 0.0018). For patients with systemic arthritis, younger age was correlated with an unsuccessful outcome (P = 0.0317).

Conclusion

The results indicate that psychiatric comorbidities, high self-graded global pain, bilateral masticatory muscle tenderness, and small MIO predict an unsuccessful outcome after arthroscopic lysis and lavage. These factors could be indicators for chronic pain disorders, including chronic myofascial pain, increased pain sensitivity, and decreased coping abilities, associated with a poor outcome.

### Differential diagnosis of spondylolysis in a patient with chronic low back pain [^112AMBAX]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Resident's case problem.

Background

A 26-year-old male sought physical therapy services via direct access secondary to a flare-up of a chronic low back pain condition. The patient complained of recent onset of lumbosacral joint pain, including (1) constant right-sided deep-bruise sensation, (2) intermittent right-sided sharp stabbing pain, and (3) constant bilateral aching. The patient's past medical history included a hyperextension low back injury while playing football at age 17. Physical examination revealed (1) deep pain with palpation over the right lumbosacral joint region, (2) sharp right lumbosacral joint pain with 1 repetition of active trunk backward bending, and (3) a marked increase in pain and joint hypomobility with right unilateral joint assessment at the L4 and L5 spinal levels.

Diagnosis

The examining therapist referred the patient for radiographic evaluation due to strong suspicions of a pars interarticularis bony defect. Lumbar plain films, oblique views, revealed an L5 bilateral pars defect, leading to a diagnosis of a longstanding bilateral L5 spondylolysis.

Discussion

Patients with low back pain often seek physical therapy services. Identification of pathology requiring examination by other health care providers, leading to patient referral to other health care practitioners, is a potential important outcome of the therapist's examination. This resident's case problem illustrates the importance of a systematic examination scheme, including a thorough medical screening component that led to a patient referral for radiographic evaluation. The resultant diagnosis, although not representing serious pathology, did impact the therapist's patient plan of care.

### Predicting contralateral surgery for Trapeziometacarpal arthrosis within 5 Years [^116fcbST]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Symptomatic trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint arthritis is a common cause of hand pain. It is unknown how many patients ultimately elect to have bilateral surgery for TMC arthritis. In this study, we assessed the frequency and predictive factors for contralateral TMC surgery in patients who underwent prior TMC surgery.

Methods

We identified 712 patients who underwent primary surgery for TMC arthritis with a follow-up period of 5 years. We collected demographic, surgical, and follow-up data. Prediction models for contralateral surgery using a training and testing data set were created with multivariable logistic regression and random forest classifier algorithms.

Results

At the time of initial surgery, 230 patients had bilateral thumb pain (32%), but only 153 patients ultimately had an operation for TMC arthritis on the contralateral side within 5 years (21% of 712 total patients and 67% of 230 patients with bilateral pain). Common predictive factors between both models for contralateral surgery were younger age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93–0.98), bilateral thumb pain (OR = 3.76; 95% CI, 2.52–5.65), and anxiety disorders (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.11–3.03).

Conclusions

In our study, we found that the rate of contralateral surgery was 21% in patients who underwent prior TMC surgery. Predictive factors for future contralateral surgery included younger age, bilateral thumb pain, and anxiety disorder at the time of initial surgery.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^112GSibk]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — diagnosis and classification — moderate lateral or anterior hip pain during weight bearing, in adults over the age of 50 years, with morning stiffness less than 1 hour, with limited hip internal rotation and hip flexion by more than 15° when comparing the painful to the nonpainful side are useful clinical findings to classify a patient with hip pain into the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) category of unilateral coxarthrosis and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of hip pain (b2816 Pain in joints) and mobility deficits (b7100 Mobility of a single joint). (Recommendation based on strong evidence.) Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications other than osteoarthritis of the hip when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function. (Recommendation based on expert opinion.)

### Multiple nonspecific sites of joint pain outside the knees develop in persons with knee pain [^111iRobL]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Many persons with knee pain have joint pain outside the knee, but despite the impact and high frequency of this pain, its distribution and causes have not been studied. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis of those studying gait abnormalities who have suggested that knee pain causes pain in adjacent joints but that pain adaptation strategies are highly individualized.

Methods

We studied persons ages 50–79 years with or at high risk of knee osteoarthritis who were recruited from 2 community-based cohorts, the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study and the Osteoarthritis Initiative, and we followed them up for 5–7 years. We excluded those with knee pain at baseline and compared those who had developed knee pain at the first follow-up examination (the index visit) with those who had not. We examined pain on most days at joint regions outside the knee in examinations after the index visit. Logistic regression analyses examined the risk of joint-specific pain adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and symptoms of depression, and we performed sensitivity analyses excluding those with widespread pain.

Results

In the combined cohorts, 693 persons had knee pain at the index visit and 2,793 did not. A total of 79.6% of those with bilateral knee pain and 63.8% of those with unilateral knee pain had pain during follow-up in a joint region outside the knee, compared with 49.9% of those without knee pain. There was an increased risk of pain at most extremity joint sites, without a predilection for specific sites. Results were unchanged when those with widespread pain were excluded.

Conclusion

Persons with chronic knee pain are at increased risk of pain in multiple joints in no specific pattern.

### Obesity profiles with knee osteoarthritis: correlation with pain, disability, disease progression [^117Lky79]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify the prevalence of overweight among community-dwelling adults diagnosed as having knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the relationship between the weight status of these individuals, selected disease-related outcomes, and disease progression.

Research Methods and Procedures

The BMIs of 82 women and 18 men with unilateral or bilateral knee OA were examined on a single occasion along with data on physical comorbidities, pain, and function and subjected to correlation analyses. BMIs from two additional samples, one that included 16 women with and without knee OA and one that included 24 women and 6 men with knee joint OA that required surgery for the subsequent onset of hip OA, were also assessed.

Results

At least 80% of all present cohorts were overweight or obese. Those with higher BMIs reported more pain than those with lower BMIs (p < 0.05) and pain was related to perceived physical exertion (p < 0.05). Body mass indices were not significantly correlated with generic gait measures, but an inverse trend toward the time spent in the gait cycle (r = -0.63; p = 0.097) that may impact the disease process was identified. Those with comorbidities had the same body mass, on average, as those with no comorbidities, and those with bilateral disease were heavier than those with unilateral disease.

Discussion

A high body mass is present in most adults with knee OA. Moreover, being overweight may affect knee joint impact rates and pain incrementally. Having high body weights may heighten the risk for bilateral knee joint, as well as hip joint, OA.

### Efficacy of lateral view needle placement for sacroiliac joint injections [^111e3MJQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is becoming an increasingly recognized pathology in patients with lower back pain, with current estimates suggesting that 15–30% of lower back pain may be attributed to SIJ pathology. The SIJ connects the sacrum to the bilateral ilium bones and is the largest axial synovial joint in the body by surface area. The SIJ is relatively inflexible due to the wide surface area of the joint, which is reinforced with irregular bony elevations and depressions that interlock the two bones in a "C" shape as well as thick, redundant ligaments exterior to the synovium. The SIJ has a very narrow joint space, ranging from 0.5 to 4mm leading to approximate ranges of motion of 3 degrees in flexion and extension, 1.5 degrees in axial rotation, and 0.8 degrees in lateral bending.

Sacroiliac pain may be caused by exterior shearing forces, hypo- or hyper-mobility, micro- or macro-fractures, soft tissue injury, inflammation, pregnancy causing laxity in the supporting ligaments, leg length discrepancy, and prior lumbar fusion, among others. The proximity of the joint to the hip joint and lumbar spine often leads to a variety of presenting symptoms, which has led to SIJ pain being referred to as the great "mimicker" of different pain pathologies. The innervation of the SIJ is complex and, despite some conflicting information in the literature, most clinicians agree that the sensory fibers stem from the lateral branches of the posterior rami of L5-S4, which are the pain sensors of the joint.

Because the differential diagnosis for SIJ pain is broad, misdiagnosis is common. The diagnosis of SIJ pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination. If a patient has a positive response to 3 or more SIJ provocative tests, the pain is likely due to pathology in the SIJ and may result in a positive diagnostic SIJ block. The SIJ block consists of intraarticular injection of corticosteroids and local anesthetics to reduce inflammation and pain, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Current standards suggest that a 75% pain improvement after two separate injections is considered a positive diagnosis of sacroiliitis.

### Multiple joint osteonecrosis in a patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids [^113aLHUh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients usually present with gradual onset of severe medial knee pain that is often worse at night or with weight-bearing. The diagnosis of knee ON is often challenging because it is assumed that the knee pain might be due to meniscal injury or early arthritic changes. Diagnostic workup including connective tissue screening tests and thrombophilia tests can be considered in patients with ON. However, their role in patient management is not clear. The plain radiographs are completely normal initially; therefore, high index of clinical suspicion and thorough history are important to identify possible risk factors. Later on, radiographs show subchondral radiolucent areas and eventual articular surface collapse with arthritic changes as the disease progresses. At early stage disease, MRI is the modality of choice to establish the diagnosis. It provides detailed information about the extension of the lesion and any other associated intra-articular lesions. MRI is also an important screening imaging tool in high-risk patients, regardless of the symptoms. Although bone scintigraphy is an effective diagnostic tool, it has a much lower sensitivity of 64% compared with 100% reported using MRI beside its limited value in patients with multifocal disease. The duration from the start of symptoms to the time of diagnosis is variable ranging from two weeks to 24 months. In our patient, the diagnosis was made 13 weeks after the pain started. Early diagnosis is important to avoid mistreatment and to avoid or delay the need for arthroplasty especially in younger patients.

Although it is difficult to differentiate between spontaneous and secondary knee ON based on the clinical presentation, demographic and radiological findings can help identify the type of knee ON. A relatively young patient with multiple joints involvement and underlying risk factors, as is the case with our patient, makes the diagnosis of secondary ON more likely. In addition, MRI findings are useful to identify the type of knee ON particularly those with notably larger lesions in patients with secondary ON and with the presence of irregular well-demarcated line between the necrotic and viable bone. Only few cases of bilateral knee ON have been reported in the literature with affection of the patella, and the lateral femoral condyle. The lesions in our case were localized to the medial tibial plateau bilaterally, which is unusual. All cases shared the same risk factor of steroid use that varied from the typical oral formto the inhaled form. In our case, intranasal corticosteroids were responsible for ON.

Bilateral discoid medial menisci are exceptionally rare and of uncertain pathoetiology. We report on a case in an active adolescent woman who presented with bilateral medial knee joint line pain. Clinical evaluation and MRI identified atypical bilateral discoid medial menisci bilaterally. The patient underwent bilateral meniscal saucerization, with no pain at 4 months postoperation, and returned to competitive sport.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — grades of recommendation based on strength of evidence are defined as follows: Category A strong evidence requires "A preponderance of level I and/or level II studies support the recommendation. This must include at least 1 level I study". Category B moderate evidence is "A single high-quality randomized controlled trial or a preponderance of level II studies support the recommendation". Category C weak evidence is "A single level II study or a preponderance of level III and IV studies, including statements of consensus by content experts, support the recommendation". Category D conflicting evidence notes "Higher-quality studies conducted on this topic disagree with respect to their conclusions. The recommendation is based on these conflicting studies". Category E theoretical/foundational evidence states "A preponderance of evidence from animal or cadaver studies, from conceptual models/ principles, or from basic science/bench research supports this conclusion". Category F expert opinion indicates "Best practice based on the clinical experience of the guidelines development team".

### Bilateral widespread mechanical pain sensitivity in carpal tunnel syndrome: evidence of central processing in unilateral neuropathy [^115TXXCs]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether bilateral widespread pressure hypersensitivity exists in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. A total of 20 females with carpal tunnel syndrome (aged 22–60 years), and 20 healthy matched females (aged 21–60 years old) were recruited. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed bilaterally over median, ulnar, and radial nerve trunks, the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, the carpal tunnel and the tibialis anterior muscle in a blinded design. The results showed that pressure pain threshold levels were significantly decreased bilaterally over the median, ulnar, and radial nerve trunks, the carpal tunnel, the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, and the tibialis anterior muscle in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as compared to healthy controls (all, P < 0.001). Pressure pain threshold was negatively correlated to both hand pain intensity and duration of symptoms (all, P < 0.001). Our findings revealed bilateral widespread pressure hypersensitivity in subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome, which suggest that widespread central sensitization is involved in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The generalized decrease in pressure pain thresholds associated with pain intensity and duration of symptoms supports a role of the peripheral drive to initiate and maintain central sensitization. Nevertheless, both central and peripheral sensitization mechanisms are probably involved at the same time in carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Patellofemoral pain [^112aS254]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) medical screening and referral — Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history and physical examination to determine whether the patient's symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral to another health care provider, and prior to diagnosing a person with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical conditions. Clinicians should recognize the key signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for the presence of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, and medical conditions for which physical therapy is not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a patient's symptoms.

### Soft tissue enlargement of fingers in a teenager [^1124vVD4]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis
B. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
C. Pachydermodactyly
D. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare
E. Pachydermoperiostosis

Answers:
A. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis – Incorrect. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease with predominantly skin findings such as a purplish-red rash over the eyelids, erythematous patches and plaques over the neck, shoulders, chest, and back and dilated nail bed capillary loops. Purplish-red papules may be present on dorsum of hands over the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Bilateral widening of the digits limited to PIP joints is not a feature. ANA is reported positive in 50% of cases.
B. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis – Incorrect. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis in children younger than 16 years. Characteristic symptoms include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Common lab abnormalities include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, with possible positive ANA and rheumatoid factor. Imaging shows changes of periarticular osteoporosis and bony erosion in the joint space.
C. Pachydermodactyly – Correct. Pachydermodactyly is a benign and uncommon fibromatosis typically seen around the proximal interphalangeal joints resulting in asymptomatic soft tissue swelling. It is most commonly seen in adolescent males. X-ray shows no joint or bony abnormalities and lab abnormalities are usually absent.
D. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare – Incorrect. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue manifesting clinically as a single or multiple subcutaneous nodules. These lesions are predominantly found in children and often occur on the scalp, acral surfaces, and lower limbs, especially on the shins. The presence of discrete nodules as opposed to fusiform widening of digits makes this diagnosis less likely.
E. Pachydermoperiostosis – Incorrect. Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare genetic disorder with skin and bone involvement. Findings include coarsening of facial features, acne, hyperhidrosis, enlargement of hands and feet, clubbing of fingers and toes, and radiographic findings of periostosis and arthritis.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^11565qXj]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extracted from studies designed for other objectives

Table 15 shows studies denoting the number of facet joints and laterality of treated patients. More procedures were performed on one to two joints than on multiple joints, and a large majority of procedures were unilateral. No sustained complication or side effects were reported that can be attributed to bilateral and/or multi-level facet nerve blocks or RFA, even in cases in which the TON was ablated bilaterally alone or in combination with other medial branches.

Table 15
Studies reporting bilateral and/or multi-level cervical medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation

Studies by the same group of investigators have sought to determine, through controlled blocks performed one level at a time, the number and distribution of affected joints in patients with chronic neck pain after whiplash. In the most comprehensive of these studies, 31 of 52 patients were diagnosed with cervical facet joint pain, with four patients having two-joint involvement and only one having three-joint involvement. Although elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis often have multiple levels concomitantly affected, the clinical significance of this in the context of other degenerative changes (eg, uncovertebral joints, cervical discs) is unclear. Performing MBB at multiple segments may lead to the unnecessary treatment of unaffected levels, not only for the initial RFA but for subsequent procedures as well.

Case reports

There are two published case reports of dropped head syndrome after cervical medial branch RFA. In one instance, severe progressive cervical kyphosis with inability of active head raising developed after bilateral C2–C3, C3–C4, and C5–C6 facet joint medial branch RFA. The ablations were performed on each side separated by 1 week. Subsequent electromyography (EMG) showed active denervation of the cervical paraspinous muscles and MRI revealed paraspinal muscle atrophy. In the second case, dropped head syndrome developed 3 months after left-sided TON and C3–C4 facet joint medial branch RF denervation with MRI evidence of left semispinalis cervicis and splenius capitis atrophy/degeneration. In neither case was sensory or motor stimulation used. In both cases, passive head extension was not impaired. The authors postulated the etiologies as loss of collateral muscle innervation from bilateral and/or multi-level RFA. It is worth noting that bilateral multi-level facet nerve blocks were performed without reported adverse effects in both cases. Although unpublished, the authors (SPC, RWH) are aware of several cases of temporary ataxia and loss of balance when bilateral upper cervical MBBs were performed.

### Shoulder pain and mobility deficits: adhesive capsulitis [^111iooTm]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis — age, sex, and bilateral occurrence notes that age can be considered a risk factor because adhesive capsulitis more commonly occurs in individuals between 40 and 65 years of age, with the reported peak incidence occurring, on average, between 51 and 55, and females appear to be affected more commonly than males. In a diabetic cohort, a greater proportion of males (33.6%) than females (25.9%) had adhesive capsulitis. Prior unilateral disease confers risk (5%-34%) for opposite-arm involvement, and simultaneous bilateral occurrence can be up to 14% of the time.

Cervical medial branch blocks (MBB) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) — bilateral treatment and number of levels: No study was identified that addresses this question. Indirect evidence notes that more procedures were performed on one or two joints than on multiple joints, and a large majority of procedures were unilateral, and no sustained complication or side effects were reported that can be attributed to bilateral and/or multi-level facet nerve blocks or RFA. After whiplash, in the most comprehensive of these studies, 31 of 52 patients were diagnosed with cervical facet joint pain, with four patients having two-joint involvement and only one having three-joint involvement, and performing MBB at multiple segments may lead to the unnecessary treatment of unaffected levels, not only for the initial RFA but for subsequent procedures as well.

The SIS Practice Guidelines state that cervical MBB, including the TON, can be done bilaterally at the same visit for patients with bilateral neck pain and headache; however, they advocate staged facet relieving blocks in different visits to isolate the painful joint(s), explicitly caution against performing medial branch RFA bilaterally and at numerous levels without careful judgment, and recommend that bilateral TON ablation be performed on separate occasions after test blocks to establish tolerance for bilateral denervation without causing debilitating ataxia and other unwanted side effects.

### The effect of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion compared to sham operation: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial [^117QSsdV]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this sham surgery-controlled RCT we could not prove that minimally invasive sacroiliac joint surgery was superior to sham surgery at six months postoperatively for the primary outcome; pain in the operated sacroiliac joint. The results were the same for all secondary outcomes.

The existing literature on minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion has shown larger measured efficacy of surgery in regard to pain and physical function than in our trial. There might be several reasons for the difference in measured efficacy of surgery, such as differences in trial populations and patient characteristics. When results from a sham surgery-controlled trial do not support existing findings, a common consideration highlighted by the surgical community is that the patients in the sham surgery-controlled trial do not represent the usual population undergoing the procedure. In this trial we used the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the European RCT in order to get as comparable populations as possible. In the American RCT eligibility criteria excluded all patients that were in litigation, on disability leave or who were receiving workers compensation, patients that might have a poorer prognosis. These differences in patient selection due to differences in social welfare and healthcare systems between the United States of America and Europe, limits the external validity of the American RCT for use on the European population. Even when we used eligibility criteria similar to the European RCT, we still ended up with a study population with slight differences from the European RCT. When we compare our population with the European RCT the age of the included were comparable. Our trial comprised a larger proportion of women (98% vs 73%) and our patients had longer duration of symptoms (12.4 years vs 4.5 years). In both the European RCT and our RCT there were a large proportion of patients with bilateral pain and this bilateralism of symptoms could affect the measured effect of surgery when using more general outcomes such as VAS low back pain, ODI and EQ-5D. By choosing a primary end-point that takes bilateralism into consideration, bilateralism of sacroiliac joint pain should not affect the measured efficacy of surgery in our primary end-point. With the use of recognized eligibility criteria in our population we could not prove sacroiliac joint fusion to be superior to sham surgery at 6 months postoperatively. Our interpretation of this is that either the eligibility criteria used are not able to select the patients who may benefit from surgical intervention, or surgery is not as efficient as previous studies have concluded.

### Zoledronic acid (reclast) [^11149ejf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures

Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.
Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture.
Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.

5.6 Musculoskeletal Pain

In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Reclast. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Consider withholding future Reclast treatment if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Patients With Asthma

While not observed in clinical trials with Reclast, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. Use Reclast with caution in aspirin-sensitive patients.

### Temporomandibular joint arthritis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, now what? [^1163gY3g]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Physical examination

TMJ arthritis does not typically manifest with joint swelling. Moreover, physical exam findings are late in the disease process where the bone growth has been altered by the arthritis. Thus, physical examination consists at the very least of evaluation for joint tenderness, clicking upon mouth opening, asymmetric mouth opening (present only in unilateral or unequal disease, with the jaw deviating towards the more affected side), and assessment of opening. Recently, published recommendations also encouraged palpation of masticatory muscles and an evaluation of TMJ morphology and symmetry. As with the historical signs, no single one of these markers is highly sensitive for arthritis. For example, Koos et al. (2014) prospectively evaluated five physical exam maneuvers (asymmetric mouth opening, pain on palpation of masticatory muscles, pain on palpation of the TMJ, TMJ clicking and reduced maximal incisal opening (MIO)) as predictors of TMJ arthritis, using MRI as the gold standard. The sensitivity of each individual item ranged from a low of 21% (MIO) to a high of 65% (asymmetric opening). Combining the items, the presence of any one of them had a sensitivity of 85%, which will still not only miss a substantial number of cases but is also associated with a low specificity of 54%. Similarly, the studies by Weiss et al. (2008) and Muller et al. (2009) both reported that physical examination maneuvers had low sensitivity as well as low specificity for the detection of MRI-suggested TMJ arthritis in new-onset patients. In contrast, Abramowicz et al. (2013) reported that a combination of abnormal MIO for age and jaw deviation had a positive predictive value of 100% in patients with long-standing JIA, indicating that patients with both had a 100% likelihood of TMJ arthritis. However, in support of the previous work, the negative predictive value was only 46%, meaning that the majority of patients lacking one or both of these findings still had arthritis. Kristensen et al. performed a systematic literature review, concluding that while studies were not directly comparable, no single physical exam finding could accurately predict MRI findings of TMJ arthritis.

### Osteoarthritis: the genesis of pain [^114P7xfi]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

OA is a painful joint disease that predominantly affects the elderly. Pain is the primary symptom of OA, and it can present as either intermittent or constant. OA pain mechanisms are complex and have only recently been determined. Both peripheral and central processes are involved in creating the OA pain experience, making targeted therapy problematic. Nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic pains are all known to occur in OA, but to varying degrees in a patient- and time-specific manner. A better understanding of these multifactorial components of OA pain will lead to the development of more effective and safer pain treatments.

### What makes osteoarthritis painful? The evidence for local and central pain processing [^115VKbRK]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

OA is a chronic arthritic disease characterized by pain, local tissue damage and attempts at tissue repair. Historically, cartilage damage was believed to be the hallmark of OA. However, since cartilage is an avascular, aneural tissue, the mechanisms of pain are likely to be complex and influenced by non-cartilaginous structures in the joint including the synovium, bone and soft tissue. Imaging studies reveal the presence of synovitis and bone marrow lesions that may mediate pain. The presence of local joint inflammation and altered cartilage and bone turnover in OA implicates a potential role for a range of molecular mediators in OA pain. Mechanisms of pain perception may include the activation and release of local pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and cytokines accompanied by the destruction of tissue, which is mediated by proteases. However, clinically, there is often disparity between the degree of pain perception and the extent of joint changes in subjects with OA. Such observations have prompted work to investigate the mechanisms of central pain perception in OA. Functional MRI has identified multiple areas of the brain that are involved in OA pain processing. These data demonstrate that pain perception in OA is complex in being influenced by local factors and activation of central pain-processing pathways. In this review, we will discuss current concepts underlying the pathophysiology of pain perception in OA and suggest possible directions for the future management of pain in this condition based on recent clinical studies.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^113NBoSM]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Conditions affecting people in the age group 50 years and older and associated with bilateral shoulder pain should be included in the differential diagnoses of PMR. This is especially true as there are no specific diagnostic tests for PMR and a misdiagnosis of any condition as PMR may lead to unnecessary exposure to GCs for extensive periods of time. The differential diagnosis should include both rheumatic and nonrheumatic diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Among the most important rheumatic conditions in the differential diagnoses of PMR is seronegative RA. This is especially true early in the disease onset of RA, which might have a prodromal phase of bilateral shoulder joint arthritis. In addition, both RA and PMR can present with arthritis in wrist joints, and if patients test negative for rheumatoid factor and/or anti‐cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti‐CCP), the differentiation between these two conditions may not be easy. However, the presence of symmetric small joint arthritis should favour the RA diagnosis. Both RA and PMR can be successfully treated with prednisolone, limiting the utility of this medication in the differentiation. Typical extra‐articular manifestations (e.g. rheumatoid nodules, cutaneous vasculitis, serositis, etc.) and positive RF/anti‐CCP favour the diagnosis of RA rather than PMR.

Myositis

Polymyositis (PM) is another disease that may be misdiagnosed as PMR and vice versa. Both conditions affect the proximal muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities. However, the presence of muscle weakness rather than stiffness and pain is an important differential feature of PM. In addition, PM is usually associated with elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes, which is not a feature of PMR. Other features that favour the possibility of PM is the presence of myositis specific autoantibodies and extramuscular manifestations including in the lungs, skin, gastrointestinal tract or the heart. Difficulty in swallowing will favour the diagnosis of PM. Unlike PM, pure muscle weakness is not typical of PMR, where the predominant symptoms are muscle aches and pain and morning stiffness.

Pain syndromes

The differentiation between PMR and pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia should be easier compared to other differential diagnosis. Fibromyalgia usually has its onset in younger age groups than PMR. In addition, there is no elevation of laboratory parameters indicating an inflammatory condition in the former group. It is important to differentiate between these two conditions to avoid unnecessary use of GCs in patients with fibromyalgia and pain syndromes.

### Septic arthritis of bilateral lumbar facet joints: report of a case with MRI findings in the early stage [^112NYbRb]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case is reported.

Objective

To report and discuss a case of septic arthritis of bilateral lumbar facet joints with contiguous extension into the paraspinal musculature without infection of the vertebral body or disc space.

Summary Of Background Data

Septic arthritis of a lumbar facet joint is a rare cause of low back pain, and only a few cases have been described. If the condition is not associated with epidural or paraspinal abscess formation and self-limiting, the correct diagnosis may be overlooked. To the author's knowledge, septic arthritis of bilateral facet joints has not been previously described in the literature.

Methods

A 72-year-old woman without any systemic illness was hospitalized because of acute severe back pain and high fever. Examination showed local tenderness over the lower lumbar region. Magnetic resonance imaging showed widened facet joints, abscess in the joints, and paraspinal involvement, which aided diagnosis and preoperative planning.

Results

The infection did not respond to intravenous antibiotics therapy, so a thorough debridement of the bilateral facet joints was performed. At the latest follow-up assessment, the patient remained afebrile and had a marked reduction of low back pain.

Conclusions

Septic arthritis of the lumbar facet joint is a rare cause of low back pain. It is important to ascertain the diagnosis at the earliest possible stage and to start intravenous antibiotics therapy as soon as possible. Magnetic resonance imaging is a quite sensitive method for identifying infection of the lumbar facet joint. Surgical debridement may be necessary if antibiotic therapy fails.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study sample

The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) is a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal observational cohort study of men and women aged 45 to 79 years at enrollment, all with or at increased risk of developing symptomatic, radiographic knee OA.OAI participants from Projects 22, 46, 47, and 48 (see Supplementary Material S1) without TF radiographic disease (Kellgren–Lawrence [KL] grade 0 or 1) in both knees and who had complete MRI readings in at least one knee at the baseline visit constituted our analysis sample. Each participant contributed one knee (right knee, or left knee if right knee MRI data were unavailable) for analysis.

OAI eligibility criteria for increased risk of symptomatic, radiographic knee OAwere knee symptoms in the past 12 months, overweight, knee injury causing difficulty walking for ≥ 1 week, history of any knee surgery, family history of total knee replacement for OA in a biologic parent or sibling, Heberden's nodes, repetitive knee bending at or outside of work, and being 70 to 79 years of age. OAI exclusion criteriawere rheumatoid or inflammatory arthritis, severe bilateral joint space narrowing, unilateral total knee replacement and severe contralateral joint space narrowing, bilateral total knee replacement or plan for it in the next three years, contraindications to MRI, positive pregnancy test, inability to provide a blood sample, use of walking aids other than a single straight cane for > 50% of the time during ambulation, severe comorbidity, or current participation in a double‐blind randomized trial. The institutional review board at each site approved the study, and all participants gave written informed consent. OAI data are publicly available at.

Assessment of‐based knee lesions

MRI data were acquired using 3T Siemens Trio scanners at each site, including sequences of coronal intermediate‐weighted (IW) turbo spin echo (TSE), sagittal IW TSE with fat‐suppression, and 3D dual‐echo steady‐state water excitation, obtained in the sagittal plane with coronal and axial multiplanar reconstructions. MRI assessments were performed on the right knee, or left knee if the images of the right knee were technically unacceptable. Three expert musculoskeletal radiologists (FWR and AG), anonymized to all other study data, scored the extent of tissue lesions using the MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS). Reading reliability demonstrated very good (0.61–0.80) or excellent (0.81–1.00) agreement. Paired images were read with known chronology.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^113ov2ev]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical facet joint pain — diagnostic considerations indicate limited certainty from routine history, examination, and imaging. The diagnosis of facet joint pain may not be made based on a radiologic evaluation or clinical assessment with certainty, and local tenderness and a manual examination of the cervical spine are not diagnostic. There is little information on the validity or utility of a self-reported history, although some features of inspection, range of motion, strength, palpation, and provocation tests can be useful, and range of motion has been described to be moderately reliable. Chronic whiplash-associated disorder patients and subjects with neck pain and myalgia have less cervical spine mobility, and patients with chronic neck pain may have slightly lower neck muscle strength compared with controls. Diagnosis prediction guides may allow practitioners to use a patient's history, self-report measures, and physical examination toward selecting the patient for cervical diagnostic facet joint blocks. Imaging statements include that there is no evidence that common degenerative changes on a cervical MRI are strongly correlated with neck pain symptoms; the evidence illustrates that these changes are highly prevalent in asymptomatic subjects and are also prevalent with increasing age; there is no evidence that such changes are associated with pain in patients with suspected cervicogenic headache; evaluation of acute unilateral neck pain with restricted motion showed no synovial effusion or inflammation around the cervical joints on MRI; and single photon emission computerized tomography scan uptake into the facet joints was present in only 43% of patients.

### Predictors of patient-reported outcomes of total joint arthroplasty in a developing country [^111Seuy4]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In response to the growing burden of joint disease, developing countries are starting to create their own total joint arthroplasty (TJA) programs. To date, there has been limited research on predictors of TJA outcomes in a developing country. This investigation uses patient-reported outcome measures collected by a medical mission to assess predictors of TJA outcomes in the Dominican Republic.

Methods

Baseline and postoperative information from 156 of the mission's recipients of hip and knee TJA was used. Demographics were abstracted from clinical notes, and self-reported pain and functional status were assessed using Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index and Short-Form 36 measures. Bivariate analysis identified variables to include in multivariable regression models of factors associated with function and pain outcomes and improvement in these domains 1 or 2 years postoperatively.

Results

The cohort had a mean age of 61.3 years, 82% were female, 79% had total knee arthroplasty, and 42% of the procedures were bilateral. In multivariate analyses, at P < .05, male sex, better preoperative function, and use of bilateral procedure were associated with better functional outcome. Male sex and worse preoperative pain were associated with better pain outcome. Worse preoperative pain and function, as well as bilateral surgery were associated with greater improvement in function. Additionally, a greater number of bothersome joints was associated with greater pain reduction.

Conclusion

Our findings of better follow-up pain scores among patients with worse pain preoperatively and better functional improvement among those undergoing bilateral replacements contrast with study results from developed countries. The explanations for these observations merit further study.

### Magnetic resonance imaging-defined osteoarthritis features and anterior knee pain in individuals with, or at risk for, knee osteoarthritis: a multicenter study on osteoarthritis [^116yBSSW]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Within‐person matched‐knee analyses may be problematic, however, in cases where the exposure is potentially bilateral. Individuals with knee OA commonly have bilateral involvement or progress from unilateral to bilateral OA over time. Thus, individuals with unilateral pain may still present with bilateral OA features that remain preclinical, or asymptomatic, in the contralateral side, or they may be at risk for developing bilateral OA features. Consequently, these individuals would be at risk for developing bilateral pain. A cross‐sectional study design cannot capture the temporal trajectory of bilateral pain and OA features, and thus a study design like this may represent overmatching. Our data support the possibility of overmatching for some OA features. For example, the prevalence of cartilage damage was symmetrical between knees in our within‐person analyses (~40% in both knees, medial and lateral patellofemoral joints), but overall, the prevalence of cartilage damage was higher in knees without frequent knee pain in the within‐person sample compared to knees without frequent knee pain in the between‐group sample (19–24%). This suggests that our within‐person sample, while presenting with unilateral AKP, may in fact have a higher prevalence of bilateral OA features. This possible overmatching limits the generalizability of our findings that patellofemoral cartilage was not associated with AKP using this first approach.

The between‐group approach does not consider contralateral knees, and this allows for a larger sample that meets eligibility criteria. This approach may be more generalizable to individuals at different stages of unilateral or bilateral OA and those with unilateral or bilateral pain. However, confounders are adjusted statistically, which is a weaker approach to controlling for confounding than the within‐person matched‐knee design. While person‐level confounders cannot be eliminated using this approach, there may be less selection bias, which is particularly relevant for OA features that tend to present bilaterally. With this approach, cartilage damage and BMLs were associated with AKP. Importantly, cartilage is aneural, so this positive finding likely reflects that cartilage damage is a surrogate marker for a different pain‐generating feature, in this case possibly BMLs. A mediation analysis in a larger cohort could confirm this.

### Spinal anesthesia in a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis [^1134ct8D]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a rare, hereditary, autonomic recessive disorder. The inability to perceive pain results from loss of nociceptive afferents, while anhidrosis is caused by loss of innervation to the sweat glands. Insensitivity to pain and mental retardation lead to self-inflicted injuries, corneal lacerations, painless bony fractures, joint deformities with consequent chronic osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. There are only a few reports on the anesthetic management for patients with CIPA. We describe the anesthetic management of a young woman with CIPA receiving bilateral arthrodesis of the ankle.

### Multiple joint osteonecrosis in a patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids [^1117M8qR]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

We present the first report of bilateral knee and left ankle osteonecrosis in a 58-year-old female patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids. Initially, our patient presented with progressive disabling knee pain with normal radiographs. The patient was presumed to have mild degenerative joint disease; therefore, she was treated conservatively. Then, the patient developed severe left ankle pain, and she was thought to have L5/S1 radiculopathy; therefore, she underwent epidural steroid injection that did not provide any benefit. However, extensive bilateral osteonecrosis of the medial tibial plateau in addition to osteonecrosis of the talus bone of left ankle were later diagnosed by MRI. The patient underwent staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. In conclusion, the diagnosis of osteonecrosis might be challenging because of overlapping clinical presentation with other disorders particularly in the early stage of the disease with normal radiographs. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and thorough history with supplemental MRI imaging are essential for the assessment of patients presented with atypical refractory joint pain particularly in the presence of risk factors.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^113PUY3o]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis — Clinicians should consider diagnostic categories other than nonarthritic joint pain when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section of this guideline or when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the impairments of body function.

### Knee pain predicts subsequent shoulder pain and the association is mediated by leg weakness: longitudinal observational data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^113vy9Db]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether the "spread" of joint pain is related to pain-associated muscle loss in 1 joint leading to increased loading and subsequent pain in other joints.

Methods

Associations between persistent knee pain (pain in 1 or 2 knees over 0–3 years vs no persistent pain) and incident shoulder pain at Year 4 were examined in participants from the longitudinal National Institutes of Health Osteoarthritis Initiative. Associations were assessed using log multinomial modeling, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, depression score, other lower limb pain, and baseline leg weakness (difficulty standing from a sitting position).

Results

In older adults with clinically significant knee osteoarthritis (OA) or at risk of knee OA (n = 3486), the number of painful joints increased yearly, from 2.1 joints (95% CI 2.0–2.2) at baseline increasing by 5.2% (95% CI 2.2–8.3) at Year 4. Shoulders were the next most commonly affected joints after knees (28.5%). Persistent pain in 1 or 2 knees increased risk of bilateral shoulder pain at Year 4 [1 knee: relative risk (RR) 1.59, 95% CI 0.97–2.61; 2 knees: RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.17–3.49] after adjustment for confounders. Further adjustment for leg weakness attenuated effect sizes (1 knee: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.60–2.11; 2 knees: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.75–2.77), indicating mediation by functional leg weakness.

Conclusion

Spread of joint pain is not random. Persistently painful knees predict new bilateral shoulder pain, which is likely mediated by leg weakness, suggesting that biomechanical factors influence the spread of pain.

### The association of variations in hip and pelvic geometry with pregnancy-related sacroiliac joint pain based on a longitudinal analysis [^112oEQg5]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study using radiological measurements and longitudinal data analysis.

Objective

We aim to explore hip/pelvic geometry on anteroposterior radiographs and examine if such parameters are associated with clinical symptoms.

Summary Of Background Data

Pregnancy-related sacroiliac joint pain is a common disease and is responsible to the disability of daily activities. The etiology is likely to be correlated with the biomechanical factors which are determined by trunk load and hip/pelvic geometry. Previous studies have already found the association between symptoms and weight increase during pregnancy. However, the relationship between bony anatomy and pregnancy-related sacroiliac joint pain remains unknown.

Methods

In total, 72 women were included in the final analysis. In pregnant women with self-reported sacroiliac joint pain, pain scores at 12, 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy were recorded and included in a mixed-effect linear regression model as dependent variables. The radiological measurements were included as independent variables. Furthermore, to investigate the relationship between hip/pelvic geometry and the activity-specific nociceptive phenomenon, the radiological measurements between patients with and without activity-induced pain were compared using a binominal logistic regression model.

Results

The relative bilateral is chial tuberosity distance (betta coefficient: 0.078; P = 0.015) and the relative bilateral femoral head length (betta coefficient: 0.011; P = 0.028) showed significant interactions with the slope of pain scores. Moreover, women whose pain exacerbate during prolonged walking had a higher odds in hip/pelvic geometry of the bilateral ischial tuberosity distance (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12; P = 0.050) and the bilateral femoral head length (OR: 1.16; P = 0.076) with approximately significant P-value.

Conclusion

These data indicate hip/pelvic anatomical variations are associated with the degree of pain increasing and the activity-specific pain during pregnancy, which may help to have further understanding on the biomechanical factor in developing pregnancy-related sacroiliac joint pain.

### Bilateral transient osteoporosis of the hip in a 20-year-old man [^117Lf5yv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Transient osteoporosis is a rare musculoskeletal condition that has been reported in pregnant women and middle-aged men. We present a bilateral case in a young man. A 20-year-old man presented with spontaneous onset left hip pain. Investigations excluded other differential diagnoses such as infection or fracture. The pain resolved completely; 6 months later the patient presented with a similar episode of pain in the contralateral hip. This also resolved spontaneously. Doctors need to be aware of the possibility of spontaneous onset musculoskeletal pain due to transient osteoporosis occurring in young men. The typical presentation is of spontaneous onset progressive pain, often affecting the hip. Other pathology must be excluded. The investigation of choice is MRI, and the treatment is simple analgesia.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^114off2h]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Disease course, clinical presentation, and risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) — OA is diagnosed at a median of 55 years of age, and patients may live approximately 30 years with the disease; patients with symptomatic OA typically present with joint pain, aching, stiffness, and limited walking ability; knee OA is usually bilateral but one knee may be affected more severely, while hip OA is frequently unilateral; OA can progress to severe, disabling pain eventually resulting in structural and functional joint failure; depression and catastrophizing are common, and sleep problems were reported in 72% of adults older than 55 years with OA; patient-level risk factors include older age, female sex, overweight and obesity, genetics, race, and engagement in certain work or recreational activities; weight gain can exacerbate symptoms and for Veterans and active duty Service Members with OA, providers should try to avoid prescription medications that promote weight gain and suggest the use of agents that promote weight loss; heavy work activities or work that requires frequent kneeling, heavy lifting, or repetitive use of joints is associated with the development of OA, and studies also show a strong association between high-impact sports and the development of OA; joint-related factors include previous injury to the knee or hip, knee malalignment, joint shape, increased bone density, knee extensor muscle weakness, joint laxity, joint deformities such as cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia, and abnormal loading of joints, with less well-defined potential risk factors including knee extensor muscle weakness and smoking; there is no cure for OA and overall management is aimed at reducing pain and improving function, and for patients with refractory, disabling pain, the most effective treatment is total joint replacement.

### Bilateral magnetic resonance imaging findings in individuals with unilateral shoulder pain [^115ociuN]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to diagnose structural abnormalities in the shoulder. However, subsequent findings may not be the source of symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine comparative MRI findings across both shoulders of individuals with unilateral shoulder symptoms.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively evaluated 123 individuals from the community who had self-reported unilateral shoulder pain with no signs of adhesive capsulitis, no substantial range-of-motion deficit, no history of upper-limb fractures, no repeated shoulder dislocations, and no neck-related pain. Images in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes with T1, T2, and proton density sequences were generated and independently and randomly interpreted by 2 examiners: a board-certified, fellowship-trained orthopedic shoulder surgeon and a musculoskeletal radiologist. Absolute and relative frequencies for each MRI finding were calculated and compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic shoulders. Agreement between the shoulder surgeon and the radiologist was also determined.

Results

Abnormal MRI findings were highly prevalent in both shoulders. Only the frequencies of full-thickness tears in the supraspinatus tendon and glenohumeral osteoarthritis were higher (approximately 10%) in the symptomatic shoulder according to the surgeon's findings. Agreement between the musculoskeletal radiologist and shoulder surgeon ranged from slight to moderate (0.00–0.51).

Conclusion

Most abnormal MRI findings were not different in frequency between symptomatic and asymptomatic shoulders. Clinicians should be aware of the common anatomic findings on MRI when considering diagnostic and treatment planning.

### Is joint pain in patients with arthralgia suspicious for progression to rheumatoid arthritis explained by subclinical inflammation? A cross-sectional MRI study [^111aBpdr]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The development of RA includes a phase of arthralgia preceding clinical arthritis. The aetiology of symptoms of arthralgia is unclear. Since subclinical joint inflammation is expected to be causally related to pain, we aimed to study associations between subclinical MRI-detected inflammation and pain in patients with arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA.

Methods

Unilateral MRIs of the wrist, MCP (2–5) and MTP (1–5) joints of 325 patients who fulfilled the EULAR definition of arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA were scored by two readers on subclinical inflammation (synovitis, bone marrow oedema and tenosynovitis). Associations between MRI-detected inflammation and overall pain severity at patient level (measured using the visual analogue scale), as well as with local joint tenderness, were studied. Analyses were stratified for ACPA.

Results

At patient level, synovitis (β = 0.10, P = 0.048) and tenosynovitis (β = 0.11, P = 0.026) associated with the visual analogue scale pain. Of the 1620 imaged joints, 447 (28%) were tender. MRI-detected synovitis associated independently with joint tenderness in all patients (odds ratio 1.74, P < 0.001), and in the ACPA-negative stratum (odds ratio 1.96, P < 0.001). In the ACPA-positive stratum only bone marrow oedema (osteitis) was independently associated with tenderness (odds ratio 2.39, P = 0.005). Sensitivity analyses in patients who developed inflammatory arthritis during follow-up (n = 61) revealed similar associations. Subclinical inflammation was present in 51% of tender joints and 39% of non-tender joints.

Conclusion

In patients with arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA, MRI-detected subclinical inflammation is associated with overall pain and local joint tenderness. However, the association is partial, indicating that subclinical inflammation is not the sole explanation of the arthralgia.

### Patterns of multisite pain and associations with risk factors [^115UDWZW]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

3 Results

The total CUPID study sample comprised 12,426 participants, but 16 were excluded from the current analysis because of incomplete information about the occurrence of pain at some anatomical sites. Among the remaining 12,410, the number by occupational group ranged from 92 to 1010 (Table 1).

Table 2 shows the 1-month prevalence of pain at each of the 10 anatomical sites, and the associations between pain at pairs of sites, summarised by ORs. Pain was reported most frequently in the low back (35.7%) and neck (31.0%), and least often in the right elbow (6.6%) and left elbow (4.3%). Participants who had pain at one anatomical site were more likely than those who did not, to have pain at other given sites (ORs ⩾2.5 for all pairs of sites). However, the strongest associations were for pain at corresponding sites bilaterally (ORs 23.0 for right and left knee, 21.5 for right and left elbow, 18.7 for right and left wrist/hand, and 10.8 for right and left shoulder). Higher ORs (5.0 to 10.2) were also observed for pain at adjacent anatomical sites in the upper limb (neck with shoulder, shoulder with ipsilateral elbow, and elbow with ipsilateral wrist/hand).

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^112duNco]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Referral patterns of pain for pain arising from cervical facet joints

The referral patterns of pain arising from the cervical facet joints have been evaluated in volunteersand in patients with pain proven to arise from the cervical facet joints. Dwyer et al performed IA facet joint injections in four volunteers and one patient with neck pain to map the area of pain produced by injection into each joint (figure 2A, B). Stimulation of the C2–3 joint by capsular distension was associated with upper neck pain that extended into the head (often towards the ear, vertex, forehead, or eye). Stimulating the C5–6 joint resulted in pain radiating into the lower neck, top of the scapula, and shoulder above the level of the scapular spine that was distinguishable from pain extending caudally to the scapular spine from irritation of the C6–7 joint. Injections into the C3–4 joint resulted in pain in the neck extending from the suboccipital region to the lower neck without involving the shoulder, whereas injection into the C4–5 joint caused pain that was more caudal, in the top of the shoulder and lower part of the neck.

Cooper et al conducted a study in 194 patients with neck pain who received dual LA diagnostic MBB. They reported the most common cervical facet joints associated with neck pain were C2–3 (36%), followed by C5–6 (35%), and C6–7 (17%). Joints at C1–2, C3–4, C4–5, and were each symptomatic in less than 5% of cases. Among patients with cervical facet joint pain, 52% had only 1 symptomatic joint. In the remainder, multiple symptomatic joints occurred in various combinations. These included bilateral joints at the same segment (eg, C2–3 or C5–6), adjacent joints on the same side (eg, C5–6, C6–7), and non-adjacent joints on the same side (C2–3 and C5–6). When C3–4 and C4–5 facet joints were symptomatic, it was usually in combination with an adjacent joint (table 5).

### Pamidronate disodium [^112TcmjC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal Pain

In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates. This category of drugs includes pamidronate disodium. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

Atypical fractures of the femur

Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including pamidronate disodium. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established.

Carpal tunnel syndrome, although rare, is known to occur in children mainly because of genetic or metabolic disorders. The clinical findings are variable and include symptoms of burning pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness or atrophy in the hands of the patients. It is usually diagnosed by demonstration of prolonged distal latency times during the electrodiagnostic studies. Reported here is a patient with juvenile chronic arthritis and a diagnosis of severe bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, the first patient reported in the literature, to the best of the authors' knowledge.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1124uUZ4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Polyarticular joint pain involves five or more joints and can be inflammatory or noninflammatory. Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0.25% of adults worldwide. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history of the patient's symptoms, with a focus on inflammation, location of pain, duration of symptoms, the presence of systemic symptoms, and any exposures to pathogens that could cause arthritis. Redness, warmth, or swelling in a joint is suggestive of synovitis and joint inflammation. A systematic approach to the physical examination that assesses for a pattern of joint involvement and presence of synovitis can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests, joint aspiration, and imaging studies should be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody tests are helpful when there is concern for rheumatoid arthritis. Although magnetic resonance imaging is highly sensitive in identifying erosive bony changes and inflammation, conventional radiography remains the standard for the initial imaging evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a useful tool to detect findings that support a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis.

### Pseudogout attack of the lumbar facet joint: a case report [^111ExioL]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case of acute low back pain caused by pseudogout attack of the lumbar facet joint is reported.

Objective

To report a new cause of acute low back pain previously unreported in the literature.

Summary Of Background Data

There have been some reports of lumbar spinal stenosis caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition. However, there are no known reports of pseudogout attack of the lumbar facet joint.

Methods

An axial magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated joint effusion at the level of the bilateral L4-L5 facet joint. Aspiration of the left L4-L5 facet joint yielded 1.5 mL of pus-like synovial effusion. Multiple cultures of synovial fluid tested negative for bacteria and fungi, whereas compensated polarized light microscopy revealed monoclinic or triclinic crystals with a positive birefringence.

Results

The symptoms of acute low back pain lasted for 3 days. Local and systemic inflammatory signs, as well as symptoms, gradually improved after joint aspiration. A follow-up evaluation 8 months after lumbar facet joint aspiration showed complete resolution of pain and no neurologic deficit.

Conclusions

Pseudogout attack of the lumbar facet joint is rare, but this clinical entity should be added to the differential diagnosis of acute low back pain.

### A girl with bilateral temporomandibular joint pain, generalized arthralgias, and inability to walk [^111zBW5w]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The authors present the case of a 6.5-year-old girl with bilateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, generalized arthralgias, inability to walk, and absence of deep tendon reflexes in the context of Guillain-Barrè syndrome. TMJ pain was the sole manifestation for 3 days, before other typical symptoms appeared, an issue that initially led to an improper diagnosis. A thorough clinical examination along with laboratory and radiographic evaluation excluded other possible causes of TMJ pain. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of Guillain-Barrè syndrome in the pediatric population initially presenting with bilateral TMJ pain. Guillain-Barrè syndrome may be quite atypical in its expression, especially in young children, with pain being a common presenting symptom, and pediatricians should be alert to avoid misdiagnosis.

Multiple Limb Affection as a Red Flag

CRPS normally starts in one extremity. However, if pain and skin reddening start bilaterally in the feet, possible reasons are peripheral neuropathies like erythromelalgia, small fiber polyneuropathy, or spinal cord affection. Pain starting in both arms might indicate cervical spinal cord pathology like syringomyelia. Rarely, CRPS spreads, eg, to the mirror image limb. For evaluating possible spreading of CRPS, the full diagnostic criteria must be applied to each limb. The spread of CRPS follows a continuous hemibody or mirror image pattern, whereas spread to unrelated extremities is rare and usually preceded by a new trauma. Diagnosis of spreading CRPS first needs exclusion of a systemic (eg, autoimmune disease) or spinal cord pathology. CRPS patients often have diffuse complaints and pain in multiple regions distant from the CRPS limb without the typical CRPS signs like discoloration, temperature difference, sweating, and passive limb movement restriction. This is not spread of CRPS but maybe related to overuse of unaffected limbs. Alternatively, the spread of pain (without signs of CRPS) may be due to not CRPS – specific central sensitization mechanisms or disruptions in pain-controlresulting in hypersensitivity to both noxious and non-noxious stimuli, which is denominated "central sensitization syndrome" and often described in fibromyalgia. The central sensitization inventory may be helpful to get an idea for such a differential diagnosis.

Protection or guidance of the CRPS extremity can lead to inappropriate overuse of contralateral joints, overuse-induced nerve entrapment (eg, contralateral carpal tunnel syndrome)or myofascial pain because of non-physiological movement patterns. Moreover, the chronic use of crutches in leg CRPS may lead to ulnar nerve compression and neuropathic pain related to but finally independent from CRPS. A list of some of the possible differential diagnoses to CRPS is provided in Table 3.

Pain profile 3 captures medical pain conditions

The third unique pain profile in turn tracked primarily medical conditions that can cause pain. Leading indicators of pain experienced in the context of medical conditions referenced the presence of osteoarthritis of one or more joints, cancer pain, gout, carpal tunnel, diabetes, and diabetic neuropathy (see Fig. 3 for summary and Supplementary Table 3 for full details). Additional relevant domains include musculoskeletal pain (of leg, knee, and arm), sleep (insomnia), abdominal pain, pain interference, and pain intensity (reporting pain in the present moment). Complimentary to the previous two pain profiles, the third pain profile showed above-average weightings for the bilateral default mode network, the right control network, bilateral visual networks and bilateral somatomotor networks (see Supplementary Fig. 4).

Medication-WAS showed associations with drugs used to manage pain (non-opioid analgesics and antipyretics, including gabapentinoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and paracetamol/acetaminophen), mood (anti-depressants), metabolic disease (anti-gout medications, glucose and lipid-lowering agents), and female-related hormone changes (estrogens, calcium, bone anti-resorptive drugs). Diagnosis-WAS showed strongest associations with sex-related cancers (female, breast) and metabolic disease (diabetes mellitus, peripheral nerve disorder) as well as associations with menopausal and digestive disorders. Phenome-WAS showed associations with socioeconomic status (rent/owning, employment status), lifestyle (weekly mobile phone usage, sleep quality/duration, time spent driving), and modifiable risk factors of chronic disease including physical measures of body habitus (e.g. leg, arm, whole body mass), substance use (alcohol and smoking), and blood pressure. Similar to the third profile, blood assay measures indicative of metabolic (e.g. cholesterol, urate, creatinine, testosterone, hematocrit/hemoglobin) or endocrine (testosterone, vitamin D, sex-hormone binding globulin) disorders were also associated with the third pain profile. Further results can be referenced in Supplementary Fig. 5 (MedWAS), Supplementary Fig. 6 (DiWAS), and Supplementary Fig. 7 (PheWAS).

Thoracic chronic mid/upper back pain — diagnostic emphasis is on facet joint assessment and controlled diagnostic blocks, with fair evidence for thoracic interlaminar epidural injections; facet joint pain is bilateral in 64% to 84% of cases and involves 3 or more joints in 81% to 94% of patients, diagnostic blocks must be performed under controlled conditions, and a positive diagnosis requires at least 75% relief with concordant anesthetic duration response; thoracic provocation discography is seldom performed, and once facet joint pain is excluded, the patient may be treated with epidural injections.

Joint Pain

Joint pain can have many causes. Differential diagnosis includes trauma (eg, sprain, tendinitis), infection, crystal-induced arthropathy (eg, gout), degenerative joint disease (eg, osteoarthritis), malignancy, rheumatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), and other conditions, such as Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, and fibromyalgia. When assessing chronic joint pain, the physician should ask about the location(s), onset, and progression of the pain as well as the presence of systemic symptoms. In addition to the patient's medical history, a family history of joint disease and rheumatic conditions should be reviewed. Physical examination involves inspection, palpation, range of motion, and other specialized tests. The occurrence of nocturnal or unremitting pain, systemic symptoms such as fever/chills or weight loss, or significant disability should prompt an immediate workup and referral. During physical examination, warm skin, erythema, and joint swelling indicate a need for a more urgent workup and are suggestive of conditions such as infection and/or autoimmune disease. Radiography is suggested if the patient displays swelling or tenderness, inability to bear weight, gross deformity, and older age. Laboratory tests do not often play a key role in the diagnosis of joint pain. Blood tests such as ESR and CRP can be helpful to rule out an autoimmune disorder, but other laboratory tests such as rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, ANA, and other auto-antibodies are often best ordered only when there is a strong clinical suspicion of an autoimmune disorder. Elevated ESR and CRP are also often elevated in other conditions such as systemic infections or malignancy.

Hair Loss

Hair loss (alopecia) can be divided into cases in which the hair follicle is damaged and those in which the hair follicle is normal but hair growth cycle is abnormal. A thorough medical history includes details on hair loss (duration and pattern), presence of breakage or shedding at the roots, and increased or decreased shedding or thinning. Family history of alopecia, past and present medical conditions, diet, and current medications should also be reviewed. A thyroid function test should be performed, and patients should be referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation.

History and Physical Exam

SIJ disorders are best differentiated from other forms of low back pain by using a combination of diagnostic modalities, including obtaining a thorough history and physical examination. SIJ pain typically presents as a uni- or bilateral aching pain below the L5 level without numbness or paresthesia (tingling). Patients typically report low back pain that is worse after prolonged sitting, bending forward, and with transfers out of a bed or up from a low chair or toilet. Pain in these patients may worsen after performing weight-bearing activities, such as climbing stairs, bending, twisting, or even prolonged walking. Repetitive bending with activities such as vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, pulling weeds and loading a dishwasher can also exacerbate SIJ pain. Gait is often compromised in individuals with SIJ pain. This dysfunction involves reduced coactivation of the gluteus maximus and contralateral latissimus dorsi, which together provide joint stability during walking.

While no single physical exam maneuver is diagnostic, a combination of specific findings and provocative tests can be essential in determining SIJ disorders. Specific physical exam provocative tests for SIJ dysfunction include FABER, compression, distraction, thigh thrust, and Gaenslen tests. Typically, SIJ pain is diagnosed when at least three out of the five provocative maneuvers are positive. Of the three positive tests, either the thigh thrust or compression test should be positive. By performing these provocative maneuvers, there is an 85% pretest probability that an intra-articular joint injection will be successful. Another study confirmed that three or more pain provocation SIJ tests have a 91% sensitivity and 78% specificity.

Patient 2

Patient 1's 13-year-old sister had pain, limitation of movement, and bilateral deformities in her hands, feet, and shoulder joints. Since infancy she had bilateral limitation of finger movement, and at age 6 years bilateral pain and deformities began in her elbows, knees, ankles, and toes. Upon physical examination there was bilateral limited range of motion and contractures in the knees, wrists, elbows, and ankles. Hip and shoulder movements were painful. There were flexion contractures in the 3rd and 4th PIP joints of the right hand, and flexion contractures in the 4th PIP joints of the left hand. Other systemic examinations were normal. No other family member had similar complaints. Radiological evaluation of patient 2 was given in Fig. 1.

Measures

Participants completed a BPD (Figure 1) at baseline and at least one of the 6‐ or 12‐month visits. They were given explicit instructions to record nonjoint pain on the BPD (eg, "Do you have pain in areas other than your joints?"). If so, they were instructed to mark on the BPD where they had pain. Patients were grouped by prespecified patterns of NAP (Figure 1) reported in four quadrants (right upper, right lower, left upper, and left lower) and axial sections as follows: (1) none, (2) regional NAP if one to three painful sections (three sections if limited to one half of the body (upper half, lower half, right half, or left half), and (3) widespread NAP if three to four painful sections (three sections if bilateral plus above and below the waist). Prior work has defined widespread pain as having a minimum of three or four painful sections on the BPD. Based on our criteria, the maximum number of sections possible was four (Figure 1). Hands and feet were excluded from these definitions. We have found that patients with three painful sections had clinical features that tracked more closely with those with four sections than those with one to two sections (Supplementary Table 1), so we included those with three sections in our widespread NAP definition. To ensure more accurate classification, we split patients who had three sections into two groups: (1) we assigned participants whose NAP was more extensive as defined above into the widespread NAP group and (2) we assigned participants who did not meet this more extensive criteria to the regional NAP group.

We calculated the frequencies and evolution of different NAP patterns at baseline and over the 12 months of follow‐up. Recurring NAP was defined as NAP reported at baseline, not at 6 months, and again at 12 months. Persisting NAP was defined as NAP occurring at all available timepoints of baseline and 6 and 12 months. We compared the frequency of regional and widespread NAP recurring or persisting in the same sections. Regional NAP could evolve to widespread NAP over time, and, conversely, widespread NAP could evolve to regional NAP. We assessed the proportions of tender and/or swollen large proximal joints (shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees) by the presence of pain in each corresponding NAP section reported on the BPD. Small joints in hands and feet were not included because they were not included in our definitions of NAP.
