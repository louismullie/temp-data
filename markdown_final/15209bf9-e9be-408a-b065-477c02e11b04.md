## Question

Duloxotine and buspar together

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether duloxetine and buspirone can be used together, what the key risks are, how to monitor, and what the evidence says about efficacy and tolerability. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled indications of each drug. Then, I should verify the documented interaction mechanisms and the strength of evidence for serotonin syndrome. Next, I will review pharmacokinetic considerations and whether duloxetine alters buspirone metabolism. After that, I need to check clinical evidence for efficacy and tolerability of the combination. Finally, I will outline a practical, safety-focused prescribing approach with monitoring, counseling, and when to avoid the combination altogether [^117G3a2S] [^115N2yd9].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and indications. Duloxetine is an SNRI indicated for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, diabetic neuropathic pain, and chronic musculoskeletal pain, acting by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, which increases synaptic serotonin and carries serotonergic safety considerations [^117G3a2S]. Buspirone is a 5-HT1A partial agonist indicated for generalized anxiety disorder and short-term relief of anxiety symptoms; it lacks benzodiazepine-like dependence liability but remains serotonergic via 5-HT1A agonism, which is relevant for additive serotonergic effects when combined with SNRIs or SSRIs [^115XEwrm] [^115N2yd9].

> Wait, let me verify the core interaction risk. The FDA labeling for duloxetine explicitly warns that concomitant use with other serotonergic drugs, including buspirone, increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly during initiation and dose increases; patients should be monitored for mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and if serotonin syndrome occurs, duloxetine and/or the concomitant serotonergic agent should be discontinued and supportive care initiated [^117G3a2S] [^114EzFty]. I should also confirm that this risk is not theoretical; postmarketing reports and class labeling support this concern, and the same warning appears across SNRI labels, reinforcing the need for vigilance when combining with 5-HT1A agonists like buspirone [^114EzFty] [^112X2CA8].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacokinetic interactions beyond pharmacodynamics. DrugBank notes that duloxetine may decrease the metabolism of buspirone, which could increase buspirone exposure; mechanistically, this would fit with CYP3A4 involvement in buspirone clearance and the potential for CYP inhibition by duloxetine, although the precise in vivo magnitude is not well quantified in the provided sources and warrants cautious interpretation pending direct clinical PK data [^111beGhv]. Let me reconsider: even if the exact magnitude is uncertain, the directionality of increased buspirone levels is plausible and supports conservative dosing and monitoring when combining agents [^111beGhv].

> Next, I should review clinical evidence for efficacy and tolerability of the combination. In STAR*D, augmentation of citalopram with buspirone or bupropion produced similar response and remission rates, but buspirone was less well tolerated with higher discontinuation due to adverse events; importantly, this was augmentation of an SSRI, not duloxetine, so direct extrapolation to duloxetine is imperfect but directionally informative for tolerability concerns with serotonergic combinations [^112XdoJT]. But wait, what if the combination with duloxetine behaves differently? A randomized trial in late-life depression found venlafaxine plus buspirone improved depressive symptoms and cognition versus venlafaxine alone with comparable adverse events, suggesting potential benefit in selected populations, though again this is not duloxetine-specific and requires replication and careful generalization [^114kvK4F]. I should also note that adding buspirone to fluoxetine may delay antidepressant response compared with dose optimization, which cautions against expecting rapid augmentation benefits in all contexts [^1177DoDf].

> I need to ensure I outline a safe prescribing approach if the combination is clinically warranted. Let me first confirm absolute contraindications: avoid combining with MAOIs or within 14 days of MAOI use due to high serotonin syndrome risk, and avoid other potent serotonergic additions when possible; if the combination is used, start low and go slow, for example duloxetine at 30 mg daily with buspirone 7.5 mg twice daily, then titrate buspirone by 5 mg every 2–3 days as tolerated toward 15–30 mg twice daily while watching for adverse effects and overlapping toxicity such as dizziness, nausea, and activation [^115N2yd9] [^117G3a2S]. I should double-check that patients are counseled to report emergent agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, tremor, rigidity, fever, or gastrointestinal upset promptly, and that clinicians monitor vitals and neurologic status during initiation and dose changes to catch early serotonin toxicity [^117G3a2S].

> Next, I should review monitoring and mitigation strategies. Baseline and periodic blood pressure checks are prudent because duloxetine can raise blood pressure and buspirone may cause dizziness or hypotension in some patients, compounding orthostatic risk; patients should be cautioned about falls, especially older adults or those on antihypertensives [^114VSLsY] [^117AUFof]. I need to check for other serotonergic or CYP-interacting drugs that could amplify risk, including triptans, tramadol, linezolid, St. John's wort, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and adjust the plan accordingly; if serotonin syndrome is suspected, discontinue offending agents and provide supportive care per labeling guidance [^117G3a2S] [^114EzFty].

> But wait, what if the patient is treatment-resistant and already optimized on duloxetine? In that scenario, augmentation with buspirone is a reasonable evidence-informed option, acknowledging that benefits may be modest and slower to emerge, and that bupropion augmentation may be somewhat better tolerated; shared decision-making should weigh potential gains against tolerability and the need for closer monitoring in the first weeks after initiation or dose escalation [^112XdoJT] [^117S8eb5]. I should confirm that the patient understands the lack of a robust duloxetine–buspirone evidence base and that we are extrapolating from related data, which underscores the importance of careful monitoring and dose titration [^notfound].

> Finally, I should summarize the bottom line. Yes, duloxetine and buspirone can be used together when clinically indicated, but the combination increases the risk of serotonin syndrome and may worsen tolerability compared with some alternatives; if used, employ conservative starting doses, slow titration, explicit patient counseling on serotonin toxicity symptoms, and vigilant monitoring during initiation and dose changes, while avoiding MAOIs and minimizing other serotonergic polypharmacy when possible [^117G3a2S] [^115N2yd9] [^112XdoJT].

---

Duloxetine and buspirone can be combined when clinically indicated, but the main concern is **serotonin syndrome** [^114EzFty] due to additive serotonergic effects [^117G3a2S]. The risk is highest during initiation and dose changes; monitor for agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, tremor, and hyperreflexia [^112xY4sX]. Buspirone is metabolized by CYP3A4, and duloxetine is a modest CYP2D6 inhibitor; clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely, but monitor for increased buspirone levels if CYP3A4 is inhibited [^115N2yd9]. Use the lowest effective doses, titrate slowly, and avoid other serotonergic drugs or MAOIs [^112xY4sX] to reduce risk.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and interaction potential

### Duloxetine

Duloxetine is a **serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)** that increases serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby improving mood and anxiety symptoms [^115V3k7P]. It is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 [^114VSLsY].

---

### Buspirone

Buspirone is a **5-HT1A receptor partial agonist** used for anxiety, with minimal dopamine antagonism and no significant GABAergic activity, resulting in a lower abuse and dependence potential than benzodiazepines [^117NMvRe]. It is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 [^notfound].

---

### Interaction potential

The primary interaction is **pharmacodynamic**: both drugs increase serotonin, raising the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly during initiation and dose changes [^114EzFty]. Pharmacokinetically, duloxetine's CYP2D6 inhibition is unlikely to significantly affect buspirone metabolism, but CYP3A4 inhibitors could increase buspirone levels and adverse effects [^1129921H].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Evidence and guidelines indicate that duloxetine and buspirone are both effective for anxiety and depression, and **combination therapy is reasonable** when monotherapy is inadequate, with close monitoring for serotonin syndrome [^116gFJxg] [^112d82Sp]. The FDA warns about serotonin syndrome with serotonergic combinations, including duloxetine and buspirone, and advises monitoring during initiation and dose changes [^114EzFty] [^112xY4sX].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

### Serotonin syndrome

Serotonin syndrome is the most serious risk, characterized by mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities [^114EzFty]. It is rare but potentially life-threatening; **monitor closely** during initiation and dose changes [^112xY4sX].

---

### Common adverse effects

| **Duloxetine** | **Buspirone** |
|-|-|
| Nausea | Dizziness |
| Dry mouth | Nausea |
| Headache | Headache |
| Fatigue | Nervousness |
| Insomnia | Lightheadedness |
| Constipation | Excitement |

---

Combined use may increase dizziness, nausea, and headache; start low and titrate slowly to improve tolerability.

---

## Clinical scenarios for combination therapy

Combination therapy may be appropriate when:

- **Residual anxiety**: Anxiety persists despite adequate duloxetine therapy.
- **Treatment-resistant depression**: Augmentation is needed after inadequate response to duloxetine [^117S8eb5].
- **Comorbid anxiety and depression**: Both conditions require targeted pharmacotherapy [^113pyzoS].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Document symptoms, vitals, and medications before starting combination therapy.
- **Slow titration**: Increase doses gradually to minimize adverse effects and detect early serotonin toxicity [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Teach patients to recognize serotonin syndrome symptoms and seek urgent care if they occur [^117AUFof].
- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor for efficacy, adverse effects, and adherence; adjust therapy as needed [^117S8eb5].
- **Avoid other serotonergic drugs**: Minimize concurrent serotonergic agents to reduce serotonin syndrome risk [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatments

If the combination is not tolerated or ineffective, consider:

- **Switching antidepressants**: Try another SNRI or SSRI [^114dKQou].
- **Non-serotonergic augmentation**: Use bupropion or atypical antipsychotics [^114VJXjM].
- **Psychotherapy**: CBT or other behavioral therapies [^112Yzanb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Combination therapy | Consider when monotherapy is inadequate, with close monitoring |
| Primary risk | Serotonin syndrome; monitor during initiation and dose changes |
| Dosing strategy | Start low, titrate slowly, monitor tolerability |
| Patient education | Teach serotonin syndrome symptoms and when to seek care |
| Alternative options | Switch antidepressants, non-serotonergic augmentation, psychotherapy |

---

Duloxetine and buspirone can be combined for anxiety and depression when clinically indicated, but the main risk is **serotonin syndrome** [^114EzFty]. Use the lowest effective doses, titrate slowly, and monitor closely; avoid other serotonergic drugs and MAOIs to reduce risk [^112xY4sX].

### Duloxetine [^117G3a2S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.12 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C19

Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not inhibit CYP2C19 activity at therapeutic concentrations. Inhibition of the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates is therefore not anticipated, although clinical studies have not been performed.

7.13 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

[See Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10), Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

7.14 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with duloxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of duloxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

7.15 Alcohol

When duloxetine and ethanol were administered several hours apart so that peak concentrations of each would coincide, duloxetine did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol.

In the duloxetine clinical trials database, three duloxetine-treated patients had liver injury as manifested by ALT and total bilirubin elevations, with evidence of obstruction. Substantial intercurrent ethanol use was present in each of these cases, and this may have contributed to the abnormalities seen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.12)].

7.16 CNS Drugs

[See Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

7.17 Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein

Because duloxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of duloxetine to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. However, co-administration of duloxetine (60 or 120 mg) with warfarin (2–9 mg), a highly protein-bound drug, did not result in significant changes in INR and in the pharmacokinetics of either total S-or total R-warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors — Advise patients, their families, and their caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, especially during treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down and instruct them to report such symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Administration — Advise patients to swallow duloxetine delayed-release capsules whole and to not chew, crush, or open the capsule (do not sprinkle contents on food or mixed with liquids) because these actions might affect the enteric coating.
Hepatotoxicity — Inform patients that severe liver problems, sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Instruct patients to talk to their healthcare provider if they develop itching, right upper belly pain, dark urine, or yellow skin/eyes while taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules, which may be signs of liver problems. Instruct patients to talk to their healthcare provider about their alcohol consumption. Use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with heavy alcohol intake may be associated with severe liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Alcohol — Although duloxetine delayed-release capsules does not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules concomitantly with heavy alcohol intake may be associated with severe liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.15)].
Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope — Advise patients of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, falls and syncope, especially during the period of initial use and subsequent dose escalation, and in association with the use of concomitant drugs that might potentiate the orthostatic effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Serotonin Syndrome — Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules and other serotonergic agents including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Drug Interactions (7.14)]. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome that may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Caution patients to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms.
Increased Risk of Bleeding — Caution patients about the concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Severe Skin Reactions — Caution patients that duloxetine delayed-release capsules may cause serious skin reactions. This may need to be treated in a hospital and may be life-threatening. Counsel patients to call their doctor right away or get emergency help if they have skin blisters, peeling rash, sores in their mouth, hives, or any other allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Discontinuation of Treatment — Instruct patients that discontinuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules may be associated with symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue, and should be advised not to alter their dosing regimen, or stop taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules without consulting their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
Activation of Mania or Hypomania — Adequately screen patients with depressive symptoms for risk of bipolar disorder (e.g. family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression) prior to initiating treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Advise patients to report any signs or symptoms of a manic reaction such as greatly increased energy, severe trouble sleeping, racing thoughts, reckless behavior, talking more or faster than usual, unusually grand ideas, and excessive happiness or irritability [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
Angle-Closure Glaucoma — Advise patients that taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle-closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
Seizures — Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they have a history of seizure disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
Effects on Blood Pressure — Caution patients that duloxetine delayed-release capsules may cause an increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].
Concomitant Medications — Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter medications, since there is a potential for interactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.12), and Drug Interactions (7)].
Hyponatremia — Advise patients that hyponatremia has been reported as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].
Concomitant Illnesses — Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].
Urinary Hesitation and Retention — Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of medicines that may affect urination. Instruct patients to consult with their healthcare provider if they develop any problems with urine flow [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].
Sexual Dysfunction — Advise patients that use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].
Pregnancy
Advise women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules.
Advise pregnant women or patients who intend to become pregnant that duloxetine delayed-release capsules may increase the risk of neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.
Advise pregnant women that there is a risk of relapse with discontinuation of antidepressants.
Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to duloxetine delayed-release capsules during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Lactation — Advise breastfeeding women using duloxetine delayed-release capsules to monitor infants for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Interference with Psychomotor Performance — Duloxetine delayed-release capsules may be associated with sedation and dizziness. Therefore, caution patients about operating hazardous machinery including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that duloxetine delayed-release capsules therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle-closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
Seizures - Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they have a history of seizure disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
Effects on Blood Pressure - Caution patients that duloxetine delayed-release capsules may cause an increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].
Concomitant Medications - Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter medications, since there is a potential for interactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.12) and Drug Interactions (7)].
Hyponatremia - Advise patients that hyponatremia has been reported as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].
Concomitant Illnesses - Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].
Urinary Hesitation and Retention - Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of medicines that may affect urination. Instruct patients to consult with their healthcare provider if they develop any problems with urine flow [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].
Pregnancy
Advise women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules.
Advise pregnant women or patients who intend to become pregnant that duloxetine delayed-release capsules use during the month before delivery may lead to an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage and may increase the risk of neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.
Advise pregnant women that there is a risk of relapse with discontinuation of antidepressants.
Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to duloxetine during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Lactation - Advise breastfeeding women using duloxetine delayed-release capsules to monitor infants for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Interference with Psychomotor Performance - Duloxetine delayed-release capsules may be associated with sedation and dizziness. Therefore, caution patients about operating hazardous machinery including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that duloxetine delayed-release capsules therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### Generalised anxiety disorder [^111armNe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to one in five people may have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) at some point, and most have other health problems. Less than half of people have full remission after 5 years. GAD may have a genetic component, and has also been linked to previous psychological or other trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for GAD? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 74 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: abecarnil, antidepressants (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, opipramol, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine), antipsychotic drugs (trifluoperazine), applied relaxation, benzodiazepines, buspirone, cognitive behavioural therapy, hydroxyzine, and pregabalin.

5.4	Serotonin Syndrome

The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

The concomitant use of Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules. Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.8, 2.9), and Contraindications (4)].

If concomitant use of Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors – Advise patients, their families, and their caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, especially during treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down and instruct them to report such symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Administration– Advise patients to swallow duloxetine whole and to not chew, crush, or open the capsule (do not sprinkle contents on food or mixed with liquids) because these actions might affect the enteric coating.
Hepatotoxicity – Inform patients that severe liver problems, sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Instruct patients to talk to their healthcare provider if they develop itching, right upper belly pain, dark urine, or yellow skin/eyes while taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules, which may be signs of liver problems. Instruct patients to talk to their healthcare provider about their alcohol consumption. Use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with heavy alcohol intake may be associated with severe liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Alcohol – Although duloxetine delayed-release capsules do not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules concomitantly with heavy alcohol intake may be associated with severe liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.15)].
Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope – Advise patients of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, falls and syncope, especially during the period of initial use and subsequent dose escalation, and in association with the use of concomitant drugs that might potentiate the orthostatic effect of duloxetine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Serotonin Syndrome – Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules and other serotonergic agents including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioid, lithium, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Drug Interactions (7.14)]. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome that may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Caution patients to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms.
Increased Risk of Bleeding – Caution patients about the concomitant use of duloxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Severe Skin Reactions – Caution patients that duloxetine delayed-release capsules may cause serious skin reactions. This may need to be treated in a hospital and may be life-threatening. Counsel patients to call their doctor right away or get emergency help if they have skin blisters, peeling rash, sores in their mouth, hives, or any other allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Discontinuation of Treatment – Instruct patients that discontinuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules may be associated with symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue, and should be advised not to alter their dosing regimen, or stop taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules without consulting their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
Activation of Mania or Hypomania – Adequately screen patients with depressive symptoms for risk of bipolar disorder (e.g. family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression) prior to initiating treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Advise patients to report any signs or symptoms of a manic reaction such as greatly increased energy, severe trouble sleeping, racing thoughts, reckless behavior, talking more or faster than usual, unusually grand ideas, and excessive happiness or irritability [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
Angle-Closure Glaucoma – Advise patients that taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle-closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
Seizures – Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they have a history of seizure disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
Effects on Blood Pressure – Caution patients that duloxetine delayed-release capsules may cause an increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].
Concomitant Medications – Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter medications, since there is a potential for interactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.12), and Drug Interactions (7)].
Hyponatremia – Advise patients that hyponatremia has been reported as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].
Concomitant Illnesses – Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].
Urinary Hesitation and Retention - Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of medicines that may affect urination. Instruct patients to consult with their healthcare provider if they develop any problems with urine flow [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].
Sexual Dysfunction -Advise patients that use of Duloxetine may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].
Pregnancy
Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules.
Advise pregnant women or patients who intend to become pregnant that duloxetine delayed-release capsules use during the month before delivery may lead to an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage and may increase the risk of neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.
Advise pregnant women that there is a risk of relapse with discontinuation of antidepressants.
Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to duloxetine during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Lactation ― Advise breastfeeding women using duloxetine to monitor infants for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Interference with Psychomotor Performance – Duloxetine may be associated with sedation and dizziness. Therefore, caution patients about operating hazardous machinery including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that duloxetine therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### Pharmacological treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116gFJxg]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder is a disease that can be associated with substantial dysfunction. Pharmacological treatment is often the first choice for clinicians because of the cost and resource constraints of psychological alternatives, but there is a paucity of comparative information for the multiple available drug choices.

Methods

A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on randomised trials in adult outpatients with generalised anxiety disorder identified from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang data, Drugs@FDA and commercial pharmaceutical registries. Placebo and active control trials were included. Data were extracted from all manuscripts and reports. Primary outcomes were efficacy (mean difference [MD] in change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale Score) and acceptability (study discontinuations for any cause). We estimated summary mean treatment differences and odds ratios using network meta-analyses with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018087106.

Findings

Studies were published between Jan 1, 1994 and Aug 1, 2017, in which 1992 potential studies were screened for inclusion. This analysis is based on 89 trials, which included 25441 patients randomly assigned to 22 different active drugs or placebo. Duloxetine (MD -3·13, 95% credible interval [CrI] -4·13 to -2·13), pregabalin (MD -2·79, 95% CrI -3·69 to -1·91), venlafaxine (MD -2·69, 95% CrI -3·50 to -1·89), and escitalopram (MD -2·45, 95% CrI -3·27 to -1·63) were more efficacious than placebo with relatively good acceptability. Mirtazapine, sertraline, fluoxetine, buspirone, and agomelatine were also found to be efficacious and well tolerated but these findings were limited by small sample sizes. Quetiapine (MD -3·60 95% CrI -4·83 to -2·39) had the largest effect on HAM-A but it was poorly tolerated (odds ratio 1·44, 95% CrI 1·16–1·80) when compared with placebo. Likewise, paroxetine and benzodiazepines were effective but also poorly tolerated when compared with placebo. Risk of reporting bias was considered low, and when possible all completed studies were included to avoid publication bias.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the largest contemporary review of pharmacological agents for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder by use of network analysis. There are several effective treatment choices for generalised anxiety disorder across classes of medication. The failure of initial pharmacological therapy might not be a reason to abandon a pharmacological treatment strategy.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^111RsquH]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Interventions and comparators

Reviews assessing SSRI monotherapy for the treatment of depression for all licensed SSRIs were included: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. The SSRI zimelidine was not included because it has been withdrawn from the market, owing to its use being associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Antidepressants outside the SSRI class with novel serotonin or mixed receptor effects were excluded: vortioxetine is a direct modulator of serotonergic receptor activity and inhibitor of serotonin reuptake; vilazodone has mixed SSRI and buspirone-like activity; the SNRIs venlafaxine and duloxetine; the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine; and bupropion and agomelatine.

Reviews examining combination treatments (using two or more antidepressants; psychotropic and non-psychotropic medicine augmentation strategies; antidepressant with psychotherapies; and switching antidepressants) were excluded because these strategies can be more effective than monotherapy and can be reserved for treatment resistant depression. Most national guidelinesand drug licenses recommend standard starting doses, which are routinely prescribed in practice, and represent standardised defined daily doses as defined by the World Health Organization. It was therefore considered appropriate to assess baseline standardised comparator dose effects against placebo and higher SSRI doses, but owing to the range of methodologies and reporting methods, it was not possible to summarise the magnitude of effects using defined daily doses.

Outcomes

These outcomes were defined as dose-response effects for efficacy, acceptability, tolerability. Efficacy was defined as a response to antidepressant treatment, which is routinely defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in observer rated depression severity rating scales such as the Hamilton depression rating scale, Montgomery-Ǻsberg depression rating scale, or Beck depression inventory, or remission. Acceptability was defined as early treatment discontinuation (dropout) or non-completion of the study. Tolerability was defined as patients experiencing reported adverse drug effects including death, suicidality, and effects relating to major organ systems (cardiovascular system (eg, arrhythmias, QTc prolongation); central nervous system (eg, headache, anxiety, insomnia, hypersomnia); dermatological; endocrine system; ear; eye; gastrointestinal; genital urinary and reproductive; haematological; musculoskeletal; respiratory; and other non-categorical adverse drug effects).

### Buspirone hydrochloride (busPIRone HCl) [^115N2yd9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg daily (7.5 mg b.i.d.). To achieve an optimal therapeutic response, at intervals of 2 to 3 days the dosage may be increased 5 mg per day, as needed. The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day. In clinical trials allowing dose titration, divided doses of 20 mg to 30 mg per day were commonly employed.

The bioavailability of buspirone is increased when given with food as compared to the fasted state (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Consequently, patients should take buspirone in a consistent manner with regard to the timing of dosing; either always with or always without food.

When buspirone is to be given with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the dosage recommendations described in the PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions section should be followed.

Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of therapy with buspirone. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping buspirone before starting an MAOI antidepressant CONTRAINDICATIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS).

### What alternatives to first-line therapy for depression are effective? [^115Bfngj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Depression is often a chronic illness that requires a methodical, long-term approach to manage it optimally. A single antidepressant trial is often insufficient for patients to achieve remission. Remission rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are about 30% to 35%. Using successive treatment steps with optimal medication dosing and making measurement-based treatment decisions can help patients achieve remission, but, at each step, remission is less likely than at the first step. Depression is considered treatment-resistant if 2 adequate trials of medication fail. Clinicians can use validated symptom checklists such as the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, Global Assessment of Functioning, and Sheehan Disability Scale to identify patients with treatment-resistant depression. Treatment resistance is likely in patients with a history of depressive chronicity and concurrent psychiatric and medical disorders and may be mistakenly suspected in patients who have had an inadequate trial of medication or who have been misdiagnosed. Strategies that can be effective to combat treatment resistance include optimizing treatment, switching to another antidepressant, combining antidepressants, and augmenting antidepressants with nonantidepressant treatments such as buspirone, lithium, liothyronine, atypical antipsychotics, or other agents. In addition, clinicians need to cultivate strong therapeutic alliances with patients, use objective measurements, practice evidence-based medicine, and educate patients about the disease and its treatments.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^115ihUjo]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has surged, with an estimated 1 in 36 eight-year-olds in the United States meeting criteria for ASD in 2020. Autistic individuals face elevated rates of co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and behavioral conditions compared to non-autistic individuals. The rising ASD-patient demand is increasingly outpacing the capacity of ASD-specialty clinics, resulting in urgent need for autism-competent providers in general practice settings. This work aims to empower healthcare providers, especially primary care providers (PCPs), with guidelines for the recognition and safe pharmacologic management of common co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in ASD.

Methods

Lurie Center for Autism medical providers, who have extensive experience in ASD care, delineated approaches for recognition and pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, and irritability tailored to ASD patients. Pharmacological guidelines were iteratively refined until consensus was reached. Treatment differences relative to standard of care (SOC) of non-autistic individuals are noted. Key literature and clinical trial results were reviewed to supplement clinical experience.

Results

The pharmacological treatment pathways reflect how appropriate medication options for ASD patients can depend on many factors unique to the patient and can differ from established non-autistic SOC. Key takeaways include: For sleep disturbances in ASD, initial strategies align with non-autistic SOC, emphasizing sleep hygiene and melatonin use. First-line recommendations for treating ADHD, anxiety, and depression in ASD differ from non-autistic SOC; α 2 -adrenergic agonists are more suitable than stimulants for some ASD-ADHD patients, buspirone and mirtazapine are preferred to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety, and duloxetine, mirtazapine, bupropion, and vortioxetine are recommended ahead of SSRIs for depression. Addressing irritability in ASD requires interdisciplinary evaluation of contributing factors, and guanfacine, risperidone, or aripiprazole may be appropriate, depending on severity.

Conclusions

Recognition and treatment of co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in autistic patients must account for differences in clinical presentation and medication effectiveness and tolerability. Drawing on evidence-based clinical insights, these guidelines seek to support PCPs in making informed decisions when prescribing medications for ASD patients with co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions, ultimately enhancing access to timely, comprehensive care for all individuals with ASD.

American College of Physicians guideline — Second-line treatment for adults with major depressive disorder in the acute phase who did not respond to an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant states that ACP suggests switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) or switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms, comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences. The rationale notes that if a clinically satisfactory response or remission of symptoms (measured by validated scales, such as the PHQ-9) is not achieved with initial monotherapy with an SGA (including dose optimization), switching to monotherapy with CBT or to a different SGA or augmenting SGA monotherapy with CBT or with a second pharmacologic treatment (such as mirtazapine, bupropion, or buspirone) are reasonable approaches and show similar efficacy when compared with each other.

### Faster response in depressive patients treated with fluoxetine alone than in combination with buspirone [^1177DoDf]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare the antidepressant efficacy of standard dose, dose optimization of antidepressant drug and buspirone augmentation strategies.

Methods

120 outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of unipolar depression were randomised to 12-weeks of open label treatment with fluoxetine 20 (flx20) or 40 mg (flx40) daily or fluoxetine 20 mg plus buspirone 20 mg daily (flx20-plus-buspirone). The severity of depression was assessed by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Response was defined as a 50% or greater reduction of the baseline HDRS total score. A response, which began at any time of the study and was maintained until the last visit, was defined as a sustained response.

Results

The proportion of responders was not significantly different among the treatment groups at the endpoint. Survival analysis showed, however, a significant faster response in the patients treated with flx20 or flx40 alone than flx20-plus-buspirone. The mean times to onset of a sustained response were 33, 24 and 40 days, respectively.

Limitations

The lack of treatment-resistant group is a methodological limitation of this study.

Conclusions

Adding buspirone to fluoxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder may delay the time to onset of antidepressant efficacy. In order to accelerate and maximise the clinical response in depressive patients, clinician should prefer to optimize the fluoxetine dose instead of in combination with buspirone.

### Assessing the efficacy and safety of combined buspirone and venlafaxine treatment in late-life depression accompanied by cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial [^114kvK4F]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Late-life depression, often accompanied by cognitive impairment, poses significant clinical challenges owing to its complex etiology and diverse manifestations. While antidepressants like venlafaxine and anxiolytics such as buspirone are effective for treating depression, their effects on cognitive function remain less well-understood. With the aging population increasingly experiencing geriatric depression, there is an urgent need for innovative treatment approaches that address both depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of combined buspirone and venlafaxine therapy in elderly patients diagnosed with geriatric depression accompanied by cognitive impairment.

Methods

A 12-week, randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 170 elderly patients. Participants were randomized into two groups: one receiving venlafaxine alone (control group) and the other receiving a combination of venlafaxine and buspirone (experimental group). The primary analysis was performed using an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) approach with mixed-effects linear models to assess changes in depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and anxiety levels. A supplementary Per-Protocol (PP) analysis, utilizing repeated measures ANOVA, was also conducted.

Results

The ITT analysis showed that the combination therapy significantly reduced depressive symptoms, as indicated by the HAMD-17 scores (p = 0.033 at week 12). Cognitive function, as measured by MoCA scores, also improved significantly in the experimental group by week 12 (p = 0.025). However, no statistically significant differences were observed in anxiety reduction between the groups (p = 0.127). The PP analysis confirmed these findings, demonstrating consistent improvements in depressive symptoms and cognitive function, particularly in those who completed the full course of treatment. The incidence of adverse events was comparable between groups, primarily mild and manageable symptoms like dry mouth, dizziness, and fatigue.

Conclusion

The combination of buspirone and venlafaxine was found to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing cognitive function in elderly patients with geriatric depression. However, the long-term benefits, especially regarding anxiety reduction, require further investigation. Future studies should consider larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and the inclusion of placebo controls to fully assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115wjYp1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A few small studies have suggested the anticonvulsant carbamazepine might have limited effectiveness as an adjunct during the BZD tapering process to reduce anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.– The CGC considered these findings and agreed there is no robust evidence that carbamazepine facilitates discontinuation and, thus, it is not recommended as an adjunct medication for BZD withdrawal management.

Buspirone had the most evidence in the systematic literature review. A total of six studies compared buspirone to placebo to support the tapering process in adults. – While the combined evidence suggested a slight benefit for buspirone on the outcome of BZD discontinuation, the CGC cited methodological issues that would limit applicability. For example, the CGC noted that many of the studies did not utilize a therapeutic dose of buspirone, and outcomes were inconsistently measured. They also discussed that the risk of drug–drug interactions should raise the threshold for recommending a medication with relatively low likelihood of benefit. The CGC agreed that although buspirone may be helpful in some patients, there was not adequate evidence to single it out as a recommended pharmacological intervention for BZD tapering, giving the impression that it is superior to other potentially useful agents.

After carefully considering existing evidence on various pharmacological interventions, the CGC agreed that no single medication had enough data to support recommending it. The CGC emphasized that the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response. The recommendations seek to highlight the importance of first pausing or slowing the taper if a patient is experiencing taper-related symptoms, minimizing polypharmacy where possible. If a slower taper does not control patient symptoms, medications may be indicated and those decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.

The CGC noted that although gabapentin and pregabalin may be useful in certain circumstances, they have potential for misuse and should not be considered prior to other potential adjunctive medications.

The Patient Panel emphasized that some patients who are experiencing protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication. In their collective experience, medications and supplements that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms. They emphasized the importance of a slow taper and giving the brain time to recover.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1125g2W6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Adjunctive pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine tapering — evidence scope and guidance: Considerable disagreement exists in the literature on the utility of pharmacological interventions as an adjunct to BZD tapering, and existing clinical guidelines that endorse adjunctive medications do not offer clear guidance on implementation. A Cochrane review was unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of various medications because the quality of the evidence was low or very low and with a high risk of bias. The systematic literature review for this CPG review yielded 28 RCTs on various adjunctive pharmacological interventions, including over-the-counter aids such as melatonin. Although a few small studies have suggested carbamazepine might have limited effectiveness to reduce anxiety and withdrawal symptoms, the CPG agreed there is no robust evidence that carbamazepine facilitates discontinuation and, thus, it is not recommended as an adjunct medication for BZD withdrawal management. Buspirone had the most evidence in the systematic literature review.

### Pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders in the 21st century: a call for novel approaches [^112EtX6g]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders in the past 30 years

Over 30 years after the introduction of fluoxetine in 1986, the first-line pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders still relies on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, two closely related classes of drugs derived from fluoxetine. Admittedly, these SSRI and SNRI drugs, along with serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonists such as buspirone, also introduced in 1986, have significantly improved the pharmacological treatment of anxiety by offering options that were significantly more tolerable to patients and vastly safer in overdose than prior treatments. Nevertheless, if we consider SSRIs/SNRIs as belonging to a broader class of medications that modulate levels of central nervous system monoamine neurotransmitters (principally serotonin and norepinephrine, but also dopamine), then no major innovation in terms of therapeutic targets has occurred since the introduction of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants in the 1950s. Benzodiazepines, the other major class of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antianxiety medications, also date back to the 1950s, and target the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor in a similar fashion to their more toxic predecessors, meprobamate and the barbiturates, whose use dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. Moreover, the use of benzodiazepines is now more limited due to concerns of abuse, dependence and mortality in polypharmacy with concomitantly prescribed (or abused) opioids. Clearly, since the advent of fluoxetine, no major breakthrough has been achieved in the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders in the past three decades, with advances being mostly incremental.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117S8eb5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — acute-phase major depressive disorder monitoring and management directives are as follows: Monitor for new or increased suicidal or self-harming thoughts and behaviors during the first 1 to 2 months of treatment (25, 54, 55). Periodically assess adherence to treatment (with both SGAs and CBT). For patients in the acute phase of mild MDD for whom CBT is not available or feasible, monotherapy with an SGA is a reasonable alternative approach. Reevaluate symptoms to monitor treatment efficacy (response and remission) and potential adverse events using validated scales, such as the PHQ-9, and clinical history. Once remission is achieved with an SGA, clinicians should continue the treatment strategy for at least an additional 4 to 9 months (25). When SGA treatment is discontinued, the dose should be gradually decreased (tapered) to minimize withdrawal symptoms. When using augmentation as a second-line treatment in patients who do not respond to initial treatment, consider augmentation of an SGA with mirtazapine, bupropion, or buspirone. Refer patients who have severe symptoms, marked functional impairment, or risk for self-harm to mental health services. Encourage exercise as a healthy lifestyle practice for adults with MDD. Consider team-based collaborative care involving appropriate psychiatric care and mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, in adults with MDD.

Introduction

Although medications indicated for major depressive disorder (MDD), including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), effectively reduce the depressive symptoms of MDD, more than 60% of individuals with MDD do not experience full remission with monotherapy or second-step augmentation, which highlights the need for novel treatment approaches. For instance, in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, remission rates with citalopram monotherapy were only 27.5% (as measured by total scores ≤ 7 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and 32.9% (as measured by total scores ≤ 5 on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report). In addition, only 29.7–39.0% of those receiving second-step augmentation with sustained-release bupropion or with buspirone achieved remission.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^1138FM2G]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

It is important to consider all of the safety findings described here in light of the dosing and design requirements of the study. The doses used in this open-label study were up to 2-fold greater than the once-daily 60 mg duloxetine dose which has been shown to provide robust efficacy in older patients in placebo-controlled trials. The dosing and other design features of the study (e.g. the intensive visit schedule) were specifically included to maximize the probability of uncovering adverse reactions to duloxetine. Furthermore, no special dosing guidelines were implemented for these elderly patients. While lower doses of many antidepressants are recommended in the elderly, especially due to concerns of adverse events among the TCAs, this can lead to the use of subtherapeutic doses and corresponding reductions in efficacy. In this study, however, the comparable adverse event profiles observed for elderly and younger age groups suggest that a duloxetine dose which has been shown to provide robust efficacy may be safely administered in depressed patients regardless of age. Only in particularly sensitive elderly patients may dosing adjustments be required.

### The interplay between SLC6A4 and HTR1A genetic variants that may lead to antidepressant failure [^112QNdMc]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Multiple strategies exist to improve SSRI response. Strategies include the addition of 5-HT1A antagonists such as Pindolol. However, there has been mixed success with Pindolol due to its lack of selectivity for the pre-synaptic or post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor. Buspirone is a 5-HT1A partial agonist, though use of this medication is limited by its multiple daily dosing requirements. Perhaps the most superior adjunct in those with homozygous or heterozygous G allele at the presence of 5-HT1A rs6295 is low dose Aripiprazole, a common adjunct to SSRIs as it is a 5-HT1A partial agonist that is dosed once daily.

Other options include first time treatment with serotonin partial agonist reuptake inhibitors (SPARIs) such as Vilazodone or Vortioxetine. Much like SSRIs, SPARIs inhibit the serotonin transporter but also have 5-HT1A partial agonist properties. For those who have poor function of the CYP2D6 liver enzyme, Vilazodone may be the better alternative as it is unaffected by CYP2D6 activity, though it does need to be taken with food for optimal bioavailability. In contrast, Vortioxetine does not need to be taken with food and has some mild stimulant properties due to 5-HT3 blockade, additionally disinhibiting neurotransmitters such as adrenaline, glutamate, and acetylcholine in those who may require regulation of these systems in addition to serotonin.

PPI reached out to the 32 patients to whom were suggested SPARIs (i.e. Vortioxetine, Vilazodone with/without Bupropion), based on the PPI test results that displayed a SLC6A4 SS- HTR1A rs6295 GG combination, and who may have been subsequently prescribed one of these medications by their treating physicians. Only 8 patients were willing to provide input, while the others did not respond to follow-up emails.

Of these 8 disability patients, 7 self- reported positive effect and medication tolerance, as per the pharmacogenomic test results and pharmacist written report, though, feedback and statistics on physician adoption of test results in this specific study are lacking. Vortioxetine as well as Bupropion fall within first-line medications as per CANMAT guidelines (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) and Vilazodone is classified as a second-line medication.

Though the evidence is weak due to a very limited feedback cohort, the success rate of medication recommendations for this HTR1A rs6295 GG and SLC6A4 SS cohort is ~87.5%.

### Lanicemine: a low-trapping NMDA channel blocker produces sustained antidepressant efficacy with minimal psychotomimetic adverse effects [^112FqxA5]. Molecular Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Adjunctive, multiple-infusion efficacy trial of lanicemine in patients with moderate-to-severe MDD and a history of poor response to antidepressants (phase IIB, D6702C00009/NCT00781742)

The phase IIB, double-blind, randomized, outpatient study (D6702C00009/NCT00781742; study 9) was performed at 30 centers in the United States between October 2008 and March 2010. It consisted of a screening period (≤ 30 days), a 3-day placebo run-in (when patients received one single-blind placebo infusion (0.9% saline)), and a 3-week treatment period, followed by a 5-week treatment-free follow-up.

Outpatients (men and women) aged 18–65 years with DSM-IV-TR -diagnosed MDD, confirmed by the MINI, and a history of poor response were included. Poor response was defined as treatment failure on two or more antidepressants after exposure at adequate doses or maximum tolerated doses for ⩾4 weeks. Informed by data on inadequate response to different classes of antidepressants in STAR*D, inadequate response to different classes of antidepressants was not a requirement. Initially, despite treatment with at least one antidepressant, a baseline HAM-D-17 score of ⩾26, a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score of ⩾5 and a Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) score of ⩾21 were required. In addition to the first antidepressant, a second antidepressant was permitted as well. Acceptable combinations of two antidepressants were SSRI/SNRI+bupropion and SSRI/SNRI+mirtazapine. Concomitant buspirone, triiodothyronine and lithium were permitted. Also permitted were concomitant benzodiazepines and hypnotics. To improve recruitment, the inclusion criteria were reduced to include patients with baseline HAM-D-17 ⩾20, CGI-S ⩾4 and QIDS-SR-16 ⩾16. Of 152 patients randomized, 72 patients were enrolled under the original protocol and 80 patients were enrolled under the amended protocol. Exclusion criteria included: current episode of depression ≤ 12 weeks or ⩾5 years; lifetime history of DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than MDD with the exception of generalized anxiety disorder, comorbid panic disorder and simple phobias; HAM-D-17 item 3 score ⩾2; use of mood stabilizers, other antipsychotic drugs or tricyclic antidepressants within 7 days of day 1 or monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 14 days of day 1 of the treatment period; and evidence of other clinically relevant disease.

### Buspirone hydrochloride [^114ZCpJE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Studies indicate that buspirone hydrochloride tablets, USP are less sedating than other anxiolytics and that it does not produce significant functional impairment. However, its CNS effects in any individual patient may not be predictable. Therefore, patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or using complex machinery until they are reasonably certain that buspirone treatment does not affect them adversely.

While formal studies of the interaction of buspirone hydrochloride, USP with alcohol indicate that buspirone does not increase alcohol-induced impairment in motor and mental performance, it is prudent to avoid concomitant use of alcohol and buspirone.

Potential for Withdrawal Reactions in Sedative/Hypnotic/Anxiolytic Drug-Dependent Patients

Because buspirone hydrochloride tablets, USP do not exhibit cross-tolerance with benzodiazepines and other common sedative/hypnotic drugs, it will not block the withdrawal syndrome often seen with cessation of therapy with these drugs. Therefore, before starting therapy with buspirone hydrochloride tablets, USP, it is advisable to withdraw patients gradually, especially patients who have been using a CNS-depressant drug chronically, from their prior treatment. Rebound or withdrawal symptoms may occur over varying time periods, depending in part on the type of drug, and its effective half-life of elimination.

The syndrome of withdrawal from sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs can appear as any combination of irritability, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, tremor, abdominal cramps, muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, flu-like symptoms without fever, and occasionally, even as seizures.

Possible Concerns Related to Buspirone's Binding to Dopamine Receptors

Because buspirone can bind to central dopamine receptors, a question has been raised about its potential to cause acute and chronic changes in dopamine-mediated neurological function (e.g., dystonia, pseudo-parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia). Clinical experience in controlled trials has failed to identify any significant neuroleptic-like activity; however, a syndrome of restlessness, appearing shortly after initiation of treatment, has been reported in some small fraction of buspirone-treated patients. The syndrome may be explained in several ways. For example, buspirone may increase central noradrenergic activity; alternatively, the effect may be attributable to dopaminergic effects (i.e., represent akathisia). See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^115yhizH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Combination interventions

With the exception of OFC, each treatment combination (i.e. two intervention/controls initiated simultaneously) had only been assessed in one study per combination and with wide ranging ESs (presented in). We conclude that, given the methodological differences between these, no conclusions can at present be made about specific combinations from RCTs of people with early-stage TRD.

Secondary outcomes

Subgroup analyses

Additional analyses stratifying between early-stage and substantive TRD criteria required for inclusion in each study are presented in. For all treatments studied, ES 95% CI had large overlap when comparing between studies defining TRD as 1 FT and 2 FTs, suggesting treatment efficacy was not sensitive to TRD definition. The exception to this rule was buspirone, for which the ES and 95% CIs were considerably higher when TRD was defined as 2 FTs (1 FT = ES = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.61–1.07; 2 FTs = ES = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.14–2.02), although this consisted of only one small study.

Additional analyses stratifying treatment ESs by the duration of study treatment are presented in. As previously mentioned, study durations were defined as 'short-term' (< 6 weeks), 'adequate duration' (6–12 weeks) and 'long-term' (> 12 weeks). Perhaps surprisingly, subgroups of 'short-term' and 'adequate duration' studies did not result in any consistent findings concerning treatment efficacy. Although approximately half of the treatments studied in this subgroup analysis saw an ES increase when focussing on those studied at an 'adequate' duration, half did not. Moreover, 95% CIs and I 2 statistics demonstrated considerable overlap and high heterogeneity, respectively.

Tolerability and acceptability

Tolerability data were recorded by 79% of included studies (k = 91). The specific measures used were too heterogeneous to allow for meaningful comparison. Data on acceptability were available for 84% of studies (k = 97). The most commonly used measure to assess tolerability was dropout due to any cause, which was reported in 28% of active treatment patients, compared to 12% of those receiving placebo.

Dropouts due to adverse events were recorded in 23 articles, returning a dropout rate approximately twice as high in active treatment conditions compared to placebo (9.2% vs 4%). Other, less commonly used, measures included treatment-emergent adverse events, dropout due to intolerance and mean retention time in weeks.

### Buspirone (buspirone hydrochloride) [^115XEwrm]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Buspirone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management
of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety.
Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not
require treatment with an anxiolytic.

The efficacy of buspirone has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials
of outpatients whose diagnosis roughly corresponds to Generalized Anxiety
Disorder (GAD). Many of the patients enrolled in these studies also had
coexisting depressive symptoms and buspirone relieved anxiety in the presence of
these coexisting depressive symptoms. The patients evaluated in these studies
had experienced symptoms for periods of 1 month to over 1 year prior to the
study, with an average symptom duration of 6 months. Generalized Anxiety
Disorder (300.02) is described in the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, lll1 as follows:

Generalized, persistent anxiety (of at least 1 month continual duration),
manifested by symptoms from three of the four following categories:

The above symptoms would not be due to another mental disorder, such as a
depressive disorder or schizophrenia. However, mild depressive symptoms are
common in GAD.

The effectiveness of buspirone in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 to
4 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled trials. There is no body of
evidence available that systematically addresses the appropriate duration of
treatment for GAD. However, in a study of long-term use, 264 patients were
treated with buspirone for 1 year without ill effect. Therefore, the physician
who elects to use buspirone for extended periods should periodically reassess
the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Isocarboxazid (Marplan) [^1124WKVb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective Serotonin Re - uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

Marplan should not be administered in combination with any SSRI. There have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation and confusion progressing to delirium and coma) in patients receiving fluoxetine (Prozac®, Lilly) in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and in patients who have recently discontinued fluoxetine and are then started on a MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Fluoxetine and other SSRIs should therefore not be used in combination with Marplan, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with Marplan. As fluoxetine and its major metabolite have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting Marplan. At least 2 weeks should be allowed after stopping sertraline (Zoloft®, Pfizer) or paroxetine (Paxil®, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals) before starting Marplan. In addition, there should be an interval of least 10 days between discontinuation of Marplan and initiation of fluoxetine or other SSRIs.

Buspirone

Marplan should not be used in combination with buspirone HCL (Buspar®, Bristol Myers Squibb); several cases of elevated blood pressure have been reported in patients taking MAO inhibitors who were then given buspirone HCL. At least 10 days should elapse between the discontinuation of Marplan and the institution of buspirone HCL. Serious reactions may also occur when MAO inhibitors are given with serotoninergic drugs (e.g., dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, venlafaxine).

### Venlafaxine (venlafaxine hydrochloride) [^116pzNG5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

[See Dosage and Administration (2.6 and 2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .]

7.10 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with venlafaxine extended-release tablets increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of venlafaxine extended-release tablets and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

7.11 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAID's, Aspirin, and Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRI's and SNRI's are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when venlafaxine extended-release tablets are initiated or discontinued [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

7.12 Electroconvulsive Therapy

There are no clinical data establishing the benefit of electroconvulsive therapy combined with venlafaxine extended-release tablets treatment.

7.13 Postmarketing Spontaneous Drug Interaction Reports

There have been reports of elevated clozapine levels that were temporally associated with adverse reactions, including seizures, following the addition of venlafaxine.

There have been reports of increases in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or INR when venlafaxine was given to patients receiving warfarin therapy.

7.14 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.

Gastroparesis — buspirone effects and certainty: Compared with placebo, changes with buspirone were not clinically important based on predefined minimal important differences, there was possible worsening in the abdominal pain score, and there was no clinically important difference in the risk of serious adverse events between patients who received buspirone and placebo. The overall certainty of evidence was very low, and the single clinical trial comparing buspirone with placebo did not show significant improvements in nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, or overall symptom severity score; despite this, Panel Content Experts felt that buspirone could be useful in patients with gastroparesis whose predominant symptoms are early satiety and bloating, especially in the absence of any signal suggesting increased risk of serious adverse events among those treated with buspirone.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for complicated depression [^111FuA3Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately half of patients with depression do not respond or only partially respond to first-line antidepressant monotherapy. To enhance treatment response, the treating clinician may choose to augment the antidepressant with a nonantidepressant agent or combine the initial antidepressant with another antidepressant, typically of another class. Although the augmentation and combination strategies reviewed here appear relatively safe and effective, additional controlled studies are needed to compare these treatment options, guide treatment selection for individual patients, and answer questions regarding the duration of combination or augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Problematic use of buspirone and tandospirone: a scoping review [^117NMvRe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Azapirone-class drugs are partial 5-HT1A receptor agonists commonly used to treat anxiety disorders. Prior experimental studies have so far demonstrated that these drugs have low potential for dependence and problematic use and are considered safe treatment options compared with benzodiazepines. However, recent evidence suggesting the contrary raises concerns about their safety. This review examines current evidence on problematic azapirone use.

Methods

This study was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Major databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycInfo, and EMBASE, were searched to identify eligible papers. Additional searches were conducted to supplement. Article selection and data extraction were completed by at least 2 independent reviewers.

Results

Thirteen reports made up of clinical studies (n = 9) and case reports (n = 4) were included. All abuse liability studies comparing azapirones (buspirone and tandospirone), benzodiazepines, and placebo reported no association of buspirone and tandospirone with key features of problematic use. Conversely, all case reports (n = 4) described problematic use, involving patients with a history of incarceration or substance use disorder (SUD) who insufflated buspirone to achieve a sedative effect.

Conclusions

Findings highlight a discrepancy in the primary literature. Specifically, experimental studies conclude that so far, buspirone and tandospirone have a low potential for problematic use. However, more recent case reports document instances of nonprescribed buspirone misuse, particularly among individuals with a history of incarceration or SUD, possibly stemming from a complex interplay of biopsychosocial-behavioral rather than purely pharmacological factors. Further research is needed to guide strategies for preventing problematic azapirone use while ensuring effective anxiety treatment in high-risk populations.

Recommendations

TCAs used as gut–brain neuromodulators are an efficacious second-line treatment for FD. They can be initiated in primary or secondary care, but careful explanation as to the rationale for their use is required, and patients should be counselled about their side effect profile. They should be commenced at a low dose (eg, 10 mg amitriptyline once daily) and titrated slowly to a maximum of 30–50 mg once daily (recommendation: strong, quality of evidence: moderate).
Antipsychotics, such as sulpiride 100 mg four times a day or levosulpiride 25 mg three times a day, may be efficacious as a second-line treatment for FD. There should be careful explanation as to the rationale for their use and patients should be counselled on their side effect profile (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
There is no evidence that SSRIs used as gut–brain neuromodulators are an efficacious second-line drug for global symptoms in FD (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: moderate).
There is no evidence that SNRIs used as gut–brain neuromodulators are an efficacious second-line drug for global symptoms in FD. However, as they are efficacious in other chronic painful conditions, more trials of these drugs are warranted (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
Tandospirone 10 mg three times a day may be an efficacious second-line treatment for FD, but there is no evidence that other 5-hydroxytryptamine- 1A agonists, including buspirone 10 mg three times a day, are efficacious. However, more trials of these drugs are warranted (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
Pregabalin 75 mg once daily may be an efficacious second-line treatment for FD but further RCTs are needed and given its controlled drug status we advise this drug is only used in specialist settings (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: low).
Mirtazapine 15 mg once daily may be an efficacious second-line treatment for patients with FD with early satiation and weight loss, but further RCTs are needed (recommendation: weak, quality of evidence: very low).

### Treating generalized anxiety disorder [^113raUJn]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronically persistent worry and therefore requires effective long-term treatment. This article reviews the benefits and risks associated with various pharmacologic and psychological therapies to assess their ability to achieve the elimination of GAD symptomatology and restoration of normal function. Psychotherapeutic approaches such as applied relaxation, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have all been shown to be effective when used as monotherapies and may be beneficial when used adjunctively. Current effective pharmacotherapies for patients with GAD include anxiolytic benzodiazepines, buspirone, and antidepressants including venlafaxine and paroxetine. Benzodiazepines have long been used to treat anxiety and are particularly appropriate in short-term treatment situations; however, their adverse side-effect profile and their inability to treat depression commonly comorbid with GAD renders them less than ideal in many situations. Buspirone has demonstrated anxiolytic benefits but, like benzodiazepines, shows negligible antidepressant action. Antidepressants like paroxetine and venlafaxine are not only effective antidepressants but also effective anxiolytics, thus implying their special ability to treat GAD and concurrent depression, even over the long-term.

### Buspirone hydrochloride (bucapsol) [^114dTinP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Studies indicate that buspirone hydrochloride is less sedating than other anxiolytics and that it does not produce significant functional impairment. However, its CNS effects in any individual patient may not be predictable. Therefore, patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or using complex machinery until they are reasonably certain that buspirone treatment does not affect them adversely.

While formal studies of the interaction of buspirone hydrochloride with alcohol indicate that buspirone does not increase alcohol-induced impairment in motor and mental performance, it is prudent to avoid concomitant use of alcohol and buspirone.

Potential for Withdrawal Reactions in Sedative/Hypnotic/Anxiolytic Drug-Dependent Patients

Because buspirone hydrochloride does not exhibit cross-tolerance with benzodiazepines and other common sedative/hypnotic drugs, it will not block the withdrawal syndrome often seen with cessation of therapy with these drugs. Therefore, before starting therapy with buspirone hydrochloride, it is advisable to withdraw patients gradually, especially patients who have been using a CNS-depressant drug chronically, from their prior treatment. Rebound or withdrawal symptoms may occur over varying time periods, depending in part on the type of drug, and its effective half-life of elimination.

The syndrome of withdrawal from sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs can appear as any combination of irritability, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, tremor, abdominal cramps, muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, flu-like symptoms without fever, and occasionally, even as seizures.

Possible Concerns Related to Buspirone's Binding to Dopamine Receptors

Because buspirone can bind to central dopamine receptors, a question has been raised about its potential to cause acute and chronic changes in dopamine-mediated neurological function (eg, dystonia, pseudo-parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia). Clinical experience in controlled trials has failed to identify any significant neuroleptic-like activity; however, a syndrome of restlessness, appearing shortly after initiation of treatment, has been reported in some small fraction of buspirone-treated patients. The syndrome may be explained in several ways. For example, buspirone may increase central noradrenergic activity; alternatively, the effect may be attributable to dopaminergic effects (ie, represent akathisia). See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Experience.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^1177Fjkw]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

It is thus useful to be familiar with several tricyclic/heterocyclic drugs, as each possess specific side effects which may be used to patient advantage. For example, an anxious, depressed, thin, insomniac patient may benefit from an anxiolytic, sedative, anti-depressant drug (e.g. doxepin); conversely, an overweight, hyper-somnolent patient with psychomotor retardation may benefit from an antidepressant with more noradrenergic selectivity (e.g. desipramine, which can be activating and can cause weight loss). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not shown any analgesic efficacy (level 4 evidence) but of course are very effective and safe anxiolytic/antidepressant drugs. The NNT for SSRIs in neuropathic pain is much higher than traditional HCAs, for example, 7.7 for citalopram, 2.9 for paroxetine.

The tricyclic/heterocyclic drugs are by far the best single agents for managing CRPS. However, these drugs are complicated and have known, expected side effects (some of which can be very useful, such as sedation in insomniac patients, which is nearly ubiquitous; see above). These drugs must be carefully monitored (frequent visits when starting) and started in low dose with methodical, gradual dose increases. The range of ultimate doses is broad, and some patients respond well to low dose; yet once started it is not appropriate to conclude lack of efficacy after a low dose trial. With tricyclics we recommend an EKG before starting at mid-dose range and at ultimate dose due to (rare) interval changes (level 4).

The older (venlafaxine) and newer combined serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g. milnacipran, duloxetine) are FDA approved for several chronic-pain indications, in addition to major depression. They have not been trialed for CRPS. Venlafaxine, an older SNRI has some anecdotal value for neuropathic pain and perhaps CRPS (level 4 evidence). There is a pressing need for data on comparative efficacy and safety of SNRIs and TCAs in CRPS.

### Duloxetine: a dual reuptake inhibitor [^115V3k7P]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Data Sources

Searches using MEDLINE and PsycINFO were conducted (1966 to November 2003).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All duloxetine MDD information gathered was considered. Articles containing comprehensive information regarding duloxetine use for MDD were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor being considered for treatment of MDD and stress urinary incontinence. While approved dosing ranges have not yet been determined, studies support the efficacy and safety of 40–60 mg twice daily for the treatment of acute MDD. Adverse effects have been of mild to moderate severity and are considered to be transient. Cardiovascular effects (increased heart rate or blood pressure), while present, do not appear to be clinically significant. Overall, duloxetine appears to be well tolerated.

Conclusions

Duloxetine is a safe and effective antidepressant. Approval of this agent provides another treatment option for the management of MDD.

### Empirically supported use of psychiatric medications in adolescents and adults with IBD [^115WDVbu]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressants, is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in spite of a lack of their robust efficacy in this population. This review provides an overview of the use trends of different classes of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication and their effects on mood, nervous system function, gastrointestinal physiology and immunity drawing from the literature available in the general population, other medical conditions, and when available, patients with IBD. It also covers the evidence base for the actions, efficacy, and potential complications of antidepressants organized by different classes.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search of articles relating the different drug classes probed to the terms above in different populations of interest. All types of articles were accepted including case reports and series, open and randomized trials, reviews, and expert opinion. We also examined the reference lists of the publications found.

Results

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the most commonly prescribed agents for anxiety and depression in patients with IBD, though their efficacy for these conditions in the general population are mild to moderate at best. SSRIs are generally well tolerated, though at higher doses, they, like most antidepressant classes, can be associated with activation, serotonergic syndrome, and increased suicidal ideation. TCAs have many more serious side effects but have some shown efficacy for functional GI symptoms. A newer class, the serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can be effective for refractory depression, anxiety and chronic pain syndromes with a side effect profile similar to both SSRIs and more mild manifestations of TCAs. Mirtazapine has moderate efficacy for depression if sedation and weight gain side effects are tolerated and some small support for use in nausea and vomiting. Bupropion targets dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake and has moderate efficacy for depression, and some small support for use in fatigue and smoking cessation. Buspirone has an indication for generalized anxiety disorder though studies show only a minimal benefit. It has some growing evidence for use in functional dyspepsia. Most of these agents have physiological effects on the brain, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract (with the exception of bupropion) hence their therapeutic and side effects manifested in these systems.

Conclusion

Antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed for depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain syndromes, but overall support for their efficacy is modest at best. Psychological interventions have growing support for having much more robust effects without the side effects of antidepressants and should be considered first-line treatment or at least an adjunct to psychotropic medications for these conditions.

### Qualitative review of SNRIs in anxiety [^111Pc4yT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders pose a problem for a significant number of individuals, with a 1-year prevalence rate estimated at 13.1% to 17.1%. Many pharmacologic agents have been used to treat anxiety disorders, and among those in current use are newer benzodiazepines (alprazolam), azapirones (buspirone), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine and sertraline), and venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The likely role of abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission in anxiety is widely supported, while the role of norepinephrine is less clear. Still, many lines of evidence support the hypothesis that a perturbation in norepinephrine neurotransmission contributes to the symptoms of anxiety. Therefore, it is conceivable that modulation of both serotonin and norepinephrine systems by dual-reuptake inhibitors may be an advantage in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Given this, the current review examines evidence on the possible role of venlafaxine in the treatment of anxiety disorders. From this review it is clear that venlafaxine is as efficacious as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating anxiety, with comparable tolerability. Future research will be valuable in determining if antidepressants that combine pharmacologic actions on serotonergic and noradrenergic systems have advantages over more selective agents in treating anxiety disorders.

5.11 Increases in Blood Pressure

In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials across the approved adult populations from baseline to endpoint, duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment was associated with mean increases of 0.5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 0.8 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure compared to mean decreases of 0.6 mm Hg systolic and 0.3 mm Hg diastolic in placebo-treated patients. There was no significant difference in the frequency of sustained (3 consecutive visits) elevated blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study designed to evaluate the effects of duloxetine delayed-release capsules on various parameters, including blood pressure at supratherapeutic doses with an accelerated dose titration, there was evidence of increases in supine blood pressure at doses up to 200 mg twice daily (approximately 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage). At the highest 200 mg twice daily dose, the increase in mean pulse rate was 5 to 6.8 beats and increases in mean blood pressure were 4.7 to 6.8 mm Hg (systolic) and 4.5 to 7 mm Hg (diastolic) up to 12 hours after dosing.

Blood pressure should be measured prior to initiating treatment and periodically measured throughout treatment [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

5.12 Clinically Important Drug Interactions

Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are responsible for duloxetine delayed-release capsules metabolism.

Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Duloxetine Delayed-Release Capsules

CYP1A2 Inhibitors — Co-administration of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].

### Safety and tolerability of antidepressants: weighing the impact on treatment decisions [^116TwGLK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorders affect an estimated 23 million U.S. adults per year. While antidepressants are effective in improving the symptoms of depression, side effects are an undesirable outcome of treatment and can have an impact on patient adherence to treatment. Compared with older drugs, selective serotonin reup-take inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and other antidepressants have more benign side effect profiles. Research continues to elucidate new agents that may combine efficacy with a minimum of side effects, as well as new methods of predicting individual response to particular antidepressants.

Comparative benefits and harms of second-line treatments — switching or augmenting SGA therapy — indicate that moderate-certainty evidence showed switching from one SGA to another probably resulted in similar response and remission rates and that an initial lack of response with one SGA does not preclude response to a different one; low-certainty evidence showed switching SGAs may have similarly affected functional capacity and quality of life and evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) about effects on suicidal ideation; low-certainty evidence showed switching to a different SGA may have resulted in similar response and remission rates compared with switching to cognitive therapy (a type of CBT) or augmentation with mirtazapine; similar findings were observed when augmentation with mirtazapine was compared with pharmacologic augmentation with bupropion or buspirone (low certainty) and when different pharmacologic augmentation strategies with bupropion or buspirone were compared with each other (moderate certainty); switching from one SGA to another may have resulted in no differences in serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events (both low certainty), and evidence on serious adverse events was very uncertain (insufficient) for comparisons involving CBT.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^115UGwWx]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Information from individual trials may better elucidate which subgroups of patients to consider use of these drugs in. An RCT of amitriptyline 50 mg once daily or escitalopram 10 mg once daily versus placebo demonstrated that amitriptyline appeared to be of greater benefit in EPS, although the drug enhanced gastric accommodation, suggesting it may also benefit those with PDS. In an RCT of imipramine 25–50 mg once daily epigastric pain, bloating, postprandial fullness, early satiation, and vomiting scores all improved significantly, versus placebo, compared with baseline. In a placebo-controlled trial of mirtazapine 15 mg once daily, recruiting 34 patients with FD and weight loss, without anxiety or depression and not taking any other neuromodulators, there was no benefit on global symptoms but the drug led to significant improvements in early satiation and quality of life. Finally, in a small Belgian crossover RCT, buspirone 10 mg three times a day had significant effects on postprandial fullness, early satiation, and upper abdominal bloating, and increased gastric accommodation. Further, larger, trials of mirtazapine and 5-HT 1A agonists in FD are warranted.

WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants (5.1)
Monitor for worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (5.1)

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

17.1 Information for Patients

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Lexapro.

General Information about Medication Guide

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with Lexapro and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Lexapro. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Lexapro.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Bupropion SR vs. buspirone for treating depression… [^112XdoJT]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question: Is buspirone or bupropion SR better for augmentation in patients with depression who do not respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Allocation: Uncertain Synopsis: In the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial, 2, 876 patients with depression were given citalopram in an average dosage of 40 mg per day. Approximately one third of patients went into remission, and approximately one half showed a response. Patients who did not respond were invited to enroll in the second phase of the trial.

Treatment options for patients who failed the initial course of citalopram included switching drugs out of class to bupropion SR, within class to sertraline, or to the dual-action agent venlafaxine XR; switching to cognitive therapy; or augmenting by adding buspirone, bupropion SR, or cognitive therapy. Patients could opt out of certain treatment options; for example, they could limit their randomization to only augmentation options or only switching options. Twenty-one patients agreed to randomization to any of the seven treatment options. In this study, the results of augmentation with bupropion SR in a dosage of up to 400 mg per day and buspirone in a dosage of up to 60 mg per day were compared. A total of 565 patients were randomized to the two drugs and followed up for a mean of 14 weeks. P <. 0009; number needed to harm = 12). A major limitation of this study was the absence of a placebo control group.

Given the relapsing, remitting nature of depression, it is likely that some patients would have gone into remission without augmentation. Not enough patients chose to be randomized to both switch and augmentation options to allow for comparison. Bottom Line: Buspirone and bupropion SR added to citalopram are similarly effective for patients with depression who do not respond initially to citalopram alone. Bupropion SR is somewhat better tolerated. This study was limited by the lack of a placebo control group.
