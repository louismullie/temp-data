## Question

If the patient is hypervolemic with fluid overload, then will the right internal jugular vein be incompressible on ultrasound guided placement of a central venous catheter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the right internal jugular vein will be incompressible on ultrasound in a hypervolemic, fluid-overloaded patient during ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic ultrasound characteristics that distinguish veins from arteries, especially compressibility. Then, I should verify how hypervolemia and elevated central venous pressure physiologically alter venous compliance and diameter. Next, I will examine whether "incompressible" is an accurate descriptor in this context or if "less compressible" is more precise. After that, I should review direct and indirect ultrasound evidence linking IJV size and behavior to CVP and volume status. Finally, I will consider practical implications for cannulation technique and confirm the bottom-line answer with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: veins are compressible, arteries are not. On ultrasound, the internal jugular vein is identified by its thin walls, respiratory variation, and compressibility with gentle probe pressure, whereas the carotid artery is thicker-walled, pulsatile, and not readily compressible; this compressibility test is a core step in vessel identification during IJV cannulation and is explicitly taught in guidelines and procedural reviews [^116yTD8Z] [^112G6Tgv].

> Now, I need to check how hypervolemia and fluid overload change venous physiology. Elevated central venous pressure in fluid overload shifts the venous pressure–volume relationship toward the stiff portion of the compliance curve, so the same incremental pressure produces a smaller change in volume; in other words, the vein becomes less compliant and tends to be more distended at a given transmural pressure, which is why IJV diameter correlates with CVP and right atrial pressure in multiple studies and reviews [^1173SWmA] [^112E5U3E] [^113876vt].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology before jumping to conclusions. I initially thought "incompressible", but that would imply arterial-like rigidity, which veins do not exhibit under normal conditions; the correct description is "less compressible" or "difficult to compress", reflecting reduced compliance and higher intraluminal pressure rather than true noncompressibility. This distinction matters because even in high CVP states, the IJV remains a vein and can still be compressed with sufficient force, albeit less readily than in euvolemia or hypovolemia [^116yTD8Z] [^112un93f].

> Next, I should review direct evidence that IJV dimensions track filling pressures. In spontaneously breathing patients, IJV end-expiratory diameter correlates with invasively measured CVP, with larger diameters seen at higher CVP; for example, mean IJV diameter was about 7.0 mm when CVP was less than 10 cm H2O versus about 12.5 mm when CVP was 10 cm H2O or greater, indicating progressive distension with higher right-sided pressures [^1173SWmA]. Similarly, in heart failure cohorts, larger IJV diameters and reduced respiratory variation are associated with higher right atrial pressure, reinforcing that distension accompanies elevated filling pressures in fluid overload states [^113876vt] [^112E5U3E].

> I will now examine dynamic indices that reflect venous compliance. Hold on, I should verify that reduced distensibility with maneuvers signals high venous pressure. Studies using Valsalva-induced changes in IJV cross-sectional area show that a smaller percentage change in CSA with Valsalva correlates with higher right atrial pressure, consistent with reduced venous compliance in congestion; thresholds such as less than about 66% CSA change have been linked to RAP of 12 mm Hg or higher in heart failure populations, illustrating that the vein becomes stiffer and less distensible as pressures rise [^112VVzUw] [^114Sm7ar]. Let me also consider respiratory variation: in hypervolemia and high RAP, IJV respiratory variation is blunted, so a small RVD or minimal sniff collapsibility is consistent with elevated filling pressures and relative nonresponsiveness to further volume, which aligns with the concept of "less compressible" rather than truly incompressible [^113876vt] [^112E5U3E].

> But wait, what if the vein appears so large and tense that it seems "noncompressible"? I should double-check that this is a perceptual pitfall. Even markedly distended IJVs remain compressible with firm, deliberate probe pressure; the key is that more force is required and the collapse is less complete than in low-pressure states, which is why guidelines still rely on compressibility to distinguish vein from artery and why operators must be cautious not to overcall an artery when the vein is simply stiff and full. This is especially important in fluid overload, where the IJV may look plethoric and minimally responsive to respiratory maneuvers yet remains a vein anatomically and physiologically [^116yTD8Z] [^112G6Tgv].

> Next, I should review practical cannulation implications. In hypervolemic patients, the IJV is typically larger and more superficial, which can facilitate ultrasound visualization, but its reduced compressibility means the operator must apply controlled pressure to confirm venous identity and avoid mistaking a tense vein for an artery. Trendelenburg positioning may further augment IJV diameter and can be used when clinically appropriate, but even in this setting, the vein remains compressible with sufficient pressure, reinforcing that "less compressible" is the accurate descriptor rather than "incompressible" [^114sJ192] [^116yTD8Z].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the bottom line. In a hypervolemic, fluid-overloaded patient, the right internal jugular vein will be distended and less compressible due to elevated intraluminal pressure and reduced venous compliance, but it will not be truly incompressible; with adequate probe pressure, it can still be collapsed, albeit less readily than in euvolemia or hypovolemia. Therefore, operators should anticipate a larger, stiffer vein, use gentle compressibility testing to confirm venous identity, and interpret reduced collapsibility as a marker of elevated filling pressures rather than as evidence of arterial structure [^113876vt] [^1173SWmA] [^116yTD8Z].

---

In hypervolemic patients with fluid overload, the right internal jugular vein (IJV) is **distended and less compressible** [^113876vt] because elevated central venous pressure (CVP) increases intraluminal pressure and reduces collapsibility [^112VVzUw]. Ultrasound will show a larger, more circular IJV with **minimal collapse** under gentle probe pressure [^1131aod8] and with respiration or Valsalva, reflecting high right atrial pressure and venous congestion [^112VVzUw]. The vein remains compressible with firm pressure, but its reduced collapsibility — not true noncompressibility — is a hallmark of hypervolemia and helps distinguish it from hypovolemic states [^113876vt] [^115ZJ5Le].

---

## Physiological basis of IJV compressibility

The IJV is a thin-walled, compliant vessel whose diameter and collapsibility reflect intravascular pressure and volume status [^116yTD8Z]. At low CVP, the IJV is **highly collapsible** and easily compressed by gentle probe pressure or during inspiration/Valsalva [^113876vt]. As CVP rises, venous wall tension increases, compliance falls, and the vein becomes less compressible, appearing more distended and circular on ultrasound [^112VVzUw].

---

## Ultrasound findings in hypervolemic patients

In hypervolemia, ultrasound typically shows the following features in the right IJV:

- **Increased diameter**: The IJV is significantly larger at end-expiration, often > 1.2 cm in adults, reflecting elevated CVP and right atrial pressure [^113876vt] [^1173SWmA].

- **Reduced collapsibility**: Gentle probe pressure or respiratory variation produces minimal collapse, indicating high intraluminal pressure and reduced compliance [^112VVzUw].

- **Circular cross-section**: The vein appears more circular rather than oval or slit-like, consistent with distension and increased transmural pressure [^1131aod8].

- **Blunted respiratory variation**: Minimal change in diameter with respiration or Valsalva maneuver, indicating volume overload and venous congestion [^113876vt].

---

## Clinical implications for CVC placement

During ultrasound-guided CVC placement, these ultrasound features have important implications:

- **Easier visualization**: The distended IJV is more readily identified, potentially facilitating cannulation [^116yTD8Z].

- **Increased risk of complications**: Reduced compressibility may increase the risk of inadvertent arterial puncture, hematoma, or pneumothorax if not carefully managed [^notfound].

- **Need for careful technique**: Operators should confirm venous identity using color Doppler, waveform analysis, and gentle compressibility testing before proceeding with cannulation [^116yTD8Z].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

While reduced IJV compressibility is a useful marker of hypervolemia, several factors can confound interpretation:

- **Patient positioning**: Trendelenburg position increases IJV diameter and reduces collapsibility, potentially mimicking hypervolemia [^112un93f].

- **Respiratory effort**: Spontaneous breathing, coughing, or Valsalva can transiently alter IJV diameter and compressibility [^1145RkEo].

- **Cardiac pathology**: Conditions such as tricuspid regurgitation, right heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension can independently elevate CVP and reduce IJV compressibility [^113DFsR7].

- **Operator technique**: Excessive probe pressure or improper transducer orientation can artifactually reduce apparent compressibility [^115rXfuB].

## Summary of ultrasound findings in hypervolemia

| **Ultrasound parameter** | **Findings in hypervolemia** |
|-|-|
| IJV diameter | Increased (> 1.2 cm in adults) [^113876vt] |
| Cross-sectional shape | Circular or oval [^notfound] |
| Collapsibility | Reduced (minimal collapse with gentle pressure) [^113876vt] |
| Respiratory variation | Blunted or minimal [^113876vt] |
| Valsalva response | Minimal change in diameter [^112VVzUw] |

---

In hypervolemic patients, the right IJV is **distended and less compressible** due to elevated CVP and reduced venous compliance [^113876vt]. Ultrasound shows a larger, more circular vein with minimal collapse under gentle pressure or with respiration, reflecting venous congestion and helping distinguish hypervolemia from hypovolemia [^113876vt].

### Diagnostic accuracy of a simple ultrasound measurement to estimate central venous pressure in spontaneously breathing, critically ill patients [^1131aod8]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis or septic shock improves outcomes but requires placement of a central venous catheter to measure central venous pressure (CVP), which may delay timely resuscitation and cause catheter-related complications. In addition, nonintensivists may not start early aggressive fluid resuscitation because of difficulty estimating CVP and concerns for inadvertent volume overload.

Objective

To determine if the CVP target of 8 to 12 mm Hg can be accurately assessed using noninvasive ultrasound to measure the internal jugular vein aspect ratio (height/width).

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Two academic medical centers.

Participants

Nineteen euvolemic volunteers and a convenience sample of 44 spontaneously breathing, critically ill patients.

Measurements

Ultrasound imaging of internal jugular vein aspect ratio; invasive CVP measurement in critically ill patients.

Results

For the volunteers, mean (standard deviation [SD]) aspect ratio of both the right and left internal jugular vein was 0.82 (0.07). Bland-Altman analysis indicated moderate intraobserver and interobserver agreement. Aspect ratio was similar for right and left sides and between men and women. In the critically ill patients, ultrasound accurately estimated a CVP of 8 mm Hg; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.84. For an invasively measured CVP of < 8 mm Hg, the likelihood ratio for a positive ultrasound test (aspect ratio < 0.83) was 3.5 and for a negative test (aspect ratio ≥ 0.83) was 0.30.

Conclusions

In this exploratory study, noninvasive ultrasound imaging of internal jugular vein aspect ratio accurately estimated a CVP of 8 mm Hg in spontaneously breathing, critically ill patients.

Conclusions

Ultrasound evaluation of IJV distensibility is a simple, easy, and readily accessible bedside measure that predicts volume responsiveness in critically ill ventilator-dependent septic patients. Importantly, the combined use of IJV distensibility with PPV increases the predictive value of these two volume-responsiveness parameters. Such right- and left-sided dynamic-measure predictor combinations need to be prospectively studied in future clinical trials.

### Bedside ultrasound assessment of jugular venous compliance as a potential point-of-care method to predict acute decompensated heart failure 30-day readmission [^112VVzUw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of filling pressure during physical examination is critical for CHF‐related decision‐making. The evaluation of the right internal jugular vein (RIJV) allows assessment of central venous pressure and is a direct measure of right atrial pressure (RAP). The majority of patients with ADHF have elevated RAP, which reflects elevated left ventricular filling pressures. Therefore, measurement of RAP is a fundamental part of the bedside heart failure evaluation. This is traditionally accomplished by assessment of the height of the RIJV meniscus, which provides a manometric measure of RAP. In clinical practice, however, estimation of central venous pressure by assessment of the RIJV is accurate in < 50% of cases and frequently is unobtainable. 7, 8 Thus, accurate assessment is difficult, and significant interobserver variability exists, even between highly trained clinicians. In fact, clinicians often underestimate RAP with this technique, which may lead to undertreatment, higher readmission rates, and, ultimately, increased overall cost of treatment for heart failure. Invasive measurement by right heart catheterization is increasingly utilized in the management for heart failure patients and carries both safety and financial burdens. We previously demonstrated in patients undergoing right heart catheterization (n = 67), that portable bedside ultrasound could be used to detect elevated RAP with a negative predictive value of 94%. 9 This finding stems from the basic biomechanical properties of veins: At low pressure, venous compliance is high, and an increase in pressure, such as during Valsalva, would be expected to cause a large change in visualization of the vein's cross‐sectional area (CSA). Conversely, at high venous pressure, compliance is low, and increases in pressure (Valsalva) would be expected to cause only small changes in CSA. 9 Intraobserver and interobserver testing showed negligible variability with this method (Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.904 [P < 0.0001], with intraclass correlation of 0.8752 [κ = 1], and 0.9662 [P < 0.0001], with intraclass correlation of 0.8779 [κ = 0.9], respectively). 9 In this study, we aimed to determine whether estimation of RAP using the ultrasound measurement of RIJV CSA change with Valsalva correlates with hypervolemia in patients admitted with ADHF and could predict 30‐day rehospitalization.

This study measured both CSA and diameters, differing from Yoon et al. who noted that the IJV exhibits varying shapes, such as round, oval, or flat. Direct measurement of CSA is preferable to TD for assessing IJV size.

The practical implications of hepatic compression for anesthesiologists include its potential utility as a technique for optimizing IJV dimensions to facilitate vascular access. HC can be performed in critically ill patients (e.g. in shock), dehydrated, younger and obese patients, where the vein is small and easily collapsible. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the differential effects of HC across various patient demographics, including sex, BMI, and fasting status, may help anesthesiologists to perform a suitable maneuver to optimize vein dimensions.

### Jugular vein distensibility predicts fluid responsiveness in septic patients [^116gdDXz]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Increasing cardiac output by volume expansion is a cornerstone treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis presumed to have tissue hypoperfusion. Fluid resuscitation is performed because it is assumed that the heart is operating of the steep ascending portion of the Frank-Starling curve (preload-responsive). However, fluid resuscitation in the non-preload-responsive patient may be deleterious if it promotes cor pulmonale, pulmonary edema, or peripheral edema. It is therefore useful to have reliable predictors of volume responsiveness.

Several studies have emphasized the reduced clinical value of static hemodynamic parameters, such as central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery occluding pressure, as compared with dynamic parameters in predicting fluid responsiveness. Such dynamic indicators include positive-pressure ventilation-induced changes in left ventricular stroke volume and arterial pulse pressure (PP). Similarly, ultrasound evaluation of respiratory variations of both superior and inferior vena cava diameter accurately reflects volume responsiveness. Specifically, both the superior vena cava (SVC) collapsibility index, calculated as the ratio of the difference in maximal diameter at expiration and the minimal diameter at inspiration to maximal diameter with insufflation, and the inferior vena cava (IVC) distensibility index, calculated as the difference in maximal diameter at inflation and minimal diameter at expiration predict volume responsiveness. IVC imaging can be problematic in the obese and those with ascites, and SVC imaging, though more accurate requires transesophageal echocardiography, limiting its application.

Many clinical examples, from tricuspid regurgitation to heart failure, from right heart failure to both hypo- and hypervolemia illustrate that any time pressure and volume change within the intrathoracic systemic venous compartment a change also occurs in extrathoracic veins, such as in the intra-abdominal IVC or extra-thoracic internal jugular vein (IJV). Based on this linkage of intrathoracic venous pressure and volume to extrathoracic venous pressure we hypothesized that right heart functional status relative to its volume responsiveness should be reflected by changes in IJV pressures as assessed by IJV diameter changes.

Since IJV imaging does not require transesophageal echocardiography and is technically easier to perform than IVC visualization, we tested the hypothesis that respiratory changes in IJV diameter in mechanically ventilated patients would also predict fluid responsiveness.

### How I do It: ultrasound-guided internal jugular and femoral central venous catheter insertion [^115feASs]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Central venous catheterization is routinely performed in the ICU to obtain venous access for hemodynamic monitoring, parenteral nutritional support, hemodialysis, and delivery of fluids and vasoactive medications. Although central venous catheters can be lifesaving, their insertion is not without risk. Historically, central veins were accessed using landmark-based techniques, but the medical literature strongly supports the use of ultrasound guidance. The purpose of this article is to review the basic principles of real-time ultrasound-guided internal jugular and femoral catheter placement. An approach for incorporating these tools into clinical practice is presented, along with illustrative figures and video.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^112G6Tgv]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric internal jugular (IJ) vein cannulation — ultrasound guidance and real-time technique: The most frequently accessed central vein using ultrasound in pediatric patients is the right IJ vein, and ultrasound allows visualization of position, patency, and thrombus, with one series demonstrating a 28% incidence of deep venous thrombosis in children with short-term central lines. Although one meta-analysis in infants and children did not demonstrate effects on failure or complication rates and did not use real-time ultrasound for all patients, the council recommends real-time use to derive the most benefit from ultrasound guidance. For technique optimization, liver compression may be used to increase IJ size or the Trendelenburg position can be used; the right IJ should lie lateral to the right CA and be easily compressible. During cannulation, the cannulation needle or catheter should be observed entering the vessel, observing vessel entry in real time is critical, and guide wire position within the vein and absence in the artery are confirmed in two image planes before dilation and placement of the central venous catheter.

### Ultrasonographic assessment of right internal jugular vein dimensions following passive legs elevation versus hepatic compression: a cross-sectional study [^114VuqpQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are also novel occlusive techniques involving the placement of an ultrasound probe to acquire a short-axis view of the IJV while an assistant applies gentle pressure to occlude the IJV at the superior end of the clavicle, below the scanning plane. Another technique involves occlusion of the contralateral IJV, where an assistant applies gentle pressure to obstruct the outflow, thereby increasing the diameter of the ipsilateral IJV.

Anatomical variations and patient factors like obesity, age, smaller veins and dehydration make central venous cannulation challenging. While Trendelenburg position and passive legs elevation are frequently performed, hepatic compression is still rarely used and there is limited data supporting its ability to increase venous dimensions, especially across varying patient demographics and physiological factors. In order to augment vein distensibility, increase success rate and lessen complications from cannulation, this study explores hepatic compression as a simple, non-invasive technique. Hepatic compression may provide a reliable alternative to other maneuvers by filling in evidence gaps and determining patient specific characteristics. We hypothesized that HC is not superior to PLE in optimizing the dimensions of the right IJV.

Evidence Review

Central Venous Pressure

POCUS Findings

Central venous pressure (CVP) can be inferred from (1) the internal jugular vein (IJV), and (2) the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Table 1).CVP is defined as the mean vena caval pressure or right atrial pressure, which, in the absence of tricuspid stenosis, is equal to the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Although widely discussed, several key aspects of the CVP often are understood poorly and bear clarifying.

Table 1
POCUS Applications in the Volume Status Assessment

First, although volume affects pressure, one must not conflate the two. An increase in CVP may be secondary to a primary pressure-related disorder, a volume-related disorder, or both. Elevated CVP may be an indication of a number of non-volume-related pathologic features, as listed in Table 2. Although CVP is not itself a measure of volume, it provides information about the right side of the heart's compliance and performance, which reflects its ability to accommodate volume.

Table 2
Causes of Elevated CVP That Do Not Reflect Total Body Volume Overload

Second, elevated CVP is a precursor to the development of clinically significant venous congestion. Venous return to the right side of the heart is governed by the pressure gradient between the right atrium and peripheral veins and by venous resistance. This pressure gradient is small, with peripheral venous pressure usually of 8 to 10 mm Hg and normal CVP ranging from 0 to 8 mm Hg. Therefore, as CVP increases, a requisite rise in peripheral venous pressures occurs to maintain right-sided heart filling.

Third, CVP is impacted by the peripheral venous system. The venous system is a low-pressure, high-capacitance system containing approximately 70% of intravascular circulating blood volume. Venous volume can be divided physiologically into stressed and unstressed volume. Under basal conditions, only about 30% of the intravascular blood volume is stressed volume; that is, it produces tension in the venous walls contributing to pressure in the vessels. The proportion of volume contained within the stressed and unstressed compartments varies depending on venous tone and is independent of total volume. The venous system can respond to physiologic demands by recruiting and de-recruiting volume from the unstressed compartment by means of sympathetic-mediated venous constriction, converting unstressed blood volume to stressed blood volume.

Identify anatomy of the insertion site and localization of the vein

As a first step, one should use US to identify the anatomy of the insertion site (vein and artery, adjacent anatomic structures) and the localization of the target vein. This includes checking for anatomic variations of the vessels (both vein and artery) and the localization of the vein in relation to the artery. This step requires combining a profound knowledge about anatomic structures and landmarks with the competencies required for US-guided CVC placement (such as knowledge about probe orientation and image display, converting the 2D US image into 3D reality, and hand–eye coordination). Given the variability in anatomic structures, this first step of US assessment is best performed before prepping and draping of the puncture site and the US probe.

The location of the vein and its anatomic relation to the artery is best identified when using both a short-axis (transverse) and a long-axis (longitudinal) view of the vessels (Fig. 2a, b). This also allows identifying hypoplastic veins or underfilling of the veins due to intravascular hypovolemia (Fig. 3). To exactly differentiate between venous and arterial vessels one can additionally perform color Doppler imaging and apply Doppler flow measurements to derive venous and arterial Doppler flow profiles (Fig. 4a, b).

### Hemodialysis catheter insertion: is increased PO2 a sign of arterial cannulation? A case report [^115hPGXC]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous catheterization (CVC) using a large bore catheter (> 7 French) is widely used in renal patients for hemodynamic monitoring, rapid infusion of fluids and blood products, antibiotic administration, parenteral nutrition, and vascular access for hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Ultrasound (US)-guided CVC for temporary vascular access, preferably using the right internal jugular vein (IJV), is widely accepted by nephrologists. Compared to the subclavian approach, right IJV is the preferred site because of easier catheterization, high rate of success when using only anatomical landmarks of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and straighter path to the superior vena cava. However CVC is associated with numerous potential complications, including death. Most mechanical complications occur early, during the puncture of the target vessel or catheter advancement, with subsequent development of hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistula, arterial dissection, neurological injury and severe or lethal airway obstruction. Therefore, nephrologists and nephrology trainees should not only be trained in temporary vascular access placement, but also be informed about techniques to identify or differentiate successful venous punctures from arterial punctures, as well as how to prevent and manage procedure-related complications.

### Role of internal jugular venous ultrasound in suspected or confirmed heart failure: a systematic review [^112E5U3E]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Few data are available on the use of internal jugular vein (IJV) ultrasound parameters to assess central venous pressure and clinical outcomes among patients with suspected or confirmed heart failure (HF).

Methods

We performed electronic searches on PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases from the inception through January 9, 2021, to identify studies evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the IJV ultrasound parameters and exploring its correlation with central venous pressure and clinical outcomes in adult patients with suspected or confirmed acutely decompensated HF. The studies' report quality was assessed by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 scale.

Results

A total of 11 studies were eligible for final analysis (n = 1481 patients with HF). The studies were segregated into 3 groups: (1) the evaluation of patients presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea, (2) the evaluation of patients presenting to the HF clinic for follow-up, and (3) the evaluation of hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated HF or undergoing right heart catheterization. US parameters included IJV height, IJV diameter, IJV diameter ratio, IJV cross-sectional area, respiratory compressibility index, and compression compressibility index.

Conclusions

The findings of this systematic review suggest a significant role for ultrasound interrogation of the IJV in evaluation of patients in the emergency department presenting with dyspnea, in the outpatient clinic for poor clinical outcomes in HF, and in determining the timing of discharge for patients admitted with acutely decompensated HF. Further studies are warranted for testing the reliability of the reported ultrasound indices.

### Will this hemodynamically unstable patient respond to a bolus of intravenous fluids? [^114d5Mec]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Fluid overload occurring as a consequence of overly aggressive fluid resuscitation may adversely affect outcome in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients. Therefore, following the initial fluid resuscitation, it is important to identify which patients will benefit from further fluid administration.

Objective

To identify predictors of fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable patients with signs of inadequate organ perfusion.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to June 2016) and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks for studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests to predict fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adult patients who were defined as having refractory hypotension, signs of organ hypoperfusion, or both. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output following intravenous fluid administration.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality. A bivariate mixed-effects binary regression model was used to pool the sensitivities, specificities, and LRs across studies.

Results

A total of 50 studies (N = 2260 patients) were analyzed. In all studies, indices were measured before assessment of fluid responsiveness. The mean prevalence of fluid responsiveness was 50% (95% CI, 42%-56%). Findings on physical examination were not predictive of fluid responsiveness with LRs and 95% CIs for each finding crossing 1.0. A low central venous pressure (CVP) (mean threshold < 8 mm Hg) was associated with fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.4–4.6]; pooled specificity, 76%), but a CVP greater than the threshold made fluid responsiveness less likely (negative LR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.39–0.65]; pooled sensitivity, 62%). Respiratory variation in vena cava diameter measured by ultrasound (distensibility index > 15%) predicted fluid responsiveness in a subgroup of patients without spontaneous respiratory efforts (positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 1.1–27]; pooled specificity, 85%). Patients with less vena cava distensibility were not as likely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.08–0.87]; pooled sensitivity, 77%). Augmentation of cardiac output or related parameters following passive leg raising predicted fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 11 [95% CI, 7.6–17]; pooled specificity, 92%). Conversely, the lack of an increase in cardiac output with passive leg raising identified patients unlikely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07–0.22]; pooled sensitivity, 88%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Passive leg raising followed by measurement of cardiac output or related parameters may be the most useful test for predicting fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adults. The usefulness of respiratory variation in the vena cava requires confirmatory studies.

### Ultrasound-guided internal jugular access: a proposed standardized approach and implications for training and practice [^115Uuu1U]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

In 2001, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recommended the use of ultrasound for the placement of central venous catheters (CVCs) as one of their 11 practices to improve patient care. These recommendations were based on the results of several randomized clinical trials showing significantly improved overall success as well as reductions in complications. This article will describe the practical aspects of using ultrasound to guide placement of CVCs in the internal jugular vein in a "how I do it" approach, as well as review the practice management and training aspects related to incorporating ultrasound into daily practice.

### Bedside ultrasound assessment of jugular venous compliance as a potential point-of-care method to predict acute decompensated heart failure 30-day readmission [^114Sm7ar]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Heart failure is one of the most costly diagnosis-related groups, largely because of hospital readmissions. Objective assessment of volume status to ensure optimization before hospital discharge could significantly reduce readmissions. We previously demonstrated an ultrasound method of quantifying percentage of cross-sectional area (CSA) change of the right internal jugular vein with Valsalva that reliably estimates central venous pressure. Methods and Results Patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) underwent ultrasound measurements of the right internal jugular vein at end-expiration and during the strain phase of Valsalva to determine a percentage of CSA change. An initial subgroup of patients with right heart catheterization and accompanying ultrasound measurements of the right internal jugular vein identified a percentage of CSA change predictive of right atrial pressure (RAP) ≥ 12 mm Hg. Images of admitted ADHF patients were obtained at admission and discharge for final analysis. Simultaneous right heart catheterization and right internal jugular vein ultrasound measurements demonstrated that a < 66% CSA change predicted RAP ≥ 12 mm Hg (positive predictive value: 87%; P < 0.05, receiver operating characteristic curve). Elevated admission RAP by percentage of CSA change normalized by discharge (P < 0.05), indicating that this test is significantly responsive to therapeutic interventions. Using the cutoff value of 66% CSA change, normal RAP at discharge had 91% predictive value for patients avoiding 30-day readmission (P < 0.05). Conclusions This bedside ultrasound technique strongly correlates to invasive RAP measurement in ADHF patients, identifies restoration of euvolemia, and is predictive of 30-day ADHF readmission. This tool could help guide inpatient ADHF treatment and may lead to reduced readmissions.

### Comparison of subclavian vein to inferior vena cava collapsibility by ultrasound in acute heart failure: a pilot study [^116aZyGr]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Early, accurate, and ongoing intravascular volume assessment in patients admitted with heart failure is required to provide effective goal‐directed therapy, minimize adverse outcomes of inappropriate, ineffective, or excessive diuresis, and improve survival. Although 65% of nonedematous patients with chronic heart failure are intravascularly hypervolemic, 30% are euvolemic, and 5% are hypovolemic. Assessment of relative intravascular volume by physical examination may be inaccurate, and N‐terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) is nonspecific for volume overload.

The American Society of Echocardiography supports the use of ultrasound assessment of IVC maximum diameter (IVC max) and IVC collapsibility index (CI) with respiration to estimate right atrial pressure (RAP), with recent validation. IVC CI measurements have reasonable sensitivity (84%–96%) and specificity (37%–93%) for diagnosis of congestive heart failure, and may help guide diuresis and heart failure therapy to improve patient outcomes.

The goal of volume management is to improve cardiac output by optimizing relative intravascular volume. The gold standard for assessing volume responsiveness has been defined as an increase in cardiac output of ≥ 10% in response to volume administration. Dynamic parameters that take into account respiratory variation, such as IVC CI, and subclavian vein (SCV) CI, have the best sensitivity and specificity for estimating relative intravascular volume and predicting response to volume administration. These dynamic parameters are objective measures of the jugular venous waveform, with increased respiratory variation suggesting intravascular hypovolemia or volume responsiveness.

Ultrasound measurements of IVC CI have been used to assess relative intravascular volume overload in patients with congestive heart failure, and/or renal failure, and to predict which patients may benefit from volume removal. An IVC CI of < 20% was related to the ability to remove volume by ultrafiltrationand/or increase cardiac output after volume removalin renal failure. In patients with shortness of breath due to various etiologies, IVC CI was greater in nonheart failure (46%) than in heart failure (9.6%) patients (p < .0001). At an IVC CI cutoff of 15%, sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure were 92% and 84%, respectively. IVC diameter and variation with respiration may be altered by changes in relative intravascular volume as well as by moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR).

### Demystifying volume status: an ultrasound-guided physiologic framework [^115PCCjW]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points for CVP

(1) CVP is influenced by nonvolume variables, physiologic conditions, and hemodynamic responses to disease states, rather than being a true reflection of whole-body volume or fluid responsiveness.(2) A nonelevated CVP is the normal physiologic state and does not necessarily equate to a need for additional fluids. (3) An elevated CVP may represent volume intolerance, the pathologic features listed in Table 2, or both. (4) When the IJV and IVC findings on POCUS are discordant, careful examination for caveats or confounders should take place (Table 1).

### New method for noninvasive quantification of central venous pressure by ultrasound [^115NREo8]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The central venous pressure (CVP) is essential for assessing the cardiac preload and circulating blood volume in clinic. The invasive CVP measurement by central venous catheter has been reported with various complications. The aim of this study was to develop a new noninvasive method for quantification of CVP by ultrasound.

Methods and Results

Seventy-six patients who had their CVP monitored for intraoperative or postoperative management were recruited. By accurate location of the collapse point of the internal jugular vein and the center of the right atrium using ultrasound imaging, the height of the fluid column between those 2 points was measured as the noninvasive CVP (CVPn). A total of 118 measurements were performed and compared with the invasive CVP (CVPi). Linear correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between CVPi and CVPn (preoperative measurements, r = 0.90; P < 0.01 and postoperative measurements, r = 0.93; P < 0.01). Bland-Altman plots showed a good agreement between CVPi and CVPn with the mean difference of 0.22 mmHg (preoperative measurements) and -0.09 mmHg (postoperative measurements), respectively.

Conclusions

The new noninvasive CVP quantification method based on the location of both the collapse point of internal jugular vein and the center of right atrium by ultrasound could be used as a reliable approach for monitoring the hemodynamic status in clinic.

### Single-plane versus real-time biplane approaches for ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization in critical care patients: a randomized controlled trial [^112rh21h]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Central venous catheterization (CVC), which can be lifesaving for critically ill patients, is frequently performed to aid the intravenous administration of fluid resuscitation, allow safe intravenous administration of medication, facilitate hemodialysis, and help in the monitoring of hemodynamic variables in the intensive care unit (ICU). More than 15 million CVCs are performed each year in the United States, and 70 CVCs per 100 patient-days are performed in the European ICUs. Central venous access is commonly attempted through the internal jugular vein (IJV), subclavian vein, and femoral vein (FV). IJV and FV are the primary choices, as recommended by the guidelines, both in elective and emergency settings because of their advantage of being less frequently associated with mechanical complications. Ultrasound (US) guidance has been extensively studied to reduce the number of complications and improve the safety and quality of CVCs; therefore, US-guided techniques have become widely accepted and are recommended by the guidelines for CVCs.

### Bedside ultrasound of the internal jugular vein to assess fluid status and right ventricular function: the POCUS-JVD study [^113876vt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate estimation of fluid status is important in the management of heart failure patients, however, the current methods for bedside assessment can be unreliable or impractical for daily use.

Methods

Non-ventilated patients were enrolled immediately prior to scheduled right heart catheterization (RHC). Using M-mode, IJV maximum (Dmax) and minimum (Dmin) anteroposterior diameters were measured during normal breathing, while supine. Respiratory variation in diameter (RVD) was calculated as [(Dmax - Dmin)/Dmax] in percentage. Collapsibility with sniff maneuver (COS) was assessed. Lastly, inferior vena cava (IVC) was assessed. Pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) was calculated. Data was obtained by five investigators.

Results

Total 176 patients were enrolled. Mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m2, LVEF 14–69% (range), 38% with LVEF ≤ 35%. The POCUS of IJV could be performed in all patients in < 5 min. Increasing RAP demonstrated progressive increase in IJV and IVC diameters. For high filling pressure (RAP ≥ 10 mmHg), an IJV Dmax ≥ 1.2 cm or IJV-RVD < 30% had specificity > 70%. Combining the POCUS of IJV to physical examination improved the combined specificity to 97% for RAP ≥ 10 mmHg. Conversely, a finding of IJV-COS was 88% specific for normal RAP (< 10 mmHg). An IJV-RVD < 15% is suggested as a cutoff for RAP ≥ 15 mmHg. The performance of IJV POCUS was comparable to IVC. For RV function assessment, IJV-RVD < 30% had 76% sensitivity and 73% specificity for PAPi < 3, while IJV-COS was 80% specific for PAPi ≥ 3.

Conclusion

POCUS of IJV is an easy to perform, specific and reliable method for volume status estimation in daily practice. An IJV-RVD < 30% is suggested for estimation of RAP ≥ 10 mmHg and PAPi < 3.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography [^116yTD8Z]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Vessel identification by ultrasound (US) — morphology, positioning maneuvers, and Doppler signatures — is summarized as follows: veins are larger, thin walled, contain valves, compressible with modest external surface pressure, and may change diameter with respiration or position, whereas arteries are smaller, round, thicker walled, valveless, not readily compressible, and pulsatile under normal cardiac conditions. Systematic US scanning identifies the vessel size, location, patency, and anomalies; vein diameter and shape vary with position and fluid status, and unless contraindicated, placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position or compressing the liver may increase jugular vein diameter and reduces the risk for air embolism during subclavian vein cannulation; a Valsalva maneuver will further augment jugular vein diameter and is most useful in hypovolemic patients; the reverse Trendelenburg position may increase femoral and peripheral lower limb venous vessel size. Adding Doppler interrogation can further help differentiate arteries from veins: color flow Doppler at any velocity shows pulsatile systolic arterial flow in either SAX or LAX; normal venous flow is low velocity requiring a lower CFD velocity scale to show uniform color representing continuous laminar flow; a small PWD sample volume within the vessel lumen shows characteristic systolic flow predominance in an artery, while a lower PWD velocity range shows multiphasic venous flow on the basis of the cardiac cycle; however, the absence of arterial pulsatility cannot identify an artery during conditions such as cardiopulmonary bypass, nonpulsatile ventricular circulatory assistance, and cardiac or circulatory arrest.

Catheters and port catheter systems — site selection and imaging: The preferred insertion site for tunneled cuffed venous dialysis catheters or port catheter systems is the right internal jugular vein, with subclavian access used only when no other upper-extremity or chest-wall options are available (A). Other options include the right external jugular vein, left internal and external jugular veins, subclavian veins, femoral veins, and translumbar and transhepatic access to the IVC, and ultrasound should be used in the placement of catheters (B); the position of the tip of any central catheter should be verified radiologically (B).

### Real-time ultrasound-guided catheterisation of the internal jugular vein: a prospective comparison with the landmark technique in critical care patients [^117WCsXz]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The visualisation of the IJV and of neighboring anatomical structures on both the longitudinal and transverse axes ensures the avoidance of a double-wall puncture during catheterisation.

- Ultrasound-guided cannulation of the IJV offers the advantage of a shorter access time and a reduced number of successful attempts.

- Ultrasound-guided cannulation of the IJV has a lower mechanical complication rate and may result in a lower incidence of CVC-BSI compared with the landmark technique.

### Jugular vein distensibility predicts fluid responsiveness in septic patients [^112wi2hZ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study is that US assessment of IJV distensibility during positive-pressure ventilation can discriminate R from NR in critically ill septic patients. Furthermore, the combination of both IJV distensibility and PPV markedly increased the reliability of these predictive indices.

The use of respiratory variations of arterial pressure and aortic flow are accepted bedside parameters of fluid responsiveness and are incorporated into the display screens of many monitoring devices and used to drive resuscitation algorithms. Static parameters, such as CVP, are poor predictors of fluid responsiveness as previously reported and as shown in our study.

Although each dynamic measure may independently predict fluid responsiveness, combining several independently affected physiological parameters, like PPV and IJV distensibility, improves the sensitivity and specificity of these parameters to predict volume responsiveness. The improved performance of the combined measure is due, most likely, to the ability to assess both right and left sided volume responsiveness. IJV distensibility assesses venous return and right ventricular reserve while PPV assesses left ventricular response, both of which are central to controlling overall cardiovascular homeostasis.

Most of the studies evaluating the ability of functional parameters to predict the CI response to volume challenge use ROC-curve analysis to define the optimal threshold, allowing for maximum sensitivity and specificity. Recently Cannesson et al. used a gray-zone approach evidencing that when PPV decreases into a gray zone between 9 and 13%, uncertainty exists and clinicians should attempt to define volume responsiveness using additional measures. By combining IJV distensibility with PPV, we demonstrate that such gray-zone conditions can be minimized.

Our new measure of IJV diameter change is easily seen with US with minimal training, as this approach is frequently used for US-guided central vein catheterization. We demonstrated the reliability of IJV distensibility on detecting fluid responsiveness of ventilated patients with a value of 16.4% IJV distensibility having a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% in mechanically ventilated septic patients. Similarly, PPV threshold values of 12.5% have been reported in the literature to discriminate between R and NR with similar sensitivity and specificity. Thus, both PPV and IJV distensibility can be used to assess fluid responsiveness. Perhaps more interesting, the combination of both PPV and IJV distensibility improves the sensitivity and specificity of fluid responsiveness prediction with best results for values of IJV > 9.9% and PPV of > 12%. These data suggest that combining right- and left-sided dynamic parameters should improve their predictive values.

### Bedside ultrasound assessment of jugular venous compliance as a potential point-of-care method to predict acute decompensated heart failure 30-day readmission [^115sc6mw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The change in RIJV CSA measurements between end‐expiration and the strain phase of Valsalva were tabulated and compared with the resting RAP for all patients enrolled in the study. A ROC curve was generated from these data, and the area under the curve (AUC) was tested for a significant difference from 0.5 (null hypothesis) using RAP ≥ 12 mm Hg to indicate hypervolemia. The ROC curve determined the optimal ultrasound measurement threshold to indicate volume overload to provide an AUC of > 0.8 ± 0.05. To test for associations between RAP and change in RIJV CSA with Valsalva, the Fisher exact test was used, given the relatively small sample size. The diagnostic utility of this percentage change in RIJV CSA with Valsalva was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. To test the association between change in RIJV CSA with Valsalva and early readmission, defined as 30 days, the Fisher exact test was again used. The diagnostic utility of the ultrasound measurement at discharge was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Statistical significance was defined as 2‐sided P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM Corp). Exploratory analyses were conducted to test whether key patient characteristics at baseline such as age, comorbidities, renal function, BNP, net fluid status, and weight were associated with the percentage change in RIJV CSA using Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests for continuous data and χ² or Fisher exact tests for categorical data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for the effect of these factors on RAP and percentage change in RIJV CSA. The analyses were conducted according to the intention‐to‐treat principle with 2‐sided hypothesis tests and α = 0.05. Categorical data are presented as percentages, and normally distributed continuous data are presented as mean ± SD. Log‐transformed values for BNP (logBNP) were used to reduce the effect of the typical skewness of BNP values.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^113VbQJu]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Assessment of volume status in heart failure (HF) is described as critically important at the initial and each follow-up visit; at each visit clinicians should record body weight and sitting and standing blood pressures and determine jugular venous distension, organ congestion, and peripheral edema. The most reliable sign of volume overload is jugular venous distension, and right-sided filling pressures are elevated in the basal state or with abdominal compression in many patients with chronically elevated left-sided filling pressures. Most patients with peripheral edema should be considered to have volume overload, whereas most patients with chronic HF do not have rales; studies using 131I-tagged albumin showed plasma volume expansion in more than 50% of patients in whom clinical volume overload was not recognized. Short-term changes in fluid status are best assessed by measuring changes in body weight. The majority with clinical evidence of volume overload do not exhibit hypoperfusion, but when cardiac output declines markedly or abruptly, clues include narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, resting tachycardia, and disproportionate elevation of blood urea nitrogen relative to serum creatinine.

### Ultrasound imaging of congestion in heart failure: examinations beyond the heart [^116hg4FC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Congestion, related to pressure and/or fluid overload, plays a central role in the pathophysiology, presentation and prognosis of heart failure and is an important therapeutic target. While symptoms and physical signs of fluid overload are required to make a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, they lack both sensitivity and specificity, which might lead to diagnostic delay and uncertainty. Over the last decades, new ultrasound methods for the detection of elevated intracardiac pressures and/or fluid overload have been developed that are more sensitive and specific, thereby enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis and facilitating treatment strategies. Accordingly, we considered that a state-of-the-art review of ultrasound methods for the detection and quantification of congestion was timely, including imaging of the heart, lungs (B-lines), kidneys (intrarenal venous flow), and venous system (inferior vena cava and internal jugular vein diameter).

### Jugular vein distensibility predicts fluid responsiveness in septic patients [^113DFsR7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, all subjects were on mechanical ventilation and fully adapted to the ventilator. However, IVC collapse analysis remains predictive of fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing subjects, suggesting that the IJV distensibility index may remain valid as well. Still, the IJV distensibility index needs to be studied in spontaneously breathing subjects. Second, we did not also measure IVC collapse or stroke-volume variation, both measures of volume responsiveness similar in quality to our IJV distensibility and PPV measures, respectively. Still, PPV should be an acceptable surrogate for stroke-volume variation in this type of comparison. Third, changes in CVP influence the IJV pressure and diameter and may decrease relative distensibility. Conditions associated with increased intra-abdominal or intrathoracic pressure may potentially increase CVP and can lead to a reduced IJV distensibility index independent of preload responsiveness. We did not study the effect of high CVP on IJV distensibility. However, this process would have similar effects on both SVC and IVC collapse parameters. Accordingly, right-sided US indices, using large-vein collapsibility to predict volume responsiveness, require careful awareness of these potential limitations. Again, these specific clinical conditions may also minimize the predictive values of PPV as well. Fourth, patients' position can influence IJV size. The supine position leads to increased IJV diameter, which is further increased in the Trendelenburg position, whereas sitting or standing can reduce the IJV filling and IJV diameter. Therefore, we made all our measurements from a standard 30° head of the bed elevated semi-recumbent position. However, since this is the recommended position for supine ventilated patients, to minimize aspiration, this limitation needs to be understood and positioning standardized in clinical practice if IJV distensibility index is used for clinical decision-making. Fifth, we did not include patients with cardiac disease, who would particularly benefit from functional hemodynamic monitoring. However, in this initial clinical study we did not aim to evaluate the effectiveness of such methods in those patients, because of the potential confounding effect that right heart failure would impose on venous pressures. As cor pulmonale markedly alters other dynamic indices, often making them appear positive when not, we chose to also exclude these patients from our study. However, this patient cohort had a wide range of baseline cardiac reserve, as manifested by having only 30 of 50 patients being volume responsive. Therefore, in this initial validation study, any confounding condition, such as cardiac disease, jugular vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation was excluded. Sixth, our only cardiovascular challenge was fluid loading. It is not clear if the use of vasoactive drugs, which may independently alter both CVP and the effective circulating blood volume, would independently affect the IJV distensibility index. This interaction and its interpretation remain to be assessed. Finally, as all measurements were performed by a single operator, inter-observer variability in IJV diameter measurement remains to be assessed in future studies.

### Evaluation of proper above-the-diaphragm central venous catheter placement: the saline flush test [^115VqrP2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

hest radiographs are routinely obtained after the insertion of above-the-diaphragm central venous catheters to confirm placement and detect mechanical complications. At times, performing the radiograph can be time-consuming and findings may be inaccurate. We present a case of a patient with difficult access who required emergent resuscitation. A central venous catheter was inserted under ultrasound guidance into the patient's right internal jugular vein. After the procedure, a 2-dimensional bedside ultrasound of the heart was performed with simultaneous flush of saline through the catheter. Ultrasound detected an immediate echogenic turbulent pattern from the flush in the right atrium and then the right ventricle. This correlated to the proper placement of the catheter tip in the superior vena cava. A bedside ultrasound of the ipsilateral lung evaluated and ruled out iatrogenic pneumothorax. Other investigators have demonstrated different methods to confirm central venous catheter placement by bedside ultrasound, utilizing multiple views, Doppler technology, or microbubble contrast. This novel technique, as described here, is most simple. Further research is needed to demonstrate accuracy and utility.

### Ultrasound-guided placement of central venous port systems via the right internal jugular vein: are chest X-ray and / or fluoroscopy needed to confirm the correct placement of the device? [^112s54pQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous central venous port (CVP) placement using ultrasound-guidance (USG) via right internal jugular vein is described as a safe and effective procedure. The aim of this study is to determine whether intraoperative fluoroscopy (IF) and/or postoperative chest X-ray (CXR) are required to confirm the correct position of the catheter.

Methods

Between January 2012 and December 2014, 302 adult patients underwent elective CVP system placement under USG. The standard venous access site was the right internal jugular vein. The length of catheter was calculated based on the height of the patient. IF was always performed to confirm US findings.

Results

176 patients were men and 126 were women and average height was 176.2 cm (range 154–193 cm). The average length of the catheter was 16.4 cm (range 14–18). Catheter malposition and pneumothorax were observed in 4 (1.3%) and 3 (1%) patients, respectively. IF confirmed the correct position of the catheter in all cases. Catheter misplacement (4 cases) was previously identified and corrected on USG. Our rates of pneumothorax are in accordance with those of the literature (0.5–3%).

Conclusion

Ultrasonography has resulted in improved safety and effectiveness of port system implantation. The routine use of CXR and IF should be considered unnecessary.

### Can you justify not using ultrasound guidance for central venous access? [^114imWpY]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Karakitsos and coworkers, in this journal, reported further compelling evidence on the value of ultrasound in guiding internal jugular vein catheterization. In a large, prospective, randomized study of 900 patients, comparisons were made between patients in whom the procedure was performed using landmark-based techniques and those assigned to ultrasound guidance. The key benefits from use of ultrasound included reduction in needle puncture time, increased overall success rate (100% versus 94%), reduction in carotid puncture (1% versus 11%), reduction in carotid haematoma (0.4% versus 8.4%), reduction in haemothorax (0% versus 1.7%), decreased pneumothorax (0% versus 2.4%) and reduction in catheter-related infection (10% versus 16%). The implications of these findings are discussed, and a compelling case for routine use of ultrasound to guide central venous access is made.

### Accuracy of ultrasound jugular venous pressure height in predicting central venous congestion [^114A9oQF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Assessment of volume status through the estimation of central venous pressure (CVP) is integral in the care of heart failure (HF). Bedside assessment is limited by obesity, variation in physical examination skills, and expertise in ultrasonography.

Objective

To validate the accuracy of quantitative and qualitative point-of-care ultrasonography assessment of jugular venous pressure (JVP) in predicting elevated CVP.

Design

Prospective observational study using convenience sampling.

Setting

2 U.S. academic hospitals.

Patients

Adult patients undergoing right heart catheterization between 5 February 2019 and 1 March 2021.

Measurements

Estimation of the JVP height by handheld ultrasound device (uJVP), JVP by traditional physical examination, and qualitative presence of a distended uJVP in the upright position (upright-uJVP) was done before invasive measurements. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis of the uJVP was compared with invasive hemodynamics.

Results

In 100 participants undergoing right heart catheterization for HF indications (mean age, 59.6 years; 44% with preserved ejection fraction), the uJVP in a reclined position accurately predicted elevated right atrial pressure (RAP) (> 10 mm Hg), with an area under the curve of 0.84. A positive uJVP in the upright position was 94.6% specific for predicting elevated RAP.

Limitation

Limited examiners, only 2 centers, and convenience sampling.

Conclusion

Point-of-care ultrasonography assessment of the uJVP is feasible, reproducible, and accurately predictive of elevated CVPs in patients undergoing right heart catheterization. Further investigation of clinical application of ultrasound-measured JVP seems warranted.

Primary Funding Source

### Ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement: a structured review and recommendations for clinical practice [^117Hqsev]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

A guideline from the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) also recommends pre-interventional US vessel screening of target vessels to determine the most appropriate anatomical site and the optimal patient position (5-D) and routine real-time US guidance during CVC placement (1-A).

In 2016, the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland also recommended the routine use of US for CVC placement in the IJV. In addition, the expert group recommends US use "for all other central venous access sites, but recognizes evidence is, at present, limited". Nevertheless, the recommendation also underlines that the understanding of the landmark technique is necessary for situations when US is not available.

### Central vein catheterization of dialysis patients with real time ultrasound guidance [^1147qPtZ]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2008). Low credibility.

Internal jugular vein cannulation has become a routinary and clinically important aspect of medical care in critically ill patients. The landmark-guided technique usually affords rapid and easy vascular access, but it is not always successful and may be complicated by arterial puncture, hematoma, pneumothorax. A prospective, descriptive study is reported on the use and success of ultrasound-assisted central vein catheterization in dialysis patients who had an indication for internal jugular vein catheterization. Data were collected prospectively on number of punctures, needle passes, and success rates. Over a 6-year period, there were 220 attempts at internal jugular catheterization in 205 patients and ultrasound guidance was used in 210 of the 220 (95%) attempts. Incidences of successful puncture and cannulation using ultrasound were 100% (210 out of 210) and 99.5% (209 out of 210), respectively, compared with 80% (8 out of 10) and 80% (8 out of 10) in the landmark group. With the availability of the ultrasound device complication rates also improved markedly, suggesting that the ultrasound technique is an easily learned technique that rapidly produces an improvement over the external landmark method. First attempt success improved from 20% to 85%, carotid punctures decreased from 33% to 2.9% (6 out of 210). The patient population also included 32 patients with several high risk conditions, such as no visual or palpable landmarks, severe coagulopathies due to hepatic failure or ex-cess of anticoagulation treatment. In these patients, cannulation was successful in 100% (32 out of 32) using ultrasound guidance. In 9 patients (9/195, 4.6%), preliminary ultrasound evaluation of the neck vessels failed to identify a right internal jugular vein suitable for cannulation, because of thrombosis or a small diameter of the vein. In all cases, the left internal jugular vein could be cannulated without difficulties. Our results confirm that ultrasound-guided cannulation of the internal jugular vein offers several advantages over the external landmarks technique: higher success rate in both vein puncture and catheter placement, lower complications, lower patient discomfort during the procedure because of a low number of needle passes. Ultrasound-assisted cannulation of the internal jugular vein may become the standard approach to dialysis catheter placement in the future.

Positioning the patient for needle insertion and catheter placement — observational studies report that Trendelenburg positioning increases right internal jugular vein diameter or cross-sectional area in adult volunteers, pediatric patients, and newborns, but findings are equivocal in adult patients, and the literature is insufficient to evaluate whether Trendelenburg positioning improves insertion success rates or decreases the risk of mechanical complications; consultants and ASA members strongly agree with the recommendation to perform central venous access in the neck or chest with the patient in the Trendelenburg position when clinically appropriate and feasible.

### Jugular vein distensibility predicts fluid responsiveness in septic patients [^112PoCRP]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of the study was to verify the efficacy of using internal jugular vein (IJV) size and distensibility as a reliable index of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis.

Methods

Hemodynamic data of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis were collected through a radial arterial indwelling catheter connected to continuous hemodynamic monitoring system (Most Care®, Vytech Health, Padova, Italy), including cardiac index (CI) (L/min/M 2), heart rate (beats/min), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (mmHg), central venous pressure (CVP) (mmHg) and arterial pulse pressure variation (PPV), coupled with ultrasound evaluation of IJV distensibility (%), defined as a ratio of the difference between IJV maximal antero-posterior diameter during inspiration and minimum expiratory diameter to minimum expiratory diameter x100. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups; fluid responders (R), if CI increase of more than or equal to 15% after a 7 ml/kg crystalloid infusion, and non-responders (NR) if CI increased more than 15%. We compared differences in measured variables between R and NR groups and calculated receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves of optimal IJV distensibility and PPV sensitivity and specificity to predicting R. We also calculated a combined inferior vena cava distensibility-PPV ROC curve to predict R.

Results

We enrolled 50 patients, of these, 30 were R. Responders presented higher IJV distensibility and PPV before fluid challenge than NR (P < 0.05). An IJV distensibility more than 18% prior to volume challenge had an 80% sensitivity and 85% specificity to predict R. Pairwise comparison between IJV distensibility and PPV ROC curves revealed similar ROC area under the curve results. Interestingly, combining IJV distensibility more than 9.7% and PPV more than 12% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 95%.

Conclusion

IJV distensibility is an accurate, easily acquired non-invasive parameter of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated septic patients with performance similar to PPV. The combined use of IJV distensibility with left-sided indexes of fluid responsiveness improves their predictive value.

### Jugular vein distensibility predicts fluid responsiveness in septic patients [^115rXfuB]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

We simultaneously collected the hemodynamic data and an ultrasound (US) examination of the IJV by the same operator. The ultrasound examination was performed with a 12-MHz linear transducer (Esaote, Milan, Italy) and ultrasound system (MyLab™ 50 XVision). The IJV was visualized with two-dimensional echo at the level of the cricoid cartilage and recognized by compression, color Doppler and pulse wave Doppler sampling. As the patient position can influence IJV, all measurements were performed in the semi-recumbent position (head elevated 30°).

The antero-posterior (AP) IJV diameter was measured using M-mode during a respiratory cycle. In order to avoid changes in vein diameter unrelated to respiratory variation, gentle pressure by the US probe was used to collapse the IJV in order to distinguish it from the carotid artery, then the pressure was relieved to the US probe-skin interface and attention was given to avoid influence of probe compression on IJV dimensions during the US examination. Moreover, in order to avoid interference of probe-to-vein angle, the JV evaluation was performed by positioning the probe perpendicular to the skin and oriented orthogonally to the JV short-axis diameter (Figure 1). The IJV distensibility index (%) was calculated as the ratio of the difference in the maximal IJV AP diameter during inspiration and minimum IJV expiratory diameter to the minimum IJV expiratory diameter × 100.

Figure 1
Ultrasound probe position for internal jugular vein detection at the cricoid cartilage level. The patient is in the supine position at 30° with head rotation of 30°.

All ultrasound measurements were performed before (T 0) and immediately after (T 1) 30-minute volume expansion with a 7-ml/kg crystalloid infusion. IJV distensibility was evaluated offline by an investigator blinded to the results of the fluid challenge on CI. Two consecutive measures of IJV diameters were obtained before and after fluid challenge on the first 15 patients to evaluate intraobserver variability.

Vasoactive drug infusion rates and ventilation settings were not changed during this 30-minute observation interval. Patients were defined as fluid responders (R) if an increase in CI (ΔCI) ≥ 15% was obtained after volume expansion, and non-responders (NR) if ΔCI was < 15%.

### Massive hemothorax secondary to internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement in a patient undergoing spinal surgery complicated by chest trauma: a case report [^112dXnbp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) is a common procedure for spinal surgery and is relatively safe under ultrasound guidance.

Case presentation

We report the case of a 56-year-old female who underwent ultrasound-guided placement of an internal jugular vein CVC for fluid replacement during spinal surgery for thoracic vertebral burst compression fracture and multiple rib fractures as a result of a high-altitude fall injury. Hemothorax developed intraoperatively. During a thoracotomy, the tip of the CVC was found within the chest cavity. The presence of chest trauma may impact on clinician's appreciation of the potential complications of internal jugular vein CVC placement.

Conclusion

The present case demonstrates the need for clinical awareness of the potential complications of CVC placement in patients with chest trauma and the need for adequate training in this technique.

### Ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement: a structured review and recommendations for clinical practice [^1135aiCd]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

US guidance can improve patient safety and procedural quality during CVC placement in the IJV, FV, and SV. Based on evidence from clinical studies, several guidelines of medical societies strongly recommend the use of US for CVC placement in the IJV. Data from survey studies show that there is still a gap between the existing evidence and guidelines and the use of US in clinical practice. We recommend a six-step systematic approach for US-guided central venous access. To achieve the best skill level for CVC placement the knowledge from anatomic landmark techniques and the knowledge from US-guided CVC placement need to be combined and integrated.

### Should we measure the central venous pressure to guide fluid management? Ten answers to 10 questions [^114YMK67]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

CVP values provide important information about the cardiocirculatory status of the patient and should not be abandoned. Use of CVP to guide fluid resuscitation has many limitations, but we believe it is wiser to understand and take into account these limitations rather than to discard CVP completely.

### Dialysis catheter placement via the left internal jugular vein: risk of brachiocephalic vein perforation [^113tyq9Y]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We discuss a case of a brachiocephalic vein (BCV) perforation after Tesio® central venous catheter insertion.

Method and Results

An 80-year-old patient underwent an ultrasound-guided hemodialysis (HD) catheter placement via his left internal jugular vein (IJV). One day postoperatively, the patient became hemodynamically unstable immediately after HD initiation. As a vascular event was feared, an emergency CT scan was performed demonstrating a BCV perforation. The patient underwent a sternotomy, the lines were removed and the venous laceration was closed. The patient recovered well.

Conclusions

In spite of ultrasound guidance, fluoroscopy for guidewire and sheath advancement, venous blood aspiration and a normal appearing postoperative x-ray, traumatic central venous catheter placement is still possible. Tenting of the BCV wall during catheter advancement possibly caused the venous perforation. A 'how-to' for correct catheter placement via the IJV is provided and potential pitfalls during each procedural step are discussed.

### Real-time ultrasound-guided catheterisation of the internal jugular vein: a prospective comparison with the landmark technique in critical care patients [^111th53K]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Catheterisation of the internal jugular vein (IJV) is commonly attempted to obtain central venous access for haemodynamic monitoring, long-term administration of fluids, antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition, and haemodialysis in critical care patients. The safe puncture of the IJV is achieved by using anatomical landmarks on the skin's surface and thus passing the needle along the anticipated line of the vein. Many anatomic landmark-guided techniques for IJV puncture have been described since 1966. Complications, including death, are influenced by patient factors such as body mass index (BMI), site of attempted access, and operator experience. Furthermore, inability to cannulate the IJV may occur in up to 19.4% of cases.

It has been suggested that ultrasound guidance could be beneficial in placing central venous catheters (CVCs) by improving the success rate, reducing the number of needle passes, and decreasing complications. Also, employment of ultrasound imaging may identify patients in whom central venous access may be more difficult and/or in whom consequences of complications could be more serious. Although the ultrasound method has compared favourably with the landmark technique, its widespread use has been hampered by the impracticality of specially designed ultrasound devices or sterile scanner manipulation, unavailability of equipment, and lack of trained personnel. Furthermore, previous studies of ultrasound location of vessels followed by subsequent catheter placement with landmark techniques found no advantages over standard landmark techniques. However, few prospective studies exist comparing the technique itself of ultrasound-guided central venous cannulation versus the landmark method in critical care patients. This prospective study was designed to compare the real-time ultrasound-guided approach with the landmark technique in the cannulation of the IJV in critical care patients.

### Massive hemothorax secondary to internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement in a patient undergoing spinal surgery complicated by chest trauma: a case report [^1129SfQA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

We report the case of a 56-year-old female patient weighing 58 kg who was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital due to chest and back pain caused by injury following a fall from height. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (KLL-2022–663).

Vital signs were stable. Relevant examinations were completed after admission. Blood routine examination demonstrated a hemoglobin (HB) level of 83 g/L, red blood cell (RBC)-specific volume of 0.26, and an RBC count of 2.68 × 10¹² /L. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a T4 vertebral burst compression fracture, suspected spinal cord injury, and fractures of the first to third right ribs and the first to fifth left ribs. Closed thoracic drainage was not performed. Internal fixation of the T4 vertebral fracture via a posterior approach under general anesthesia was proposed.

Placement of a right internal jugular vein CVC and arterial line were performed under general anesthesia. Ultrasound of the right internal jugular vein revealed no abnormalities. The leading edge of the midpoint of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is used as the puncture point. Ultrasound-guided down-plane puncture was performed, and the guide wire was successfully inserted and confirmed to be within the internal jugular vein using ultrasonography. A CVC was then placed after dilatation and confirmation of venous blood flow through the insertion needle. The CVC depth was 12 cm. Unobstructed flow was observed after skin fixation.

Four hours after surgery in the prone position, the patient's blood pressure continued to decline. No obvious bleeding from the surgical area was observed, and the airway pressure was not significantly increased. The volume of the autologous blood recovery tank was 600 mL. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a Hb level of 83 g/L. Rapid fluid and autologous blood infusions were immediately administered. After the administration of vasopressors, the systolic blood pressure was maintained at 85–90 mmHg. At 50 min postoperatively, the blood pressure gradually decreased again with a lowest invasive blood pressure (IBP) of 60/30 mmHg, heart rate of 140 bpm, SpO 2 of 100%, and central venous pressure of 10 cmH 2 O. Blood gas analysis demonstrated an HB level of 76 g/L. Fluid resuscitation and the administration of vasopressors failed to improve hypotension. At that time, the operation was completed, and the patient was quickly placed in the supine position.

### Respiratory variation in the internal jugular vein does not predict fluid responsiveness in the prone position during adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery: a prospective cohort study [^1167wm9g]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic monitoring

After induction of anesthesia, a 20-G radial arterial line was inserted and connected to a pressure transducer. The invasive arterial blood pressure and PPV were continuously displayed on an Intellivue MP70 patient monitor (Philips Medical Systems, Germany) in real time. The radial arterial catheter was also connected to a dedicated transducer (FloTrac TM, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) to obtain the following hemodynamic parameters: SVV, stroke volume index (SVI), and cardiac index, which were displayed on a Vigileo TM monitor (Edwards Lifesciences [4th generation algorithm]). Furthermore, CVP was obtained through an internal jugular vein (IJV) catheter. The pressure transducers were continuously adjusted to the level of the patients' right atrium during the study.

Pulse pressure (PP) was defined as the difference between systolic and diastolic arterial pressures. The maximal pulse pressure (PPmax) and minimal pulse pressure (PPmin) values were determined during the same respiratory cycle. PPV was automatically computed with the following formula: PPV(%) = (PPmax-PPmin)/[(PPmax+PPmin)/2]. In addition, SVV was defined as the beat-to-beat SV variation from the mean value during the past 20 sec and calculated with the following equation: SVV = (SVmax –SVmin)/SVmean. The mean values of PPV and SVV from three consecutive respiratory cycles were used for statistical analyses.

Sonographic measurement of IJVV was performed with a Philips CX50 ultrasound device (Philips Healthcare, Hamburg, Germany), equipped with a linear transducer. IJVV was measured by the same anesthesiologist with sufficient experience in ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation. The anesthesiologist performing the ultrasound examinations was not involved in this study and blinded to the hemodynamic parameters; a lead plate separated the monitor from the anesthesiologist and ultrasound device. The optimal short axis of the IJV was obtained at the level of the cricoid cartilage by placement of the transducer perpendicular to the skin on the patient's neck in a transverse plane. The vein was identified with color Doppler imaging as well as by compression. Ultrasound measurements were performed on the left IJV, to minimize the risk of infection at the right IJV puncture site.

### How can assessing hemodynamics help to assess volume status? [^114HnHx5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In critically ill patients, fluid infusion is aimed at increasing cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it may contribute to fluid overload which may be harmful. Thus, volume status, risks and potential efficacy of fluid administration and/or removal should be carefully evaluated, and monitoring techniques help for this purpose. Central venous pressure is a marker of right ventricular preload. Very low values indicate hypovolemia, while extremely high values suggest fluid harmfulness. The pulmonary artery catheter enables a comprehensive assessment of the hemodynamic profile and is particularly useful for indicating the risk of pulmonary oedema through the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Besides cardiac output and preload, transpulmonary thermodilution measures extravascular lung water, which reflects the extent of lung flooding and assesses the risk of fluid infusion. Echocardiography estimates the volume status through intravascular volumes and pressures. Finally, lung ultrasound estimates lung edema. Guided by these variables, the decision to infuse fluid should first consider specific triggers, such as signs of tissue hypoperfusion. Second, benefits and risks of fluid infusion should be weighted. Thereafter, fluid responsiveness should be assessed. Monitoring techniques help for this purpose, especially by providing real time and precise measurements of cardiac output. When decided, fluid resuscitation should be performed through fluid challenges, the effects of which should be assessed through critical endpoints including cardiac output. This comprehensive evaluation of the risk, benefits and efficacy of fluid infusion helps to individualize fluid management, which should be preferred over a fixed restrictive or liberal strategy.

### Ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for internal jugular vein catheterization [^116JCmH9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters (CVCs) can help with diagnosis and treatment of the critically ill. The catheter may be placed in a large vein in the neck (internal jugular vein), upper chest (subclavian vein) or groin (femoral vein). Whilst this is beneficial overall, inserting the catheter risks arterial puncture and other complications and should be performed with as few attempts as possible. Traditionally, anatomical 'landmarks' on the body surface were used to find the correct place in which to insert catheters, but ultrasound imaging is now available. A Doppler mode is sometimes used to supplement plain 'two-dimensional' ultrasound.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two-dimensional (imaging ultrasound (US) or ultrasound Doppler (USD)) guided puncture techniques for insertion of central venous catheters via the internal jugular vein in adults and children. We assessed whether there was a difference in complication rates between traditional landmark-guided and any ultrasound-guided central vein puncture. Our secondary objectives were to assess whether the effect differs between US and USD; whether the effect differs between ultrasound used throughout the puncture ('direct') and ultrasound used only to identify and mark the vein before the start of the puncture procedure (indirect'); and whether the effect differs between different groups of patients or between different levels of experience among those inserting the catheters.

Search Methods

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), EMBASE (1966 to 15 January 2013), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 15 January 2013), reference lists of articles, 'grey literature' and dissertations. An additional handsearch focused on intensive care and anaesthesia journals and abstracts and proceedings of scientific meetings. We attempted to identify unpublished or ongoing studies by contacting companies and experts in the field, and we searched trial registers. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with identified studies of interest when we update the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing two-dimensional ultrasound or Doppler ultrasound with an anatomical 'landmark' technique during insertion of internal jugular venous catheters in both adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest using a standardized form. A priori, we aimed to perform subgroup analyses, when possible, for adults and children, and for experienced operators and inexperienced operators.

Main Results

Of 735 identified citations, 35 studies enrolling 5108 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was very low for most of the outcomes and was moderate at best for four of the outcomes. Most trials had an unclear risk of bias across the six domains, and heterogeneity among the studies was significant. Use of two-dimensional ultrasound reduced the rate of total complications overall by 71% (14 trials, 2406 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.52; P value < 0.0001, I² = 57%), and the number of participants with an inadvertent arterial puncture by 72% (22 trials, 4388 participants, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44; P value < 0.00001, I² = 35%). Overall success rates were modestly increased in all groups combined at 12% (23 trials, 4340 participants, RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.17; P value < 0.00001, I² = 85%), and similar benefit was noted across all subgroups. The number of attempts needed for successful cannulation was decreased overall (16 trials, 3302 participants, mean difference (MD) -1.19 attempts, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.92; P value < 0.00001, I² = 96%) and in all subgroups. Use of two-dimensional ultrasound increased the chance of success at the first attempt by 57% (18 trials, 2681 participants, RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.82; P value < 0.00001, I² = 82%) and reduced the chance of haematoma formation (overall reduction 73%, 13 trials, 3233 participants, RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.55; P value 0.0004, I² = 54%). Use of two-dimensional ultrasound decreased the time to successful cannulation by 30.52 seconds (MD -30.52 seconds, 95% CI -55.21 to -5.82; P value 0.02, I² = 97%). Additional data are available to support use of ultrasound during, not simply before, line insertion. Use of Doppler ultrasound increased the chance of success at the first attempt by 58% (four trials, 199 participants, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.43; P value 0.04, I² = 57%). No evidence showed a difference for the total numbers of perioperative and postoperative complications/adverse events (three trials, 93 participants, RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.71; P value 0.28), the overall success rate (seven trials, 289 participants, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.25; P value 0.20), the total number of attempts until success (two trials, 69 participants, MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.92 to 0.66; P value 0.34), the overall number of participants with an arterial puncture (six trials, 213 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.73; P value 0.35) and time to successful cannulation (five trials, 214 participants, each using a different definition for this outcome; MD 62.04 seconds, 95% CI -13.47 to 137.55; P value 0.11) when Doppler ultrasound was used. It was not possible to perform analyses for the other outcomes because they were reported in only one trial.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on available data, we conclude that two-dimensional ultrasound offers gains in safety and quality when compared with an anatomical landmark technique. Because of missing data, we did not compare effects with experienced versus inexperienced operators for all outcomes (arterial puncture, haematoma formation, other complications, success with attempt number one), and so the relative utility of ultrasound in these groups remains unclear and no data are available on use of this technique in patients at high risk of complications. The results for Doppler ultrasound techniques versus anatomical landmark techniques are also uncertain.

### Should we measure the central venous pressure to guide fluid management? Ten answers to 10 questions [^1163ZgsA]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: Are the factors that influence CVP too numerous to make it meaningful?

We agree that the CVP is influenced by many factors, but this is also true for other variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output — does that mean we should not measure them? No, rather we need to understand which factors influence these measurements and how, in order to use them optimally.

CVP is an indicator of right ventricular and, to a lesser extent, left ventricular preload. CVP also reflects the limit to venous return and informs about right ventricular function. As such, CVP measurements may be helpful to guide fluid management. However, CVP is also affected by thoracic, pericardial, and abdominal pressures, which makes its interpretation more complicated. Indeed, although the CVP measured in these conditions overestimates the transmural CVP and may thus fail to reflect the true loading conditions of the right ventricle, it does represent the limit to venous return and the back pressure of all extrathoracic organs. In particular, the risk of peripheral edema, ascites, renal, and liver impairment is related to the absolute CVP value.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography [^113LXffP]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation — on the basis of evidence and expert consensus opinion, this writing group strongly recommends (grade 1A) that properly trained clinicians use ultrasound (US) guidance during IJV cannulation, when possible, to improve cannulation success and reduce complication rates associated with catheter insertion. The writing group recognizes that static US is superior to a landmark technique and is useful in identifying vessel patency and anatomy by skin-marking the optimal entry site for vascular access.

### AIUM practice parameter for the use of ultrasound to guide vascular access procedures [^112K1MbA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Ultrasound after vascular access procedures may be used after cannulation to ensure appropriate placement and to assess for complications. For venous access procedures, a postprocedure flush using agitated normal saline may be performed and recorded, which involves injecting a small amount (< 10 mL) of agitated saline with large air bubbles removed; when the catheter is properly placed, injection of agitated saline produces hyperechoic contrast within the vessel lumen, verifying position. For central catheters, this can be performed while visualizing the right atrium using a low-frequency curvilinear or phased array transducer. Ultrasound is faster than a chest x-ray, does not involve radiation, and may confirm that an infusion is entering the right side of the heart; however, current evidence suggests that ultrasound cannot replace the chest x-ray in determining appropriate tip position. Lung sliding may also be assessed using ultrasound to help show the absence of pneumothorax, particularly after placement in subclavian or internal jugular (IJ) sites.

### Correlation of sonographic measurements of the internal jugular vein with central venous pressure [^1173SWmA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Determination of volume status is crucial in treating acutely ill patients. This study examined bedside ultrasonography of the internal jugular vein (IJV) to predict central venous pressure (CVP). Ultrasonography was performed on 34 nonventilated patients with monitored CVPs. The IJV was measured during the respiratory cycle and with the patient in different positions. Mean IJV diameter in patients with CVP less than 10 cm H2O was 7.0 mm (95% confidence interval, 5.7–8.3) vs 12.5 mm (95% CI, 11.2–13.8) in patients with CVP of 10 cm H2O and greater. Measurement of end expiratory diameter with the patient supine had the highest correlation coefficient: 0.82 (95% CI). There was strong agreement among ultrasonographers: correlation coefficient, 0.92 (95% CI). This pilot study shows promise that ultrasonography of the IJV can be a noninvasive tool to predict CVP. Measurement of end expiratory diameter in supine patients exhibited a high correlation to CVP.

### Ultrasound in central venous access for hemodialysis [^114cDhSR]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Procedure algorithm

After establishing the anatomical location for the insertion of the CVC, the following steps are suggested:

1. Patient placement
a. comfortable for the patient and the operator
b. Trendelenburg when appropriate (neck vessels)
c. safety measures (i.v. access, air supply, monitoring ECG, etc.)
2. Placement and setting of the ultrasound machine
a. screen aligned with the direct view of the field
b. setting gain, depth, focal zone to needle tip depth, spatial compounding, harmonic imaging
3. Preliminary ultrasound assessment (pre-scan)
a. evaluation of the target vessel (short and long axis evaluation)
i. presence
ii. patency (compressibility)
iii. collapsibility in relation to the respiratory activity or fluid status
iv. response to Valsalva maneuver
v. diameter
vi. depth
vii. relationship with surrounding structures
viii. running direction and dangerous hurdles (e.g. large arteries and branches)
4. Setting up a sterile operating field
5. Sterile transducer coverage and, if possible, of the ultrasound machine as well
a. Put on gel between the probe and the sterile cover
b. Acoustic pairing with sterile gel. If not available, use sterile saline or chlorhexidine 0.2%
6. Local anesthesia with a small gauge needle under dynamic ultrasound guidance, avoiding air insufflation; the infiltration around the vessel aims to reduce pain during dilatation
7. A preliminary short transverse incision of the skin in the case of tunneled CVC at the exact puncture site may reduce the friction of the needle advancing in the subcutaneous area, but it is not usually necessary
8. Echo-guided puncture in the short, oblique, or long axis as per the operator's choice under real-time control of needle advancement along the path to the vessel
a. The angle of insertion of the needle varies depending on the depth of the vascular target (ranging from 45° to 70°)
b. The greater the inclination, the lower the ultrasound reflection of the needle shaft to the probe, thus resulting in less visibility
c. With the OOP approach, insert the 4–5 mm needle with subtle jiggling movements to confirm the orientation and then tilt the probe back to locate the body of the needle
d. vanishing sign: tilt the probe forward until the disappearance of the dot image that identifies the position of the tip
e. the needle can then be advanced with the same sequence of movements (identification of the tip and step-by-step needle advancement preceded by tilting the probe) up to the anterior vessel wall
f. the compression of the superior wall (tent effect) is often visible
9. Check the correct placement of the needle by US (the visibility of the needle inside the anechogenic lumen increases and the vanishing target can easily be obtained)
a. through lateral (in OOP) or anteroposterior (in IP) movements, the needle tip flashes
10. Blood flashback in the syringe and aspiration
11. Careful disconnection of the syringe (no pulsatile flow must be present)
12. Insertion of the guidewire (do not insert the guidewire before checking the correct placement of the needle or in case of difficulties in blood aspiration)

Internal jugular (IJ) vein cannulation — recommendation: It is recommended that properly trained clinicians use real-time ultrasound during IJ cannulation whenever possible to improve cannulation success and reduce the incidence of complications associated with the insertion of large-bore catheters, and this recommendation is based on category A, level 1 evidence. The writing committee recognizes that static ultrasound (when not used in real time) is useful for the identification of vessel anatomy by skin-marking the optimal entry site for vascular access and for the identification of vessel thrombosis and is superior to a landmark-guided technique.

Pediatric venous cannulation — internal jugular vein (IJV) emphasizes that the most frequently accessed central vein using US in pediatric patients is the right IJV, and US scanning allows easy visualization of the vessel. This is important because there is a high incidence (28%) of DVT in children from short-term central venous line placement. In pediatric patients, the supine position with Trendelenburg, liver compression, or simulated Valsalva maneuver may increase IJV size, and shorter needles and a superior entry point may reduce the risk for pleural or great vessel puncture, while avoiding compression of small veins by the US probe takes experience. Evidence includes a meta-analysis of 23 studies (3,995 procedures) in pediatric patients undergoing IJV and CFV cannulation revealing that US guidance significantly reduced the risk for cannulation failure and the incidence of arterial punctures, and compared with the landmark approach, studies using US guidance show a shorter time to successful first attempt cannulation and overall time to cannulation with fewer complications. An RCT of 60 neonates and infants weighing < 7.5 kg comparing US guidance with a surface-marking technique showed a reduction in cannulation time and fewer needle passes necessary for right IJV cannulation.

### Estimation of right atrial pressure by ultrasound-assessed jugular vein distensibility in patients with heart failure [^116fCeKn]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical evaluation of central venous pressure is difficult, depends on experience, and is often inaccurate in patients with chronic advanced heart failure. We assessed the ultrasound-assessed internal jugular vein (JV) distensibility by ultrasound as a noninvasive tool to identify patients with normal right atrial pressure (RAP ≤ 7 mmHg) in this population.

Methods

We measured JV distensibility as the Valsalva-to-rest ratio of the vein diameter in a calibration cohort (N = 100) and a validation cohort (N = 101) of consecutive patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who underwent pulmonary artery catheterization for advanced heart failure therapies workup.

Results

A JV distensibility threshold of 1.6 was identified as the most accurate to discriminate between patients with RAP ≤ 7 versus > 7 mmHg (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.64–0.84]) and confirmed in the validation cohort (receiver operating characteristic, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73–0.92]). A JV distensibility ratio > 1.6 had predictive positive values of 0.86 and 0.94, respectively, to identify patients with RAP ≤ 7 mmHg in the calibration and validation cohorts. Compared with patients from the calibration cohort with a high JV distensibility ratio (> 1.6; n = 42; median RAP, 4 mmHg; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 11 mmHg), those with a low JV distensibility ratio (≤ 1.6; n = 58; median RAP, 8 mmHg; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 22 mmHg; P < 0.0001 for both) were more likely to die or undergo a left ventricular assist device implant or heart transplantation (event rate at 2 years: 42.7% versus 18.2%; log-rank P = 0.034).

Conclusions

Ultrasound-assessed JV distensibility identifies patients with chronic advanced heart failure with normal RAP and better outcomes.

### Real-time ultrasound-guided catheterisation of the internal jugular vein: a prospective comparison with the landmark technique in critical care patients [^115KqFVn]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Central venous cannulation is crucial in the management of the critical care patient. This study was designed to evaluate whether real-time ultrasound-guided cannulation of the internal jugular vein is superior to the standard landmark method.

Methods

In this randomised study, 450 critical care patients who underwent real-time ultrasound-guided cannulation of the internal jugular vein were prospectively compared with 450 critical care patients in whom the landmark technique was used. Randomisation was performed by means of a computer-generated random-numbers table, and patients were stratified with regard to age, gender, and body mass index.

Results

There were no significant differences in gender, age, body mass index, or side of cannulation (left or right) or in the presence of risk factors for difficult venous cannulation such as prior catheterisation, limited sites for access attempts, previous difficulties during catheterisation, previous mechanical complication, known vascular abnormality, untreated coagulopathy, skeletal deformity, and cannulation during cardiac arrest between the two groups of patients. Furthermore, the physicians who performed the procedures had comparable experience in the placement of central venous catheters (p = non-significant). Cannulation of the internal jugular vein was achieved in all patients by using ultrasound and in 425 of the patients (94.4%) by using the landmark technique (p < 0.001). Average access time (skin to vein) and number of attempts were significantly reduced in the ultrasound group of patients compared with the landmark group (p < 0.001). In the landmark group, puncture of the carotid artery occurred in 10.6% of patients, haematoma in 8.4%, haemothorax in 1.7%, pneumothorax in 2.4%, and central venous catheter-associated blood stream infection in 16%, which were all significantly increased compared with the ultrasound group (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The present data suggest that ultrasound-guided catheterisation of the internal jugular vein in critical care patients is superior to the landmark technique and therefore should be the method of choice in these patients.

Ultrasound guidance for needle, wire, and catheter placement includes: Use real-time ultrasound guidance for vessel localization and venipuncture when the internal jugular vein is selected for cannulation, and when feasible, real-time ultrasound may be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected. Use static ultrasound imaging before prepping and draping for prepuncture identification of anatomy to determine vessel localization and patency when the internal jugular vein is selected for cannulation, and static ultrasound may also be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected. This approach may not be feasible in emergency circumstances or in the presence of other clinical constraints. For neonates, infants, and children, confirmation of venous placement may take place after the wire is threaded.

### The use of internal jugular vein ultrasonography to anticipate low or high central venous pressure during mechanical ventilation [^111mtPYs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Critically low or high central venous pressure (CVP) values, together with systemic hypotension, can indicate hypovolemia or acute heart failure. However, measuring CVP requires the insertion of a central venous catheter, a time-consuming procedure that can be associated with severe complications.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the use of ultrasonography of the internal jugular vein (IJV) to estimate low or high CVP values in patients who were on ventilation.

Methods

Ultrasonography of IJV dimensions and the collection of hemodynamic data was performed in 47 patients, and the ratio between IJV diameter in the 30° and 0° position was calculated (ratio(30/0)). The predictive value of ratio(30/0) for estimating low and high CVP levels was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

The median IJV diameter ratio(30/0) was 0.49. CVP ranged from 1 to 13 mm Hg (median 7 mm Hg). Seventeen patients had a CVP ≤ 5 mm Hg or lower (defined as "low"), and in 11 patients, values of ≥ 10 mm Hg were measured (defined as "high"). The corresponding IJV diameter ratios increased significantly from 0.34 (in the low CVP group) to 0.9 (in the high CVP group). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a good predictive value of the ratio(30/0) for the prediction of low or high CVP values, respectively. A ratio(30/0) of < 0.45 optimally indicated a low CVP, while > 0.65 was the cutoff value to detect a CVP ≥ 10 mm Hg.

Conclusion

The estimation of low or high CVP values by IJV ultrasonography in different patient positions can be a helpful instrument for the rapid hemodynamic assessment of the critically ill patient.

Venous cannulation overview states that indications include therapeutic, monitoring, and diagnostic reasons in hospital and outpatient settings, that venous access sites may involve central or peripheral vein cannulation with central veins defined as the venae cavae (inferior and superior), brachiocephalic, subclavian, and iliac (common and external) vessels and more peripherally located veins such as the internal jugular, axillary, and femoral used to reach them, that the preferential site for central venous cannulation is the upper body especially in ambulatory patients and femoral vessels can better accommodate large cannulas, and that US examination of the target vein in SAX and LAX views should evaluate depth, size, patency, and tortuosity.

### Correlation between positive fluid balances with venous excess ultrasound scores and lung ultrasound in critically ill children with fluid overload [^112fxmJF]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Dilation of the inferior vena cava during fluid overload is attributed to elevated central venous pressure, intravascular volume redistribution, neurohormonal activation, and vascular changes that reduce venous compliance and increase arterial resistance. Given the high elasticity of venous vessels, the IVC typically enlarges in response to hypervolemia. Nonetheless, in this study, most patients exhibited normal IVC diameters, which contrasts with previous studies reporting IVC distension in fluid-overloaded patients. The physiological effects of positive fluid balance are modulated by cardiac function and capillary leak, making illness severity a key determinant. In less severely ill children, effective cardiac output may prevent rises in CVP and IVC diameter.

Most of the hepatic vein Doppler waves in this study were normal, and 15% of the subjects presented mild–moderate S-wave abnormalities. Mild–moderate hepatic vein abnormalities are associated with a reduction in the amplitude of the S wave; thus, the S wave is smaller than the D wave. The hepatic vein Doppler waveform may remain normal in fluid overload due to several compensatory mechanisms as well as the dynamics of venous return.

The portal vein in this study had the same pattern as the hepatic vein. Most of the Doppler results were normal, followed by mild–moderate abnormalities. Under normal circumstances, the portal vein has a continuous flow pattern influenced by atrial contraction and is characterized by gentle pulsatility. An increase in right atrial pressure due to fluid overload or other cardiovascular problems is transmitted to the portal circulation, potentially resulting in more pulsatile flow.

The VExUS grade prototype is a scoring system designed to assess systemic venous congestion. The components of VExUS A to C are hepatic, portal, and intrarenal vein Doppler in addition to the IVC diameter. VExUS classes D and E were developed to exclude IVC diameter and improve specificity for severe congestion in adult patient. In this study, most patients were classified as having mild congestion under VExUS E, supporting the notion that modified VExUS protocols excluding IVC may be more applicable in pediatric populations.

### Ultrasonographic assessment of right internal jugular vein dimensions following passive legs elevation versus hepatic compression: a cross-sectional study [^113upHna]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In Mangano et al.'s study, larger IJV CSA was observed with increasing age (> 40 years), consistent with our findings. Similarly, Jeon Cheon et al. reported increased CSA with age, corroborating our results.

Regarding gender, PLE significantly increased CSA in females and AP diameter in males, but TD and AP diameter in females and TD and CSA in males did not increase significantly compared to the control. HC significantly increased TD, AP diameter, and CSA in both sexes compared to supine. Comparing HC and PLE, no significant differences were found between the two maneuvers in either gender, except for CSA in males, which increased more with HC. Consistent with our findings, Mangano et al. reported smaller IJV CSA in females compared to males, likely due to higher estrogen levels and greater endothelial progenitor cell activity, which reduce endothelial dysfunction in females.

For BMI, TD, AP diameter, and CSA increased in the supine position across BMI categories < 18, 18.5–24.9, and 25–29.9 kg/m² but not in BMI > 29.9 kg/m². In contrast, Mangano et al. and Belov et al. found that CSA increased with higher BMI. Unlike Jeon Cheon et al.'s study, our findings showed that CSA did not increase with higher BMI in the control group. We hypothesize that higher BMI increases intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure, impairing venous return and distension. However, in morbid obesity, thick fat pads may compress blood vessels, reducing vein dimensions.

Regarding fasting duration, CSA increased in the control group among patients fasting ≤ 10 h and ≥ 16 h. PLE and HC both significantly increased CSA compared to supine in patients fasting 10–16 h. Prolonged fasting may result in relatively empty veins that distend during fluid-shifting maneuvers. For fasting > 16 h, HC significantly increased CSA compared to supine but not PLE. This could be due to vasoconstriction from prolonged fasting, where PLE may not facilitate fluid shifts, while HC directly transmits increased pressure to the IJV, causing distension. Xie et al. similarly reported that fasting > 15 h impacted IJV CSA.

Table 4 — patient volume status in suspected sepsis lists bedside signs of hypoperfusion and fluid overload to guide assessment. Hypoperfusion signs include SBP < 100 mm Hg (or less than baseline SBP for patients with baseline SBP < 100 mm Hg), MAP < 65 mm Hg (or less than baseline MAP for patients with baseline MAP < 65 mm Hg), heart pulse rate ≥ 110 beats/min, shock index (pulse rate/SBP) > 1.0, peripheral capillary refill time > 3 seconds, and decreased urine output (< 0.5 mL/kg per hour). Fluid overload with fluid administration is indicated by development of pulmonary crackles, increased jugular venous distention, increased work of breathing, increased hypoxemia, chest x-ray signs of pulmonary edema, and ultrasound signs consistent with pulmonary edema (eg, B-lines).

### We should avoid the term "fluid overload" [^115MKcBB]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Using the right word or phrase to describe a specific pathologic process/patient diagnosis and/or status is important, not only within the intensive care unit team, but also when we communicate with external consultants. This is not just a question of semantics. Using incorrect terms can lead to misunderstanding and even to incorrect therapeutic decisions. For example, it is not uncommon to see clinicians examining an edematous patient, saying that the patient has "fluid overload" or "hypervolemia" or both and proposing fluid restriction and/or diuretics as the logical strategy, when often during the acute phases of resuscitation from circulatory shock this approach may be inappropriate.

A fundamental determinant of cardiac output and its ability to vary in response to changing metabolic demands is the body's effective circulating blood volume. Total circulating blood volume is distributed throughout the circulatory system into vessels that can initially be filled without changing their distending pressures because they merely alter their conformation rather than stretch, rather like a large empty balloon that will not have any measurable distending pressure when air is initially blown into it. Once filled beyond this volume, however, wherein conformational changes alone cannot accept more air without requiring the balloon's walls to stretch, the distending pressure will start to increase. The volume in the balloon below this point is called its unstressed volume. In the body, this unstressed volume accounts for between 60 and 70% of the total circulating blood volume. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the amount of unstressed volume can be rapidly and dynamically changed by changing blood flow distribution, increasing surrounding tissue pressure, or increasing venomotor tone. The effective circulating blood volume reflects the proportion of blood volume above the unstressed volume and is essentially independent of arterial pressure, because arterial pressure is dissipated across the high resistance arterioles, analogous to a "vascular waterfall". The stressed blood volume relative to the venous compliance defines the mean circulatory filling pressure, which is the back pressure to venous flow from the body back to the right ventricle. The primary reason for giving fluids during resuscitation is to increase the stressed circulatory blood volume, thus causing mean circulatory filling pressure to rise. If the heart can handle this increased driving pressure, then venous return increases causing cardiac output to rise. If the effective circulating blood volume is low, then mean circulatory filling pressure is also low, and if the effective circulating blood volume is high, then mean circulatory filling pressure is also high.

CVC tip position, malposition, and troubleshooting — postinsertion imaging should be considered to avoid malpositioning, and proper location for the CVC tip is at the mid right atrium to avoid vessel and right atrial trauma and consequent complications. Complications were documented in 1% of right internal jugular vein placements via ultrasound guidance in a retrospective single-center study where 75% of CVCs were placed by trainees, and in a prospective study 1.4% of right internal jugular vein CVCs were malpositioned when placed by an anesthesiologist using anatomic landmarks without image guidance. Factors associated with tunneled CVC tip malpositioning include change in position from supine to upright, which may be accentuated in obese and female patients, and consistent with the 2006 KDOQI guideline, it is reasonable to consider imaging for correct CVC location when catheter dysfunction persists that is unresponsive to conservative maneuvers and tPA administration.

### Internal jugular vein thrombosis after positioning CVC in dialysis patients: the most common ultrasound patterns [^113xSbgC]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2007). Low credibility.

Frequently patients are started on hemodialysis after the placement of a central venous catheter (temporary or tunneled) in the internal jugular vein (IJV). Currenty this procedure is facilitated by ultrasound probes that improve the rate of success of catheter placement in vessels and diminishes the possible complications, minimizing the gap between nephrologists with wide surgical expertise and those with limited surgical experience. Stenosis and thrombosis of the subclavia vein are well documented complications derived from the placement of the venous catheter. Internal jugular vein thrombosis is not seen very often due to scarce clinical evidence. In our paper we have been able to systematically document various extrinsic thrombotic complications outside the central venous catheter, by use of ultrasound (periluminar or related to the vessel).

### Noninvasive central venous pressure measurement by controlled compression sonography at the forearm [^114RFpBT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to validate a new noninvasive technique to determine central venous pressure (CVP) using high-resolution compression sonography.

Background

Information concerning CVP is crucial in clinical situations, including cardiac failure, volume overload, and sepsis. The measurement of CVP, however, requires puncture of a vein with attendant risk of complication.

Methods

After a proof-of-concept study in healthy subjects, a prospective blinded evaluation was performed comparing CVP measurement using a central venous catheter with measurement using compression sonography in critically ill (intensive care unit) patients.

Results

In healthy subjects with experimentally induced venous hypertension with a wide range of pressure values, a strong correlation (r = 0.95; p < 0.001) between noninvasive and invasive peripheral venous pressure at the forearm was shown. High interobserver agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.988 shows excellent reliability of the system. Noninvasive peripheral venous pressure measurement at the forearm showed a good correlation with CVP in 50 intensive care unit patients with the forearm positioned both below heart level (r = 0.84; p < 0.001) and at heart level (r = 0.85; p < 0.001). The mean difference between invasive and noninvasive measurement was negligible (-0.1 ± 3.5 cm H2O and -0.7 ± 3.4 cm H2O, respectively).

Conclusions

Controlled-compression sonography is a valuable tool for measuring venous pressure in peripheral veins and allows reliable indirect assessment of CVP without intravenous catheterization.

### Fluid status assessment and the role of the venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) score [^1154nL95]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventional radiologists frequently assume care of patients with high severity of acute and chronic illnesses, many of which can contribute to shock and organ failure in the inpatient setting. The ability to quickly assess the hemodynamic status of a decompensating patient at bedside is therefore a valuable skill for IRs to develop. Assessment of intravascular volume status is fundamental to this-shock and organ failure are commonly precipitated by hypovolemia resulting in decreased circulating blood volume and organ perfusion, but may also develop due to fluid overload resulting in heart failure and organ malperfusion due to venous congestion. The venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) protocol is a rapid point-of-care sonographic exam that scores severity of systemic venous congestion by integrating analysis of multiple venous beds. Here, we review traditional methods of estimating intravascular volume status, technical aspects of the VExUS examination, interpretation of VExUS results, and practical applications for VExUS.

We recommend using ultrasound guidance for dialysis catheter insertion (1A) and obtaining a chest radiograph promptly after placement and before first use of an internal jugular or subclavian dialysis catheter (1B). We suggest not using topical antibiotics over the skin insertion site of a nontunneled dialysis catheter in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with AKI requiring RRT (2C), and we suggest not using antibiotic locks for prevention of catheter-related infections of nontunneled dialysis catheters in AKI requiring RRT (2C).

### Hocus pocus: advanced point-of-care ultrasound from the trauma bay to the surgical ICU [^116KfPMn]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

IVC ultrasound

Imaging the IVC is a useful tool for assessing fluid status in critically ill and injured patients. Although static diameter measurements provide a snapshot of volume status, evaluating respiratory variation offers insight into volume responsiveness in both ventilated and non-ventilated patients.

Technique

Using a phased-array probe, the IVC is first identified in the transverse plane at the subxiphoid area. Once the IVC is centered, the probe is rotated 90 degrees to obtain a longitudinal view. Ideally, the confluence of the hepatic veins and the IVC at the right atrium is visualized. Measurements are typically taken 1–2 cm distal to the hepatic vein confluence.

Findings

Respiratory variation of the IVC is assessed to analyze collapsibility. In spontaneously breathing patients, the IVC collapses during inspiration, whereas in mechanically ventilated patients, it may dilate.

Collapsibility index: calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum diameters divided by the maximum diameter (figure 5).
Clinical significance: Collapse > 50% suggests fluid depletion and the likelihood of fluid responsiveness. Repeat the examination after a fluid challenge to assess treatment efficacy.

Figure 5
Visualization of the IVC and hepatic vein. M-mode through the IVC shows a plethoric IVC with < 50% respiratory variation indicative of hypervolemia. IVC, inferior vena cava; RA, right atrium.

IVC size and central venous pressure (CVP)

IVC size and respiratory variation correlate with CVP and can be used to estimate CVP values. This estimation had previously relied on categorizing the IVC size and collapsibility into one of several categories. However, recent guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography have simplified the process. Ideally, IVC collapse is assessed by asking the patient to sniff, though this could also be assessed on deep inspiration.

Normal CVP (3 mm Hg): IVC 1–2 cm, and it collapses more than 50% with a sniff.
Intermediate CVP (8 mm Hg): IVC is > 2.1 cm or collapses less than 50% with a sniff.
High CVP (15 mm Hg): IVC is > 2.1 cm and collapses less than 50% with a sniff.

### Ultrasound validation of maneuvers to increase internal jugular vein cross-sectional area and decrease compressibility [^112un93f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study is to determine which maneuvers result in greatest cross-sectional area (CSA) of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and reduce collapsibility as measured by ultrasound during simulated venipuncture.

Methods

A total of 52 healthy adult volunteers were prospectively studied in an academic emergency department. Cross-sectional area of the IJV was recorded at baseline, with Valsalva, hepatic pressure, and a combination of hepatic pressure plus Valsalva. Subjects were studied in supine and Trendelenburg. Measurements were repeated using pressure applied to the ultrasound transducer to simulate venipuncture and evaluate degree of IJV collapse. Repeated measures analysis of variance models were used to assess the effects of the maneuvers on the diameter equivalent of the cross-sectional area (CRADE).

Results

With simulated venipuncture, both Valsalva and Trendelenburg position were significantly (P < .0001) associated with increased CSA of the IJV. Valsalva in either Trendelenburg or supine position was associated with the largest CRADE (1.20 and 1.13 cm, respectively). Without simulated venipuncture, CSA of the IJV were increased in all settings (P < .0001), but the relative impacts of Valsalva and Trendelenburg position were similar. Hepatic pressure had no impact on CSA of the IJV (P = 0.94).

Conclusions

All maneuvers with the exception of hepatic pressure led to a statistically significant increase in IJV CSA as compared with baseline with and without simulated venipuncture. Valsalva was the only maneuver, when used alone or in combination, to increase the CSA by greater than 50% and prevent collapse by 50% or more under simulated venipuncture.

Rationale notes that central venous pressure "does not correlate with fluid responsiveness", and evidence reports "A cutoff value of 15% change in IVC diameter between inspiration and expiration in mechanically ventilated patients was found to accurately separate responders and nonresponders". Technique cautions include specifying "the distance distal to hepatic veins (1–2 cm)", and ventilator settings specify "Patients should be ventilated in a flow-limited (volume-control) mode with 8 mL/kg ideal body weight tidal volume".

### Respiratory variation in the internal jugular vein does not predict fluid responsiveness in the prone position during adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery: a prospective cohort study [^111FqBJD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Appropriate intraoperative fluid therapy aimed at optimizing cardiac output (CO) is important in decreasing postoperative complications and mortality, whereas inappropriate fluid management has been reported to be harmful. Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has typically been associated with substantial fluid shifts, blood loss, and transfusion requirements. In this context, fluid administration is the first line therapy used to increase CO, and reverse hypovolemia and tissue hypoperfusion. However, fluid therapy increases CO in only half of patients when fluid responsiveness is not predicted. Therefore, the assessment of fluid responsiveness is essential to prevent fluid overload in patients who are fluid unresponsive.

Many predictors of fluid responsiveness have been investigated. Traditional static parameters, such as central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, have been criticized for their lack of reliability in predicting the effects of fluid therapy. Subsequently, dynamic indicators based on heart-lung interactions, including pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), have been widely used to predict preload responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. Unfortunately, these dynamic indices may have diminished reliability during lung-protective ventilatory (low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation or Vt ≤ 8 ml·kg⁻¹) and prone position, which are commonly used during PSF. Furthermore, the measurement of these hemodynamic parameters requires invasive procedures and special monitoring equipment, thus further limiting their clinical application.

Recently, noninvasive ultrasound has been recommended to evaluate fluid status, because of its measurement reproducibility and ease of image acquisition. Among these ultrasound modalities, respiratory variations in the superior and inferior cava vena have been extensively studied in patients who are mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing. Of note, measurements of the superior and inferior vena cava may fail to predict fluid responsiveness because of poor image quality caused by surgical drains, dressings, mediastinal air, morbid obesity or abdominal distension. Current evidence suggested internal jugular vein (IJVV) has shown promising results in predicting volume responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients and ventilated patients with low Vt. Additionally, unlike respiratory variation in the superior vena cava, measurement of the IJVV does not require transesophageal echocardiography, and sonographic visualization is much more easily accessible. Although IJVV has been investigated in several studies, its accuracy in ventilated patients with low Vt in prone position has not been confirmed.

### Correlation between positive fluid balances with venous excess ultrasound scores and lung ultrasound in critically ill children with fluid overload [^116pZGf7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid overload is a frequent and clinically significant complication in pediatric intensive care, affecting up to 83% of critically ill children depending on the definition and population studied. Fluid overload typically results from a mismatch between aggressive fluid administration for resuscitation, maintenance, or medication delivery, and impaired elimination due to renal, cardiac, or hepatic dysfunction. Even a modest degree of fluid accumulation, defined by a cumulative positive fluid balance exceeding 5% of body weight, has been independently associated with increased risk of mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and adverse organ outcomes. The negative physiological consequences of fluid accumulation is called fluid overload and depends on individual factors of illness severity.

Despite its clinical relevance, early detection of fluid overload remains challenging. Clinical signs such as peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and pulmonary crackles often emerge at more advanced stages and demonstrate limited sensitivity and specificity. These findings may also be confounded by underlying disease processes, resulting in underestimation of early systemic or pulmonary congestion. Objective parameters such as central venous pressure (CVP) and cumulative fluid balance are frequently used but lack sufficient accuracy for individualized volume assessment, particularly in dynamic critical illness settings.

### Routine chest radiography is not necessary after ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein catheterization [^1179AbRZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Central venous catheter placement is a common procedure performed on critically ill patients. Routine postprocedure chest radiographs are considered standard practice. We hypothesize that the rate of clinically relevant complications detected on chest radiographs following ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein catheterization is exceedingly low.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Adult ICUs, emergency departments, and general practice units at an academic tertiary care hospital system.

Patients

All 1,322 ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein central venous catheter attempts at an academic tertiary care hospital system over a 1-year period.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Data from standardized procedure notes and postprocedure chest radiographs were extracted and individually reviewed to verify the presence of pneumothorax or misplacement, and any intervention performed for either complication. The overall success rate of ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement was 96.9% with an average of 1.3 attempts. There was only one pneumothorax (0.1% [95% CI, 0–0.4%]), and the rate of catheter misplacement requiring repositioning or replacement was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6–1.7%). There were no arterial placements found on chest radiographs. Multivariate regression analysis showed no correlation between high-risk patient characteristics and composite complication rate.

Conclusions

In a large teaching hospital system, the overall rate of clinically relevant complications detected on chest radiographs following ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein catheterization is exceedingly low. Routine chest radiograph after this common procedure is an unnecessary use of resources and may delay resuscitation of critically ill patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^113NQSU4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Tunneled cuffed venous catheter placement — use sites and avoidance include placing in an area where ultrasound guidance and fluoroscopy are available, preferring the right internal jugular vein, which offers a more direct route to the right atrium and is associated with a lower risk of complications and fewer placement complications than other sites, avoiding the left internal jugular when possible given poorer BFRs and greater rates of stenosis and thrombosis, recognizing that femoral and translumbar vein placement are associated with the greatest infection rates compared with other sites, not placing catheters in the subclavian vessels on either side because of the risk for stenosis that can permanently exclude upper-extremity permanent fistula or graft, not placing catheters on the same side as a slowly maturing permanent access, and noting catheter-induced central vein stenosis is related to site of insertion, number and duration of catheter uses, and occurrence of infection.

### Ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement: a structured review and recommendations for clinical practice [^116tHM8Q]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Can ultrasound make central venous catheter placement safer? What is the evidence?

The use of US to reduce the number of complications related to vascular access for CVC placement has been evaluated in numerous previous studies in a variety of clinical settings. Recent Cochrane systematic reviews and meta-analyses summarize the current evidence for US guidance versus anatomic landmark techniques for CVC placement in the IJV, SV, and FV with regard to complications of CVC placement. These meta-analyses included adult and pediatric patients treated in the intensive care unit or the operating room and compared conventional landmark techniques with techniques using static or real-time US or Doppler US. The primary outcome measure was the total rate of peri-interventional complications and adverse events.

For the IJV, 35 trials enrolling a total of 5108 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis demonstrated that the use of US for CVC placement in the IJV reduces the total rate of complications compared with conventional landmark techniques (US, 48 complications in 1212 patients (4.0%) vs landmark, 161/1194 (13.5%); risk ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)) 0.29 (0.17–0.52)). The overall success rate was higher when US was used (US, 2120/2172 (97.6%) vs landmark, 1900/2168 (87.6%); risk ratio (95% CI) 1.12 (1.08–1.17)). In addition, the use of US resulted in a decrease in the rate of arterial puncture, hematoma formation, and number of attempts and time until successful cannulation, and in an increase in the success rate with the first attempt of puncture. The benefits of US-guided or US-assisted CVC placement with regard to the total complication rate, overall success rate, and number of attempts until success were consistent across experienced and inexperienced operators. Thus, this meta-analysis clearly provides evidence that US offers gains in safety and quality during CVC placement in the IJV. The quality of the evidence, however, was very low for most outcome measures and the heterogeneity among the studies was high.

### Demystifying volume status: an ultrasound-guided physiologic framework [^1123NR5N]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Accurate assessment of a patient's volume status is crucial in many conditions, informing decisions on fluid prescribing, vasoactive agents, and decongestive therapies. Determining a patient's volume status is challenging because of limitations in examination and investigations and the complexities of fluid homeostasis in disease states. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is useful in assessing hemodynamic parameters related to volume status, fluid responsiveness, and fluid tolerance. It requires understanding several physiologic concepts to interpret and integrate POCUS findings accurately into volume-related clinical decision-making.

Review Findings

The following concepts serve as a scaffold for a comprehensive volume status assessment: central venous pressure, right-sided heart function, left-sided heart assessment, extravascular volume, and venous congestion. POCUS allows us access to these hemodynamic and structural data points as an extension and refinement of the physical examination. Often, multiple POCUS applications are used, and findings must be integrated with the rest of the clinical evaluation. We illustrate this using 3 common scenarios: hypotension, hypoxia, and acute kidney injury. Clinicians must be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of findings in different physiologic states and the potential pitfalls of image acquisition and interpretation. Further studies are necessary to determine the benefits and clinical outcomes of a POCUS-directed volume status assessment.

Summary

Volume status assessment is ubiquitous, yet is challenging to perform. This review summarizes foundational physiologic concepts relevant to volume status evaluation and highlights how multiorgan POCUS elucidates hemodynamic parameters that can be combined with the conventional clinical assessment to make fluid-related decisions.

### Axillary vein as an alternative venous access site for VV-ECMO cannulation: a case report [^112wf54H]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The patient underwent difficult central venous catheterization of bilateral internal jugular veins with multiple punctures and compression for hemostasis, the day before VV-ECMO support. After the placement of the catheter, a follow-up bedside chest X-ray showed left pneumothorax and a chest tube was inserted for drainage. We believe that thrombosis and pneumothorax are related to this procedure. The patient developed severe pneumonia and ARDS due to inhalation of sewage. The severity of lung lesions was not consistent between the left and right lungs (Fig. 1). Additionally, there was also a left-sided pneumothorax. Therefore, there was a strongly difference in the appearance of the lungs on the chest X-ray between the left and right sides (Fig. 3 b). The patient had already experienced a significant decrease in urine output before being placed on VV-ECMO. After the initiation of ECMO, we performed simultaneous hemodialysis filtration to reduce potassium level. Unfortunately, the patient developed septic shock and died of hyperkalemic induced ventricular fibrillation after 36 h of VV-ECMO running. There were no signs of congestion or swelling in the patient's right upper and lower limbs. Vascular ultrasound showed unobstructed blood flow, and no increase in CPK level. We believed that infection and severe hypoxemia were responsible for the acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, with septic shock as the aggravating reason. The patient received anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin before ECMO initiation and systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin during ECMO support. Regrettably, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram could not be performed. However, ECG and echocardiography did not show typical signs of pulmonary embolism. Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to support that the death was due to pulmonary embolism.

### Practice guidelines for central venous access 2020: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on central venous access [^112W34Ae]. Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Central venous access — ultrasound guidance for needle, wire, and catheter placement includes real-time or dynamic ultrasound for vessel localization and guiding the needle and static ultrasound imaging for prepuncture vessel localization, with evidence favoring ultrasound over anatomical landmarks for internal jugular access and mixed findings for other sites; consultants and ASA members express graded agreement on when real-time and static ultrasound should be used. Guidance for needle, wire, and catheter placement includes (1) real-time or dynamic ultrasound for vessel localization and guiding the needle to its intended venous location and (2) static ultrasound imaging for the purpose of prepuncture vessel localization. Meta-analyses of RCTs comparing real-time ultrasound-guided venipuncture of the internal jugular with an anatomical landmark approach report higher first insertion attempt success rates, higher overall success rates, lower rates of arterial puncture, and fewer insertion attempts (Category A1-B evidence), and RCTs also indicate reduced access time or times to cannulation with ultrasound compared with a landmark approach (Category A2-B evidence). For the subclavian vein, RCTs report fewer insertion attempts and higher overall success rates with real-time ultrasound-guided venipuncture (Category A2-B evidence), while findings are equivocal for arterial puncture and hematoma (Category A2-E evidence). For the femoral vein in pediatric patients, an RCT reports a higher first-attempt success rate and fewer needle passes with real-time ultrasound-guided venipuncture compared with the landmark approach (Category A3-B evidence). For static ultrasound versus landmark, meta-analyses yield equivocal evidence for improved overall success rates for internal jugular insertion, overall success irrespective of insertion site, and impact on arterial puncture rates (Category A1-E evidence), though RCTs report a higher first insertion attempt success rate for locating the internal jugular vein with static ultrasound (Category A3-B evidence), and the literature is equivocal for subclavian or femoral access (Category A3-E evidence). The consultants and ASA members strongly agree with the recommendation to use real-time ultrasound guidance when the internal jugular vein is selected for cannulation and agree that feasible, real-time ultrasound may be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected; they strongly agree and agree, respectively, with using static ultrasound imaging before prepping and draping for prepuncture identification of anatomy to determine vessel localization and patency when the internal jugular vein is selected, and agree that static ultrasound may also be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected.

Central venous access site–specific arterial puncture risk — With the landmark method, arterial puncture risk is 6.3% to 9.4% for the IJ, 3.1% to 4.9% for the SC, and 9.0% to 15.0% for the FV, and a higher incidence occurs during attempted IJ versus SC access.

### Anatomical relationship between the omohyoid muscle and the internal jugular vein on ultrasound guidance [^111Ddi3h]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The placement of a central venous access into the internal jugular vein(IJV) is a commonly practiced clinical technique that allows fluid and blood transfusion and other rescue treatments. It is widely used to treat critically ill patients with severe trauma, shock, and acute circulatory failure. It can also be used for total parenteral nutrition therapy, long-term intravenous fluid and antibiotic therapy, and temporary cardiac pacemaker transcatheter installation. The reported incidence of mechanical complications following central venous catheterization is between 1.1% and 17%, and depending on its definition, the most common complication is carotid artery injury. Therefore, many studies have been conducted on the relationship between the IJV and carotid artery, as well as ultrasonic observation of the effect of positive pressure ventilation and body position on the size of the IJV and relevant studies on the catheterization of the IJV. However, few people are concerned about the muscles that surround the IJV, and few people are careful not to damage them during the puncture, such as the omohyoid muscle(OM). The OM has an inferior belly originating from the superior border of the scapula, near the suprascapular notch. This muscle then passes deep to the sternocleidomastoid where its superior belly passes almost vertically upward next to the lateral border of sternohyoid to attach to the inferior border of the body of the hyoid bone lateral to the insertion of sternohyoid. OM can ensure the smooth completion of swallowing. And the upper and lower abdomen of the OM can continuously improve the neck pressure and effectively relieve the compression of the carotid artery by the OM during swallowing. Lesions of the OM are characterized by discomfort or pressure in the patient during swallowing, accompanied by a raised mass on the affected side. Although we found a close relationship between the OM and the IJV, clinicians often overlook the relationship in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to explore the anatomical relationship between the OM and the IJV under ultrasound to provide a theoretical reference for internal jugular puncture and catheterization.

### Ultrasound in central venous access for hemodialysis [^117WTcJR]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ultrasonography began to play a role in central venous catheterization in 1978 when venous Doppler examination was used for the first time to locate the internal jugular vein (IJV) and to mark the skin above the venipuncture site. This technique was then refined and applied to central venous infraclavicular access, but the first use of ultrasonography in real-time dates back to 1986 when internal jugular vein cannulation in longitudinal scanning was successfully carried out. However, despite the innovative and useful features of this new technological resource, the standard technique for central vessel cannulation continued to be mostly based on anatomical landmarks until the end of the 1990s. The first meta-analysis on ultrasonographic assistance for the placement of central venous catheters (CVCs)was published in 1996. In 2001, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence Report, with the support of robust scientific evidence, recommended ultrasound (US) placement of CVCs as one of the 11 practices to be adopted by clinicians. Since then, a broad series of reports have confirmed the appropriateness of this clinical practice and the association with a significant reduction in the number of complications as compared to the "blind" method.

The most critical review to address this issue was by Rabindranath et al.in the Cochrane Library in 2011, which analyzed seven studies, including 767 patients and 830 CVC placements. The results confirmed the reduction in the number of attempts by venipuncture, failures, and main complications (arterial puncture, hematoma, hemothorax, or pneumothorax) related to the procedure. To date, most guidelines recommend the insertion of CVCs under ultrasound guidance. –
