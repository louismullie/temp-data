## Question

What causes normocytic anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes normocytic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining normocytic anemia and confirming the diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should categorize the major pathophysiological mechanisms that produce normocytic indices. Next, I will enumerate the most common etiologies within each mechanism, including special populations. After that, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially the role of reticulocytes and iron studies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of causes and highlight pitfalls and exceptions that can mimic or coexist with normocytic anemia, ensuring each claim is supported by references.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor incorrectly: normocytic anemia is a decrease in hemoglobin or hematocrit with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) within the age- and laboratory-specific normal range, typically around 80–100 fL in adults, acknowledging that pediatric ranges differ and must be interpreted with age-specific norms [^450f3652] [^6ff026bf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I classify them; normocytic anemia arises from four broad pathophysiologic buckets: decreased RBC production, increased RBC destruction or loss, an uncompensated increase in plasma volume, or a mixed process that averages out to normal MCV, and I should keep these buckets in mind as I proceed [^450f3652] [^7f38d88b].

> I will now examine decreased production causes, starting with anemia of inflammation/chronic disease, which is the most common normocytic anemia worldwide; cytokine-driven hepcidin upregulation sequesters iron, impairs erythropoietin responsiveness, and shortens RBC survival, yielding a normocytic, normochromic, hypoproliferative pattern with low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, and normal or high ferritin, and I should double-check that ferritin can be misleading in inflammation before I label it definitively [^f2002ab5] [^e95bac04] [^fd2e1118].

> Next, I should review chronic kidney disease anemia, which is typically normocytic and normochromic due to relative erythropoietin deficiency compounded by uremic toxins and iron-restricted erythropoiesis; I need to ensure I note that erythropoietin levels are generally not helpful in routine evaluation and that reticulocyte counts better reflect marrow response, and I should confirm that guidelines emphasize correcting other causes before ESAs [^c24bf35f] [^440b00ef] [^54214bf9].

> Let me consider endocrine deficiencies; hypothyroidism and testosterone deficiency can cause mild normocytic anemia via reduced erythropoietin drive and altered marrow kinetics, so I should remember to check TSH and, when appropriate, testosterone in the right clinical context, especially in older adults or men with suggestive symptoms [^8996ac59].

> I should confirm that bone marrow failure syndromes, including aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia, present with normocytic anemia and reticulocytopenia; these are diagnoses of exclusion requiring marrow examination, and I need to ensure I don't miss them when the reticulocyte count is inappropriately low for the degree of anemia [^f694b9c9] [^aeeaf8f8].

> But wait, what if the anemia is acute or subacute; acute blood loss and early iron deficiency often present as normocytic because the marrow has not yet shifted to microcytosis, so I should double-check iron studies and consider occult bleeding when the story fits, particularly in older adults or perioperative patients [^f4ad26bf] [^eb5d51fe].

> Now, I will examine increased destruction or loss, i.e., hemolysis and hemorrhage; hemolytic anemias are often normocytic with an elevated reticulocyte count and characteristic labs such as elevated LDH, indirect bilirubin, and low haptoglobin, and I should verify the direct antiglobulin test to separate immune from nonimmune causes and review the smear for morphologic clues [^1d3c44d2] [^cf78dc9a].

> Hold on, I should verify that some hemoglobinopathies, like sickle cell disease, present with normocytic anemia despite chronic hemolysis; this is a key exception where the MCV remains normal due to balanced globin chain synthesis or reticulocyte compensation, so I need to keep hemoglobinopathy on the list when the reticulocyte index is high and the smear is abnormal [^442b43dc] [^1d3c44d2].

> Let me consider dilutional states; pregnancy and aggressive intravenous fluid administration can expand plasma volume and lower measured hemoglobin without changing RBC mass, yielding a spurious normocytic anemia, so I should confirm the clinical context and, if needed, reassess hematocrit after fluid balance correction before chasing other etiologies [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations; in children, normocytic anemia is common and often reflects iron deficiency, transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, or hemolysis, so I need to check reticulocytes and iron studies and remember that TEC is a self-limited pure red cell aplasia in toddlers that resolves spontaneously [^15d5bf78] [^e08a83be] [^6ff026bf].

> In older adults, I should double-check for multifactorial etiologies because unexplained anemia is frequent; approximately one-third are nutritional, one-third are due to CKD or inflammation, and one-third remain unexplained even after thorough evaluation, so I must avoid premature closure and tailor testing to pretest probabilities [^bbebb535] [^69b79037].

> I need to ensure my diagnostic approach is systematic; the reticulocyte count is the pivotal first branch point: high reticulocytes suggest blood loss or hemolysis, whereas low reticulocytes suggest decreased production, after which iron studies, renal function, inflammatory markers, and selective testing for hemolysis, endocrine disease, or bone marrow failure guide the etiology, and I should confirm that guidelines endorse correcting reversible causes before ESAs in CKD and cancer-associated anemia [^440b00ef] [^54214bf9] [^5c77613e].

> Let me reconsider iron study interpretation in inflammatory states; ferritin is an acute phase reactant, so in CKD or inflammatory disease, transferrin saturation and, when available, reticulocyte hemoglobin content or hepcidin can unmask functional iron deficiency, and I should apply higher ferritin thresholds or integrate TSAT to avoid missing iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^3a9c6eef] [^eb5d51fe] [^fd2e1118].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical hierarchy: the most common causes of true normocytic anemia are anemia of inflammation/chronic disease, chronic kidney disease, acute blood loss or early iron deficiency, hemolysis including sickle cell disease, bone marrow failure syndromes, and endocrine deficiencies, with dilutional states and mixed etiologies as important considerations; I need to ensure I keep exceptions in mind, such as normocytic presentations of iron deficiency early on and the coexistence of microcytic or macrocytic processes that average to normal MCV, so I don't misclassify the anemia [^450f3652] [^f4ad26bf] [^1d3c44d2] [^f694b9c9] [^8996ac59].

Normocytic anemia is most often due to **anemia of chronic disease/inflammation** [^f2002ab5], **chronic kidney disease** [^c24bf35f], or **acute blood loss** [^450f3652]. Other causes include **bone marrow disorders** (aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, pure red cell aplasia) [^f694b9c9], **hemolysis** (sickle cell disease, autoimmune hemolysis, mechanical valves) [^1d3c44d2], and endocrine deficiencies (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism) [^8996ac59]. Evaluation should start with a **reticulocyte count** [^440b00ef] to distinguish hypoproliferative from hyperproliferative causes, then proceed to iron studies, renal and liver function, hemolysis labs, and selective endocrine or marrow testing as indicated [^f4ad26bf].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Normocytic anemia arises from **four main mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Decreased RBC production | - Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation [^f2002ab5] <br/> - Chronic kidney disease [^c24bf35f] <br/> - Bone marrow failure syndromes [^f694b9c9] <br/> - Endocrine deficiencies [^8996ac59] |
| Increased RBC destruction (hemolysis) | - Sickle cell disease [^442b43dc] <br/> - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1d3c44d2] <br/> - Mechanical hemolysis (e.g. prosthetic heart valves) [^notfound] |
| Acute blood loss | - Gastrointestinal bleeding [^b39cea74] <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Surgical blood loss [^eb5d51fe] |
| Dilutional anemia | - Overhydration <br/> - Pregnancy (physiologic hemodilution) |

---

## Common etiologies

### Decreased RBC production

- **Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation**: Cytokine-driven hepcidin upregulation causes iron sequestration and impaired erythropoiesis; typically normocytic and normochromic [^f2002ab5] [^e95bac04].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Relative erythropoietin deficiency leads to hypoproliferative, normocytic anemia [^c24bf35f] [^440b00ef].

- **Bone marrow failure syndromes**: Aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and pure red cell aplasia cause normocytic anemia with low reticulocytes [^f694b9c9] [^aeeaf8f8].

- **Endocrine deficiencies**: Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypogonadism reduce erythropoietin drive and marrow response [^8996ac59].

---

### Increased RBC destruction (hemolysis)

- **Sickle cell disease**: Chronic hemolysis with normocytic indices [^442b43dc].

- **Autoimmune hemolytic anemia**: Immune-mediated RBC destruction with reticulocytosis [^1d3c44d2].

- **Mechanical hemolysis**: Prosthetic heart valves or microangiopathic processes cause fragmentation hemolysis [^1d3c44d2].

---

### Acute blood loss

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding, trauma, and surgical blood loss initially present as **normocytic anemia** until iron deficiency develops [^450f3652].

---

### Dilutional anemia

Overhydration and pregnancy can cause **physiologic hemodilution**, yielding normocytic indices [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm anemia**: Repeat CBC to verify low Hb/Hct with normal MCV [^fc3a58d4].

- **Reticulocyte count**: Low suggests decreased production; high suggests hemolysis or blood loss [^440b00ef].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, TIBC to distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease [^3a9c6eef].

- **Renal and liver function**: Assess for CKD, liver disease, or endocrine causes [^f4ad26bf].

- **Hemolysis labs**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, Coombs test when hemolysis is suspected [^1d3c44d2].

- **Bone marrow evaluation**: Consider in unexplained cytopenias or suspected marrow failure [^f694b9c9].

---

## Clinical implications

Normocytic anemia is a marker of **underlying disease** and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults and those with chronic conditions [^f4ad26bf] [^6d439f4c]. Management focuses on identifying and treating the cause, with transfusion reserved for symptomatic or severe anemia [^f4ad26bf].

Normocytic anemia reflects diverse causes; **identifying the mechanism and etiology** guides targeted therapy and improves outcomes [^a3cf1342].

### Abstract (...) [^450f3652]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a decrease in the circulating red blood cell mass to below age-specific and gender-specific limits. In normocytic anemias, the mean corpuscular volume is within defined normal limits, but the hemoglobin and hematocrit are decreased. The MCV is also age-specific. Most patients with anemia are asymptomatic. Therefore, the condition is most often discovered by laboratory evaluation, usually on routine testing as part of the general physical examination or for reasons other than suspected anemia. Anemia should be considered a sign, not a disease. 3 It can be caused by a variety of systemic disorders and diseases, as well as primary hematologic disorders. Etiology Normocytic anemias may be thought of as representing any of the following: a decreased production of normal-sized red blood cells; an increased destruction or loss of red blood cells; an uncompensated increase in plasma volume; or a mixture of conditions producing microcytic and macrocytic anemias. Decreased Red Blood Cell Production ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE Anemia of chronic disease is the most common normocytic anemia and the second most common form of anemia worldwide. 7 The MCV may be low in some patients with this type of anemia. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease is multifactorial and is related to hypo-activity of the bone marrow, with relatively inadequate production of erythropoietin or a poor response to erythropoietin, as well as slightly shortened red blood cell survival. ENDOCRINE DEFICIENCY RENAL FAILURE Anemia occurs in acute and chronic renal failure. The anemia is usually normocytic but may be microcytic.

In renal failure, anemia occurs in part because uremic metabolites decrease the lifespan of circulating red blood cells and reduce erythropoiesis. Anemia secondary to uremia is characterized by inappropriately low erythropoietin levels, in contrast to the normal or high levels that occur with most other causes of anemia. To further confuse the presentation, serum iron levels and the percentage of iron saturation are often low, apparently because of negative acute-phase reactions.

### Anemia of inflammation [^f2002ab5]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^7f38d88b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^60d17a1b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^c24bf35f]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anemia of chronic kidney disease: 
- Definition: Anemia of CKD is usually normocytic, normochromic, and hypoproliferative, which increases as the kidney disease progresses.
- Pathophysiology: Anemia of CKD is mostly caused by a relative deficiency in EPO (EPO) production. Other causes include inflammation, iron deficiency, and accumulation of uremic toxins.
- Disease course: Decreased production of EPO due to worsening kidney function results in anemia of CKD, which causes clinical manifestations of decreased QoL, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, CKD progression, and cardiovascular comorbidities.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Anemia of CKD among diabetics is associated with higher mortality (HR 3.61, 95% CI 2.48-5.26).

### Anemia of inflammation [^e95bac04]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammation arising from various etiologies, including infection, autoimmune disorders, chronic diseases, and aging, can promote anemia. The anemia of inflammation (AI) is most often normocytic and normochromic and is usually mild. Characteristic changes in systemic iron handling, erythrocyte production, and erythrocyte life span all contribute to AI. The preferred treatment is directed at the underlying disease. However, when the inflammatory insult is intractable, or the cause has not been diagnosed, there are limited options for treatment of AI. Because anemia is a comorbid condition that is associated with poor outcomes in various chronic disease states, understanding its pathogenesis and developing new tools for its treatment should remain a priority. Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide has taken center stage in recent years as a potent modulator of iron availability. As the technology for quantitative hepcidin analysis improves, hepcidin's role in various disease states is also being revealed. Recent insights concerning the regulatory pathways that modify hepcidin expression have identified novel targets for drug development. As the field advances with such therapeutics, the analysis of the impact of normalized hemoglobin on disease outcomes will confirm whether anemia is a reversible independent contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory diseases.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children (...) [^442b43dc]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Worldwide, anemia affects up to one-half of children younger than five years. 1 Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level that is two standard deviations below the mean for age. 2, 3 After children reach 12 years of age, the hemoglobin norm can be further divided into gender-specific ranges. 3 Table 1 lists age-based hemoglobin levels. 3, 4 Anemia can be categorized as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic. Microcytic iron deficiency anemia is a common cause of childhood anemia, whereas macrocytic anemia is rare in children. Table 2 summarizes the causes of anemia. 3, 5. Microcytic Anemia DIAGNOSIS OF IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The U. S. prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children one to five years of age is estimated to be 1% to 2%. 10 A child with microcytic anemia and a history of poor dietary iron intake should receive a trial of iron supplementation and dietary counseling.

Iron deficiency anemia is likely if the hemoglobin level increases by more than 1. 0 g per dL after one month of presumptive treatment. THALASSEMIA Thalassemia, a hemoglobinopathy with an α-globin or β-globin production defect, should be considered in a child with microcytic anemia if the history or laboratory studies are inconsistent with iron deficiency. α-Thalassemia occurs most often in persons of African and Southeast Asian descent, and β-thalassemia is most common in persons of Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian descent. Normocytic Anemia Iron deficiency anemia and acute blood loss are the most common causes of normocytic anemia in infants and children. Evaluation of normocytic anemia (. Sickle cell disease, caused by a genetic defect in the β-globin, is a hemoglobinopathy that results in normocytic anemia. In the United States, it is typically diagnosed through newborn screening.

3, 37 A review of the management of sickle cell anemia was recently published in American Family Physician.
38. A low reticulocyte count with normocytic anemia in infants and children suggests impaired bone marrow function. This can be due to anemia of chronic inflammation; acquired red blood cell aplasias; and bone marrow disorders, such as leukemia.

### Diagnosis and management of acquired pure red cell aplasia [^aeeaf4f8]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia is a syndrome characterized by a severe normocytic anemia, reticulocytopenia, and absence of erythroblasts from an otherwise normal bone marrow. Although the causes and natural course of this syndrome are variable and although the anemia in some patients can be managed by treatment of an underlying inflammatory or neoplastic disease, the pathogenesis of a large number of cases is autoimmune, including those associated with thymoma, and are best managed with immunosuppressive therapy.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^126f9c5e]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Anemia in children [^958fac0e]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### An update on anemia in less developed countries [^5406b69c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

The highest prevalence of anemia exists in the developing world where its causes are multi-factorial. Anemia is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in less developed countries (LDCs). Understanding causes of anemia and potential mechanisms are crucial to our ability to intervene to reduce this burden. In the past decade, our understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of anemia in LDCs has advanced significantly. This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of the burden of anemia in specific sub-groups, the causes and mechanisms of anemia, and consequences of anemia for the human host.

### New treatment approaches for the anemia of CKD [^7e43fbb9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Normocytic normochromic anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease and is associated with many adverse clinical consequences. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and adjuvant iron therapy represent the primary treatment for anemia in chronic kidney disease. The introduction of ESAs into clinical practice was a success story, mediating an increase in hemoglobin concentrations without the risk for recurrent blood transfusions and improving quality of life substantially. However, recombinant ESAs are still expensive and require a parenteral route of administration. Moreover, concern has arisen following randomized clinical trials showing that higher hemoglobin targets and/or high ESA doses may cause significant harm. This, together with changes in ESA reimbursement policy in some countries, has resulted in a significant reduction in ESA prescribing and the hemoglobin level targeted during therapy. Several attempts are being made to develop new drugs with improved characteristics and/or easier manufacturing processes compared with currently available ESAs, including new treatment approaches that may indirectly improve erythropoiesis. We give an update on the new investigational strategies for increasing erythropoiesis, examining in depth their characteristics and possible advantages in the clinical setting and the caveats to be aware of at the present stage of development.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^fc3019e4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^cc1b531e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Etiologies and outcomes of normocytic anemia in children [^15d5bf78]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the evaluation and outcomes of children referred to pediatric hematology for normocytic anemia.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study of children aged 0-21 years referred to a tertiary pediatric hematology clinic for normocytic anemia from 2019 through 2021. Normocytic anemia was defined as a low hemoglobin and normal mean corpuscular volume, per the referring laboratory reference range.

Results

Two-hundred seventy-one patients (48% female, median age 5.4 years) were included. The most common hematologic diagnoses included iron deficiency (n = 90, 33%), statistical anemia (n = 64, 24%), transient marrow suppression (n = 36, 13%), and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC, n = 19, 7%). There were 17 (6%) patients in whom anemia was thought to be secondary to a nonhematologic disorder and therefore were referred to another pediatric specialty. Sixteen patients (6%) had anemia which spontaneously resolved without an underlying etiology being identified. Aside from iron deficient patients, 35 (13%) had diagnoses requiring ongoing hematology care including transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, hemolytic anemia, Diamond Blackfan Anemia, and abnormal beta globin traits. Two-hundred fifty-one patients (93%) were discharged from hematology care after a median of 25 days (range 0-2124 days).

Conclusion

Pediatric patients with normocytic anemia have diverse underlying etiologies with iron deficiency being most common. These data support initial management within the primary care setting including assessment of a serum ferritin, iron panel, and reticulocyte count, with only a subset of patients requiring ongoing subspecialty care.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Blood transfusion in obstetrics [^56214296]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, iron supplementation, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a trial of oral iron supplementation as first-line therapy in patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. Obtain further testing if there is no demonstrable rise in hemoglobin at 2 weeks and compliance has been assured.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^54214bf9]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO 2012—Pre-ESA evaluation recommendation: 3.1: Address all correctable causes of anemia (including iron deficiency and inflammatory states) prior to initiation of ESA therapy. (Not Graded). The rationale states that after diagnosing anemia in a patient with CKD all correctable causes should be treated before considering ESA therapy.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^cf78dc9a]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, normoblasts can be caused by anemia, tuberculosis, myelofibrosis, thalassemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, leucoerythroblastic anaemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, bone marrow metastasis, sickle cell disease, acute bleeding, hypoxia and severe infections.

---

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1d3c44d2]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^6ff026bf]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^eb5d51fe]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia—wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin <30 ng/mL and/or TSAT <20%; ferritin <100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb <29 pg or a serum hepcidin level <20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%.Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores.Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency.Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index <2) may help identify likely causes.Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^89912ded]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^fd2e1118]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency

Iron deficiency, both isolated and associated with anemia, represents one of the five major causes of disability burden worldwide, especially in women.For discussions of the etiology, clinical presentation and treatment of iron deficiency with or without anemia readers are directed to specific reviews. – In absolute iron deficiency low total body and serum iron fully suppress hepcidin, a mechanism of adaptation to increase iron absorption. In functional iron deficiency (e.g. in inflammation) total body iron is not decreased, but iron is sequestered in stores by the high hepcidin levels. This distinction strongly influences the route of iron administration required to treat iron deficiency, as discussed below.

Anemia of inflammation

Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β, produced in chronic infections, autoimmunity, cancer, renal failure and other chronic disorders activate hepcidin expression leading to iron-restricted erythropoiesis and anemia of inflammation, once named anemia of chronic diseases. By withholding iron in macrophages, extracellular Gram-negative microorganisms are deprived of this essential nutrient. This is an innate defense mechanism known as ‘nutritional immunity’.A recent interpretation is that hypoferremia prevents the generation of NTBI that potentiates the pathogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria.Anemia, usually moderate and normocytic, is multifactorial, because of concomitant insufficient erythropoietin production and impaired early erythroid commitment.Microcytosis occurs in longstanding severe inflammation such as in Castleman disease, a lymphoproliferative disorder in which high IL-6 production strongly enhances hepcidin synthesisor in patients with ectopic hepcidin expression by liver adenomas.Anemia reverts after anti-IL6 receptor treatment in Castleman disease or after surgical removal of the tumor in the case of adenoma.

Anemia of inflammation regresses with control of the disease. In selected cases intravenous iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are used. Since treatment is often unsatisfactory, manipulation of the hepcidin pathway (blocking either its production or function) is proposed as a novel therapeutic opportunity.

### Anemia and anemia correction: surrogate markers or causes of morbidity in chronic kidney disease? [^39a42f6f]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Observational studies have shown a strong positive correlation between the severity of anemia and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This observation was initially taken to imply that adverse outcomes in CKD are caused by anemia. However, the assumption of causality ignores the possibility that anemia and adverse outcomes might be unrelated and that both are caused by underlying inflammation, oxidative stress and comorbid conditions. Randomized clinical trials of anemia correction have revealed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients assigned to normal, rather than subnormal, hemoglobin targets. As a result, correction of anemia is now considered potentially hazardous in patients with CKD. Notably, individuals who did not reach the target hemoglobin level in the clinical trials, despite receiving high doses of erythropoietin and iron, experienced a disproportionately large share of the adverse outcomes. These observations point to overdose of erythropoietin and iron, rather than anemia correction per se, as the likely culprit. This Review explores the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the findings of observational studies and randomized clinical trials of anemia treatment in CKD. I have focused on data from basic and translational studies, which are often overlooked in the design and interpretation of clinical studies and in the formulation of clinical guidelines.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^b39cea74]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality—high, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality—high, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality—medium, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality—medium, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality—medium, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^31cf984f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative management—risk assessment for anemia in cardiac surgery states: Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits (Class IIa, Level B-R). Anemia burden is substantial, with the prevalence of anemia in the 30% to 40% range and severe anemia by World Health Organization classification of hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL in the 8% to 10% range. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent cause of anemia in the cardiac surgical population, occurring in up to 50% of anemic patients; iron‑deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, whereas normocytic or macrocytic anemia stem from a variety of causes. Routine iron studies are of importance in the determination of the type of anemia present and should be done routinely in the careful preoperative assessment of patients so that treatment can be instituted if warranted, and differentiation must be made between anemias caused by iron deficiency as opposed to other causes of anemia.

### Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood: a review for the pediatric emergency medicine physician [^e08a83be]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood is a form of pure red cell aplasia that is self-limited and occurs in children 4 years old and younger. It is characterized by an absence or a significantly reduced quantity of erythroblasts in the bone marrow without underlying congenital red blood cell abnormalities. Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood should be considered in previously healthy children who present with normocytic anemia and lack of reticulocytosis without evidence of blood loss, hemolysis, or other causes of bone marrow suppression. Evaluation should be targeted at ruling out other causes of anemia. Management is mainly supportive, although some children may require blood transfusions for symptomatic anemia. Most patients demonstrate a return of hematopoiesis within two weeks of diagnosis and normalization of blood counts within two months.

### Preoperative anemia in cardiac operation: does hemoglobin tell the whole story? [^61d32d38]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia, defined by hemoglobin level, is associated with elevated risk after cardiac operation. Better understanding of anemia requires characterization beyond this. This investigation focuses on red cell size and its association with patient characteristics and outcomes after cardiac operation.

Methods

From January 2010 to January 2014, 10,589 patients underwent elective cardiac operations at Cleveland Clinic. Anemia was characterized as normocytic, microcytic, or macrocytic based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Models for hospital complications were developed using multivariable logistic regression. Other outcomes were postoperative transfusion and intensive care unit (ICU) and postoperative hospital lengths of stay.

Results

A total of 2,715 patients (26%) were anemic. Of these, 2,365 (87%) had normocytic, 219 (8.1%) microcytic, and 131 (4.8%) macrocytic anemia. Non-anemic patients (n = 2,041, 26%) received transfusions compared with 1,553 (66%) normocytic, 148 (68%) microcytic, and 97 (74%) macrocytic anemia patients. Patients with normocytic or macrocytic anemia had more renal failure (normocytic: odds ratio (OR) 1.9, macrocytic: OR 3.5), other complications (normocytic: OR 1.3, macrocytic: OR 2.2) and death (normocytic: OR 2.0, macrocytic: OR 6.2) than non-anemic patients; patients with microcytic anemia had fewer reoperations (OR 0.35) and less postoperative atrial fibrillation (OR 0.50). Anemic patients experienced longer ICU (27 versus 48 hours, p < 0.001) and postoperative hospital (6.1 versus 7.4 days, p < 0.001) length of stay than non-anemic patients.

Conclusions

Cardiac surgical patients are often anemic. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes are dissimilar according to red cell size. Patients with microcytic anemia had the lowest hemoglobin levels, yet the best clinical outcomes among anemic patients. MCV from the standard complete blood count adds additional information beyond hemoglobin for targeted intervention.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^c90807d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Anemia associated with new-onset diabetes: improvement with blood glucose control [^dac38714]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the mild normochromic normocytic anemia associated with new-onset diabetes in young, otherwise healthy patients.

Methods

We undertook a retrospective review of medical records of patients with new-onset diabetes and unexplained anemia. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 12.5 g/dL in women and less than 14 g/dL in men. Patients with obvious causes of anemia, such as renal insufficiency, infection, pancreatitis, deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis, or acute or chronic blood loss, were excluded from the study.

Results

In 16 otherwise seemingly healthy patients with new-onset diabetes, a normochromic normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 86.4 +/- 4 fL) was diagnosed at initial assessment. These 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) had a mean age of 33 +/- 10 years. At diagnosis, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 15.5 +/- 3.4%, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.5 +/- 0.6 g/dL, and the mean hematocrit was 36.2 +/- 2%. All patients were treated with insulin. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 +/- 17 months, insulin treatment resulted in a decline in HbA1c to 7.7 +/- 1.7% (P<0.001; confidence interval [CI], 5.7 to 9.8). The hemoglobin concentration increased to 14.3 +/- 0.9 g/dL (P<0.001; CI, 1.22 to 2.38), and the hematocrit increased to 42.1 +/- 1.9% (P<0.001; CI, 3.59 to 7.04). All patients had hemoglobin AA and normal levels of hemoglobin A2. Men and women had equal improvement in hematologic variables after improvement in glycemic control.

Conclusion

Some patients with new-onset diabetes have a mild normochromic normocytic anemia that is not attributable to usual causes, such as infection, pancreatitis, or blood loss. Improvement in glycemic control tends to be associated with normalization of hemoglobin levels. The cause of such cases of anemia may be either direct "glucose toxicity" to erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow or perhaps oxidative stress to mature erythrocytes.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^440b00ef]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease—CBC interpretation and reticulocyte/erythropoietin testing states that the anemia of CKD is hypoproliferative and generally normochromic and normocytic; erythropoietin levels are not useful for evaluation in most clinical settings and are generally not recommended for measurement. Effective erythropoietic proliferative activity is most simply assessed by determining the absolute reticulocyte count. Abnormal white blood cell or platelet counts are not typical of CKD anemia and should prompt investigation for other processes. Reticulocyte counts obtained with automated CBC testing may be high with active blood loss or hemolysis and low with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may cause macrocytosis, whereas iron deficiency or inherited disorders of hemoglobin formation may produce microcytosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^fbf05c15]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Accordingly, micro-, macro- or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and serum ferritin, TfS and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In patients with postoperative CD or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated. In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have also emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis markers, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and that are further discussed in the outlook section.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^a2676bcb]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 The Challenges in Estimating the Global Burden of Anemia

Estimating the burden imposed by anemia is not a trivial task. The difficulties in reliably quantifying its consequences stem from complex challenges related to its diagnosis. As previously mentioned, anemia is multifactorial and can result from various causes. These can often be hard to differentiate, making accurate diagnosis challenging, especially in developing countries. Also, multiple types of anemia can occur simultaneously, often presenting with similar symptoms, making it challenging to distinguish and accurately attribute the specific causes of anemia on a global scale. Achieving this requires more comprehensive, high‐quality data to understand and quantify the contributions of different underlying causes across diverse populations.

Over‐attribution to iron deficiency anemia, the most common type of anemia, is an important issue, often due to its status as a default diagnosis in regions with limited diagnostic resources and its high prevalence as a primary etiology in many populations. Analyses often rely on iron deficiency, while only about half of anemia cases globally are due to it, leading to misdiagnosis and misclassification. Therefore, assessing anemia should involve testing various biomarkers (e.g. ferritin and retinol) with different sensitivities and specificities. This “biomarker complexity” is further heightened and compounded by interactions with factors like inflammation, nutrient deficiencies, and pregnancy, especially in developing countries, where multiple types of anemia can coexist.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^0282cc73]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and is seen in 75% of cases. The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Common causes include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malnutrition, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment-related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein–Barr virus. Given the diverse and sometimes multifactorial etiology (alcohol and hepatitis B) of cirrhosis, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of anemia in these groups of patients.

The most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis is normocytic normochromic anemia, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multifactorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption. However, liver cirrhosis is characteristically associated with round macrocytes [-], whereas B12 and folate deficiency show oval macrocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear (PBS), along with megaloblastic erythropoiesis on bone marrow examination.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum.Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^195e6fb7]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^8b511868]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^69b79037]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

With the global growing older adult population, clinicians face the common, yet complex challenge of how to evaluate and manage anemia in this population. Older age predisposes to common causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality. Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because anemia may have a single cause, may be multifactorial, or may have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. We believe a systematic approach to diagnosis ensures appropriate testing and avoids the pitfall of undertreatment and overtreatment. In this article we present our recommended approach through common scenarios for the management of anemia in the older adult.

### Anemia among children living with HIV / AIDS on HAART in mekelle hospital, tigray regional state of Northern ethiopia-a cross-sectional study [^b52b79e3]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

On the type of anemia, normocytic-normochromic anemia appears to be more common (48 %) in this study. This finding agrees with studies done by Engdaw et al. (2015) and Fenta et al. (2020), which reported the occurrence of normocytic-normochromic anemia in 46.5 % and 64.5 % of participants, respectively. However a study conducted in Uganda reported microcytic-hypochromic anemia (44.9 %) as the predominant type of anemia. Due to limited data, we could not suggest any underlying causes for the observed microcytosis and macrocytosis in the current study.

This study provides first-hand prevalence data on the study populations in our region. Interpretation of the findings should consider the following limitations, however. The findings may not be generalisable given the study population and anemic patients were relatively small to represent the whole children living with HIV/AIDS on HAART population in the region. In addition, the study did not explore the association between anemia and various factors such as socio-demographic characteristics, environmental, nutritional, disease-related, lifestyle, presence of malaria, and intestinal parasitosis, which may affect the Hgb levels of the study participants. Therefore, we were unable to identify the determinants of anemia in this study. Undertaking in-depth studies, exploring the underlying factors is deemed necessary.

Table 1 
WHO classification of anaemia according to age and severity.

Table 2 
Classification of anaemia.

Hypo‐regenerative anaemia can occur in aplastic anaemia, renal cell aplasia, renal failure or endocrine disorders. A disturbance in the maturation and proliferation of red blood cells (RBCs) may be caused by defective DNA synthesis, as in anaemia due to vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency. In IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, there is impaired Hb synthesis.ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection, inflammation or malignancy. To understand the pathomechanism of anaemia, assessment of hepcidin levels may be very helpful. Hepcidin is an iron‐regulatory hormone that inhibits iron release from cells of the reticuloendothelial system and intestinal absorption leading to hypoferraemia. An increase in hepcidin and other inflammatory cytokines, therefore, reduces the availability of iron for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. It is usually a mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia and with low circulating iron and low transferrin saturation, but with a normal to elevated iron storage protein ferritin.

Statistical analysis

All patients were classified into 4 groups according to their anemia typing (microcytic, macrocytic, normocytic and dimorphic anemia). Patients were further subclassified according to their MELD scores (Group A <12 and Group B >12) and CTP class (Child A, B and C). Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations of the MELD score and CTP score with Hb levels and macrocytosis. Variables with a P-value <0.05 in univariate models were then included in the multivariate analyses. A 2-tailed test was used to calculate the P-value, and the results were considered statistically significant when the P-value was <0.05.

### How I treat renal anemia [^7a4c0a21]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a frequent complication of kidney disease. When severe, it causes symptoms that can be debilitating. The course of anemia tends to track the decline in kidney function, with prevalence increasing in more advanced disease. Although the most common cause is relative erythropoietin deficiency, other factors such as reduced iron availability contribute to the pathobiology. In this review, we use cases to explore the surprising complexity of decision-making in management of renal anemia.

2.7. Anemia

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron, or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information, but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable. Novel red cell indices available on modern automated blood count analyzer such as the reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RET–He) and the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes (%HYPO) can predict functional iron deficiency where the ferritin is unreliable, and predict response to iron replacement.

### A recurring mutation in the respiratory complex 1 protein NDUFB11 is responsible for a novel form of X-linked sideroblastic anemia [^c126690e]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

The congenital sideroblastic anemias (CSAs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited blood disorders characterized by pathological mitochondrial iron deposition in erythroid precursors. Each known cause has been attributed to a mutation in a protein associated with heme biosynthesis, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, mitochondrial translation, or a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Here, we describe a recurring mutation, c.276_278del, p.F93del, in NDUFB11, a mitochondrial respiratory complex I-associated protein encoded on the X chromosome, in 5 males with a variably syndromic, normocytic CSA. The p.F93del mutation results in respiratory insufficiency and loss of complex I stability and activity in patient-derived fibroblasts. Targeted introduction of this allele into K562 erythroleukemia cells results in a proliferation defect with minimal effect on erythroid differentiation potential, suggesting the mechanism of anemia in this disorder.

### Iron deficiency anemia in women across the life span [^8567d688]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a global health issue with disproportionately high prevalence in women. In addition to being an independent risk factor for decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality, anemia in women has been linked to unfavorable outcomes of pregnancy and other issues for children born to anemic women. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in many populations. Guidelines recommend proactive screening for anemia, particularly in the preoperative setting. Once anemia is diagnosed, treatment should be based on etiology (most commonly, iron deficiency followed, in order of prevalence, by inflammation or chronic disease). Iron supplementation (oral and intravenous) offers safe and effective treatment for anemia associated with iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic disease may be more challenging to treat, and attention must be given to the underlying disease, along with use of hematinic agents. Given its enormous impact on the health and well-being of women and the availability of simple and effective treatment options, anemia should never be left unmanaged.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA)

PRCA is a rare disorder characterized by severe normocytic normochromic anemia with decreased reticulocytes. Bone marrow shows absent erythroid precursors with otherwise normal hematopoiesis. Acquired PRCA occurs with ICI therapy, neoplasms, autoimmune diseases, or infections, due to autoantibodies against erythroid progenitors or erythropoietin.

PRCA presents with reticulocyte counts < 10,000/μL, normal WBCs and platelets, and is confirmed by marrow biopsy. Differential diagnosis is essential. Treatment is corticosteroids, IVIG, and T-cell–directed therapies, sometimes requiring prolonged courses due to relapse risk.

Guo et al. studied 13 PRCA patients and reviewed 38 pharmacovigilance reports, finding nivolumab most frequently associated, followed by nivolumab/ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. PRCA typically developed after four cycles, with a mortality rate of 51.7%.

Aplastic anemia (AA)

AA is bone marrow failure with pancytopenia and hypocellular marrow. Severe AA is defined by cellularity < 25% or 25–50% with < 30% hematopoietic cells, neutrophils < 0.5 × 10⁹/L, platelets < 20 × 10⁹/L, or reticulocytes < 20 × 10⁹/L.

Patients present with pancytopenia and symptoms including fatigue, infections, and easy bruising. Diagnosis requires history, exam, smear, reticulocytes, CBC with differential, and marrow aspirate. Cytogenetics and FISH aid in exclusion of other causes.

Treatment depends on severity and age. Supportive care includes transfusions, antifungal prophylaxis, and antibiotics for severe neutropenia. Definitive therapy is immunosuppressive therapy (horse ATG + cyclosporine) in patients > 40, or bone marrow transplant in younger adults/children. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, shows promise in sustaining hematopoiesis,. Cyclosporine A maintenance delays relapse, as shown in an 11-year follow-up.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^3cf6fb49]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In general, anaemia of CKD is normochromic and normocytic and is morphologically indistinguishable from the anaemia of chronic illness. Initial assessment of anaemia in CKD patients should aim at identifying other factors that may influence the response to treatment.

In addition to Hb, other indices of the FBC report may provide important clinical information:
Macrocytosis could be due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency.
In addition to anaemia of CKD, microcytosis could be due to iron deficiency or haemoglobinopathies.
Macrocytosis with leucopoenia or thrombocytopenia could be due to several factors such as alcohol intake, nutritional deficit (vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), or myelodysplasia.
Serum folate is more prone to variation and can be affected by the patient’s diet immediately prior to blood being taken, alcohol, trauma and other factors therefore occasionally red cell folate may need to be measured where serum folate is equivocal.
Haemolysis is suggested by the presence of macrocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase and positive Coombs test.
The normal absolute reticulocyte count ranges from 40,000 to 50,000 cells/μL. Although it has a significant inter-patient variability, this test may be useful as a semi-quantitative marker of erythropoietic activity.

c.) Evaluating Iron Status in Anaemic Patients with CKD

The aim of evaluating iron status is to assess:
Iron level in tissue stores and
The adequacy of iron utilisation for erythropoiesis.

Serum ferritin level is the only available blood marker of storage iron. There are several tests to assess adequacy of iron for erythropoiesis: TSAT, MCV, MCH, percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (HRC) and reticulocyte Hb content (CHr) or Ret-Hb.

### Plasmodium vivax infection compromises reticulocyte stability [^f4d89aa9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The structural integrity of the host red blood cell (RBC) is crucial for propagation of Plasmodium spp. during the disease-causing blood stage of malaria infection. To assess the stability of Plasmodium vivax-infected reticulocytes, we developed a flow cytometry-based assay to measure osmotic stability within characteristically heterogeneous reticulocyte and P. vivax-infected samples. We find that erythroid osmotic stability decreases during erythropoiesis and reticulocyte maturation. Of enucleated RBCs, young reticulocytes which are preferentially infected by P. vivax, are the most osmotically stable. P. vivax infection however decreases reticulocyte stability to levels close to those of RBC disorders that cause hemolytic anemia, and to a significantly greater degree than P. falciparum destabilizes normocytes. Finally, we find that P. vivax new permeability pathways contribute to the decreased osmotic stability of infected-reticulocytes. These results reveal a vulnerability of P. vivax-infected reticulocytes that could be manipulated to allow in vitro culture and develop novel therapeutics.

### Anemia [^3a57a1ea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia is an enormous problem worldwide that is worse in the developing countries but by no means lacking in developed countries. Women and children are disproportionately affected. Nutritional anemias, mainly caused by a lack of iron and folate, are largely correctable by dietary improvement, but this socioeconomic change may not be readily achieved. The inherited disorders, the hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, in their heterozygous forms are beneficial to the affected populations. Prevention of the homozygous forms and the serious diseases that result can only be addressed by education. These conditions are seen in all types of medical practice ranging from neonatology to geriatrics and public health and are an ongoing concern to all physicians.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia.The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2. 
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or ‘normal’, although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (=0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time).As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

### Anemia in older persons [^6d439f4c]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia in older persons is commonly overlooked despite mounting evidence that low hemoglobin levels are a significant marker of physiologic decline. Using the World Health Organization definition of anemia (hemoglobin level less than 13 g per dL [130 g per L] in men and less than 12 g per dL [120 g per L] in women), more than 10 percent of persons older than 65 years are anemic. The prevalence increases with age, approaching 50 percent in chronically ill patients living in nursing homes. There is increasing evidence that even mild anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Anemia warrants evaluation in all older persons, except those at the end of life or who decline interventions. About one third of persons have anemia secondary to a nutritional deficiency, one third have anemia caused by chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease, and one third have unexplained anemia. Nutritional anemia is effectively treated with vitamin or iron replacement. Iron deficiency anemia often is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding and requires further investigation in most patients. Anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease may respond to treatment of the underlying disease and selective use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The treatment of unexplained anemia is difficult, and there is little evidence that treatment decreases morbidity and mortality, or improves quality of life. Occasionally, anemia may be caused by less common but potentially treatable conditions, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome.

3 DEFINITION OF ANAEMIA

3.1 Recommendation

The definition of anaemia in children with GI disease should be based on validated World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (level of evidence [LoE]: low; strength of recommendation [SoR]: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.1 Statement

In children with GI disease, anaemia can be classified based on pathogenic mechanisms, red cell morphology and clinical presentation (LoE: low; SoR: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.2 Practice points

1 Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) may cause hyporegenerative anaemia.
2 IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin <30 or <100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively.
3 ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection or inflammation.
4 Anaemia can be classified as acute or chronic according to the clinical presentation.

3.2 Summary of evidence

Anaemia is a public health problem affecting both high‐ and low‐income countries. Approximately one quarter of the world's population (almost 2 billion people) suffers from anaemia, with 39.8% of children <5 years of age affected, equivalent to 269 million children, and with the highest prevalence rate (60.2%) observed in children living in the African region. The WHO estimates that the global prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6–59 months in European and North American children is 20.3% and 6.1%, respectively.

Anaemia is defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) level or red cell mass below the range considered normal for age and gender, which results in decreased oxygen‐carrying capacity to the body's tissues.The normal range of Hb varies with age, gender and race, and therefore, specified thresholds should be considered for diagnosis (Table 1). Anaemia can be classified based on pathogenesis, red cell morphology, and clinical presentation (Table 2). Regarding the pathogenic mechanisms, these are represented by inadequate production and loss of erythrocytes due to either bleeding or haemolysis. Based on these mechanisms, anaemia can be further subdivided into (a) hypo‐regenerative, with a decreased bone marrow production from impaired function, decreased number of precursor cells, reduced stem cell density, or lack of nutrients; and (b) regenerative, with an appropriate bone marrow response to a reduced erythrocyte mass, characterised by increased production of erythrocytes.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^409646b6]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Diseases of iron metabolism [^ab554058]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Diseases of iron metabolism are likely to be both more frequent than expected, and exhibit a wider range of clinic severity and effects. Some present without evidence of anemia. Unexplained diseases of end organs that are affected by iron (liver, heart, pancreas, kidney, adrenals, and cerebellum) should have an iron metabolism disorder considered. Review of the blood indices and serum iron and ferritin markers may alert the clinician to most disorders. Further research is likely to define the scope and approach to clinical diagnosis of the diseases of iron metabolism.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^1713d8a2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

Anemia

The anemia of AIG (with or without PA) may be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, although macrocytic is the classic association (Figure 3).Anemia is common in AIG, with a prevalence around 50% depending on the study, with the most often etiologies iron and vitamin B12 deficiency.Gastric acid is important for enzyme activation and freeing micronutrients from dietary sources. Gastric acid is also important for the reduction and absorption of iron. As previously described, vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with AIG may be attributed to parietal cell loss as well as autoantibodies targeting IF. IF is responsible for binding vitamin B12 and facilitating uptake in the terminal ileum. Iron stores are depleted more quickly than vitamin B12 stores and thus iron deficiency anemia is often an early manifestation of AIG. While the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia often prompts an AIG workup,, it should be equally appreciated that vitamin B12 deficiency has a broad differential, and more common causes should be evaluated in patients.The diagnosis of anemia may also be confounded by other underlying diseases, such as hypothyroidism. To this end, one multi-center study of 654 consecutive AIG patients, nearly 50% of whom had anemia, demonstrated that certain patient characteristics were associated with patterns of anemia.PA was more common in males and older patients, whereas iron deficiency anemia was more common in females and younger patients. Iron deficiency was present in both those with and without anemia. These findings were similar to another cohort study of 160 patients with AIG based on serologies.In this study, 83 of the 160 patients with AIG were also diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. Again, those with iron deficiency were more often women, younger (median age 41 vs 62 with macrocytic anemia), and had a higher prevalence of H. pylori (41.3% vs 28.6%).

In vitamin B12 deficiency, patients may be asymptomatic while other patients can have sequalae of symptoms as the disease progresses. This includes subtle findings including glossitis or more catastrophic symptoms of infertility, early recurrent miscarriages, or even thrombosis as well as the neurologic symptoms described above.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^dfd609a1]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^322a30d1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) related anemia—evaluation and initial workup: Standard assessments should be performed to look for other causes of anemia, including GI bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and corrected if depleted, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproliferative macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels. Bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Anemia in diabetes: marker or mediator of microvascular disease? [^0a2e0a55]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a common finding in patients with diabetes due to the high burden of chronic kidney disease in this population. Anemia is more prevalent and is found earlier in patients with diabetes than in those with kidney disease from other causes. The increased risk of anemia in diabetes probably reflects changes in the renal tubulointerstitium associated with diabetic kidney disease, which disrupt the delicate interaction between interstitial fibroblasts, capillaries and tubular cells required for normal hemopoietic function. In particular, the uncoupling of the hemoglobin concentration from renal erythropoietin synthesis seems to be the key factor underlying the development of anemia. Systemic inflammation, functional hematinic deficiencies, erythropoietin resistance and reduced red cell survival also drive anemia in the setting of impaired renal compensation. Although anemia can be considered a marker of kidney damage, reduced hemoglobin levels independently identify diabetic patients with an increased risk of microvascular complications, cardiovascular disease and mortality. Nevertheless, a direct role in the development or progression of diabetic complications remains to be clearly established and the clinical utility of correcting anemia in diabetic patients has yet to be demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. Correction of anemia certainly improves performance and quality of life in diabetic patients. In the absence of additional data, treatment should be considered palliative, and any functional benefits must be matched against costs to the patient and the health system.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^e0619b0e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, 51.4% of the patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, 30.9% had macrocytic anemia, 16.0% had microcytic anemia and 1.7% had dimorphic anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia, based on MCV and low serum ferritin levels, was seen only in 1 of 29 patients who had microcytic anemia on PBS. However, the interpretation of routine lab parameters such as serum ferritin is extremely difficult in liver cirrhosis, and bone-marrow staining for iron with Prussian blue is required for the confirmation of the diagnosis.

A total of 58 patients had macrocytosis (MCV>98 fL); of these, 56 had macrocytic anemia on PBS and 2 had dimorphic anemia. The remaining 51.4% of patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, the most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. We also found a significant correlation between MELD score and macrocytosis.

In our study there was a significant correlation between the MELD score and Hb levels. Lower Hb levels were associated with a higher MELD score. Similar findings were seen in a study conducted by Scheiner et al, where anemic patients showed a higher MELD (12±4 vs. 9±3; P<0.001). In a study conducted by Jain et al, 88 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis were divided into 5 groups according to their MELD scores. It was found that hematological abnormalities, such as anemia and leucopenia, were more common in the higher MELD score group. Studies have shown that anemia is a poor prognostic factor in patients with liver cirrhosis, and the severity of anemia increases with the stage of liver disease.

We also found a statistically significant correlation between CTP class and Hb. Patients with Child C classification had lower Hb levels compared to those with Child A or B.

### Prevalence and aetiologies of anaemia among first trimester pregnant women in Sri Lanka ; the need for revisiting the current control strategies [^aa89709a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Normocytic normochromic anaemia was seen among 114 (25.3%) anaemic women. Their mean haemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dl. Normocytic hypochromic anaemia was seen in 80 (17.8%) anaemic women who had mean haemoglobin of 10.5 g/dl. Two (0.4%) of the anaemic women had macrocytic anaemia (mean haemoglobin level 9.6 g/dl). Distribution of Haemoglobin and Red cell indices; RCC, MCV, MCH, MCHC according to the type of anaemia is presented in Fig. 2.

Microcytic anaemia with RCC < 5 × 10 6 /μl

A small random subsample of 11 out of the 163 of them underwent peripheral blood film analysis. Minor hemoglobinopathy was seen in four, iron deficiency and early iron deficiency were seen in three each, and early megaloblastic changes were seen in one participant(s). HPLC reports were available in 21 (9 had records, 12 were tested during the current study), and 14 of them were confirmed as having thalassemia trait.

Normocytic normochromic anaemia

A blood film reporting was available for 89 out of 114 women with normocytic normochromic anaemia (11 blood films were of poor quality and were excluded). Four cases (4.5%, CI 1.8–11.0%) of South-East Asian Ovalocytosis were detected. It contributed to 0.9% (95% CI 0.3 to 2.3%) of anaemia in first trimester women.

Features of iron deficiency, early mixed deficiency, mixed deficiency, early megaloblastic changes and megaloblastic changes were observed in 38 (40.9%), 18 (19.4%), 6 (6.5%), 7 (7.5%) and 1 (1.1%), respectively. 19 (20.4%) blood film reports were normal. Two pregnant women, the one with megaloblastic changes and another with early megaloblastic features in their blood films, were tested for B12 and folate deficiencies. Both were confirmed as having B12 deficiency. None of them had folate deficiency.

### Anemia and risk for cognitive decline in chronic kidney disease [^400d7480]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Compared to prior studies, the current study utilized a longitudinal study design. Although anemia was common in this cohort, treatment with erythropoietin was infrequent, reflective of current practice guidelines. There are several possible explanations why anemia might be associated with dementia and cognitive decline in the general population, but not among patients with CKD. Compared to studies in the general population, the prevalence of anemia in the CRIC Study cohort was higher, but the follow-up period was shorter, and this may have been insufficient to identify clinically significant changes in cognitive function. We censored patients at ESRD to eliminate the potential confounding effects introduced by the changes in health status and treatment of anemia surrounding this critical transition period. It is possible that the risk for cognitive decline is increased only for patients with severe anemia, that is, a Hb concentration well below the WHO definition. This seems unlikely, however, since prior studies in the general population also utilized the WHO definition of anemia.

Another possible explanation of our findings is that the association between anemia and cognitive impairment is confounded by nutritional deficiencies, such as B12 deficiency, and that these nutritional deficiencies are a more common cause of anemia in the general population. We lacked measures of B12, folate, and iron stores in the current study. Nevertheless, the majority of participants in the CRIC COG Study had a normocytic anemia, which would not be typical for isolated B12 or iron deficiency anemia. Erythropoietin deficiency has also been suggested as a mechanistic link between anemia and cognitive decline, based on animal models demonstrating erythropoietin receptors in the brain and uncontrolled clinical studies of patients treated with erythropoietin stimulating agents. Given that erythropoietin deficiency plays a major role in the anemia of CKD, this pathway seems unlikely to be involved based on the results of the current study. Finally, it may be that anemia is not causally related to cognitive decline in patients with CKD, but that it is a marker for other conditions which affect cognition. This conclusion is suggested by the observation that demographic and clinical characteristics largely attenuated the association between anemia and baseline cognitive function and cognitive decline.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^bf1babca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^3ecf634f]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate gastrointestinal bleeding, we usually refer for colonoscopy and/or EGD. We frequently recommend FOBT, recognizing that FOBT alone is insufficient for excluding gastrointestinal bleeding, with a sensitivity of 58% at detecting the source of IDA.FOBT is more appropriate for colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic people without anemia.We refer for endoscopic evaluation irrespective of FOBT when IDA is suspected unless another etiology for IDA is established. In frail older adults, the decision to perform an endoscopy is often case-by-case with consideration for the person’s life expectancy.It should be a shared decision with the patient and caregiver; a positive FOBT suggests a higher yield from endoscopy.

Patients with IDA may present with microcytic or normocytic hypochromic RBCs. Nearly 70% of older adults (aged ≥65 years) with IDA present with normal MCV.Laboratory evaluation includes obtaining a CBC, reticulocyte count, serum iron level, TIBC (represents the ability to bind iron to transferrin), TSAT (ratio of serum iron to TIBC), and ferritin (reflects iron stores). Individuals with iron deficiency typically have low serum iron, low TSAT, low ferritin, and high TIBC. Timing and fasted state should be considered when iron studies are collected.A TSAT of <20% suggests that the iron supply is not adequate for RBC production and a very low TSAT of <15% is consistent with iron deficiency. Compared with lower ferritin cutoffs, a ferritin level of <50 ng/mL is suspicious for iron deficiency in older adults because this is a more reliable predicter of iron deficiency in older populations. Intermediate ferritin levels (the range from 30 to 100 ng/mL) pose difficulties, particularly in older adults with chronic diseases. Ferritin levels increase with age and patients with conditions such as chronic heart failure or inflammatory disorders may experience absolute iron deficiency even at ferritin levels of up to 100 μg/L and as high as 300 μg/L if the TSAT is <20%.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^d60b0a7f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Evaluation of related anemia—Major morbidities of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include symptomatic anemia and associated fatigue; the health care provider must also identify and treat any coexisting causes of anemia, and standard assessments should be performed to look for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if possible, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels, and bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Clinical approach to marrow failure [^0b4b465e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment and medical management of aplastic anemia fundamentally differ between patients with inherited versus acquired marrow failure; however, the diagnosis of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome is frequently obscure. Recent exciting advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes have resulted in a profusion of new tests to aid in diagnosis. This in turn has raised questions regarding the appropriate choice of testing for the patient presenting with aplastic anemia. Important clues to the diagnosis of an inherited marrow failure syndrome may be gleaned from careful attention to the clinical history, physical exam, and laboratory workup.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^bbebb535]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

In one of the first population‐based studies to describe UAA, Guralnik et al. examined the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 4199 community‐dwelling men and women over the age of 65 years.One third of cases of anemia could be attributed to nutritional causes, and another third were associated with inflammation or chronic kidney disease (CKD). This left one third of cases without a clear etiology. A comparable proportion of mild anemia (defined as a Hb concentration of 10.0–11.9 g/dl in women and 10.0–12.9 g/dl in men) is unexplained: in an Italian cohort of 8744 individuals between aged 65–84, mild anemia had no identifiable cause in 26.4% of cases.

In a wide range of population‐based studies of anemia, 25%–44% of cases could be classified as UAA (Table 1). This holds true whether the study population is community‐based, hospital inpatient, or long‐term care residents. Importantly, the prevalence of UAA remains high even when the potential cause of anemia is rigorously examined. In study populations consisting of hematology clinic outpatients and patients referred to anemia referral clinics, in which cohorts were subjected to comprehensive examinations, the frequency of UAA is 35%–44%. For example, Artz et al.examined a community‐dwelling, predominantly African‐American (69%) group of patients over the age of 65 who had been referred to an anemia clinic and even after intensive evaluations of causes, UAA was the most common category in both white and African‐American patients. Michalak et al.retrospectively examined medical records of 981 patients over the age of 60 and found that anemia was unexplained in 48 of 169 patients, with a UAA prevalence of 4.9%. The prevalence of UAA increased from 2.9% in those between 60 and 69 to 12.3% in patients ≥80 years of age.
