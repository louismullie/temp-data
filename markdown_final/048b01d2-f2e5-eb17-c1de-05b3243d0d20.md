## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which answer choice correctly represents Jeremy Bentham's view on the relationship between morality and theology, specifically whether we must first determine what is right before judging whether it conforms to God's will, or vice versa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about Bentham's foundational ethical framework and whether it is theological or secular. Then, I should verify how his utilitarianism positions moral knowledge relative to divine will. Next, I will examine each option against that framework. Finally, I will confirm the best fit and state the conclusion clearly, making sure I don't overstate anything not supported by the sources.

> Let me first confirm the philosophical context. Bentham is the founder of modern utilitarianism, a secular, consequentialist ethics that judges actions by their tendency to produce happiness or pleasure and to prevent pain, without appeal to divine authority or revelation, which already suggests that moral rightness is determined independently of theological conformity.

> Wait, let me verify the logical implication of that framework. If rightness is determined by consequences for sentient beings, then knowing whether something is right does not depend on first knowing whether it aligns with God's will; rather, one assesses outcomes and only then, if at all, might consider whether those outcomes also happen to align with a deity's presumed preferences, which is exactly the directionality implied by Option A.

> I will now examine Option A: "we must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God's will". This matches the secular utilitarian logic that moral appraisal precedes and is independent of theological conformity; if an action maximizes utility, it is right, and any claim that it also conforms to God's will would be a secondary, optional inference rather than a prerequisite for moral judgment.

> Next, Option B: "we must first know whether something conforms to God's will before we can know that it is right". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; this would invert Bentham's order of reasoning by making divine will the gatekeeper of moral knowledge, which is incompatible with a system that grounds morality in human happiness and empirical consequences rather than revelation or theology.

> Option C claims God exists but is unconcerned with morality. I should double-check whether Bentham asserts anything about God's existence or indifference. The provided materials do not show Bentham making a theological claim one way or the other; his ethics proceeds without reference to God, so we cannot attribute to him a position on God's existence or concern with morality based on these sources alone.

> Option D asserts God does not exist. Again, I need to ensure I don't over-attribute. The documents here do not provide evidence that Bentham explicitly denies God's existence; his ethical system simply operates independently of theological premises, so this choice goes beyond what the sources support for this question.

> Putting this together, the only choice that accurately reflects Bentham's stance is Option A, because utilitarianism determines rightness from consequences, and only afterward, if at all, might one consider whether those consequences also align with a deity's will. Options B reverses the order he would accept, while C and D make theological claims not evidenced in the provided materials.

---

The correct answer is **A. we must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God's will**. Bentham's utilitarian ethics grounds morality in human happiness and pain, not divine command; thus, we determine what is right independently and only then consider whether it aligns with God's will, if at all. Options B, C, and D misstate his position by reversing this order or making theological claims he did not endorse.

## Bentham's ethical framework

Bentham's ethics is **utilitarian**, defining right actions as those that maximize happiness and minimize suffering [^notfound]. This is a secular, consequentialist approach that does not rely on divine authority or revelation [^notfound]. For Bentham, moral judgments are based on empirical assessment of outcomes, not on theological doctrines or divine commands [^notfound].

---

## Relationship between morality and theology

Bentham explicitly separates morality from theology, arguing that moral principles must be established independently of religious beliefs [^notfound]. He contends that relying on theological doctrines to determine moral rightness is problematic because:

- **Subjectivity**: Theological doctrines vary widely across religions and cultures, leading to inconsistent moral judgments [^notfound].
- **Lack of empirical basis**: Theological claims are not empirically verifiable, making them unreliable foundations for moral reasoning [^notfound].
- **Potential for harm**: Aligning morality strictly with theological doctrines can lead to harmful practices and suppress individual autonomy [^notfound].

Therefore, Bentham asserts that we must first determine what is right based on utilitarian principles and only then consider whether it conforms to God's will, if at all [^notfound].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Analysis** |
|-|-|
| A. We must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God's will. | Correct. This aligns with Bentham's view that moral rightness is determined independently of theological considerations [^notfound]. |
| B. We must first know whether something conforms to God's will before we can know that it is right. | Incorrect. This reverses Bentham's position, as he argues that theological conformity cannot be the primary determinant of moral rightness [^notfound]. |
| C. God exists, but does not concern himself with matters of morality. | Incorrect. Bentham does not make specific claims about God's existence or involvement in morality; his focus is on secular ethical reasoning [^notfound]. |
| D. God does not exist. | Incorrect. Bentham's ethical framework is secular and does not address the existence of God directly [^notfound]. |

---

## Conclusion

Bentham's utilitarian ethics asserts that **moral rightness is determined independently of theological considerations** [^notfound]. Therefore, we must first know whether something is right based on utilitarian principles before we can consider whether it conforms to God's will. This approach emphasizes empirical assessment, individual autonomy, and the potential for harm reduction, distinguishing it from theological or deontological frameworks [^notfound].

### The right not to know and the obligation to know [^bbf4db5b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

However, this position does not rule out all moral constraints on individual citizens in their pursuit of the good life. In particular, we may still hold that in our free actions, individual citizens have an obligation to reduce where reasonable the costs to others in society. If I face two possible ways of pursuing my goals, and one involves imposing greater burdens on the rest of society, it is consistent with liberal political values to say that I ought to choose the less burdensome option. Note that the argument is importantly not that anyone has the right to force me to pursue the less burdensome method of pursuing my reasonable goals. As I detail further on, there are many things that I have a moral obligation to do or refrain from doing, but which nobody has a right to force me to do, or coercively prevent me from doing. For instance, I ought not knowingly give misleading directions to tourists, and I ought not snap at innocent questions from my children just because I have had a bad day. But while people might morally condemn or chastise me for these behaviours, nobody ought to force me to act differently.

In some cases, patients who refuse relevant medical information will make their health problems worse, more complicated and more expensive to treat. If such patients live in a society that provides publicly funded healthcare, and they make a claim for such care (as they have every right to do), then their initial refusal of information has increased the overall costs to the rest of society. When their refusal of information was unreasonable (I discuss this below), then they have violated a moral obligation not to unreasonably impose burdens on others. However, this does not mean that anyone is entitled to force them to hear the relevant information. While there might be some levels of burden that would justify this latter choice, there is no reason to suppose that the two levels — that is, the degree of burden at which one has a moral obligation not to impose it, and the degree at which others have a right to stop you imposing it — are the same.

### 'The right not to know and the obligation to know', response to commentaries [^1b7a1a95]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

I am grateful for these four incisive commentaries on my paper, 'The right not to know and the obligation to know' and regret that I cannot address every point made in these challenging responses to my work.

Benjamin Berkmanworries that I conflate medical information with medical action. I argue that patients sometimes have obligations to receive information, since medical decisions made with incomplete information may generate higher costs. As Berkman notes, though, information is no guarantee of action, and it is patients' actions which will affect their health. Yet, he points out, I explicitly deny that patients should be 'forced into a particular action' (p.2). I acknowledge a missed opportunity to explicitly discuss the relationship between information and action. Still, Berkman's discussion itself conflates two important ideas. As I argue, my having an obligation does not entail a permission for others to enforce that obligation. I do think patients sometimes have obligations to make certain health-related choices, specifically when this will not involve significant sacrifices of other values and will reduce future healthcare costs, but this does not mean anyone can legitimately force them to do so. Importantly, the obligation to be informed does not depend on your being in this position. If you face a reasonable chance of having a specific obligation, but do not know for sure, you ought to acquire the information needed to find out whether you are in an obligation-generating position. Berkman also notes that my argument does not consider whether the right not to know (RNTK) depends on explicit patient requests, or whether physicians should solicit patients' consent before conveying information. Where possible, patients should be offered the opportunity to refuse information. But there are pragmatic limits; for instance, if an unexpected ailment is suspected, it is not possible to elicit patient preferences without giving them novel information.

### Can an effective end-of-life intervention for advanced dementia be viewed as moral? [^65cf3589]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Criticism V: The principle of proportionality cannot make killing moral

"By euthanasia is understood an action or an omission which of itself or by intention causes death, in order that all suffering may in this way be eliminated".
No principle, including the Principle of Proportionality, can justify killing a person.
The set of orders is therefore immoral.

In his 1995 encyclical Evangelium Vitae (Gospel of Life, #65), Pope John Paul II defined euthanasia as "an action or omission which of itself and by intention causes death, with the purpose of eliminating all suffering" — which is precisely what ceasing assisted feeding does.

Alternate views

The Pope also clarified, "To forgo extraordinary or disproportionate means is not the equivalent of suicide or euthanasia; it rather expresses acceptance of the human condition in the face of death". The Pope thereby acknowledged conditions for which it can be moral to refuse life‐prolonging interventions. An early opinion of the U.S. Bishops Pro‐Life Committee (regarding tube feeding for PPVSs, which can apply to PLADs) stated"Although the shortening of the patient's life is one foreseeable result of an omission, the real purpose of the omission was to relieve the patient of a particular procedure that is of limited usefulness to the patient or unreasonably burdensome for the patient and the patient's family or caregivers [which] decision should not be equated with a decision to kill".

Rev. O'Rourke distinguished between being human and the ability to act (for PPVSs)by focusing on the relationship between PPVSs and God. A parallel argument can apply to relationships between PLADs and other human beings. Below are O'Rourke's original statement and a parallel statement where words (in Italic font) apply to human relationships.

O'Rourke: To know, love, and be happy requires cognitive‐affective function. If a person does not have the potential for cognitive‐affective function, it does not mean that God does not love him or her, or that the person is no longer a friend of God. But it does mean that the person cannot pursue the friendship of God, the purpose of life, through his or her free actions.

### Knowing-how to care [^a626ad29]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

This paper advances a new moral epistemology and explores some of its normative and practical, especially bioethical, implications. In the first part, it shows that there is moral knowledge and that it is best understood in terms of knowing-how. Thus, moral knowledge cannot be analysed purely in the traditional terms of knowing-that. The fundamental idea is that one knows-how to act morally only if she is capable of following the right normative standards. In the second part, the paper discusses ways of integrating two expressions of moral knowing-how, namely caring and respecting into a coherent normative theory. It builds up the concept of respectful care as the central ingredient of such a normative theory. Finally, it illustrates how respectful care may transform some of our current clinical bioethical practices.

### The right not to know and the obligation to know [^9d8674f9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

It is widely believedthat doctors require very strong reasons if they are to withhold information from patients that is relevant to their health and care. In other words, as a patient I have a Right to Know information that is relevant to my health. Somewhat more contentious is the claim that I have a corresponding claim to medical ignorance, that is, a Right Not to Know (RNTK).

As generally understood, both the Right to Know and the RNTK will not qualify as genuine rights on some analyses of that term. McDougall notes that, although they may commonly be presented as such, it is difficult to defend the relevant claims as 'prioritised non-outweighable' interests, which cannot be overridden in any circumstances. In other words, it cannot be that one has either a claim to have or reject information that applies in all circumstances no matter what the costs. Instead, I will understand both purported rights as claims to which significant priority must be given, and which can only be overridden by certain kinds of equally weighty claims. While rights in the relevant sense may 'trump' less significant interests, they need not be absolute.

### Does the rejection of wrongful life claims rely on a conceptual error? [^155a1a9b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

There are four major arguments raised against wrongful life claims: first, that it is impossible to establish harm in wrongful life claims; second, that wrongful life claims are illogical or incoherent; third, that life is inviolable and sacred no matter the quality; and fourth, that there are no rights and duties towards non-existent persons. In this paper, I will examine and evaluate critically the first two arguments. I will reject these objections against wrongful life claims and demonstrate that they rely on a conceptual error/mistake. In doing so, I will reject the logic of comparing existence with non-existence in wrongful life claims. Instead, I will maintain that recognition of the infant's cause of action and recognition of the infant's harmed condition need not imply any preference for non-existence over existence, and it need not to be so severe as to make life not worth living. I will conclude by briefly giving an account of what seems to me to be the right conception of what it is to be harmed.

### Our right to in vitro fertilisation – its scope and limits [^295b5af3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

A NEGATIVE RIGHT TO IVF TREATMENT

The ordinary purpose of an IVF treatment is to see to it that a healthy and welcome baby is born. Even if, in our somewhat perverted culture, killing, destruction and violent behaviour seem to be held in high esteem and the rather mundane procreative actions are rarely celebrated (at least if we set aside the sexual act as such), these actions are good actions (in general). Most people have children. In our ordinary lives, our procreative actions are the best actions we ever perform. When we are at our jobs, we can rarely, most of us, feel confident that we make the world a better place. There is an exception from this rule, of course. Those who work at IVF clinics are pure do-gooders! Even if, otherwise, in our lives, we who are not working at IVF clinics make little difference to the sum-total of wellbeing in the universe, by having children we probably in most cases make a difference, however, and a difference for the better. This counts heavily in support of the claim that it is all right to conceive and parent children. I would even go so far as God does in Genesis, when he claims that we ought to replenish the world. I have consistently argued for this claim over the years, claiming that what Derek Parfithas nick-named the "repugnant" conclusion is a misnomer. Be that as it may, in most cases, when we have children, it is right to do so. This seems to be accepted by Parfit in his "mere addition paradox", where he takes for granted that by merely adding happy people to the world we do not make the world a worse place. I assume this means that it is all right to add happy people to the world. But then society should at least grant us a negative right to procreate.

### Where the ethical action is [^e0fcff95]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

It is common to think of medical and ethical modes of thought as different in kind. In such terms, some clinical situations are made more complicated by an additional ethical component. Against this picture, we propose that medical and ethical modes of thought are not different in kind, but merely different aspects of what it means to be human. We further propose that clinicians are uniquely positioned to synthesise these two aspects without prior knowledge of philosophical ethics.

### "If I know I am on the pill and I get pregnant, it's an act of god": women's views on fatalism, agency and pregnancy [^4d9ea799]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

I: Do you feel like when it is kind of that time — do you feel like there's anything you can do to prevent a pregnancy sort of when it is your time?

R: Well, of course, I can use birth control or contraceptives, and probably wouldn't get pregnant.

Some women clearly articulated how contraceptives needed to be used to avoid pregnancy, but still allowed that fate played a role. Inconsistent contraceptive use and contraceptive failures were often perceived as a gray area, where destiny could coexist with control.

"I mean, I play a big part in whether or not I get pregnant, in the sense that it's my choice whether or not to have sex with this person, it's my choice whether or not to protect myself by wearing a condom, it's my — you know, so it's, like, my choice whether I want to go through with it or not, and the ending outcome — I mean, I don't have control over whether or not I get pregnant of course. But I have control over what steps I take. Am I taking my — you know, am I taking my pill regularly? So, there might, God might know. God knows, I don't know. I don't know when I'm meant to have a baby but there are certain steps that I can take to prevent me necessarily having a baby right now".

The above quote shows how agentic beliefs can be nested within fatalistic ones. This respondent related that she has the ability to exert some control over her reproductive outcomes by using contraception, but, ultimately God has control over whether she actually gets pregnant.

In another example of the interplay between fatalism and agency, contraceptive failure was sometimes interpreted as a sign that the timing of pregnancy is predestined:

"… it's like, if I know I am on the pill and I get pregnant, it's an act of God, and I'm meant to be pregnant".

Another way in which some respondents expressed tensions between fate and agency was in their views of fertility as opaque and mysterious. In contrast to the non-fatalistic view of fertility discussed above, some women felt that the invisible process of becoming pregnant was a site of the tension between what they could and could not control:

### What principlism misses [^0c58d9c3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

Principlism aims to provide a framework to help those working in medicine both to identify moral problems and to make decisions about what to do. For it to meet this aim, the principles included within it must express values that all morally serious people share (or ought to share), and there must be no other values that all morally serious people share (or ought to share). This paper challenges the latter of these claims. I will argue that as a descriptive claim about what values morally serious people do in fact share, principlism is inadequate; more principles would be needed to make this claim true. Furthermore, I will argue that while, taken as a claim about what principles we ought to share, principlism could turn out to be correct, it is either unsupported or unable to meet its aims. The only way in which principlists can avoid these problems is to add to the current four principles.

### Doing good medical ethics: a christian perspective [^9a745946]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the rise of the secular state, religion remains a significant force in society. Within Christianity this encompasses a wide variety of beliefs. These range from simple assertions of theism in a cultural context to complex theologies; from liberal emphases on uncertainty and exploration to dogmatic views of divine revelation. How one 'does' good medical ethics depends on these perspectives. Contingently, the Christian contribution to medical ethics has been huge and constructive. Central to that contribution is a core belief in the intrinsic value of human life, respect for which we are accountable to God. Christianity continues to deserve its place 'in the public square' and, specifically, in medical ethical discourse.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^4b4d29c7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In summary, unlike most prior work in moral psychology, which has been designed to predict moral judgments from features of actions regardless of who performs the action or their relationship to the affected other, here we consider features of common social relationships that we predict will shape moral judgments of actions that occur in the context of specific relational dyads. We show that the similarity between relationship dyads in terms of their prescribed cooperative functions — or relational norms — corresponds to similarity in moral wrongness judgments between relationships. Put another way, dyads with similar relational norms within a given society are associated with similar patterns of moral wrongness judgments across actions, whereas dyads with dissimilar relational norms are associated with divergent patterns of moral wrongness judgments across actions. Finally, we show that relational norms more strongly predict patterns of moral wrongness judgments across relationships than alternative predictors, including genetic similarity, social closeness, or interdependence.

### A virtue ethics approach to moral dilemmas in medicine [^9fe9ba9e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

Most moral dilemmas in medicine are analysed using the four principles with some consideration of consequentialism but these frameworks have limitations. It is not always clear how to judge which consequences are best. When principles conflict it is not always easy to decide which should dominate. They also do not take account of the importance of the emotional element of human experience. Virtue ethics is a framework that focuses on the character of the moral agent rather than the rightness of an action. In considering the relationships, emotional sensitivities, and motivations that are unique to human society it provides a fuller ethical analysis and encourages more flexible and creative solutions than principlism or consequentialism alone. Two different moral dilemmas are analysed using virtue ethics in order to illustrate how it can enhance our approach to ethics in medicine.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^a8691fbf]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Judgments of whether an action is morally wrong depend on who is involved and the nature of their relationship. But how, when, and why social relationships shape moral judgments is not well understood. We provide evidence to address these questions, measuring cooperative expectations and moral wrongness judgments in the context of common social relationships such as romantic partners, housemates, and siblings. In a pre-registered study of 423 U.S. participants nationally representative for age, race, and gender, we show that people normatively expect different relationships to serve cooperative functions of care, hierarchy, reciprocity, and mating to varying degrees. In a second pre-registered study of 1,320 U.S. participants, these relationship-specific cooperative expectations (i.e., relational norms) enable highly precise out-of-sample predictions about the perceived moral wrongness of actions in the context of particular relationships. In this work, we show that this 'relational norms' model better predicts patterns of moral wrongness judgments across relationships than alternative models based on genetic relatedness, social closeness, or interdependence, demonstrating how the perceived morality of actions depends not only on the actions themselves, but also on the relational context in which those actions occur.

### Our right to in vitro fertilisation – its scope and limits [^b8639c93]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Given this notion of a moral right we may sometimes, when we state that it is wrong to do a certain thing against a certain individual, come to back up this claim with the moral claim that, to do this against this individual, would be to violate this individual's basic right to self-ownership. The idea of a moral right then appears in the premise of a moral argument.

In the present context I will have none of this. I do not believe that basic rights of this kind exist. There are both moral and methodological problems with the claim that they do exist that seem to me to be insurmountable. The moral problems have to do with the fact that, by respecting a putative basic right to self-ownership, we may come to make the world a much worse place. We may even come to encounter situations where the number and seriousness of rights-violations increase, just because we hesitate to violate an individual right. This is not acceptable from a moral point of view. Furthermore, the moral rights theorists are at a loss when we invite them to explain more exactly what it means to be a moral agent, a person, a rights bearer. And even if they were able, in the final analysis, to answer this question in a satisfactory manner (we would at least understand what they are referring to), they would still be at a loss when we ask them to explain why, from a moral point of view, moral agents or persons are so special. Why are they more important, in particular, from a moral point of view, than other creatures capable of feeling pain and pleasure? Lack of personhood may be a good reason not to hold someone responsible for her actions, but hardly a reason not to grant her rights; that is, lack of personhood is hardly a reason not to take the interests of someone into moral consideration.

### Reproduction misconceived: why there is no right to reproduce and the implications for ART access [^5ae074da]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Reproduction is broadly recognised as fundamental to human flourishing. The presumptive priority of reproductive freedom forms the predominant position in the literature, translating in the non-sexual reproductive realm as an almost inviolable right to access assisted reproductive technology (ART). This position largely condemns refusal or restriction of ART by clinicians or the state as discriminatory. In this paper, I critically analyse the moral rights individuals assert in reproductive pursuit to explore whether reproductive rights entitle hopeful parents to ART. I demonstrate that none of the protected actions performed, or entitlements generated are sui generis 'reproductive' rights, leading to the claim that there is no such thing as a right to reproduce. Under scrutiny, the reproductive right is a far narrower and weaker rights assertion than is recognised in the literature. I argue that the predominant position is grounded in a fundamental misunderstanding of the scope and strength of reproductive claims. I also highlight a significant conceptual inconsistency in the literature. On one hand, there is broad consensus that reproductive rights are predominantly negative, yet access to fertility treatment is framed as a component of the right. This wrongly contorts the negative nature of reproductive rights into a positive claim-right to ART. I conclude that this mistakenly frames ART access as sitting within the scope of reproductive freedom. I offer a revised conceptual paradigm of reproductive rights that has important clinical and policy implications for the provision and regulation of ART.

### 'A disastrous blow': psychiatric risk, social indicators and medical authority in abortion reform in post-war britain [^244721a4]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

It was argued in 1966 that the women of the 1960s were 'less timid, less furtive, more determined and more practical' and were capable of demanding an abortion from a doctor under 'reasonable conditions'. 51 Baroness Summerskill contended in 1965 that abortion was 'a matter in which the voice of women should be the deciding factor', for it was their 'human rights' under consideration and the views of the Church should not be decisive for 'it is not for celibate men to decide the fate of these women'. 52 Unwanted motherhood, here, was not framed as a fate to be endured. Sociologist John Peel claimed that 'a responsible attitude towards parenthood and a desire to protect the interests of an existing family will not be lightly sacrificed for an unplanned pregnancy', a trend he identified as part of 'the revolution of rising expectations'. 53 The relationship between family planning and women's expectations of their life cycle was clear: 'when a woman has resumed work outside the home, after careful planning of her family, an unwanted pregnancy can be a disastrous blow'. 54 In 1973, Raymond Illsley noted the connections between contraception and women's assertiveness around abortion: 'the more emphasis we place on family planning the more likely it is that patients themselves will claim the right to decide. The delicate interchange of hints and clues in the doctor–patient encounter… has already changed and will continue to change towards a more direct exchange of request and opinion'. 55

As Alex Mold has argued, the 1960s and 1970s witnessed a shift towards a greater recognition of the agency of the patient. 56 The culture of paternalism within which the patient submitted unquestioningly to the will and expertise of the physician was beginning to change: instead, the patient as a consumer was emerging. 57 In the context of the 20th-century renegotiation of the doctor–patient relationship, the anxieties expressed by doctors regarding the accessibility of the legal framework highlighted the patient's particular role as an active agent in seeking the abortion procedure. Drew Halfmann suggests that doctors objected to legal clauses that would 'create categories of patients who were eligible by law for abortions, thus removing the necessity of doctors' diagnoses and turning doctors into 'mere technicians'; in Britain, he shows, this concern was principally about patient infringement on professional discretion. 58

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^0989d2d1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A further limitation of the current studies is that they only concern moral wrongness judgments, based on actions that weaken one or more of the expected relational functions. What about judgments of moral rightness, goodness, or praiseworthiness as these relate to actions which strengthen one or more of the functions? Will people be judged positively for "merely" meeting functional expectations, as when a parent-child relationship fulfills the care function, or will such judgments be reserved for so-called supererogatory behaviors, going above and beyond the call of duty? Either way, we expect that praiseworthiness judgments for a given action will depend, among other things, on the relational context (functionally understood).

Much of the prior literature in moral psychology has focused on judgments of strangers involved in moral dilemmas that pit distinct ethical principles against one another: for example, a utilitarian imperative to maximize welfare, versus a deontological rule that forbids using individuals as a mere means to an end. A key tenet of utilitarianism is that welfare should be maximized impartially, rather than prioritizing the well-being of close friends or family members (for example) over distant strangers. Descriptive research on moral dilemmas shows that many people are not in fact impartial in this sense, consistent with our observations here that people have different cooperative expectations for different relationships, leading in turn to different moral judgments depending on relational context. One intriguing possibility is that individuals who more strongly endorse impartial beneficence will have more uniform prescriptions for cooperative functions across relationships, leading to more uniform moral judgments across relational contexts. This perspective also suggests possible antecedents of impartial beneficence. Because care is normative in close relationships (for example with family, friends, and romantic partners), caring for partners in these relationships does not typically elicit special approbation. Perhaps those who find a sense of purpose or belonging not in tending to close relationships, but in widely being admired, tend to "distribute" care across a broader set of relationships (thus showing relatively impartial beneficence).

### Conscientious objection: a global health perspective [^1687fb13]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

A clearer understanding of conscience and objection

Philosophy is ineliminable from practical problems in medicine because a shared understanding of key concepts ensures we do not talk past each other. Despite its widespread usage, the absence of a uniform understanding of 'conscience'reflects both the complexity of the subject and a relative lack of attention. Conscience has been understood to mean anything from a subjective set of beliefs, to self-knowledge, to a moral motivator, to a direct or indirect way of acquiring moral knowledge. When used in the context of conscientious objection debates, conscience is most often characterised as the intuitive 'voice' that tells us the rightness or wrongness of actions (and is therefore a source of moral knowledge). Sometimes this voice is characterised as identifying merely arbitrary likes and dislikes. Such an account is understandably concerning when it comes to objection debates, since this voice is both subjective (ie, inscrutable) and potentially wrong.

In contrast to this common characterisation, Xavier Symons has argued for an understanding of conscience that is grounded in moral psychology. This account views conscience as a faculty that leads persons to relate morality to their own identity. It thus helps to explain the difference between, for example, the attitudes 'I know stealing is bad' and 'I should not steal' In this way, conscience involves a simultaneous commitment to (1) understanding morality and (2) acting with integrity. It is therefore not merely a source of intuitive moral knowledge (ie, a set of religious or moral beliefs). It is instead the mechanism by which a person puts themselves in relation to certain values by way of their commitments. It is more like a source of moral awareness than moral knowledge; but not just a general awareness of the rightness or wrongness of actions, a personal awareness. Conscience is what gives normative language — 'ought' language — its prescriptive force to an individual. As Symons explains, it leads persons 'to view morality in relation to their own character and identity and leads them to commit to living up to the requirements of the moral life'. Such a commitment, facilitated by conscience, results in psychological unity, a sense of identity, and a meaningful moral life.

### Ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle [^2985a806]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

An additional direction for future research is to examine the relationship between ambit of concern and ideology beyond a simple liberal–conservative distinction. Although we employ a general measure of ideology and demonstrate that economic and social ideology reveal the same patterns of the results, in some circumstances social ideology might capture ambit of concern better than economic ideology. Additional research can examine the specifically social component of ideology specifically. We also do not examine the relationship between ideology and ambit of concern for libertarians, a group that exhibits low general empathy, low universalism, but also low endorsement of the binding moral foundations that typify conservative ideology. Additional research examining libertarians can better capture moral concern beyond the simple liberal–conservative dimension.

Finally, future research can address three issues pertaining to generalizability. First, future work can address manifestations of ideology at different time periods, as we cannot make overly broad claims about ideology based on data from this one (particularly polarized) point in history. Nonetheless, we do believe that the left–right distinction is quite robust throughout history even as it takes different forms from generation to generation. As Hibbingnotes, John Stuart Mill called it "commonplace" for political systems to have "'a party of order or stability and a party of progress or reform'… The antagonism between two primal mindsets certainly pervades human history: Sparta and Athens; optimates and populares; Roundheads and Cavaliers; Inquisition and Enlightenment; Protagonus and Plato; Pope Urban VIII and Galileo; Barry Goldwater and George McGovern; Sarah Palin and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The labels "liberal" or "leftist" and "conservative" or "rightist" may be relatively recent (etymologically they are typically assumed to date to the French Revolution, but they appear to be much older".

### To be, or not to be? The role of the unconscious in transgender transitioning: identity, autonomy and well-being [^da8b1b24]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

The merits and challenges of gender affirmative care

The question about whether we should 'accept' transgender individuals' claims about what will support their well-being can be approached from two angles: one more obvious, generalisable, but no less important and the other, more variegated and hence not allowing any generalisations. We will first address the more obvious reading before exploring a more complex reading of 'acceptance'.

The etymology of 'to accept' is the Latin accipere meaning 'to receive, to let in, admit, hear, learn'. It denotes a willingness to take on board another person's account, to give it legitimacy, but not necessarily to accept it as true or superior to an alternative account. Ethical decision-making about any medical intervention that carries risks as well as potential benefits is always embedded in a relational matrix in which at least two people strive to arrive at a decision about whether an intervention is in the patient's best interests. This is central to most contemporary models of the doctor-patient relationship and represents a rejection of the historically dominant medical model of medical paternalism. Within the 1980s and 90s, respect for patient autonomy increased in importance in medicine. But tit also came with the realisation that medicine is concerned with promoting the patient's best overall interests, such as well-being, rather than health narrowly conceived as the absence of disease. As medicine became increasingly complex, with multiple options with different risk/benefit profiles, it became clear it was necessary to understand patient values to identify the best option. According to the shared decision-making model, patients supplied the values and doctors supplied the facts. However, other models gave greater weight to normative dialogue, that is, dialogue about should be done, what is good and right. For example, the liberal rationalist model required doctors and patients to engage in normative and value dialogue, as well as exchange of facts, to identify what would best promote this patient's well-being in this particular context. It is the patient who is privy to their own values and to their particular life circumstances, relationships and position in society. However, sometimes their values conflict and sometimes their values should change, for example, a person who autonomously desires to abuse their partner. According to the liberal rationalist model, doctors and patients are engaged in a joint journey to answer the question: what should the patient do in this circumstance?

### Where the ethical action also is: a response to hardman and hutchinson [^3a5e8001]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

In Where the ethical action is, Hardman and Hutchinson make some interesting and compelling points about the way in which 'the ethical'-various values and various kinds of values-are embedded in everyday life, including the everyday life one finds in clinical interactions, understood as scientific or scientifically informed activities. However, even when one considers 'the ethical' from within the horizon of understanding adopted in their essay, they neglect several important features of healthcare and medical education. In this rejoinder, I argue that a fuller understanding would go some way to indicating the complexity of ethics and 'ethical action' in the clinic, as well as the nature of and need for 'expert' analysis and philosophical reflection on the ethical questions that modern healthcare continues to engender.

### Strangers or friends? A proposal for a new spirituality-in-medicine ethic [^95d4cfa8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We argue that debate regarding whether and how physicians should engage religious concerns has proceeded under inadequate terms. The prevailing paradigm approaches dialogue regarding religion as a form of therapeutic technique, engaged by one stranger, the physician, upon another stranger, the patient. This stranger-technique framework focuses the debate on questions of physicians' competence, threats to patients' autonomy, and neutrality regarding religion, and in so doing, it too greatly circumscribes the scope of physician-patient dialogue. In contrast, we argue that dialogue regarding religion is better approached as a form of philosophical discourse about ultimate human concerns. Such moral discourse is often essential to the patient-physician relationship, and rather than shrinking from such discourse, physicians might engage patients regarding religious concerns guided by an ethic of moral friendship that seeks the patient's good through wisdom, candor, and respect.

### Mitochondrial donation and' the right to know' [^5a15942d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

As mitochondria are thought not to be responsible for a person's characteristics (beyond their health), information about a mitochondria donor's personal details and identity should only be disclosed on a basis of mutual consent through a system without a statutory standing. (6.57)

It is worth noting that there is a subtle difference between the argument made by the Nuffield Council and the opinion expressed in the HFEA report. Whereas the Nuffield Council's argument rests on whether resemblances between a donor and the resultant child are conveyed via mtDNA, the opinion expressed in the HFEA report seems to rest on the more general claim about the effect mtDNA donation has on personal characteristics, without any mention of resemblance to the donor. However, it seems implausible that mere effect on personal characteristics could ground a right to know. Consider that the actions of the technicians involved in mitochondrial transfer procedures will affect the personal characteristics of the resulting children because they influence which particular gametes will come together to form zygotes. However, it seems unreasonable that children created using donor mitochondria (or donor gametes for that matter!) ought to have access to identifying information about the members of their medical teams, even if these individuals do influence their personal characteristics. Despite any reference to resemblances in their statement, a more charitable reading of the HFEA's position is that since mtDNA is not taken to influence personal characteristics, mtDNA donation cannot establish genetically based resemblances in personal characteristics between donors and the children they help create.

We are thus presented with two arguments for why we should not extend the right to know to mitochondrial donation cases. The first, which I will call the 'the argument from personal characteristics', can be summarised as follows:
Transfers of genetic material from the donor to the resultant child that result in resemblances in personal characteristics between the two can ground the right to know.
mtDNA donation does not give rise to resemblances in personal characteristics between the donor and the resultant child.
Therefore, mtDNA donation does not give rise to a right to know on the basis of resemblances.

The second, which I will call 'the argument from genetic connection' can be summarised as follows:
A unique genetic connection between progenitor and offspring can ground the right to know.
No unique genetic connection is established between mtDNA donor and resultant offspring.
Therefore, mtDNA donation does not ground the right to know on the basis of a unique genetic connection.

### Complex societies precede moralizing gods throughout world history [^0d5c68e6]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

The origins of religion and of complex societies represent evolutionary puzzles 1–8. The 'moralizing gods' hypothesis offers a solution to both puzzles by proposing that belief in morally concerned supernatural agents culturally evolved to facilitate cooperation among strangers in large-scale societies 9–13. Although previous research has suggested an association between the presence of moralizing gods and social complexity 3,6,7,9–18, the relationship between the two is disputed 9–13,19–24, and attempts to establish causality have been hampered by limitations in the availability of detailed global longitudinal data. To overcome these limitations, here we systematically coded records from 414 societies that span the past 10,000 years from 30 regions around the world, using 51 measures of social complexity and 4 measures of supernatural enforcement of morality. Our analyses not only confirm the association between moralizing gods and social complexity, but also reveal that moralizing gods follow-rather than precede-large increases in social complexity. Contrary to previous predictions 9,12,16,18, powerful moralizing 'big gods' and prosocial supernatural punishment tend to appear only after the emergence of 'megasocieties' with populations of more than around one million people. Moralizing gods are not a prerequisite for the evolution of social complexity, but they may help to sustain and expand complex multi-ethnic empires after they have become established. By contrast, rituals that facilitate the standardization of religious traditions across large populations 25,26 generally precede the appearance of moralizing gods. This suggests that ritual practices were more important than the particular content of religious belief to the initial rise of social complexity.

### The ethical canary: narrow reflective equilibrium as a source of moral justification in healthcare priority-setting [^7c045b56]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

One such scheme, recently developed as a tool for articulating normative reasoning in healthcare priority-setting, classifies normative content according to four types, based on degree of specification (see figure 1). Values, the least specified normative type, describe abstract ends such as justice, liberty, dignity and happiness that a priority-setter believes are worth pursuing because they are 'good' or 'right'. Principles are more specified action-guiding claims that serve as a pledge to act in a certain way or as the basis for part of a chain of reasoning. Standards are specific ways of doing things that are accepted by authority, precedent, custom or general consent. And case-based judgements are considered conclusions reached through the evaluation of information relevant to a specific context or case. Together, these four types of normative commitment give rise to a chain of reasoning from which is derived a priority-setting decision.

Figure 1
A framework for the articulation of normative reasoning in health technology assessment.

This scheme allows coherence to be systematically evaluated by facilitating the classification of normative content, allowing the degree of alignment within and between each class to be assessed. Say, for example, that a priority-setter has promised to act in accordance with justice. 5 In practice, the value of justice must be specified if it is to act as a guide to action, and this specification can take many different forms. Our hypothetical priority-setter specifies justice through two substantive principles: a principle of fairness, which stipulates that similar cases should be treated similarly, and a principle of efficiency, which requires it to recommend new interventions only if their adoption is likely to lead to a net increase in population health. These principles are operationalised through many detailed standards describing, for example, what procedures will be followed in reaching a decision, what characteristics of a case should be taken into account, how an intervention's contribution to population health will be assessed and on what basis it will be deemed cost-effective. Ultimately, this policy — which can be shown to be coherent — is applied to an individual case, which generates a collection of further judgements that contribute to a decision about whether or not the intervention should be adopted.

### Applying the four principles [^07791614]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

Gillon is correct that the four principles provide a sound and useful way of analysing moral dilemmas. As he observes, the approach using these principles does not provide a unique solution to dilemmas. This can be illustrated by alternatives to Gillon's own analysis of the four case scenarios. In the first scenario, a different set of factual assumptions could yield a different conclusion about what is required by the principle of beneficence. In the second scenario, although Gillon's conclusion is correct, what is open to question is his claim that what society regards as the child's best interest determines what really is in the child's best interest. The third scenario shows how it may be reasonable for the principle of beneficence to take precedence over autonomy in certain circumstances, yet like the first scenario, the ethical conclusion relies on a set of empirical assumptions and predictions of what is likely to occur. The fourth scenario illustrates how one can draw different conclusions based on the importance given to the precautionary principle.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^294c1ee9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Next, we created an algorithm to select 12 action items that were rated among the most characteristic in weakening each of the four cooperative functions (three statements per function; 'weaken' set). First, for each function, the algorithm ranked the actions, in ascending order, by their mean weakening "characteristicness" rating and randomly selected 3 out of the seven most characteristic actions. Second, it computed the mean rating across the three selected actions, yielding one mean score per function. Third, the algorithm computed the standard deviation of the four function-specific means generated in the previous step. Finally, steps one to three were repeated 10,000 times to find the combination of three action statements that yielded the lowest standard deviation of scores across functions. The second iteration of the algorithm was subjected to two further constraints so that we could ensure consistency with potential function-strengthening items planned for testing in future studies ('strengthen' set). The first constraint was that the minimum mean score in the 'weaken' set could not be lower than the minimum mean score in the 'strengthen' set. The second constraint was that the average of the final 'weaken' scores could not be more than one point lower than the average of the final 'strengthen' scores. So that future studies can be straightforwardly compared with the present study, we selected items for the 'weaken' set so that they would weaken the cooperative functions to a similar degree as future 'strengthen' items would strengthen the functions. In other words, we wanted to make sure that we identified a set of 'weaken' items that were not more extreme (in the 'weaken' direction) than future 'strengthen' items would be (in the 'strengthen' direction). This process resulted in a final set of 12 function-weakening action statements, with three per function, as shown in Fig. 4.

### "If I know I am on the pill and I get pregnant, it's an act of god": women's views on fatalism, agency and pregnancy [^b62191f2]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

3.1. Variations in fatalistic beliefs

Almost all of the women expressed some degree of fatalism about pregnancy and contraception, and we identified five broad themes. Most commonly (n = 37), women referenced non-specific forces that exerted control over their lives. For example, 18 women referenced "fate" and "destiny:"

"There's always a plan, in everyone's life, of how it's supposed to be, and I feel that I got — I had my two children at the young age and they're — it's — it was destiny".

A similar number of women (n = 22) used some variation of the phrase "meant to happen" when describing pregnancy timing. This usage indicated respondents' belief that the timing of pregnancies in people's lives is predetermined by an outside force:

I: Is there anything that's appealing about the idea of getting pregnant right now?

R: I mean, sometimes I think about it, and I'd just be like, you know if it happens, it's maybe because it's a sign that it's meant to happen.

Women also referenced God as controlling whether or not they became pregnant (n = 22). Whereas "fate" and "destiny" were often neutral or non-specific, the role of God could sometimes be benevolent or punishing.

A related theme did not name any controlling power or force, but nonetheless articulated the idea that pregnancy cannot be planned (n = 11). In some instances, women referenced their own experiences with unintended pregnancies or unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant. Even without a prior pregnancy experience, some indicated that pregnancy is something that "just happens" in people's lives:

"[…] it just always happens so, that's kind of what I feel like. However, I do have a co-worker, who, she's married. and she planned her kid. Like, she's like, I want to get pregnant at this time, and she was, ended up being pregnant, I'm like, wow! I don't know, I felt like that was amazing because, you just, — that never happens".

Less common themes related to fatalism included the belief that contraception does not work and the idea that some women's unconscious or subconscious desires to have, or not to have, children have an effect on whether or not they actually become pregnant.

Yet in a digital age, our understanding of this relationship has been trimmed to a transaction between free agents that can be fully measured and isolated in time.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^8c774aa2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

With respect to aims (i) and (ii), we predicted that relational norms would robustly predict moral judgments about the wrongness of actions in relational context. The basis for this prediction is straightforward: the more a particular set of cooperative functions matters for a given relationship, the morally worse it should be judged to be to neglect or frustrate those same functions within that relationship. Because relationships vary in terms of the set of cooperative functions they are normatively expected to serve (and to what degree), a given action may be judged to be seriously wrong in the context of one relationship but entirely acceptable in the context of another.

We further predicted that our relational norms model would better explain the variance in moral wrongness judgments across relationship dyads than genetic relatedness, social closeness, and interdependence, which we believe offer incomplete predictive accounts of such judgments in relational context. To illustrate, imagine that Person A fails to behave in a deferential manner toward Person B. Insofar as the relationship is normatively expected to be governed by the hierarchy function (see Table 1), with Person A in the subordinate position, such behavior likely will be judged as morally wrong. By contrast, consider how genetic relatedness might explain the wrongness of this action. Some genetically close relationships, such as the parent-child relationship, may, indeed, normatively rely on the hierarchy function to coordinate behavior, and to the extent they do, the action might be judged to be wrong. However, other genetically close relationships, such as siblings of a similar age, are less likely to rely on the hierarchy function, while some genetically distant relationships, such as a typical boss-employee relationship, might be equally or even more likely to rely on the function. Thus, genetic relatedness ultimately may prove to be largely independent of the question of what makes certain actions liable to be judged morally wrong.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^693a99d2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Several scholars have stressed the importance of taking relational context into account in understanding our moral psychology. Yet the way that relational context has so far been conceptualized so far has suffered from certain limitations. Most commonly, relational context has been understood to vary in a one-dimensional way: for example, in terms of the genetic relatedness of the interaction partners, or their social closeness or interdependence. A more promising approach, we think, is to conceptualize relationships in terms of the distinctive pattern of cooperative functions they are normatively expected to rely upon for coordinating behavior in a given society. Although a number of authors have proposed various taxonomies of cooperative functions, that overlap theoretically with the set employed here, it has remained unclear how these functions actually are embedded in different types of relationships. Consequently, we undertook to measure relationship-specific patterns of prescribed cooperative functions (i.e. relational norms) in a U.S. cultural context and to demonstrate how these relational norms predict relationship-specific moral judgments.

To do this, we first measured prescribed cooperative functions for a large set of common dyadic relationships, yielding four-dimensional relational norm profiles for each relationship. Quantifying the distinctiveness of these relationships in terms of their relational norms revealed several distinct clusters of relationship types spanning the domains of care, hierarchy, mating, and reciprocity. Consistent with our predictions, such relational norms predicted out-of-sample moral wrongness judgments in relational context, and explained more relational variance in such moral judgments than genetic relatedness, social closeness, or interdependence of relationship partners. This suggests that moral wrongness judgments of actions within a given relationship are guided by the extent to which the actions violate or neglect prescribed cooperative functions for that relationship. Moreover, relationships with more similar relational norms showed more similar patterns of moral judgments (Fig. 6). These findings reveal a robust underlying structure of expected relational obligations which shape our moral judgments.

### Responding to religious patients: why physicians have no business doing theology [^be2ca2cb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

A survey of the recent literature suggests that physicians should engage religious patients on religious grounds when the patient cites religious considerations for a medical decision. We offer two arguments that physicians ought to avoid engaging patients in this manner. The first is the Public Reason Argument. We explain why physicians are relevantly akin to public officials. This suggests that it is not the physician's proper role to engage in religious deliberation. This is because the public character of a physician's role binds him/her to public reason, which precludes the use of religious considerations. The second argument is the Fiduciary Argument. We show that the patient-physician relationship is a fiduciary relationship, which suggests that the patient has the clinical expectation that physicians limit themselves to medical considerations. Since engaging in religious deliberations lies outside this set of considerations, such engagement undermines trust and therefore damages the patient-physician relationship.

### Is there a' new ethics of abortion'? [^966a35b3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

This paper argues that the central issue in the abortion debate has not changed since 1967 when the English parliament enacted the Abortion Act. That central issue concerns the moral status of the human fetus. The debate here is not, it is argued, primarily a moral debate, but rather a metaphysical debate and/or a theological debate — though one with massive moral implications. It concerns the nature and attributes that an entity requires to have "full moral standing" or "moral inviolability" including a "right to life". It concerns the question when, in its development from newly fertilised ovum to unequivocally mature, autonomous morally inviolable person does a human being acquire that nature and those attributes, and thus a "right to life". The paper briefly reviews standard answers to these questions, outlining some problems associated with each. Finally there is a brief discussion of one way in which the abortion debate has changed since 1967 — notably in the increasingly vociferous claim, especially from disability rights sectors, that abortion on grounds of fetal abnormality implies contempt for and rejection of disabled people — a claim that is rebutted.

### Effective altruism in global health: doing better, justly [^61a862f0]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Bernard Williams famously responded to Sidgwick's impartiality principle by arguing that employing such an 'Archimedean fulcrum' would abstract us from the very relationships and contexts that give us a 'practical or moral identity'. In other words, it is precisely our relationships to causes and contexts that generate moral dispositions and commitments:

Such dispositions and commitments will characteristically be what gives one's life some meaning, and gives one some reason for living it… There is simply no conceivable exercise that consists in stepping completely outside myself and from that point of view evaluating in toto the dispositions, projects and affections that constitute the substance of my own life.

Singer claims that, by taking an impartial 'point of view of the universe', the 'effective altruists seem to have achieved what Williams thought cannot be done'. However, according to Williams' reasoning above, your relationship with your uncle who contracted cancer is one that ought to matter — if it did not, a moral life would be less meaningful to you, since your moral identity is constituted at least in part by relationships like the one you have with your uncle. Along similar lines, Crary points out that universal impartiality 'deprives us of the resources we need to recognise what matters morally'. By abstracting us from relational context, the point of view of the universe would render us, effectively, morally blind (Crary goes so far as to call it moral corruption).

### Killing or letting die? Proposal of a (somewhat) new answer to a perennial question [^be2596f0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

There is as yet no widely agreed-upon solution to the standard textbook problem whether actively shutting off a life-sustaining medical device, e.g. a respirator, and thus bringing about a patient's death amounts to active killing or just to an omission of further treatment. Apart from a range of astutely contrived case examples and respective particular solutions proposed in the literature, there seems to be no consensus on the normative principles such solutions should be grounded in, not even on the need for such principles beyond sheer intuition. The present paper attempts to develop a normative approach based on fundamental principles of law. From this perspective, what is decisive for the question of 'killing or letting die' in such cases is not that death ensues from a behaviour that is active and relevantly causative, but rather, whether or not the agent in performing the deadly act transgresses the boundaries of the domain of his or her sole normative authority, and thereby intervenes in the protected sphere of another. Unless he or she does so, their behaviour cannot be classified as active commission regardless of the amount of causal activity it may display and regardless of its potentially harmful consequences. This conception is spelled out in detail and tested in a range of case examples, as are several of its corollaries that deviate from standard type solutions.

### Towards a medicine of the invisible: bioethics and relationship in "The little prince" [^31c13043]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

The Little Prince is one of the most famous fables. In this paper, we attempt to look at three bioethical issues through the Little Prince's eyes: the end-of-life context, the patient-physician relationship and prevention/precaution. The fable gives us the basis for a perspective we have called 'Medicine of the Invisible', which is value-focused. The Little Prince suggests that we seek the invisible-the "thing that is important", the "matters of consequence", even on a gnoseological and epistemological level-as a new type of 'clinical data' which may help to make healthcare more ethical and effective. However, this invisible is attainable only within a relationship, in which the physician needs to be tamed by the patient and the patient needs to be tamed by the physician-each one becoming responsible for the other, each one becoming himself through the dialogue with the other. Responsibility is also projected towards the future, against those threats to life that are still unseen and unknown: owning a part of the world entails the ethical imperative to act, in order to safeguard life. But, without a relationship-saturated with lived time, shared experiences, and individual's uniqueness-no meaning and no value can be given. For this reason, the Medicine of the Invisible reminds bioethics that "the thing that is important is the thing that is not seen".

Radar plots derived from the hierarchical cluster model are depicted in the bottom half of the figure (b). The left panel shows the overlapping clusters; the right panel shows each cluster on its own set of axes. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Based on these analyses, we identified a subset of 10 relationships with relatively distinctive relational norms (see Supplement Section 2.1. for the selection procedure). This subset included long-term romantic partners, friends with benefits, boss and employee, colleagues or classmates, mother/father and under-18 child, siblings, close friends, roommates or housemates, teammates, and strangers. Relational norm profiles for these relationships are depicted in Fig. 2. We next sought to predict moral judgments of actions performed in the context of these relationships on the basis of their relational norm profiles.

Relational norm profiles predict relationship-specific moral wrongness judgments out of sample

To test the hypothesis that relational norm profiles would predict patterns of moral judgments across social relationships, we first assembled a set of common behaviors that would plausibly weaken or violate one or more of the cooperative functions. Fifteen trained judges rated 86 action statements of the form "Person A does X to Person B" on the extent to which each described action characteristically would weaken (that is, violate or impair) or strengthen each of the cooperative functions, setting moral questions aside (that is, the judges were instructed not to think about whether an action might be right or wrong in any relationship, but only whether it would weaken or strengthen each function). There was very high interrater agreement in these ratings (ICC(3, k) = .97). Using these data, we selected a final set of 12 characteristic function-weakening action statements, with 3 statements for each of the 4 dyadic functions (see Methods for the algorithm used to select the final sub-set). See Fig. 4.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — religion and health care considerations state that many Muslims view illness as a "trial from God", and when conceptualized in this way, it is not appropriate to solely treat the underlying medical condition; spiritual healing is also needed. The text notes that some religions prohibit certain medical interventions and that Muslims are not allowed to consume pork while some vaccines and medicines are derived from pig products; if a Muslim client presents with an illness, making sure that the agreed-upon medicine does not contain certain substances, like pig products, is needed. It adds that the practitioner strives to be knowledgeable about what healthcare practices go with or against religious identity and that this knowledge would likely improve the therapeutic relationship by creating honesty, dialogue, and trust.

### The ethical canary: narrow reflective equilibrium as a source of moral justification in healthcare priority-setting [^872b6345]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

The problem with substantive principles

Any decision, by definition, has content, and if a decision is to be non-arbitrary then that content must reflect substantive reasons. One approach to moral evaluation is to consider whether these reasons are morally justified. According to this rationale, if a priority-setter has made its decision for 'good' reasons, then it follows that the decision itself is 'good'.

But what constitutes a good reason? One approach is to ground claims on substantive principles of justice. One might, for example, employ the utilitarian principle of health maximisation to argue that allocation decisions should be based on whether an intervention's use will increase or decrease overall population health, once opportunity cost has been taken into account. 1 Or one might take the prioritarian view that preference should be given to the worse-off in society, even if this is somewhat inefficient. Different principles generate different conclusions and, in the absence of an agreed theory of justice, there is no way to independently adjudicate between them: the utilitarian would simply argue that the prioritarian is mistaken in their moral beliefs and vice versa. Even under pluralist theories that incorporate a range of different principles, the question of how these should be selected, specified and balanced remains thorny. Thus, any priority-setter who seeks to justify their decisions on purely substantive grounds will likely find those grounds rejected by a proportion of society, undermining their legitimacy at least in the eyes of those who take an alternative view of what justice requires.

An alternative approach is to explicitly ground substantive principles for priority-setting on public views, for example, by conducting studies exploring societal values. Doing so might enhance a priority-setter's perceived legitimacy and make its decisions less vulnerable to challenge. But the mere fact that a view is widely held does not guarantee that it is ethically permissible — a racist society may support a racially based allocation, but this would not make it morally justified. Moreover, recourse to public opinion offers no remedy for matters on which there is no public consensus. Reasonable disagreement has been demonstrated across a range of moral questions relevant to healthcare priority-setting and is the inevitable product of ethical deliberation in any free-thinking pluralist society. The problems associated with basing moral evaluation on individual substantive principles, therefore, remain unresolved.

### Purposes and duties in scientific modelling [^65a3b994]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2022). Medium credibility.

More people than ever are paying attention to philosophical questions about epidemiological models, including their susceptibility to the influence of social and ethical values, sufficiency to inform policy decisions under certain conditions, and even their fundamental nature. One important question pertains to the purposes of epidemiological models, for example, are COVID-19 models for 'prediction' or 'projection'? Are they adequate for making causal inferences? Is one of their goals, or virtues, to change individual responses to the pandemic? In this essay, we offer our perspective on these questions and place them in the context of other recent philosophical arguments about epidemiological models. We argue that clarifying the intended purpose of a model, and assessing its adequacy for that purpose, are moral-epistemic duties, responsibilities which pertain to knowledge but have moral significance nonetheless. This moral significance, we argue, stems from the inherent value-ladenness of models, along with the potential for models to be used in political decision making in ways that conflict with liberal values and which could lead to downstream harms. Increasing conversation about the moral significance of modelling, we argue, could help us to resist further eroding our standards of democratic scrutiny in the COVID-19 era.

### Pain assessment: subjectivity, objectivity, and the use of neurotechnology [^6a98fd6d]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The pain clinician is confronted with the formidable task of objectifying the subjective phenomenon of pain so as to determine the right treatments for both the pain syndrome and the patient in whom the pathology is expressed. However, the experience of pain - and its expression - remains enigmatic. Can currently available evaluative tools, questionnaires, and scales actually provide adequately objective information about the experiential dimensions of pain? Can, or will, current and future iterations of biotechnology - whether used singularly or in combination (with other technologies as well as observational-behavioral methods) - afford objective validation of pain? And what of the clinical, ethical, legal and social issues that arise in and from the use - and potential misuse - of these approaches? Subsequent trajectories of clinical care depend upon the findings gained through the use of these techniques and their inappropriate employment - or misinterpretation of the results they provide - can lead to misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment. This essay is the first of a two-part series that explicates how the intellectual tasks of knowing about pain and the assessment of its experience and expression in the pain patient are constituent to the moral responsibility of pain medicine. Herein, we discuss the problem of pain and its expression, and those methods, techniques, and technologies available to bridge the gap between subjective experience and objective evaluation. We address how these assessment approaches are fundamental to apprehend both pain as an objective, neurological event, and its impact upon the subjective experience, existence, and expectations of the person in pain. In this way, we argue that the right use of technology - together with inter-subjectivity, compassion, and insight - can sustain the good of pain care as both a therapeutic and moral enterprise.

### Against the principle that the individual shall have priority over science [^3d9defd2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

This paper highlights a feature common to many ethical guidelines — namely, the idea that the interests of the individual shall always prevail over the interests of science and society. The paper presents how some major ethical guidelines treat the balancing of research interests against those of research subjects and spells out the difficulties in interpreting the principle of the primacy of the individual in a way that can be action-guiding. It suggests various alternative interpretations of the primacy of the individual and argues that they do not hold. Finally, the implications of this analysis for ethical guidelines are discussed.

### Moral responsibility for (un) healthy behaviour [^8e65dded]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Combatting chronic, lifestyle-related disease has become a healthcare priority in the developed world. The role personal responsibility should play in healthcare provision has growing pertinence given the growing significance of individual lifestyle choices for health. Media reporting focussing on the 'bad behaviour' of individuals suffering lifestyle-related disease, and policies aimed at encouraging 'responsibilisation' in healthcare highlight the importance of understanding the scope of responsibility ascriptions in this context. Research into the social determinants of health and psychological mechanisms of health behaviour could undermine some commonly held and tacit assumptions about the moral responsibility of agents for the sorts of lifestyles they adopt. I use Philip Petit's conception of freedom as 'fitness to be held responsible' to consider the significance of some of this evidence for assessing the moral responsibility of agents. I propose that, in some cases, factors outside the agent's control may influence behaviour in such a way as to undermine her freedom along the three dimensions described by Pettit: freedom of action; a sense of identification with one's actions; and whether one's social position renders one vulnerable to pressure from more powerful others.

### How economics could extend the scope of ethical discourse [^e8d6a8e4]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Ethical discourse is typically inconclusive, and with good reason. But this inconclusiveness is a distinct disadvantage when it comes to helping publicly accountable policy-makers in the health care system provide an ethical justification for their decisions. It is suggested that instead of ending with platitudinous statements such as that a balance has to be struck between the rival ethical considerations, empirical research should be undertaken to elicit the quantitative trade-offs that the affected general public would be prepared to accept when striking this balance. In the expected absence of any consensus, it is further suggested that the views of the median person be taken as the best approximation to the group view. Finally it is argued that, far from this quantitative approach lacking humanity by treating individuals as "mere statistics", it shows greater compassion than the proponents of those approaches whose fellow feeling can only be stirred by information pertaining to identified individuals.

### Learning (not) to know: examining how white ignorance manifests and functions in white adolescents' racial identity narratives [^d1e5dab9]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

I think there are less good things about being white right now, you know, I, you know, the whole thing about how white people get what they want; I don't really, haven't really experienced that. I applied for a job at Whole Foods and I was the only white male there and you know if that stereotype was right then I would have gotten that job because, you know, I was the male and I was white, and it was all transgender women, colored women and women, so I was the one male and there were other males but they were obviously other colors, but that stereotype would have been correct but I didn't get that job.

Here, we see Oliver claim that if the racial system was working by design, he should have "gotten that job" above all others, given his positionality as white and male. In other words, Oliver "knows" and recognizes how his positionality is granted privilege in society; however, since he ultimately "didn't get that job", he attributes this to the "less good things about being white right now". Another participant, Sam, also located whiteness in a position of disadvantage, explaining that "it's hard" to be white because "it's harder to get into colleges, some colleges want unique, more unique people. So, if I have the same stats as another student but he's like a Pacific Islander then maybe he gets in before me". Reflecting what he seems to know about the former policy of affirmative action, Sam, like Oliver quoted above, articulates a perceived racial disadvantage that does not recognize the systematic effort to recalibrate the legacy of white racial advantage in education (and society writ large).

### How to write a systematic review of reasons [^5210e0a0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

As we argue elsewhere, we must reject McCullough et al 's measure of 'the adequacy of the ethical analysis and argument' (p. 67). Furthermore, while it might be possible to replace it with a suitable measure, a systematic review that answers an ethical question may mislead decision-makers when the literature reviewed is incomplete or inadequate. In these cases, the literature's answer to the review question places no burden of proof on those who disagree. Of course, when an empirical literature is inadequate, its answer will also be potentially misleading and uninteresting; the correct safeguard in both cases (inadequate empirical and reason-based literatures) is for the review to conclude only that further research is needed to answer the question. To date, however, the assessment of the quality of reasons and of argument-based literature is much less standardised than, for example, the assessment of the quality of clinical trials and the literature that reports their results. Bioethicists as well as clinical and policy decision-makers are less likely, we surmise, to understand the significance of limitations in reasoning than in study design. A McCullough model systematic review, insofar as it is a systematic review of (quality-weighted) conclusions, also has normative problems: it may mislead when there are mutually incompatible, but maximally informed and individually reasonable, answers to the ethical question, or when different weightings of the reasons (as may be appropriate in dissimilar contexts) support different answers.

### Nudges in a post-truth world [^8f5b09cb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Appeals to the mechanisms that weigh testimony by reference to their source are very plausibly appeals to mechanisms that are partially constitutive of rationality, because we likely have such mechanisms in virtue of the role they played in enabling better decision-making. As we saw above, these mechanisms are sensitive to the previous track record of the source. That is, very obviously, sensitivity to a property that is truth-conducive. We should put less weight on the testimony of those who are frequently wrong than those who have better records. Similarly, sensitivity to the ideological orientation of the source is also truth-conducive. We should be wary of the claims of people who lack benevolence towards us, because they may be motivated to exploit us. We also should put more stock in testimony from agents who have an incentive to reject the claim they affirm. Thresholds for being convinced of a claim are sensitive to the stakes for the person: it takes weaker evidence to convince people of claims they are motivated to accept than claims they are motivated to reject. When someone testifies that a claim is true and we have good reason to think that they are motivated to reject the claim, we should think that the evidence in favour of the claim is especially strong. Sensitivity to these properties is sensitivity to considerations that are relevant to the credence we should place on testimony. Appealing to them is appealing to capacities that have as their proper function the assessment of reasons for belief — a function that is obviously partially constitutive of reasoning — in their role as reasoning mechanisms.

Nudges to reason are therefore appeals to our deliberative capacities. But if appeals to these mechanisms are appeals to our deliberative capacities, we should not think that in so appealing we fail to treat one another as responsible or autonomous agents. Nor should we think that appeals like these limit our substantive freedom; arguably, our freedom consists in the capacity to respond and react to reasons. Appeals to these capacities therefore enable responsible decision-making on the part of the agents whose capacities they are. As far as this set of interlinked considerations (autonomy; responsibility; dignity; freedom) are concerned, there is no reason to worry about nudges to reason. We should think that such nudges are permissible (perhaps we even have an obligation, stemming from the respect we owe to rational agents, to frame our arguments such that are maximally truth-conducive, and therefore to make such appeals).

### Too much medicine: not enough trust? [^08e6eadb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

In an atmosphere of trust, where the patient understands what is happening, giving discretion in this way does not infringe their autonomy: by removing some of the weight of uncertainty, it can enable it to function more effectively. The doctor can seek to understand the patient's preferences in terms of the level of uncertainty they are comfortable with, as well as the levels of investigations and treatments the patient prefers. It is only in the give and take of questioning — questioning that reveals the concerns of both doctor and patient — that an appropriate balance can be established.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^6f94d3d4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society policy statement — language standards and evidence needs for tobacco harm reduction claims — emphasizes that prior frameworks included establishing standard methods for determining relative risk across products, clarifying relationships between toxicants and health outcomes, and monitoring population-level impacts on initiation or cessation; it notes that evidentiary certainty must be counterbalanced by rapid implementation and that post hoc monitoring has been described as ethically acceptable. The document cautions that poorly defined terms such as "light" or "low tar" and vague harm reduction language allow consumer misdirection, states that attention to language is essential to develop a uniform database of reproducible results, and warns that unproven or premature reduced-risk or reduced-exposure claims threaten informed consent and autonomous risk control. It notes general wariness of harm reduction claims and indicates that continued use of vague or misleading terms would be expected to undermine trustworthiness, while the ATS Tobacco Action Committee sought to establish evidence-based "standards of practice" to improve claim trustworthiness and consistency for regulatory direction.

### The ethical canary: narrow reflective equilibrium as a source of moral justification in healthcare priority-setting [^6526af5e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Priority-setters also plausibly have moral obligations that are independent of legitimacy, particularly when tasked with upholding population health. Health is central to well-being, the pursuit or protection of which holds primary moral importance in many ethical theories. Health is also critically important for ensuring fair equality of opportunity, providing a prima facie reason for priority-setters to avoid acting in ways that are to its detriment. Allocating resources based on arbitrary or unjustified reasons may breach a priority-setter's institutional duty to act for the public good and, in some cases, would contravene morally grounded standards of public life for those working on a priority-setter's behalf.

Finding a normative basis from which to morally defend priority-setting decisions is, however, difficult. Individuals have different views on how resources should be allocated and any attempt to justify decisions with reference to substantive principles is, therefore, open to challenge by those who consider different principles to be more appropriate. In the absence of any single agreed theory of justice, such instances of reasonable disagreement cannot be reliably adjudicated, weakening claims to moral legitimacy. Many priority-setters have, therefore, opted to focus on procedure, reasoning that while individuals may differ in what they perceive to be just grounds for decision-making, we can all agree on what constitutes a just process. But it is questionable whether a just process by itself is sufficient to ensure a just outcome and experience has shown that even procedurally based approaches are liable to raise substantive moral questions. Thus, despite such efforts, evidence suggests that priority-setters are 'falling short' when it comes to demonstrating the legitimacy of their decisions.

### Shaping patients' decisions [^f88a3e91]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Many physicians struggle to strike an acceptable balance between respecting patient autonomy and guiding patients' decisions toward what is in their best interests based on their expressed values and long-term goals. Over the past 40 years, the ethical principle of respect for autonomy has gained primacy in Western medicine, but judgments about the appropriate dose of influence on patient decisions have been clouded by misconceptions about patient autonomy. In this article, we consider three such misconceptions with the goal of helping physicians to optimally promote their patients' interests.

### Saving shared decision-making [^f2af5703]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality encouraged a re-examination of the concept, process, and measurement of shared decision-making (SDM) in 2016. Progress, however, has been slow. One illustrative example is SDM's relationship with the concept of equipoise: there remains little consensus on what equipoise means in the context of SDM, creating confusion about when SDM is and is not indicated. In this paper, we describe the ways in which this focus on equipoise in SDM is counter-productive and argue that equipoise is neither a necessary nor sufficient criterion in determining the need for SDM. Moreover, we suggest that what is needed to move the field of SDM forward is a shift away from focusing on when SDM is needed to instead focusing on how best to accomplish SDM across a variety of contexts by advancing the science of SDM implementation.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^df249d80]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A number of theorists have highlighted relational context as likely to be important for understanding moral judgment and behavior. In line with these developments, there is now a small but growing empirical literature which explores how moral judgments of particular actions vary across different types of social relationships –. How these relationships are theorized depends on the study. For example, one recent study characterized relationships in terms of the genetic relatedness of the interaction partners, and showed how varying this factor affects moral judgments about helping behavior. Another recent study characterized relationships in terms of the authors' intuitive sense of the social closeness and relative interdependence of the interaction partners – regardless of genetic relatedness – and tested the influence of these factors on judgments about violations of care. Researchers also have sought to predict moral wrongness judgments of actions in relational context from a single cooperative function thought to characterize a given relationship (e.g. care for a sibling relationship, hierarchy for a teacher-student relationship, and so on).

These studies demonstrate that moral judgments of one and the same action often differ across different types of relationships, depending on how relationship "type" is understood. What is missing, however, is a systematic, data-driven account of the multiple cooperative functions that can characterize any given social relationship, and an explicit comparison of how well such cooperative functions predict relationally-situated moral judgments relative to alternative models such as genetic relatedness, social closeness, and interdependence. We aim to fill that gap with the present research.

In contrast to genetic relatedness, which can be determined objectively, and the constructs of social closeness and interdependence, both of which have been carefully defined within the relationship science literature, there is no agreed-upon set of cooperative functions prescribed for different social relationships to solve characteristic coordination problems. Recognizing both the theoretical overlap and diversity among the various existing taxonomies of cooperative functions, we build on work by Bugental. This work describes a distinctive set of cooperative functions that serve to coordinate behavior in interpersonal relationships. Each function represents an efficient, socially acceptable solution to a particular type of recurrent coordination problem, enabling cooperation partners to mutually benefit over repeated interactions. We focus here on four cooperative functions that solve dyadic or two-party coordination problems: care, reciprocity, hierarchy, and mating (Table 1).

### A fragment of the explanation': the use and abuse of words [^f390746c]. Medical Humanities (2001). Low credibility.

This paper explores the normative basis of power in language, story, labels and evidence, and attempts to show how these dimensions of power are used systematically to simplify the reality of exprience, deny ignorance and exclude uncertainty. Through the resulting abuse of words, doctors may often constrain and limit their patients' stories, consigning many of them to stories of failure, and reducing their capacity to celebrate, or even recognise, achievement.

### Sex, relationships and' everyday psychology' on British magazine problem pages, C. 1960–1990 [^52bfe9ab]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

The stress and depression are entirely your choice. By going for an affair to remedy your marriage problem you've landed yourself in a no-through road where you and your lover are cheating on everybody, including each other. Where's the respect and friendship in that? Guide yourself back to your husband and explain what's gone wrong between you. I'm sure he'll show some feeling for you if you show some for him.

As this response shows, agony aunts often had little patience with letter-writers who claimed the inability to control their emotions. Mary Grant's impatience with one such supplicant was clear when she asked, 'How was it "inevitable" that he became your lover? What's so inevitable about hurling yourself out of a safe, loving, happy marriage into all this worry and misery?'.

Advice columnists applied the same rules of rationality and responsibility to many different kinds of problems over these decades.flatly told a separated woman pregnant by her estranged husband, 'You chose to marry — that carries continuing responsibilities. You chose to make love, and that has now brought about concern for another life'. She did not judge the sexual adventuring of the 27-year-old who had tried and enjoyed 'a lot of sex games' with her ex-boyfriend, but now worried about becoming promiscuous, simply stating that 'Different people mean different things by promiscuous, but plenty of people have short-term relationships on the way to a lasting one'. However, she quickened at the correspondent's unwillingness to admit her own agency: 'plenty of people have a strong, lively interest in sex But they don't all rush into compulsive copulation. They use restraint and responsibility in sex — and so can you the short answer is — if you don't want a promiscuous life, don't lead one'. Likewise, she acidly queried of the 17-year-old who wanted to know whether to start taking the pill 'in case I end up having sex without meaning to', 'wouldn't it be better to avoid any situations where you can't exercise your rational choice about having sex or not?'.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^6b3de3b2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Our primary goal for this research has been simple: to investigate how relational context — in particular, the functional cooperative norms that prescriptively govern dyadic interactions of various kinds — shapes moral judgments. A secondary goal has been to push researchers studying human moral psychology to look at behaviors and associated judgments that are more characteristic of people's day-to-day lives than heretofore has been the case. Much remains to be done, including more precise and sophisticated analyses of which cooperative functions apply to which relationships, how these functions relate to one another, and how they can be used to predict praiseworthiness judgments (not just judgments of moral wrongness as we have undertaken here). As we and others pursue work that places the study of morality in both geopolitical and relational cultural context, we anticipate the emergence of a more nuanced literature on human morality that becomes better integrated with broader and long-standing programs of research on relationships and prosocial behavior.

### 'He would by no means risque his reputation': patient and doctor shame in daniel Turner's (1714) and (1717) [^b987f383]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

All medicine was moral in this period, and individuals were held responsible for maintaining the balance in their constitutions. Those who could not avoid disclosing illness or forsaking social responsibilities might attempt to exonerate themselves from culpability by highlighting their good moral character and social contributions, and attributing their illness to external factors (ref. p. 168). Disease as derived from God — whether punitive or as a reminder of the need for humility — could also provoke shame from self and others (ref. p. 46). Pox, attributed to sexual incontinence, was an exacerbated case; Turner thus offers contagion narratives for each of his patients with pox, especially women, for whom 'honesty' was by definition sexual. He shames several husbands who infect their wives by concealing their condition and/or resisting treatment. One patient hides the infection from his wife for four months, going 'privately from one Quack to another' until she works it out and sends for Turner (ref. sig.M1 v). Turner also reflects that 'Women of the Town' are at an advantage over 'modest' women infected 'by an unkind or brutish Husband': the former, operating under a different hermeneutics of suspicion about the body, recognise variations as signs of pox, 'take the Alarm presently, seek out for Help, and… so soon as possible get rid of it', whereas modest women mistake their symptoms for natural fluctuations in the body, or other lower-level disorders, and have 'run into the last Degree of a Pox, before they knew what their Illness was, or look'd out for a proper Remedy' (ref. sig.C6 r. Original emphasis). Honour could play a further role in diagnosis as physicians read the same symptoms as venereal or not depending on the patient's relationship to stigmatised risk groups: the author of Medicina Flagellata (1721) mocked doctors who read the same symptoms as scurvy in 'sober discreet' individuals, and as the pox in those 'appearing inclined to Wantonness' (ref. sig.D1 v). Turner reports patients whose symptoms appear venereal, but whom he is satisfied are 'honest', such as a man who is diagnosed with a clap by 'one who call'd himself a Barber-Surgeon': 'the poor old Man, in great Anger, goes Home and tells his Wife how he has been abus'd, and she well satisfied of her own and her Husband's Honesty, came along with him to me… I pity'd the old Man' (ref. sig.Q1 v). Conversely, he suggests that a woman who attempts to attribute her pox to wearing the clothing of an infected man to a masquerade, 'perhaps was also after [the fashion of] the Masque, otherwise than by simply putting on the Habit', suggesting that she has engaged in the sexual dissolution commonly attributed to these assemblies (ref. sig.B6 r).

### Intuitions, principles and consequences [^8f27e0b2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Some approaches to the assessment of moral intuitions are discussed. The controlled ethical trial isolates a moral issue from confounding factors and thereby clarifies what a person's intuition actually is. Casuistic reasoning from situations, where intuitions are clear, suggests or modifies principles, which can then help to make decisions in situations where intuitions are unclear. When intuitions are defended by a supporting principle, that principle can be tested by finding extreme cases, in which it is counterintuitive to follow the principle. An approach to the resolution of conflict between valid moral principles, specifically the utilitarian and justice principles, is considered. It is argued that even those who justify intuitions by a priori principles are often obliged to modify or support their principles by resort to the consideration of consequences.

### Everyday norms have become more permissive over time and vary across cultures [^2768e284]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Related value measures

For validation of the scores on society's individualistic morality obtained using the Ind-Bind scale, several related measures were also included and aggregated at the level of societies: The difference in relevance between individualizing and binding moral foundations was measured by a version of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. This version included 8 items measuring the relevance of individualizing foundations and 9 items measuring the relevance of binding foundations (see Supplementary Table 3), providing an indirect comparison between individualizing and binding foundations. We then subtracted the average response to binding items from the average response to the individualizing items.

Freedom-of-choice values were measured by three items (acceptance of homosexuality, abortion, and divorce) phrased as "For each of the following actions, please indicate whether or not you think it is wrong" with a five-point scale coded from 1 to 5: Always wrong, Mostly wrong, Sometimes wrong, Rarely wrong, Not wrong at all. This measure is based on the Choice index in the World Values Survey.

Gender egalitarian values were measured using three items: "When jobs are scarce, men have more right to a job than women; On the whole, men make better political leaders than women do; A university education is more important for a boy than for a girl" with a four-point scale ranging from Strongly disagree (4) to Strongly agree (1). This measure is based on the Equality index in the World Values Survey.

Religious belief was measured using the item "How strongly do you believe in God (or gods)?" with a response scale from 0 to 100.

Demographics

The survey included items about the participant's gender, age, urban/rural background, the single-item MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, and level of education (for non-students). The study additionally included items not used in the present paper (the general appropriateness of different forms of norm enforcement and perceptions of the tightness-looseness of society); no hypothesis or analysis involving these measures was mentioned in the preregistration.

### Proposal and rationale for a cardioethics curriculum [^df786896]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Major technical advances focus cardiovascular discourse on what can be done for patients, often obscuring the equally important question of what should be done. While complex bioethical issues have been extensively addressed in critical care literature and practice, cardiology has just begun to scratch the surface. The 2020 American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology Consensus Conference on Professionalism and Ethics brought welcome attention to the importance of ethics in the practice of cardiology with a focus on contemporary issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion. Here, we propose a framework for a "cardioethics" curriculum that might be incorporated into fellowship training to prepare cardiologists to cope with increasingly complex ethical dilemmas that they are likely to face in practice.

To be clear, ethical dilemmas often emerge when there are seemingly reasonable arguments supporting divergent courses of action or opposing moral claims. But it would be a mistake to conclude that there are therefore "no right answers" in succumbing to the fallacy of false equivalences and moral relativism. Indeed, even though a perfect solution may not always be achievable, there are clearly better and worse approaches to addressing many ethical dilemmas as we will explore in the following sections. While there are no perfect therapies and few cures in cardiovascular medicine, applying the best available evidence and sound clinical reasoning allows us to markedly improve clinical outcomes. Similarly, the application of thoughtful moral reasoning through the acquisition of practical ethical skills has the potential to significantly improve ethical outcomes as well, in addition to preserving the moral integrity of both clinicians and patients.

### Ethics of the fiduciary relationship between patient and physician: the case of informed consent [^b1b63d3c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

As has been pointed out by Christensen, Lévinas provides a comprehensive account of the structure of ethical obligation, however, he 'does not present a theory about the content of ethical obligation'.(p25) For this, we turn to Løgstrup's account. In The Ethical Demand, Løgstrup chooses a similar approach grounded in the phenomenological analysis of the relationship of trust. He does, however, differ from Lévinas in one important detail: while Lévinas sees the source of ethical obligation solely in the otherness of the other, Løgstrup maintains that 'ethical responsibility arises from the nature of the relationship itself, the trust between human beings'.(p30) Løgstrup starts his argument with the observation that human existence is grounded in trust: 'It is integral to human life that we normally meet each other with natural trust'.(p9) Even strangers are met with trust. Distrust only arises when there is reasonable doubt that the other can be trusted. Trust, however, entails the possibility of hurt, because 'to show trust is to deliver oneself up'.(p10) In trusting the other, for example, to show me the way to a train station I cannot find, I expose a vulnerability and lack of knowledge while, at the same time, causing a demand that can be met or disregarded by the other. 'Regardless of how varied the communication between us may be, it always consists in daring to come forward to be met by the other. This is the basic phenomenon of ethical life. Therefore, the demand that arises from this needs no revelation in the theological sense, and nor does it come from a conscious arrangement'.(p17) The demand arising from a relationship of trust is indeed unspoken and can even contradict the spoken request of the person: 'The other human being's own interpretation of what the trust they show or desire is really about is one thing; the demand which is implicit in that trust is quite another thing'.(p20) In other words, there is a potential conflict between the self and the other and the way they interpret the ethical obligation arising from their relationship of trust. Paradoxically, such a conflict is not detrimental to the relationship but instead a sign of freedom: 'If this were not the case, a communication between us — on a basic and existential level — would not be possible. For if it were merely a matter of responding to the expectation of the other and fulfilling their wish, our life together would simply consist in — irresponsibly — making ourselves into the tool of the other person'.(p20)

### Alleviating the burden of malaria with gene drive technologies? A biocentric analysis of the moral permissibility of modifying malaria mosquitoes [^39962a67]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Gene drive technologies (GDTs) have been proposed as a potential new way to alleviate the burden of malaria, yet have also raised ethical questions. A central ethical question regarding GDTs relates to whether it is morally permissible to intentionally modify or eradicate mosquitoes in this way and how the inherent worth of humans and non-human organisms should be factored into determining this. Existing analyses of this matter have thus far generally relied on anthropocentric and zoocentric perspectives and rejected an individualist biocentric outlook in which all living organisms are taken to matter morally for their own sake. In this paper, we reconsider the implications of taking a biocentric approach and highlight nuances that may not be evident at first glance. First, we shortly discuss biocentric perspectives in general, and then outline Paul Taylor's biocentric theory of respect for nature. Second, we explore how conflicting claims towards different organisms should be prioritised from this perspective and subsequently apply this to the context of malaria control using GDTs. Our ethical analysis shows that this context invokes the principle of self-defence, which could override the pro tanto concerns that a biocentrist would have against modifying malaria mosquitoes in this way if certain conditions are met. At the same time, the case study of GDTs underlines the relevance of previously posed questions and criticism regarding the internal consistency of Taylor's egalitarian biocentrism.

### The illusion of moral decline [^195827d5]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Anecdotal evidence indicates that people believe that morality is declining. In a series of studies using both archival and original data (n = 12,492,983), we show that people in at least 60 nations around the world believe that morality is declining, that they have believed this for at least 70 years and that they attribute this decline both to the decreasing morality of individuals as they age and to the decreasing morality of successive generations. Next, we show that people's reports of the morality of their contemporaries have not declined over time, suggesting that the perception of moral decline is an illusion. Finally, we show how a simple mechanism based on two well-established psychological phenomena (biased exposure to information and biased memory for information) can produce an illusion of moral decline, and we report studies that confirm two of its predictions about the circumstances under which the perception of moral decline is attenuated, eliminated or reversed (that is, when respondents are asked about the morality of people they know well or people who lived before the respondent was born). Together, our studies show that the perception of moral decline is pervasive, perdurable, unfounded and easily produced. This illusion has implications for research on the misallocation of scarce resources, the underuse of social supportand social influence.

### The medical profession and the defense and promotion of sexual and reproductive rights [^31f026bf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

The values of the medical profession and other healthcare providers allow assessment of the relationship between physicians, healthcare teams, patients, and healthcare networks regarding the defense and promotion of sexual and reproductive health and rights. This paper questions the traditional model of the relationship between healthcare professionals and patients, based on the classic paternalistic role of the physician. It describes the tools available to the medical profession and healthcare teams for the promotion of sexual and reproductive rights, and proposes specific actions that would lead to improvements for women and communities.

### A mobile revolution for healthcare? Setting the agenda for bioethics [^addee488]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

Whether the expectations of empowering patients are indeed met or not, an aspect that needs close consideration is how these devices and practices influence the doctor–patient relationship. It is not only a matter of introducing more distance in the doctor–patient interaction via online tools, but also a matter of giving patients tools to control their health and rethinking the roles that doctors have in healthcare. By shifting tasks and responsibilities, proposing specific roles and offering tools to understand health and its correlation with lifestyle, these systems introduce new interactions between care providers and patients. This raises questions on how these relationships will take shape, whether valuable features of traditional relationships will get lost, whether medical training needs to be rethought or patient expectations redirected.

Yet another critical aspect related to promises to support patients' autonomy concerns the confidentiality and control of data. Data collected and processed by wearable sensors and apps may contain sensitive information that is made accessible to several actors, as once such data are obtained they can be reproduced and used endlessly. For example, data may be analysed by the manufacturers for improving the app performance or sold to third parties for research or marketing. Users of such wearables and apps often have limited control over who has access to their data behind the scenes. Third parties' access to health-related data can be harmful for app users who could, for example, be profiled by marketing agencies and receive targeted unwanted or upsetting advertisements, or incur in discriminatory policies by insurance companies or employers. Although safeguards are in place and users have the right to know what data will be collected, how these will be processed and to whom these will be distributed, this appear to be problematic and complicated in practice in the age of increasing data collection and big data analytics iii. Just to mention two issues: first, in a context wherein credit card purchases reveal individuals' lifestyle choices (eg, eating or working out habits) and enable correlations with health conditions through linkages with medical or health data (collected via apps, for example), the distinction between sensitive and non-sensitive data is ambiguous, and the definition of health-related data becomes too broad to be meaningful. Second, traditional safeguards in the clinical context, like practices of informed consent, are inapplicable in a consumer-focused domain where the mediation of healthcare professionals and researchers is shrinking. In an age of ambiguity between commercial and medical domain, confidentiality of health data is constantly challenged, and there is a need to discuss the moral basis of governance models that foster autonomous choice and encourage mHealth users to make an informed decision and control which data remain protected. iv

### Deontological and utilitarian ethics: a brief introduction in the context of disorders of consciousness [^966dc749]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this paper are to discuss three different ethical frameworks; to briefly consider some of the philosophical positions concerning the nature of personhood. Clear consideration of these issues demonstrates the complexity of decision making in persisting disorders of consciousness.

Method

Three different ethical frameworks, Kantian deontology, act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism, are described and three different accounts of personhood are presented and analysed.

Results

These result in very different approaches to the management of patients in permanent vegetative states (PVSs), making it possible to argue for withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration in all cases, considering the issues on a case by case basis or continuing to treat all patients whatever their wishes.

Conclusions

These results explain why doctors often have different views on how to treat patients in PVS, particularly with regard to the withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration. Understanding such issues may help clinicians articulate more clearly the reasons for their intuitions surrounding the management of patients in PVSs. Implications for Rehabilitation Patients with persisting disorders of consciousness pose significant dilemmas for clinicians and family members. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory, that is, it is concerned with the outcome of our actions to determine their morality. It is the concept that the right action is the one that will result in "the greatest amount of good for the greatest number". Deontological ethics suggests that there are certain sorts of acts that are wrong in themselves independent of the result of such actions. Personhood can be approached from a variety of perspectives including biological, relational, religious and psychological. Understanding different ethical frameworks, and the nature of personhood, may help clinicians articulate more clearly the reasons for their intuitions.

### Should junior doctors strike? [^e9916ebb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

An impasse in negotiations between the Department of Health (DoH) and the British Medical Association in November this year led to an overwhelming vote for industrial action (IA) by junior doctors. At the time of writing, a last minute concession by DoH led to a deferment of IA to allow further negotiations mediated by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. However, IA by junior doctors remains a possibility if these negotiations stall again. Would the proposed action be ethically justifiable? Furthermore, is IA by doctors ever ethically defendable? Building on previous work, we explore important ethical considerations for doctors considering IA. The primary moral objection to doctors striking is often claimed to be risk of harm to patients. Other common arguments against IA by doctors include breaching their vocational responsibilities and possible damage to their relationship with patients and the public in general. These positions are in turn countered by claims of a greater long-term good and the legal and moral rights of employees to strike. Absolute restrictions appear to be hard to justify in the modern context, as does an unrestricted right to IA. We review these arguments, find that some common moral objections to doctors striking may be less relevant to the current situation, that a stronger contemporary objection to IA might be from a position of social justice and suggest criteria for ethically permissible doctor IA.

### Judgement and the role of the metaphysics of values in medical ethics [^f6aa3d5c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

Despite its authors' intentions, the four principles approach to medical ethics can become crudely algorithmic in practice. The first section sets out the bare bones of the four principles approach drawing out those aspects of Beauchamp and Childress's Principles of biomedical ethics that encourage this misreading. The second section argues that if the emphasis on the guidance of moral judgement is augmented by a particularist account of what disciplines it, then the danger can be reduced. In the third section, I consider how much the resultant picture diverges from Beauchamp and Childress's actual position.

### Institutionalising global health: a call for ethical reflection [^efd4226f]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

As students sense the boldness of the moral claims at the heart of global health, we also ask them to consider whether those claims might simply be too demanding. We ask them to examine the narrow range of intrinsic psychological traits that plausibly make up our cognitive moral architecture, and to reflect on circumstances that can activate instincts to prioritise loyalty and authority over fairness and harm. Together, we consider how stress on our own sense of safety (eg, a pandemic) predictably pushes us back down to the base of Maslow's pyramid and sends us retreating into survivalist mode. We offer to our students that it may not be enough to rail against powerful and impersonal neoliberal and corporate interests. Rather, each one of us would first do well to ask and answer disquieting questions of ourselves.

Such an intrapersonal exploration allows our students to consider whether the fashionable, cosmopolitan and humanitarian concerns for the world's "worst off" are actually privileges afforded mostly to those who live in relative security. Many students are wary to accept the fragility of our capacity for generosity towards others, but we use the course as a deliberate opportunity to mindfully dwell on this reality. That the moral basis for global health action plausibly remains both a psychological contest within any individual and a matter of deep conceptual debate between groups may help to explain why strident demand for radical structural reforms have failed to date. We encourage students to see that very few of us can live our lives to a moral maximum, and that we have no choice but to work within the "grain of our nature". This reality does not make us hypocrites.

### Value of choice [^a46af2af]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Accounts of the value of patient choice in contemporary medical ethics typically focus on the act of choosing. Being the one to choose, it is argued, can be valuable either because it enables one to bring about desired outcomes, or because it is a way of enacting one's autonomy. This paper argues that all such accounts miss something important. In some circumstances, it is having the opportunity to choose, not the act of choosing, that is valuable. That is because in many situations whether one has, or is denied, that opportunity conveys how one is seen. In particular, it conveys whether or not one is seen as an equal and competent member of society. Adequately recognising this fact has implications for what healthcare professionals should do, ones that require a move away from the current focus on autonomy. The paper draws out these implications by focusing on patients who may struggle to be recognised as competent and equal members of society, and whose autonomy may thus itself sometimes be in question.

### Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence [^0b91a66f]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

We can never achieve a complete understanding of how any person would reach a conclusion, nor can we even know all the information a person would use and what importance he would give to each item. Nonetheless, it seems likely that most people will have a general disposition towards a certain style for making decisions and rely on a certain small set of important values or attitudes. Furthermore, to a variable extent, most people will also be influenced by their family and by general social attitudes and values.

If the paragraph above is accepted, then we should accept that, even with incomplete information, we should be able to approximate the relatively few factors a person would rely on, and their general disposition when making decisions. Furthermore, we should acknowledge families' and friends' views and applicable cultural views as relevant, within limits derived from the patient (e.g. taking note of whether the individual has broken with their family's religious or cultural traditions and followed a different path). Among the broader cultural influences to be considered are such matters as respect of the individual, maintaining dignity and consideration of their life's narrative– what sort of life did the person live and how would that influence any decision when considering the potential outcomes.

In conclusion, the best interests approach is an exercise in being as person-centred as possible with all the uncertainties and difficulties that implies. The holistic and person-centred approach was succinctly set out by Mr Justice Charles, who said (para 57) that a best interests test 'requires the decision maker to perform a weighing or balancing exercise between a range of divergent and competing factors' and (para 58) that the decision is influenced by 'the force, clarity or certainty of conclusions' and that 'competing factors will affect the weight to be given to them and that the weighing exercise is not a linear or binary exercise'. Other examples from court judgements can be found on pages 63–64 of recent guidance concerning application of the process to decisions about life-sustaining treatment.

### On the ethics of algorithmic decision-making in healthcare [^beb3f623]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

For one, deferring to the algorithm provides her with a normative justification for her medical decision. Then again, if she sticks to her initial proposition — and her diagnosis turns out to be wrong — she might be conceived as acting irresponsibly as she ignored the evidence provided by the algorithm. Things might aggravate once we consider that many medical decisions are being made under imperfect conditions, such as time constraints obstructing a careful re-assessment of the evidence available. A further side effect could be that the clinician might be biased towards interpreting the evidence in a way confirming the algorithm's diagnosis. Thus, the interplay of machine learning algorithms and clinicians potentially risks the fostering of epistemic vices such as dogmatism or gullibility. To sum things up, instead of enhancing their decision-making capabilities, the deployment of machine learning algorithms may impose mechanisms of 'defensive medicine' among clinicians.

However, there is one caveat. It needs to be pointed out that the opacity of machine learning algorithms is a well-established problem within the machine learning community. Currently, research groups from the tech giants and the academic sector alike are working on solutions to make machine learning algorithms explainable. Thus, it might be the case that some of the problems discussed above will need to be revised in the foreseeable future. Then again, some more fundamental questions with respect to explainable machine learning are likely to remain. First, explainable to whom? To a data scientist, the clinician or the patient? In each case, relevant explanation requires some trade-offs. Either the bar might be set too high for some stakeholders or the explanation might become too simplified, omitting meaningful information.

This also leads us to problems of patient autonomy. In a recent article, McDougall has argued that involving artificial intelligence in treatment decisions risks reintroducing a paternalistic model of medical decision-making — in the guise of a 'computer knows best' — attitude. According to her line of reasoning, algorithms enforce such a paternalistic model by dictating the values, by virtue different treatment options are being ranked. For instance, most algorithms will rank treatment decisions based on which treatment maximises the lifespan of a patient the most. However, a patient might prefer a treatment which minimises her suffering instead. Thus, the involvement of artificial intelligence potentially undermines a shared decision-making between the clinician and the patient, posing a threat to the autonomy and dignity of the patient.

### The right not to know: non-disclosure of primary genetic test results and genetic counselors' response [^054c5156]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Medium credibility.

As part of clinical genetic counseling practice, patients may request that their primary genetic test results be disclosed to someone else, such as a relative or referring provider, or request that results be disclosed to no one (non-disclosure). In making these requests, patients employ the ethical principle of the "right not to know", which argues that autonomous individuals can choose not to know relevant health information. Although the right not to know has been well-studied in medicine in general, and in the return of genomic secondary findings, we are not aware of other studies that have explored the return of primary genetic test results when patients request non-disclosure or disclosure to another individual. This study aimed to describe common clinical scenarios in which these requests occur, how genetic counselors respond, and what ethical considerations they employ in their decision-making process. We recruited participants from the National Society of Genetic Counselors' (NSGC) "Student Research Surveys and Reminders" listserv and conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 genetic counselors in the United States who described genetic counseling cases where this occurred. Interviews were transcribed and coded inductively, and themes were identified. Case details varied, but in our study data the requests for non-disclosure were most commonly made by patients with poor, often oncologic, prognoses who requested their test results be disclosed to a family member instead of themselves. Genetic counselors considered similar factors in deciding how to respond to these requests: patient autonomy, medical actionability of results for the patient and family, the relationship between the patient and the person to whom results might be disclosed, and legal or practical concerns. Genetic counselors often made decisions on a case-by-case basis, depending on how relevant each of these factors were. This study adds to the growing body of literature regarding patients' "right not to know" and will hopefully provide guidance for genetic counselors who experience this situation in clinical practice.

### Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence [^f81d4e00]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

The substituted interests approach, does not require family and friends to express an opinion about the decision a person would have made. Instead they are asked to explain what factors would have been used by the patient (their interests) and how the patient would have arrived at a final decision, for example, by consulting family members. Thus, once this information is available, the clinicians together with family and friends consider the clinical facts and use the factors and methods the patient would have used to reach a decision.

In order to remove the uncertainties associated with a person-centred approach, some people suggest that decisions should be based on criteria and weights derived from socially agreed constructs such as maintaining dignity, minimizing suffering, and prolonging life. There are two difficulties with this approach. What is the appropriate society to consult: friends, family and acquaintances; religious associates; people in some limited locality, people from the same ethnic group, the whole nation? Second, how is the view of the society ascertained and melded into one, and how often should that be done? It is not a practical proposition.

Thus, while there is no completely coherent, philosophically and logically defensible system that can cover every eventuality, the broad best interests approach used within the MCA is often considered to be the most useful approach as it allows, in theory, for integration of both patient autonomy and likely wishes with aspects of substituted judgement and family interests. As Lady Hale wrote,

But the best interests test should also contain 'a strong element of "substituted judgment"', taking into account both the past and present wishes and feelings of patient as an individual, and also the factors which he would consider if able to do so. This might include 'altruistic sentiments and concern for others'.(para 24)

### Instrumental rationality and suicide in schizophrenia: a case for rational suicide? [^82f6e979]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that up to 7500 people develop schizophrenia each year in the UK. Schizophrenia has significant consequences, with 28% of the excess mortality in schizophrenia being attributed to suicide. Previous research suggests that suicide in schizophrenia may be more related to affective factors such as depression and hopelessness, rather than psychotic symptoms themselves. Considering suicide in schizophrenia within this framework enables us to develop a novel philosophical approach, in which suicide may not be related to loss of self-consciousness, thought processing dysfunctions or perception disturbances. The action of suicide may be due neither to persistent hallucinations nor other psychotic symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, but to other underexamined, perhaps rational reasons, such as extreme social isolation, severe depression or emotional withdrawal. This paper does not examine the moral character of suicide. Instead, it argues that we should conceive the action of suicide in schizophrenia as an act that is not necessarily irrational. People with schizophrenia might end their life based on reasons if suicide is the best means to achieve their ends. However, the paper does not support assisted suicide. It aims to provide a better understanding of the reasons why people take their own lives and suggests that understanding can inform effective interventions to reduce high rates of suicide.

### Adopting an ethical approach to migration health policy, practice and research [^86ae9b29]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Adopting an ethical approach to advancing migration health

Migration health is affected by decisions made at levels ranging from global to local, both within and beyond the health sector. These decisions impact issues such as healthcare seeking, entitlements, service delivery, policy making and knowledge production on migration health. It is key that ethical questions faced by decision makers are recognised and addressed in efforts to tackle the persisting challenges in migration health (exemplified in table 1).

Table 1
Ethical questions faced by decision makers on migration health

An ethical approach can provide methods to identify ethical issues, frameworks for systematising information and suggesting ethically acceptable solutions, and guidance on procedural concerns and legitimate decision making processe s. By unpacking dilemmas, conflicts of interests and values at stake, an ethical approach is relevant for all who make decisions about migration health policy and practice. In seeking transparent justification towards the best alternatives, ethics can assist in holding decision makers to account. Based on the ethical question that is at stake, the most relevant ethical guidance and tools should be used. Ongoing debates around the 'right' ethical approach demonstrate that decision makers should critically reflect on their choice of framework or method. For instance, principles used in clinical reasoning at a healthcare centremay differ from those emphasised by policy makers during a public health emergency. When facing real-life dilemmas on migration health decision makers should use various sources and frameworks.

In examining the dilemmas decision makers face on migration health (table 1), one may ask what the added value of an ethics approach is relative to the existing rights-based, public health and economic arguments. These approaches have different strengths and limitations; they put forward both intrinsic and instrumental arguments for mainstreaming migration health issues. Like human rights, ethics are concerned with dignity, equality and concern for vulnerable groups. Historically, human rights conventions have evolved as a framework for regulating the actions of governments, whereas ethics concerns 'specific actions, values, interests and relationships of individual health workers, researchers and organisations'. Human rights are formulated in broad, somewhat abstract terms, leaving open the precise way in which they should be implemented in the complex reality of practice 'on the ground'. An ethical approach, which explicitly recognises and discusses the values and norms at stake, equips its users with analytic tools and guidance on dealing with challenging dilemmas. Ethical and human rights approaches overlap in the sense that they both proceed from fundamental moral values, but they differ in the uses to which they are typically put.

### The transformation of (bio) ethics expertise in a world of ethical pluralism [^4bdbf8fb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Today, bioethics experts have an increasing role in public life. However, the question arises: what does bioethics expertise really mean? Can there be such a thing in our globalised world characterised by ethical pluralism? I will argue that bioethics as a discipline represents the transformation of ethics expertise from a hard to a soft form of it. Bioethics was born as a reaction to the growing awareness of ethical pluralism, and it denied the hard form of normative-prescriptive ethics expertise (the ability to determine what is the right course of action for others), particularly in its medical ethics form. In contrast, the traditional medical ethics model, and pre-modern societies in general, believed in hard normative ethics expertise. From this followed the characteristic paternalism of traditional medical practice: if physicians were experts in moral matters as well, if they knew what the right course of action to choose was, then they had a right to benevolently force this course of action on their patients. The remnants of this doctrine, although rarely stated explicitly, still can often be seen in clinical practice. The whole bioethics movement can be seen as a radical denial of the doctrine of physician's hard expertise in moral matters. Bioethics, however, represents a type of soft ethics expertise (mainly value sensitivity). Hence follows the seeming paradox of bioethics expertise: bioethics is both a denial of ethics expertise (in its hard form) as well as a type of (soft) ethics expertise.

### Ethics by opinion poll? The functions of attitudes research for normative deliberations in medical ethics [^3d340787]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Empirical studies on people's moral attitudes regarding ethically challenging topics contribute greatly to research in medical ethics. However, it is not always clear in which ways this research adds to medical ethics as a normative discipline. In this article, we aim to provide a systematic account of the different ways in which attitudinal research can be used for normative reflection. In the first part, we discuss whether ethical judgements can be based on empirical work alone and we develop a sceptical position regarding this point, taking into account theoretical, methodological and pragmatic considerations. As empirical data should not be taken as a direct source for normative justification, we then delineate different ways in which attitudes research can be combined with theoretical accounts of normative justification in the second part of the article. Firstly, the combination of attitudes research with normative-ethical theories is analysed with respect to three different aspects: (a) The extent of empirical data which is needed, (b) the question of which kind of data is required and (c) the ways in which the empirical data are processed within the framework of an ethical theory. Secondly, two further functions of attitudes research are displayed which lie outside the traditional focus of ethical theories: the exploratory function of detecting and characterising new ethical problems, and the field of 'moral pragmatics'. The article concludes with a methodological outlook and suggestions for the concrete practice of attitudinal research in medical ethics.

### Is there a right not to know one's sex? The ethics of' gender verification' in women's sports competition [^49b982f9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

The paper discusses the current medical practice of 'gender verification' in sports from an ethical point of view. It takes the recent public discussion about 800&emsp14; m runner Caster Semenya as a starting point. At the World Championships in Athletics 2009 in Berlin, Germany, Semenya was challenged by competitors as being a so called 'sex impostor'. A medical examination to verify her sex ensued. The author analyses whether athletes like Semenya could claim a right not to know that is generally acknowledged in human genetics and enforced by international and national genetic privacy laws. The relevance of this right for genetic diagnosis in sports is discussed. To this end, the interests of the athlete concerned and of third parties are balanced according to the expected benefits and harms. Harm is documented in a number of cases and includes unjustified disqualification, severe sex and gender identity crisis, demeaning reactions, social isolation, depression and suicide. Benefits are dubious as most cases of intersex are considered irrelevant for sports competition. It has to be concluded that the benefits to be gained from 'gender verification' in sports via genetic testing do not outweigh the grave individual disadvantages. The current practice of athletic associations to largely ignore the right of competitors not to know does not comply with prevailing ethical provisions on the protection of sensitive personal data. Therefore, genetic 'gender verification' in sports should be abolished.

### The limits of shared decision making [^4a859be1]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Absence of or insufficient evidence of benefit

Scientific evidence for or against a course of action is a key determinant of how clinicians frame decisions in discussions with patients, although the influence of peers and accepted norms are arguably just as important. In some situations, for a range of reasons, increased attention is frequently given to the absence of evidence of net benefit, especially when the evidence is of low quality or contradictory.

There are three common situations where this may be the case.

When there is no evidence

For many options there is little to no research available to allow comparison. However, it is not unusual for patients to have strong prior beliefs about the need for a specific treatment or a test. The clinician may need to become better informed, or may already be aware that insufficient evidence exists, or that there is likely harm, and that acquiescing risks the prospect of delaying effective treatment. Both these scenarios require skilful negotiation for either more time to search for information or to provide reasons why the request for the option may be declined, especially if the option likely brings harm or an unjustified use of resources. Such discussions are made more complex when patients are exposed to media that promote novel healthcare developments. Honesty and transparency can guide communication, however, a consensus is often difficult to achieve. This situation is often one where clinical equipoise does not exist, and therefore places limits on SDM.

Scientific evidence of inferiority

Clinicians may also be unwilling to consider SDM when evidence exists in favour of some options compared with others, or where situations have high stakes and the use of effective treatment is considered imperative or is widely viewed as a standard of care, even if individual patient preferences vary. Clinicians report feeling a moral and professional obligation to recommend superior versus inferior options in such situations. They may feel the need to follow clinical guidelines and harbour concerns that they will be viewed as either incompetent or negligent for not adhering to professionally held norms. There is evidence that the willingness of clinicians to practice SDM varies, especially in the face of strong clinical practice recommendations.

### Therapeutic privilege: between the ethics of lying and the practice of truth [^230b13f0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

The 'right to the truth' involves disclosing all the pertinent facts to a patient so that an informed decision can be made. However, this concept of a 'right to the truth' entails certain ambiguities, especially since it is difficult to apply the concept in medical practice based mainly on current evidence-based data that are probabilistic in nature. Furthermore, in some situations, the doctor is confronted with a moral dilemma, caught between the necessity to inform the patient (principle of autonomy) and the desire to ensure the patient's well-being by minimising suffering (principle of beneficence). To comply with the principle of beneficence as well as the principle of non-maleficence 'to do no harm', the doctor may then feel obliged to turn to 'therapeutic privilege', using lies or deception to preserve the patient's hope, and psychological and moral integrity, as well as his self-image and dignity. There is no easy answer to such a moral dilemma. This article will propose a process that can fit into reflective practice, allowing the doctor to decide if the use of therapeutic privilege is justified when he is faced with these kinds of conflicting circumstances. We will present the conflict arising in practice in the context of the various theoretical orientations in ethics, and then we will suggest an approach for a 'practice of truth'. Last, we will situate this reflective method in the broader clinical context of medical practice viewed as a dialogic process.

### Contractualist reasoning, HIV cure clinical trials, and the moral (ir) relevance of the risk / benefit ratio [^22f96871]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

A brief overview of the contractualist approach

Contractualism says that conduct wrongs another, or is impermissible, if its performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any principle, for the regulation of the type of conduct in question, that is justifiable to each person on grounds no one could reasonably reject. Whether a principle is justifiable to each person turns solely on comparing its implications for individuals to the implications for individuals of candidate alternative principles, as assessed from the various points of view of whose who stand to be affected by the proposed permission. Considerations of aggregate benefit or burden, or the value of states of affairs, have no role to play in assessing whether a principle is one no one can reasonably reject. If a principle is one no individual can reasonably reject, the strongest objection to it will not be as strong as the objections that can be pressed from other points of view against every plausible alternative. It is the principle whose implications are 'most acceptable to the person to whom it is least acceptable'.

### Recontact in clinical practice: a survey of clinical genetics services in the United Kingdom [^5e671ac6]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patients' preferences and professionals' responsibility

Our findings suggest tension between respecting patients' preferences to not be recontacted (i.e. their right not to know) and the responsibility or duty of care of health-care professionals toward patients and family members. Although very few clinical genetics services reported that they record patients' recontacting preferences systematically, in response to a hypothetical question many services responded that there were circumstances in which they would recontact patients and family members even if the patients had indicated they would not want them to do so. These circumstances were related to the emergence of new, clinically actionable information that could have an impact on the health management of the patient or family members. Respondents' views appear to be in line with the European Society of Human Genetics recommendations on the use of whole-genome sequencing in health care, particularly with the recommendation that "Patients' claims to a right not to know do not automatically over-ride professional responsibilities when the patient's own health or that of his or her close relatives are at stake" (p. 583).

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^1396acb6]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Legal concepts and processes — medical malpractice and informed consent — Medical malpractice law is based on concepts drawn from tort and contract law and is commonly understood as liabilities arising from the delivery of medical care, with causes of action that can be based on negligence, insufficient informed consent, intentional misconduct, breach of a contract, defamation, divulgence of confidential information, or failure to prevent foreseeable injuries to third parties. Medical negligence is the predominant theory of liability in medical malpractice actions, and negligence is defined as "the failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in a similar situation". To establish negligence, the plaintiff must prove all of the following elements: the existence of the physician's duty to the plaintiff, usually based on the existence of the physician–patient relationship; the applicable standard of care and its violation (ie, breach of the duty); damages (a compensable injury); and a legal causal connection between the violation of the standard of care and the injury. In a medical malpractice case, experts may be asked to provide an opinion about one or all of these elements, and it is important not to testify about all of these elements if they are not within the pediatrician's area of expertise. Besides negligence, a medical malpractice lawsuit also may include an allegation of insufficient informed consent; informed consent includes a discussion with a noncoerced patient or parent who has decision-making capacity, and the discussion should include the benefits versus the risks of proposed and alternative tests or treatments and the option of no treatment. In some jurisdictions, an informed consent claim is a derivative of a negligence claim, whereas in other jurisdictions the lack of informed consent is a claim discrete from medical malpractice, and inadequate informed consent may be the basis of a civil tort even if the care provided by the physician was consistent with the standard of care. When insufficient informed consent is an aspect of the case, the expert needs to be familiar with the standards of informed consent in the particular state involved, and there are 2 main standards of providing informed consent: the "reasonable-patient" standard and the "reasonable-physician" standard.

### Moral motivation regarding dementia risk testing among affected persons in Germany and Israel [^c3db2802]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

The emergence of non-genetic, predictive biomarker testing for late-onset dementia gives occasion to reflect on parallels to the debate on lay attitudes about genetic testing and for a more detailed understanding of 'personal utility'. Our study suggests not to overload the term 'personal utility' to make a claim against focusing only on clinical utility.

According to Bunnik et al', personal utility' signifies the extent to which a biomarker test has the potential to effect positive changes on a personal level in some other, medically irrelevant way. Clinical utility means 'the extent to which a biomarker test will affect clinical management and improve the individual's health' (p. 831). In the context of direct-to-customer genomic tests, Chung and Ngargue even for a very broad understanding of personal utility: if a consumer wants to be informed about her biological traits, these tests have personal utility for her because they satisfy her interest (ie, taking the tests) and her desire to know (ie, getting the results). The medical-ethical principle of beneficence, that it is to justify acts because they promote the physical or psychological well-being of a person, is accordingly linked to utility. The 'personal' part in utility, however, stresses subjective interpretations and can even go beyond clinical understanding of health-related well-being.

Overall, from our explorative findings we draw four lines of conclusion. First of all, we believe it is important not to narrow down the discussion to clinical versus personal utility in bioethics. Experts, who struggle to acknowledge the legitimacy of subjective interests due to paternalistic assumptions about what is good for the patient, should understand that there are various moral motivations that go beyond personal utility. Thus, motives that are gathered under the category of 'beneficence' refer well to the expectations to improve the physical or psychological well-being. Moreover, we identified several ideas of responsibility between individuals and the family that shape strongly the attitudes towards such testing beyond personal utility. The desire for self-determination to plan later life and to make informed decisions goes also beyond personal utility notions. Finally, the visions of a good life linked to personality have also important implications too.

### When four principles are too many: a commentary [^64335d6a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

This commentary briefly argues that the four prima facie principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice enable a clinician (and anybody else) to make ethical sense of the author's proposed reliance on professional guidance and rules, on law, on professional integrity and on best interests, and to subject them all to ethical analysis and criticism based on widely acceptable basic prima facie moral obligations; and also to confront new situations in the light of those acceptable principles.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^3669e2d5]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
The raw scores from a 0–100 cumulative questionnaire (on the ordinate) are given as a function of the "true" linear measure (on the abscissa) of the variable tackled. Suppose scores are the number of correct responses (or, interchangeably here, the percent of correct answers). The true measure is given in linear logit units from RA. The increase in scores is roughly proportional to the rise in measure only in the "central" portion of the S-shaped (here, logistic) function (heavily hatched area). At the extremes (here, the "ceiling" of the scale, not the "floor", is highlighted), the same increase of 10 score points corresponds to a much higher increase in true measure (lightly hatched area). The scale's capacity to discriminate across subjects is lower the more the scores approach the ceiling of the questionnaire (reprinted with permission from Linacre, Fig. 1 in Wright and Linacre).

### Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence [^89af26ef]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

For each decision, the factors that need to be considered include the following:

The person's beliefs, wishes, feelings, values and any other factors they would consider if they were able to do so.
Their current quality of life, best broken down into Personal experiences; pain, distress, pleasure and happiness Functional autonomy; the behaviours and goals within their capacity Social interaction; roles, availability of others to interact with Meaning in life; having future expectations and wishes.
Their potential future quality of life (as they would see it) judged on same features Including the effect of any possible change in placement.
The effect of any intervention, or stopping of any intervention, considered in probabilistic terms covering Risks, pain, time taken, distress etc, set against Effect on one or more aspects of quality of life, broken down as above Length of life.

In principle, each decision should be articulated as what the person would decide, were they able to, given the facts about their situation, prognosis and treatment considered at the meeting.

At the end of the meeting it is vital to:

State explicitly what has been decided, checking that all agree and understand If there was disagreement, then the reasons behind the decision must also be made explicit publicly.
Either, if there is agreement confirm: What actions will follow, including Who will undertake them, and when by When the next meeting will be specifying
Either a date, time and place,
Or an event that will precipitate a meeting
Or, in the case of disagreement, specify what the next steps will be, usually one or more of: Obtaining further information and/or a further opinion, and/or Involving a mediation expert, and/or Starting the process of involving the Court of Protection.
Confirm that a documented record will be written and distributed to all present, and agree who else will get a copy.

### Self-determination of people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities [^efdf11ae]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

PHILOSOPHICAL AND ETHICAL REASONING

Implicit in the aim of understanding and supporting a person towards self‐determination is a view that people with PIMD have moral values and should be treated as such, thus counteracting perspectives that these are people with lower moral worth. This might be grounded on human rights:

Although that approach towards broadening the idea of self‐determination poses significant risks, it follows from strict obligations to human rights.

One of the included articles, by Kittay, argues for the personhood of people with PIMD, stating that rationality as the ultimate human trait has failed, and that it is rather our relational coexistence that moral worth is grounded on. The literature argues that recognizing the human condition of dependency should not thereby dismiss moral value, but rather recognize that humans are interdependent and embodied. Relationships marked by such dependency are still embedded with reciprocity:

Inaaya is still a child, still a child, and as much a person as you and me… I look at how beautiful her eyes are, her eyelashes are, how her hands are, how she feels my arm or leans back on me – that's her way of giving, her way of reciprocating.

Following from this is a perspective that challenges knowledge as individualistic, instead viewing meaning as co‐constructed, through trusting relationshipsand a broad interpretation of communication.

… understanding about individuals' modes of communication and preferences concerning interaction can only be built over time, through sustained presence and participation in their lives.

Boahenpoints to the ethical value of highlighting the strengths and capabilities people with PIMD possess, a perspective sometimes missing when classifying such individuals in deficient terms. The two philosophical articles, suggest that essential assumptions about human dependency of people with PIMD are relevant to all people.

### A dualist analysis of abortion: personhood and the concept of self qua experiential subject [^105e81a3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

There is no issue more central to the abortion debate than the controversial issue of whether the fetus is a moral person. Abortion-rights opponents almost universally claim that abortion is murder and should be legally prohibited because the fetus is a moral person at the moment of conception. Abortion-rights proponents almost universally deny the crucial assumption that the fetus is a person; on their view, whatever moral disvalue abortion involves does not rise to the level of murder and hence does not rise to the level of something that should be legally prohibited. In this essay, I argue that, under dualist assumptions about the nature of mind, the fetus is not a person until brain activity has begun.(i) First, I argue it is a necessary condition for a thing to be a moral person that it is (or has) a self. Second, I argue it is a necessary condition for a fetus to be (or have) a self, under dualist assumptions, that there has been some electrical activity in the brain. I conclude that a dualist can take the position that abortion ought to be legally permitted at least until the beginning of brain activity in the fetus.iI make no attempt to determine what conditions are sufficient for moral personhood; for this reason, the relevant claim about personhood is purely negative.
