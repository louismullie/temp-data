## Question

Is there evidence for benefits of treating a 30 year old with statin therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is evidence for benefits of treating a 30-year-old with statin therapy, specifically for primary prevention, and in what situations this would be supported by guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline ASCVD risk in 30-year-olds and how 10-year versus lifetime risk frameworks change the calculus. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about statins in adults under 40 and whether any exceptions exist. Next, I will examine modeling and causal-benefit approaches that argue for earlier treatment in selected high-risk young adults. After that, I need to check the strength of direct evidence from randomized trials in this exact age group. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with attention to LDL-C thresholds, diabetes, and shared decision-making, while noting uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk landscape. Most 30-year-olds have very low 10-year ASCVD risk, often below 5%, which alone would not meet conventional thresholds used to trigger statin therapy in primary prevention, so short-term absolute benefit is small even though relative risk reductions with LDL-C lowering are consistent across ages [^11775BjY] [^117GV1Kw]. Hold on, I should verify the lifetime perspective: because atherosclerosis is cumulative, lifetime risk can be substantial even when 10-year risk is low, and lifetime risk tools like PREVENT now allow estimation beginning at age 30, which can surface high long-term risk profiles that 10-year calculators miss [^116SGy2D] [^11775BjY].

> Next, I should review guideline positions for adults under 40. The USPSTF does not recommend routine statin initiation for primary prevention in adults younger than 40, citing insufficient evidence for benefits and harms in this age group, and its B/C recommendations are confined to ages 40–75, which means a 30-year-old would not meet USPSTF criteria for statin therapy solely on 10-year risk [^1153NaTP] [^115RDxGq]. Wait, let me verify ACC/AHA guidance: the 2018/2019 ACC/AHA cholesterol and primary prevention guidelines emphasize lifestyle first for ages 20–39, with pharmacotherapy reserved for severe hypercholesterolemia or select high-risk conditions, and they explicitly note that evidence for statin benefit in 20–39 is limited, aligning with a conservative approach in this age band [^115iDaTQ] [^116TMavT] [^111CzrrQ].

> I will now examine the exceptions where statins are considered reasonable even in young adults. Severe primary hypercholesterolemia with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL is a clear indication for maximally tolerated statin therapy starting in young adulthood, given the lifetime burden of atherogenic lipoproteins and early atherosclerosis risk, and this applies down to age 20 in ACC/AHA guidance [^115BSQ1i] [^114RnktC]. But wait, what if the patient has diabetes? For ages 20–39 with long-standing diabetes or diabetes with major complications, it may be reasonable to discuss moderate-intensity statins, recognizing that ASCVD risk can reach intermediate levels by the 30s in this subgroup, though the evidence base is weaker than in older adults [^113u9zt6] [^114ntLnu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "average-risk" 30-year-olds. Modeling studies suggest that a long-term benefit approach can identify younger individuals with higher LDL-C and low 10-year risk who accrue substantial absolute risk reduction over 30 years, with estimated NNTs around 7 for a 30-year ARR threshold of 15%, which is compelling for lifetime prevention framing [^1175ya2m]. Let me consider causal-benefit models as well: incorporating LDL-C level and expected relative risk reduction per mmol/L LDL-C lowering can yield larger absolute benefit in younger adults with elevated LDL-C than in older adults with similar 10-year risk, supporting earlier initiation in selected profiles even when 10-year risk is low [^114jw5tv] [^115BsYsZ].

> I should double-check the direct trial evidence in this exact age group. There are no large randomized trials of statins for primary prevention specifically enrolling 30-year-olds; the USPSTF evidence base centers on adults 40–75, and contemporary syntheses flag the need for trials on efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40, which means recommendations for 30-year-olds rely on extrapolation, modeling, and pathophysiologic rationale rather than direct outcome trials [^1153NaTP] [^114qPs7j]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a trial in 30–39, but I should correct that: available RCTs in primary prevention largely enroll older adults, so the evidence gap remains for this exact cohort [^1153NaTP].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a 30-year-old, I need to ensure we start with aggressive lifestyle modification and comprehensive risk assessment, including lipid profile, blood pressure, diabetes screening, smoking, family history, and consideration of risk enhancers such as Lp(a) or inflammatory conditions, while also estimating lifetime risk using PREVENT to contextualize long-term benefit [^111CzrrQ] [^11775BjY]. I should confirm LDL-C thresholds: if LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL, initiate high-intensity statin regardless of calculated 10-year risk; if LDL-C is 160–189 mg/dL with risk enhancers or strong family history, consider moderate-intensity statin after shared decision-making; if LDL-C is < 160 mg/dL and no diabetes or major risk enhancers are present, prioritize lifestyle and reassess periodically, recognizing that very low 10-year risk yields small near-term absolute benefit [^115BSQ1i] [^115iDaTQ].

> I need to ensure we address diabetes specifically. For a 30-year-old with type 1 diabetes for ≥ 20 years or type 2 diabetes for ≥ 10 years, or with diabetic complications, it is reasonable to discuss moderate-intensity statin therapy even if 10-year risk is not high, given the accelerated atherosclerosis and potential for earlier benefit, while acknowledging the weaker direct evidence base in this exact age range [^113u9zt6] [^114ntLnu]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with ACC/AHA: yes, the guideline allows for individualized consideration in 20–39 with long-standing diabetes or end-organ involvement, reinforcing a case-by-case approach [^113u9zt6].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring considerations unique to decades-long therapy. Statins have a favorable safety profile in large meta-analyses, with no excess in cancer or nonvascular mortality and very low rates of serious muscle or hepatic adverse events, but long-term effects of multi-decade use from age 30 are not fully characterized, so I need to discuss uncertainties, reproductive plans, and adherence, and plan periodic lipid and liver enzyme monitoring if treatment is initiated [^117GV1Kw] [^114qPs7j]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse monitoring response: yes, repeat lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation and periodically thereafter is recommended to document expected LDL-C reduction and adherence [^115GmjJN].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance. For most 30-year-olds, the net clinical benefit of statins for primary prevention is uncertain over a short horizon, so lifestyle-first strategies and risk-enhanced reassessment over time are appropriate; however, for those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, long-standing or complicated diabetes, or high lifetime risk with elevated LDL-C and risk enhancers, a statin can be justified as a long-term investment in ASCVD prevention after shared decision-making that weighs potential lifetime absolute risk reduction against decades of therapy and current evidence gaps [^115iDaTQ] [^1175ya2m] [^114jw5tv]. I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary guidance emphasizing clinician–patient risk discussion and individualized decisions in younger adults, which it does [^111CzrrQ] [^116TMavT].

> Finally, I should note the research direction. There is a recognized need for randomized trials evaluating earlier initiation of statins in high-risk young adults, and emerging tools like PREVENT and causal-benefit modeling can help identify candidates, but until direct outcome data are available, decisions in 30-year-olds should remain conservative, exception-driven, and anchored in shared decision-making that incorporates lifetime risk, LDL-C severity, diabetes status, and patient preferences [^1153NaTP] [^11775BjY] [^114jw5tv].

In select 30-year-olds, statins are appropriate for **primary prevention** when LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL [^115BSQ1i] or when there is **long-standing diabetes** [^113u9zt6] or **familial hypercholesterolemia** [^114RnktC]. For others, use **lifetime risk** [^1118HMwh] and risk enhancers (e.g. high LDL-C, family history, elevated Lp[a]) [^115iDaTQ] to guide shared decision-making [^117C5V8q]. Statins lower LDL-C and **plaque progression** [^113wFdxn], with a favorable long-term benefit–risk profile, but evidence is limited for adults under 40 [^1153NaTP]; thus, prioritize lifestyle and consider statins for those with high lifetime risk or persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy [^116TMavT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provide **specific recommendations** for statin use in younger adults:

- **Severe hypercholesterolemia**: Adults aged 20–75 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [^115BSQ1i] should receive maximally tolerated statin therapy [^114RnktC].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Adults aged 20–39 years with long-standing diabetes (≥ 10 years) or additional risk factors (e.g. nephropathy, retinopathy) [^113u9zt6] may be considered for statin therapy after clinician–patient discussion [^116bmtUv].

- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: Young adults with FH or persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy may benefit from statin therapy [^115iDaTQ].

- **Lifetime risk assessment**: For adults aged 20–39 years, lifetime risk assessment [^1118HMwh] and risk enhancers (e.g. family history, elevated Lp[a]) [^115iDaTQ] should guide individualized decisions.

---

## Evidence supporting statin therapy in young adults

Although **direct randomized controlled trial (RCT) data** are limited for adults under 40, several lines of evidence support statin use in appropriately selected young adults:

- **Plaque stabilization and regression**: Statins reduce LDL-C and stabilize/regress atherosclerotic plaque [^113wFdxn], potentially preventing early cardiovascular events.

- **Long-term benefit**: Modeling studies suggest that initiating statins in young adults with elevated LDL-C significantly reduces lifetime cardiovascular risk [^114jw5tv].

- **Safety profile**: Statins have a favorable safety profile, with minimal long-term adverse effects reported in young adults [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

While statins are generally well tolerated, **potential risks and considerations** include:

- **Muscle-related symptoms**: Myalgias and rare cases of myopathy [^11486Fz4].

- **Liver enzyme elevations**: Rare, typically mild, and reversible [^114qPs7j].

- **Diabetes risk**: Slight increase in incident diabetes, particularly in individuals with predisposing factors [^notfound].

- **Long-term safety**: Limited long-term data in adults under 40 necessitate cautious, individualized decision-making [^1153NaTP].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting statin therapy in 30-year-olds

Based on current guidelines and available evidence, **statin therapy may be appropriate** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL | Strong recommendation for statin therapy [^115BSQ1i] |
| Familial hypercholesterolemia | Statin therapy recommended [^114RnktC] |
| Long-standing diabetes (≥ 10 years) or additional risk factors | Consider statin therapy after clinician–patient discussion [^113u9zt6] |
| Persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy | Consider statin therapy [^115iDaTQ] |
| High lifetime risk based on risk enhancers | Individualized decision after shared decision-making [^113wFdxn] |

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

Lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of cardiovascular risk reduction in young adults. Adjunctive therapies, such as **ezetimibe** or **PCSK9 inhibitors**, may be considered in cases of severe hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerance, though evidence in this age group is limited [^114BMqX1].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Statins can be appropriate for select 30-year-olds, particularly those with severe hypercholesterolemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, or long-standing diabetes. For other young adults, decisions should be individualized using **lifetime risk assessment** [^1118HMwh], risk enhancers, and shared decision-making [^117C5V8q]. Statins effectively lower LDL-C, stabilize/regress plaque [^113wFdxn], and reduce lifetime cardiovascular risk, with a favorable safety profile. However, given limited direct evidence in adults under 40, lifestyle modifications should be prioritized, and statin therapy considered for those with high lifetime risk or persistent LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL despite lifestyle interventions.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^117AG4xC]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In Europe alone, at least 85 million patients have cardiovascular disease (CVD), causing 3.9 million deaths each year. The majority of these patients is aged ≥ 65 years, a number expected to grow even further in our ageing Western society. Hence, the sum of older adults eligible for lipid-lowering drugs will increase. This has given rise to clinical dilemmas on whether, and how we should treat hypercholesterolaemia in older adults, such as in patients 1, 2 and 3 presented in figure 1. All three cases present patients frequently encountered in daily clinical practice. They raise questions about the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults with varying number of (cardiovascular) comorbidities and functional status. In this article we provide an overview of the current literature on lipid-lowering drugs in older adults and explain why heterogeneity of cardiovascular risk increases with age. We set out why and how estimated 10-year risk of CVD needs to be put into the perspective of a patient's estimated life expectancy when deciding on whether or not to prescribe lipid-lowering therapy. Finally, we call for a shift from a risk-based strategy using traditional 10-year risk estimation tools to a lifetime benefit-based strategy, and provide recommendations on how to implement this in daily clinical practice.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111XpJM9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia management — older patients (Chart 6) states that primary prevention strategies in patients 65–79 years of age should be managed in accordance with the NLA Recommendations for the Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia-Part 1, and that for patients age ≥ 65 to < 80 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, moderate or high intensity statin therapy should be considered after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio. For secondary prevention in patients ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon a provider-patient discussion of the risks and benefits of such therapy, consideration of drug-drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations, and patient preference. Risk calculators such as the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk calculator or the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator can be used in select older individuals with one additional risk factor to further assess risk, using the thresholds for high risk of ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event with the Pooled Cohort Equations, and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham risk calculator; however, these risk calculators have several limitations for use in older patients and may result in overestimation of lower risk older individuals. Older, primary prevention patients who are statin-eligible should undergo a patient-centered discussion with their provider about the risks and benefits of statin therapy, and if unable to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification, the provider should discuss the pros and cons of drug therapy and, if feasible, prescribe moderate intensity statin therapy, particularly when risk exceeds the high risk threshold. CAC scoring may be useful to further assess risk in older patients for whom questions remain about whether to prescribe drug therapy. If statin intolerance is an issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens or low dose statin combination therapy or non-statin monotherapy, with a goal of at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C.

### What do the statins tell us? [^116ionm7]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Until the recent introduction of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the potential effect of cholesterol lowering on the prevention of clinical manifestations of coronary disease was a matter of debate. In trials conducted before the introduction of statins, cholesterol levels were lowered, on average, by only approximately 10%, resulting in prevention of coronary events but with no effect on total mortality rates. However, statins have been able to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by a mean of roughly 28%, significantly decreasing both relative and absolute risk levels of coronary events and total mortality. These benefits have been demonstrated not only in middle-aged men but also in women and patients aged > 65 years. Aggressive cholesterol lowering has also been shown to yield larger decreases in the incidence of subsequent coronary events than angioplasty, and to reduce the occurrence of such events in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery, which raises the question of whether these procedures should be relegated to symptom relief, with cholesterol lowering as the primary means of coronary heart disease event prevention. Statins, therefore, have unequivocally shown the importance of cholesterol lowering in the prevention of morbidity and mortality due to coronary disease. Ongoing research will elucidate the role of statin therapy in the prevention of strokes and in the treatment of patients aged > 75 years, and future trials will be needed to evaluate the potential role of statins in primary prevention for younger populations who cannot control cholesterol with lifestyle changes.

High risk — conditions and risk scoring — lists high-risk conditions as diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 additional major ASCVD risk factors, CKD stage 3B or 4, LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL, or the presence of ≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; as an option for those with 2 major ASCVD risk factors, the clinician may wish to perform quantitative risk scoring to estimate 10-year or long-term or lifetime risk for an ASCVD or CHD event, using thresholds for high risk of ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event (ATP III Framingham), ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event (Pooled Cohort Equations), and ≥ 45% risk for CVD (Framingham long-term 30 year); it is noted that these thresholds are not intended to indicate "statin benefit groups" and that quantitative risk calculators vary in outcomes predicted, included risk factors, and prediction time frame (e.g., 5 years, 10 years, or long-term or lifetime).

Evidence from trials

Up until now, only one randomised clinical trial (RCT), the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial, was specifically designed to evaluate statins versus placebo in older patients with and without pre-existing CVD. Other evidence on the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults is based on (meta-analyses of) subgroups of older patients from large RCTs including adults aged < 80 years. The PROSPER trialincluded 5804 patients aged 70–82 with (high risk of) CVD. In older patients with CVD, pravastatin lowered the risk of cardiovascular events or death over a period of 3.2 years (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.93). However, in patients without pre-existing CVD, contrary to most other primary prevention trials with effect sizes of 25%–30%, the relative risk (RR) reduction was only 6% and did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.94; 0.77–1.15). This could be due to lack of power because the PROSPER trial was not designed to demonstrate a significant effect in each subgroup. Yet, this still leaves the effectiveness of statins in older adults without CVD unconfirmed. A recent meta-analysis of 28 randomised controlled trials including 14.483 patients > 75 years of age (mean (SD) age 78.8 (2.8) years) showed that in patients with pre-existing CVD the proportional reduction in cardiovascular events was similar among all age groups (p trend 0.2). The RR reduction on major vascular events for patients with CVD was 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98 in 4.9 years of time. In patients without pre-existing CVD, mainly using subgroup results of the PROSPER trial, a smaller proportional risk reduction was observed with increasing age (p trend 0.05). No significant benefit of statins was observed for patients aged > 75 years without CVD (RR 0.92; 0.73 to 1.16). This is in line with a previously published primary prevention meta-analysis. Although ambiguous, of all older adults without CVD, data seem to suggest only (very) high-risk patients (eg, with diabetes) benefit from statins in terms of preventing CVD. In conclusion, previously performed trials show that lipid-lowering therapy benefits older adults at high absolute risk of CVD, for example, those with preexisting CVD. However, these trials did not include adults aged > 80 years and most likely no frail older adults, suggesting that these results may not apply to a great deal of the (frail) older patients encountered in daily clinical practice. Also, RCTs were not powered in terms of outcomes which are important in the majority of older adults, such as quality of life and functional status. According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) placebo-controlled and pragmatic RCTs seem to be suitable to address these knowledge gaps, studying a full range of outcomes, such as quality of life, function and symptom burden related to statins. However, we foresee obstacles for conducting such a trial, as today most older adults already take lipid- lowering drugs, and the frailest patients are not able to participate in such trials. Perhaps only pragmatic deprescribing RCTs or analyses of electronic health records with details on incidence and severity of major side effects and drug interactions could determine benefits and harms of (de)prescribing therapy in these older adults. Pending results of such trials, other factors should be taken into account when treating hypercholesterolaemia in the oldest old and frail older adults.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]) — primary prevention recommendations state that in patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL or higher (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended; if such patients achieve less than a 50% reduction in LDL-C while receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and/or have an LDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L) ezetimibe therapy is reasonable; if baseline LDL-C is 190 mg/dL or higher (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) and less than a 50% reduction is achieved with fasting triglycerides 300 mg/dL or lower (≤ 3.4 mmol/L) while on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a bile acid sequestrant may be considered; in patients 30 to 75 years of age with heterozygous FH and an LDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L) while taking maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered; and in patients 40 to 75 years of age with a baseline LDL-C level of 220 mg/dL or higher (≥ 5.7 mmol/L) who achieve an on-treatment LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL or higher (≥ 3.4 mmol/L) while receiving maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered.

### Statin therapy is associated with lower mortality among patients with severe heart failure [^112osdWY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Experimental considerations suggest both potential harm and benefit from statin therapy in patients with severe heart failure. However, relations of statin therapy with clinical outcomes in severe heart failure are not well established. Using data from the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation (PRAISE) trial, we evaluated associations of statin therapy with total mortality among 1,153 patients with severe heart failure (ejection fraction < 30% and New York Heart Association class IIIB or IV symptoms) of ischemic and nonischemic etiologies. Statin therapy was administered to 134 patients (12%) during the study period. Over a 1.3-year mean follow-up, there were 413 deaths (29 deaths/100 person-years). Adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking, heart failure etiology, ejection fraction, and New York Heart Association class, statin therapy was associated with a 62% lower risk of death (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.65), or 1 fewer death/5 patients taking statin therapy for 1 year. This association was not greatly altered by additional adjustment for a variety of other patient characteristics, including serum cholesterol levels. After propensity score analyses, statin therapy was still associated with a 48% lower risk of death (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.89). Although this observational study does not prove causality, further investigation of potential benefits of statins in patients with severe heart failure appears warranted.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^113vETxB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### JCL roundtable: lipid-lowering drugs in those older than 75 years of age [^1177aGKU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Using drugs in the elderly requires some special considerations; however, there is no question that our older patients benefit tremendously from the use of agents that prevent and/or control many of the risk factors for vascular disease that are most prevalent in the latter years of life. Recently, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol elevations. For the first time, little specific guidance was given for the age group older than 75 years of age. The rationale given for this approach was primarily that the data from randomized trials comparing drug therapy to treatment with placebos were inadequate for such recommendations. There was also concern regarding safety in this group. This Roundtable will consider this lack of recommendations in a broader context than statin trials.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus, age 20 to 39 years — evidence on ASCVD rates and statin benefit is limited; rates are low in those < 30 years and may reach intermediate risk by 30 to 39 years, especially with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus or type 1 diabetes mellitus of > 20 years' duration. It may be reasonable to discuss initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years or with major complications, including nephropathy (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg albumin/mg creatinine) or an ABI of < 0.9.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115FFUSv]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rationale — primary prevention statins in adults with risk factors: In adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking), the USPSTF finds convincing evidence of benefit and concludes with moderate certainty that net benefit is at least moderate when the estimated 10-year CVD event risk is 10% or greater and at least small when risk is 7.5% to less than 10%. The USPSTF states that harms in adults 40 to 75 years are at most small and that evidence is inadequate for benefits and harms in adults 76 years or older; for the small-benefit group, it states the decision to initiate statin therapy should depend on individual patient preference. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

### Statins in the elderly: a patient-focused approach [^111WV3E3]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals age > 65 years represent the fastest-growing subpopulation in the United States. Although these individuals with the highest cardiovascular risk profile would be anticipated to be the most aggressively treated, paradoxically, treatment and baseline risk are inversely related. Presumably, the elderly population would benefit from high-intensity statin therapy; however, as per the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, given the scarcity of evidence in patients age > 75, there are only sufficient data from randomized controlled trials to support use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. Despite evidence demonstrating statins are beneficial in the elderly, the decision to initiate and sustain treatment should be a well-informed and collaborative decision. One must balance the benefits (secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular prevention, stroke reduction, decreased morbidity and mortality) with the potential risks to the elderly (altered metabolism, comorbidities, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, side effects, cognitive limitations, and cost).

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^116sNQu3]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Before this meta-analysis, the evidence available from randomised trials on the effects of statin therapy in older people had been summarised only in meta-analyses of aggregated data from published reports. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed for English-language publications published between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2017, using the search terms "statins OR HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors" and "Elderly OR Aged", and found 14 meta-analyses with conflicting assessments of efficacy among older people (generally defined as > 65 years). Because of a lack of access to the individual participant data, none of these previous meta-analyses were able to examine the effects of statins within particular older age groups (eg, > 75 years) in primary and secondary prevention. We previously reported meta-analyses of the effects of statins by age, but these analyses were restricted in scope and some large randomised trials that included older individuals have been reported since they were published.

Added value of this study

We analysed individual participant data from 27 randomised controlled trials (n = 174 149) and detailed summary data from one trial (n = 12 705). During 4.9 years of follow-up, major vascular events were significantly reduced by statin therapy among all age groups by about a fifth per 1.0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction, including among the 14 483 participants who were older than 75 years at randomisation. Older age groups were disproportionately represented in heart failure and dialysis trials (which did not show an overall benefit with statin therapy), and exclusion of those trials weakened an apparent trend with increasing age towards smaller relative risk reductions in vascular event and mortality outcomes. We found significant reductions in major coronary events in all age groups (including those older than 75 years at randomisation), but the trend towards smaller relative reductions with increasing age persisted, even after excluding heart failure and dialysis trials. However, as the absolute risk of these events was higher in older people, the absolute benefits were similar to, if not greater than, those at younger ages. We observed significant efficacy regardless of age among participants with previous vascular disease, whereas there was a weak trend towards smaller relative risk reductions with increasing age in the primary prevention setting (although there were too few such older participants for reliable assessment in that group alone). Despite previous concerns, we found no adverse effects on cancer or non-vascular mortality in any age group.

### Statin therapy for young adults: a long-term investment worth considering [^113wFdxn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) significantly decrease low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, resulting in stabilization, and in some cases regression, of atherosclerotic plaque with subsequent reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. To date, there remains a paucity of data to guide the use of statins in young adults (20–49 years old). We herein aim to summarize the potential benefits and risks for statin therapy in younger adults, outlining a possible approach to statin use in young adults. Early identification and treatment of young individuals at risk for ASCVD offers the potential to significantly reduce the lifetime risk of ASCVD. However, there is a paucity of data on the potential side effects of long-term statin use over many decades. Comprehensive risk assessment, including calculation of life-time ASCVD risk, as well as incorporating non-traditional risk factors including lipoprotein (a), strong family history of premature ASCVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, LDL-C level and presence of underlying systemic inflammatory disorders can be helpful in identifying young adults who stand to benefit the most from statin therapy. Selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment, as well as potentially polygenic risk scores, can be considered in situations where there remains uncertainty regarding risk assessment. Importantly, the decision for statin treatment should occur in the context of a patient centered shared decision-making process.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

Question 5 — adults older than 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) assesses expected net benefit of statin therapy as follows: In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, validated mortality indexes that include noncardiac conditions and functional status are recommended to help clinicians incorporate the patient's remaining life expectancy into decision making about statin therapy for ASCVD prevention (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, integrating screening for frailty, dementia, and functional impairment into decisions about initiating statin therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD can be useful (COR IIa, LOE B-NR).

Heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk and life expectancy

Older adults are likely to have multimorbidity, polypharmacy and functional impairments putting them at risk of frailty. This results in a heterogeneous population ranging from very fit patients with a long remaining life span to very frail older adults with a limited life expectancy (see online supplementary appendix 1 for more information on (assessing) frailty). With increasing chronological age, this difference in biological age becomes larger (figure 2). For every patient, potential benefit of lipid-lowering therapy depends on pre-treatment (ie, baseline) risk, the relative burden of treatable risk factors, for example, high blood pressure or cholesterol, and competing risks (ie, the risk of dying from other causes than CVD). Due to the large variety in cardiovascular risk factors, in older adults a much wider variety in baseline cardiovascular risk exists compared with younger adults. Differences in pre-treatment risk do not significantly influence the RR reduction established by lipid-lowering therapy, but pre-treatment cardiovascular risk does heavily influence the potential absolute risk reduction. For example, in two patients with the same estimated life expectancy, benefits of lipid-lowering therapy are greatest in the patient with the highest pre-treatment risk of CVD. However, it is important to realise that high pre-treatment risk of CVD does not necessarily mean a high lifetime risk of CVD. This can be explained by competing risks; older adults are likely to have one or more chronic diseases, which puts them at high risk of non-vascular death. Consequently, they may not live long enough to experience a (new) cardiovascular event, making their 10-year risk of CVD lower than their lifetime risk of CVD (ie, the time-until-benefit exceeds life expectancy). As with cardiovascular risk, a substantial heterogeneity in life expectancy exists in older adults. For example, an average 75-year-old male has a median estimated remaining life expectancy of approximately 8–9 years. On the other hand, a 75-year-old with multiple comorbidities belonging to the 'sickest' 25% of the population is estimated to live a maximum of 5 years. See online supplementary appendix 2 for more information on estimating life expectancy.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Incremental benefit and cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease [^115hha2z]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical trials found that high-dose statin therapy, compared with conventional-dose statin therapy, reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the actual benefit and cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy are unknown.

Methods and Results

We designed a Markov model to compare daily high-dose with conventional-dose statin therapy for hypothetical 60-year-old cohorts with ACS and stable CAD over patient lifetime. Pooled estimates for major clinical end points (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, rehospitalization, and revascularization) from relevant clinical trials were incorporated. Incremental benefit was quantified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Threshold analyses determined at what price difference high-dose statins would yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY gained. In ACS patients, a high-dose versus conventional-dose statin strategy resulted in a gain of 0.35 QALYs. In threshold analyses, a high-dose statin strategy consistently yielded incremental cost-effective ratios below $30,000 per QALY even under conservative model assumptions. In stable CAD patients, a high-dose statin strategy yielded a gain of only 0.10 QALYs and was sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy. The daily cost difference between a high- and conventional-dose statin would need to be < $1.70, $2.65, and $3.55 to yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY.

Conclusions

High-dose statin therapy is potentially highly effective and cost-effective in patients with ACS. In patients with stable CAD, however, the cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy is highly sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy and cost. Use of high-dose statins can be supported on health economic grounds in patients with ACS, but the case is less clear for patients with stable CAD.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115qCcBH]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for 1 of every 3 deaths among adults.

Objective

To update the 2008 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of dyslipidemia in adults 21 years and older; the benefits and harms of statin use in reducing CVD events and mortality in adults without a history of CVD events; whether the benefits of statin use vary by subgroup, clinical characteristics, or dosage; and the benefits of various treatment strategies in adults 40 years and older without a history of CVD events.

Conclusions and Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer low- to moderate-dose statins to adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10% (C recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older (I statement).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Benefit of intensive statin therapy in women: results from PROVE IT-TIMI 22 [^114fxGSz]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the known benefit of intensive statin therapy for reducing future cardiovascular events, its effectiveness in women has been questioned by some.

Methods and Results

In the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial, 911 (21.9%) women and 3251 (78.1%) men were randomized to intensive statin (atorvastatin 80 mg) versus standard therapy (pravastatin 40 mg) therapy for a median duration of 2.1 years. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina; revascularization (occurring after 30 days); or stroke. Safety end points included elevations in liver function tests, creatine kinase, and myalgias/myositis. Women had a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 42.8% from baseline at 30 days (to a median of 60 mg/dL) in the intensive therapy arm, with 88.8% reaching the LDL goal of < 100 mg/dL and 65.0% of < 70 mg/dL, compared with a 16.8% reduction in LDL (to a median of 88 mg/dL) in the standard therapy arm. Women receiving intensive statin therapy had a significant 25% relative reduction over standard dose (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.99; P = 0.04) for the primary composite end point compared with a 14% reduction for men (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.04; P-interaction, 0.38). No differences were observed between sexes for safety (all P-interaction ≥ 0.11).

Conclusions

This trial provides evidence that both women and men derived benefit from intensive statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome, and thus, sex should not be a factor in determining who should be treated with intensive statin therapy.

### Lipid-lowering therapy with statins in high-risk elderly patients: the treatment-risk paradox [^114jzuve]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The benefits of cardiovascular therapies such as statins for secondary prevention have been well documented, although they may not be optimally used in patients most likely to benefit. Ideally, aggressiveness in the use of these beneficial therapies should correlate with baseline cardiovascular risk.

Objective

To examine the association between physicians' treatment aggressiveness and baseline cardiovascular risk.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study incorporating the use of multiple linked health care administrative databases covering more than 1.4 million elderly residents of Ontario. We included 396,077 patients aged 66 years or older who had a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes while undergoing medical treatment and who were alive on April 1, 1998. Baseline cardiovascular risk was derived using a risk-adjustment index in which we modeled probability of death after 3 years of follow-up.

Main Outcome Measure

Likelihood of statin use, stratified by baseline cardiovascular risk, after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and rural or urban residence.

Results

Only 75,617 patients (19.1%) in this secondary prevention cohort were prescribed statins. In patients 66 to 74 years old, the adjusted probabilities of statin prescription were 37.7%, 26.7%, and 23.4% in the categories of low, intermediate, and high baseline risk, respectively. The likelihood of statin prescription was 6.4% lower (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.93–0.95) for each year of increase in age and each 1% increase in predicted 3-year mortality risk. The influence of age also interacted synergistically with baseline risk on the prescription of statins (P < .001).

Conclusions

We found that prescription of statins diminished progressively as baseline cardiovascular risk and future probability of death increased. Since the benefits of a therapy are dependent on the baseline risk, the maximum benefits of statins may not be fully realized until implementation of therapy includes patients at highest risk.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^1135hSSu]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Rethinking 10-year risk of CVD

Table 1 gives an overview of the recommendations for managing hypercholesterolaemia in older adults for three major guidelines: the 2014 British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelineand the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline. They all recommend that hypercholesterolaemia treatment in older adults, in principle, should not differ from those in younger patients, and is based on estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk. As previously experienced, CVD is a major risk factor for the occurrence of new cardiovascular events, all patients with pre-existing CVD are at very high 10-year risk of CVD and therefore eligible for lipid-lowering drugs. For patients without CVD, guidelines recommend estimating 10-year risk with traditional risk tools, which state that the majority of older adults are at (very) high 10-year risk of CVD because of their age (and presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors). As a consequence, almost every older adult — with or without CVD — is eligible for use of a lipid-lowering drug. Traditional risk estimation tools do not adjust for competing risks, and consequently, tend to overestimate an older patient's actual 10-year risk of CVD. Also, as described above, a large number of older adults, especially those with multimorbidity or frailty, will not live as long as 10 years. On a group level, the beneficial effects of lipid-lowering drugs in terms of establishing a clinically relevant difference in preventing CVD occur approximately 2–3 years after initiating treatment. For some older patients, the time-until-benefit of lipid-lowering therapy therefore may exceed their life expectancy. Every guideline acknowledges that evidence on benefits and harms of lipid-lowering drugs in older patients, especially patients without CVD, is limited. They all mention that treatment decisions should be guided by clinical judgement, and recommend to include comorbidity, frailty, adverse effects, adherence and patient preference in the decision to treat or not. Compared to the 2014 NICE and the 2016 ESC guidelines, the 2018 AHA/ACC guideline clarifies in more detail what should be meant by this. Also, the latter guideline is the only guideline addressing when to consider deprescribing a lipid-lowering drug (although only for older patients without pre-existing CVD). An important shortcoming of all guidelines is that they are single-disease based, solely based on data from clinical trials in relatively young and fit adults and give advice on how to treat 'average' patients. Recently, a multidisciplinary addendum 'Cardiovascular Risk Management (CVRM) in (frail) older adults' was published in the Netherlands. Based on current, best-available evidence and expert opinion, it provides advice on starting, continuing or discontinuing lipid-lowering drugs in fit and frail older adults. The recommendations may be seen as progressive, because more attention is paid to frailty status, not initiating and deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy than in standard guidelines. Our recommendations presented below are based on this addendum.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^111TVtRA]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Individual randomised trials of statin therapy have previously reported significant cardiovascular risk reductions among participants older than 65 years but younger than 70 years at the time of randomisation (who were therefore aged > 70–75 years at the end of a median of 5 years of scheduled treatment). Meta-analyses among older people have consistently reported evidence for beneficial effects in secondary prevention, but the evidence has been less clear for primary prevention. Availability of individual participant data in the CTT Collaboration database has permitted more detailed assessment of the effects of statin therapy at different ages.

In our meta-analysis of data from 28 trials among 186 854 people (with 14 483 [8%] older than 75 years at randomisation), we found slightly smaller proportional risk reductions in major vascular events (p trend = 0.06) and vascular deaths (p trend = 0.004) with increasing age. The exclusion criteria for 24 trials incorporated at least one of the following: a history of heart failure, poor ejection fraction, poor prognosis (other than from atherosclerotic disease), or the requirement for renal dialysis. However, two trials exclusively enrolled patients with moderate to severe (New York Heart Association Class II–IV) heart failure, and two exclusively enrolled patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Statin therapy has not been found to reduce the risk of major vascular events or vascular deaths in either of these patient populations, and consequently is not recommended for such patients in the absence of other indications. Therefore, we did exploratory analyses that excluded these four trials, to assess their contribution to the observed trends towards smaller relative reductions with increasing age. Among people without heart or renal failure, we found little evidence of any diminution of benefit with increasing age on major vascular events (p trend = 0.3) or on vascular death (p trend = 0.2).

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for statins in primary prevention — The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% (C recommendation), and states that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older (I statement).

### Lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for older people in the United kingdom: a modelling study [^117JpD9S]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This assessment of the lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy in people ≥ 70 years old in the UK used contemporary patient data, a validated CVD microsimulation model and a meta-analysis of the effects of statin treatment across age categories. It concluded that lifetime statin treatment increased quality-of-life-adjusted survival in older men and women and, at UK cost of generic statins, was highly cost-effective for all, irrespective of their CVD history or LDL-C level. Higher intensity statin therapy was the strategy likely to bring the highest health benefits cost-effectively, although standard statin regimens would achieve most of these benefits. These findings remained robust in sensitivity analyses with smaller cardiovascular risk reductions with statin therapy, though smaller benefits were projected and standard statin therapy became the preferred option for older people with LDL-C levels < 3.4 mmol/L.

In this analysis, we used the overall relative risk reductions in cardiovascular events per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction with statin therapy given the similar relative risk reductions across age categories in the individual participant meta-analysis of statin trials. The meta-analysis, however, noted trends towards smaller proportional reductions in major coronary events and vascular deaths in older people. Data were particularly limited among participants > 75 years old without prior CVD, where there was no direct evidence for statistically significant cardiovascular risk reductions with statin therapy. In the present report, two scenario analyses assessed the sensitivity of findings to the size of statin effects using relative risk reductions in cardiovascular events in the meta-analysis (1) among participants > 75 years old, and (2) among participants > 75 years old without prior CVD at randomisation. In both scenarios, despite smaller net health benefits, statin therapy remained cost-effective although with larger uncertainty.

and 3 large cohort studies. 1, 2 The evidence review found that statin therapy use in patients for primary prevention was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and the composite cardiovascular outcome. 1, 2 Insufficient data were available for older adults, especially individuals older than 75 years. Importantly, the evidence review did not find any significant harm associated with statin therapy, suggesting a significant overall net benefit in primary prevention in appropriate groups of individuals. 1, 2. The evidence review2 led to 3 clinical recommendations1 that are consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. A B statement was made that clinicians initiate statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with at least 1 CVD risk factor and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk 10% or greater.

This is understandable, given the issues surrounding overestimation of ASCVD risk using PCE, as shown in some studies, and the dominant role that age plays in 10-year ASCVD risk estimation. 3 On the other hand, statin therapy has been shown to be efficacious at much lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels. For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from 5. 1% to
7. 6%. 4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk. 5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time.

With statin therapy, this strategy could still be considered by clinicians, given more than 40 years' worth of efficacy and safety data; excellent cost-effectiveness, even for individuals with 10-year ASCVD risk of at least 5%6; availability of statin therapy as a low-cost generic medication; and.

### Statin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults… [^1171occs]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer low- to moderate-dose statins to adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small.

Randomized clinical trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older without a history of heart attack or stroke. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.

The decision to initiate therapy in this population should reflect an assessment of patients' specific circumstances and their preference for a potential small benefit relative to the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a lifelong daily medication. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD. Available information about use of high-dose statins in a prevention population comes from the JUPITER trial.

### Benefit versus risk in statin treatment [^11486Fz4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The Statin Safety Assessment Conference of the National Lipid Association (NLA), reported in this supplement to The American Journal of Cardiology, provides a comprehensive evaluation of old and new experience on adverse events associated with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins. To place these in context, one can express both the risk of side effects and the benefits for cardiovascular disease in terms of events per person-year of statin treatment. The mortality risk from fatal rhabdomyolysis is approximately 0.3 per 100,000 person-years, and the risks of nonfatal rhabdomyolysis and of putative statin-attributable peripheral neuropathy are approximately 3 and 12 events, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. Reports of acute liver failure and acute or chronic kidney disease give lower rate estimates that, even when corrected for underreporting, are approximately equal to the background rates of these conditions in the general population, lending scant support for statin-attributable etiology. In contrast, the benefit of statin use is to avert several hundred deaths and several hundred cases each of heart and brain infarction per 100,000 person-years in appropriately treated high-risk patients. Although population estimates such as these are useful, they must be translated repeatedly to individual patient-provider encounters, where clinical skill and art must combine with scientific evidence. The continued publication of individual case reports and small randomized trials among groups of patients with potential side effects should be encouraged. Statins should not be used in situations where minimal benefit is expected, as safety data and risk-benefit analysis must be meshed with guidelines that help the clinician decide whom to treat and how aggressively to treat.

### Statin use and cardiovascular risk in young adults in the United States [^11775BjY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease pathogenesis begins in early adulthood, yet guidance on statin use for primary prevention in young adults is limited.

Methods

This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study of adults aged 20–39 years receiving primary care within 87 U.S. health systems (2022–2023). The study included patients with at least 1 low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measurement. The primary outcome was the measured the proportion of patients prescribed a statin within 1 month of LDL-C testing. The characteristics of those who were and were not prescribed statins were compared using standardized mean differences. Finally, the PREVENT 10- and 30-year ASCVD risk scores for the "average" patient (using the cohort mean values of risk score variables), a "lower-risk" patient, and a "higher-risk" patient were compared (using pooled values 1 SD below and above the mean, respectively). Analyses were conducted in 2024–2025.

Results

Statins were initiated in 3,309 of 775,162 patients. Those who received statins were more likely to be older, male, and have higher mean LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, HgA1c, and BMI (standardized mean differences > 0.10). PREVENT 10-year risk scores were similar or higher among those prescribed statins compared to those not prescribed statins for the average (0.75% vs 0.76%), lower-risk (0.19% vs 0.35%), and higher-risk (8.87% vs 4.55%) groups.

Conclusions

In a multicenter cohort, 0.43% of young adults were prescribed a statin within 1 month of initial LDL-C measurement. The average patient would not have qualified for statin therapy based on their PREVENT risk percentile. Future studies should evaluate the cost effectiveness of statins for primary prevention in patients aged 20 to 39 years.

### Patient characteristics and general practitioners' advice to stop statins in oldest-old patients: a survey study across 30 countries [^116FMVan]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cholesterol-lowering treatment with statins is an important part of cardiovascular risk management. Statins are frequently used in old age and continued to the end of life. Statins can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in old age. However, in case of life-limiting illness or multi-morbidity, the risk-to-benefit ratio of preventive statin treatment might favour stopping. Clarity and evidence about the point at which statin treatment is no longer beneficial is currently lacking.

General practitioners (GPs) are frequently confronted with the question 'is statin treatment still appropriate for this older patient'. The lack of information about the risk-to-benefit ratio of preventive treatment for older patients makes it challenging for GPs to advise on statin therapy. Guidelines generally do not include recommendations when to stop statin treatment (other than in the presence of adverse events). – Statins have been identified as in need of evidence-based deprescribing guidelines. Recent research on GP decision-making on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) suggests that, while some GPs follow guidelines regardless of patient age, other GPs take into consideration patient factors including comorbidities, frailty and estimated life expectancy. It is unclear how patient factors influence GPs' advice on when to stop statin treatment in older patients.

In the present multi-national study, we investigated how patient characteristics (history of CVD, statin-related side effects, frailty and short life expectancy) influence GPs' advice on stopping statins in patients over 80 years. We also investigated what other factors GPs consider relevant for stopping statin treatment.

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

### Evaluation of time to benefit of statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 50 to 75 years: a meta-analysis [^114MhwFc]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend targeting preventive interventions toward older adults whose life expectancy is greater than the intervention's time to benefit (TTB). The TTB for statin therapy is unknown.

Objective

To conduct a survival meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of statins to determine the TTB for prevention of a first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in adults aged 50 to 75 years.

Data Sources

Studies were identified from previously published systematic reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and US Preventive Services Task Force) and a search of MEDLINE and Google Scholar for subsequently published studies until February 1, 2020.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of statins for primary prevention focusing on older adults (mean age > 55 years).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently abstracted survival data for the control and intervention groups. Weibull survival curves were fit, and a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled absolute risk reductions (ARRs) between control and intervention groups each year. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were applied to determine time to ARR thresholds.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to ARR thresholds (0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for a first MACE, as defined by each trial. There were broad similarities in the definition of MACE across trials, with all trials including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality.

Results

Eight trials randomizing 65 383 adults (66.3% men) were identified. The mean age ranged from 55 to 69 years old and the mean length of follow-up ranged from 2 to 6 years. Only 1 of 8 studies showed that statins decreased all-cause mortality. The meta-analysis results suggested that 2.5 (95% CI, 1.7–3.4) years were needed to avoid 1 MACE for 100 patients treated with a statin. To prevent 1 MACE for 200 patients treated (ARR = 0.005), the TTB was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0–1.7) years, whereas the TTB to avoid 1 MACE for 500 patients treated (ARR = 0.002) was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.5–1.0) years.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that treating 100 adults (aged 50–75 years) without known cardiovascular disease with a statin for 2.5 years prevented 1 MACE in 1 adult. Statins may help to prevent a first MACE in adults aged 50 to 75 years old if they have a life expectancy of at least 2.5 years. There is no evidence of a mortality benefit.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^115LtqVY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

How can we stratify cardiovascular risk in diabetes?

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology approach

The 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines propose an approach based on the global risk estimation. The panel considers that patients with diabetes, either type 1 or 2, aged between 40 and 75 years, who have a baseline non-treated LDL-c between 70 and 189 mg/dL, should be stratified into a higher or a lower risk category to receive either high or moderate intensity treatment with statins. This categorization is based on the calculation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes.

The ACC/AHA calculator was developed to estimate the 10-year risk for the first ASCVD event (non-fatal myocardial infarction or CHD death, or fatal/non-fatal stroke) by entering definite risk factors. It uses a risk equation derived from a pool of 4 cohorts obtained from the American population. The 10-year risk is based on the first ASCVD event over a 10-year period among people previously free from ASCVD. The calculator should be used in non-Hispanic African Americans and in non-Hispanic whites in the range of 40–79 years of age. For patients with diabetes, the guidelines indicate intensive statin treatment for patients with an ASCVD risk above 7.5% in 10 years. If the risk is below this cut-off, moderate-intensity statin treatment is indicated.

The panel defines high-intensity treatment as the statin therapy able to reduce LDL-c in more than 50% from baseline. Moderate-intensity treatment is defined as the reduction of LDL-c in about 30 to < 50%. In patients aged less than 40 years, or above 75 years, the evidence of benefit is less clear. In these cases, when deciding to initiate or intensify statin therapy, the AHA/ACC panel consider reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD benefits, considering the preferences of the patient and the potential for adverse effects.

### A long-term benefit approach vs standard risk-based approaches for statin eligibility in primary prevention [^1175ya2m]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

A 10-year benefit-based approach to statin therapy in primary prevention includes younger individuals with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and prevents more cardiovascular events than a risk-based approach. However, a 10-year treatment duration likely underestimates the expected benefits of statins.

Objective

To model the impact of a 30-year benefit approach to select individuals for statin therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data set included samples of the US population from the 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014 data collection cycles. Individuals between 40 to 60 years old who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or LDL-C levels greater than 190 mg/dL and who were not taking statins were included. Data analysis took place from November 2017 to August 2018.

Exposures

We calculated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 10-year and 30-year absolute risk reduction (10-year ARR and 30-year ARR) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for each individual.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of individuals meeting eligibility for statins based on 10-year (atherosclerotic) cardiovascular disease risk, 10-year ARR, or 30-year ARR.

Results

A total of 1688 individuals were included, representing 56.6 million US individuals. Statin eligibility based on 7.5% CVR10 was 9.5%; based on 2.3% 10-year ARR, 13.0%, and based on 15% 30-year ARR, 17.5%. The 10-year risk, 10-year benefit, and 30-year benefit approaches all led to similar acceptable mean absolute risk reductions at 30 years, with the benefit-based approaches better able to avoid treatment of individuals with low expected benefit. Individuals who met statin eligibility based solely on the 30-year ARR threshold of 15% or greater were younger (mean age, 50 [95% CI, 48–52] years) and more likely to be women (43% [95% CI, 26%-59%]) than those recommended with a 10-year ARR threshold of 2.3% or greater (mean age, 56 [95% CI, 54–57] years; 22% [95% CI, 10%-34%] women). This group also had lower 10-year risk (mean risk, 4.7% [95% CI, 4.4%-5.1%]) and higher LDL-C levels (mean level, 149 mg/dL [95% CI, 142–155 mg/dL]) than those recommended with a 10-year ARR threshold of 2.3% or greater (mean risk, 9.3% [95% CI, 8.3%-10.2%]; mean LDL-C levels, 110 [103–118] mg/dL). Preventable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in 10 and 30 years were highest using the 30-year benefit approach (296 000 at 10 years and 2.03 million at 30 years) and lowest based on 10-year risk (204 000 at 10 years and 1.18 million at 30 years).

Conclusions and Relevance

A long-term benefit approach to statin eligibility identifies nearly 1 in 6 individuals as having a high degree of expected long-term benefit of statins, with a number needed to treat of less than 7. This approach identifies younger individuals with higher LDL-C levels who would not be currently recommended for treatment and may provide a more optimal approach for determining statin eligibility in primary prevention.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular… [^114qPs7j]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

High applicability to US primary care settings All studies enrolled participants with CVD risk factors Trials primarily enrolled White participants; mean age was 52 to 66 y in all trials except for 1 Seven trials found no clear differences in risk estimates associated with statin therapy vs placebo or no statin defined by demographic and clinical factors. Relative benefits were consistent in groups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics, although data for persons older than 75 years were sparse. Statin therapy was not significantly associated with increased risk of serious adverse events, myalgias, or elevated alanine aminotransferase level. Conclusions and Relevance In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and CVD events.

Benefits of statin therapy appear to be present across diverse demographic and clinical populations, with consistent relative benefits in groups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics. The recommendations were based on evidence that statins are associated with reduced risk of mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in persons at higher baseline risk. There was insufficient evidence to assess outcomes of statins in adults 76 years or older. 1 This evidence report was conducted to update the 2016 USPSTF review to inform the USPSTF for an updated recommendation statement on statins for primary prevention. 1, 2 This review focused on adults 40 years or older; the USPSTF addressed lipid screening in children and adolescents as a separate topic.
3. For harms, large cohort and case-control studies of statin use vs nonuse were also eligible. The selection of literature is summarized in Figure 2.

Two trials enrolled some patients with a history of clinical CVD. 11, 29 The duration of follow-up was 1 to 6 years in all trials except for 1 trial25 with 6-month follow-up. Three trials with planned 5-year follow-up were stopped after 2 to 3 years because of interim analyses indicating statin benefits27, 29 or low CVD event rates. 22.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^111o5DUt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The cholesterol guidelines specifically chose a ≥ 7.5% ASCVD risk over the next decade as the cutoff to define a statin benefit group even though its analysis of 3 large, solely primary prevention, randomized controlled trials showed benefit with statin therapy down to a 10‐year ASCVD risk of 5%. This was done purposefully to allow for some overestimation of risk because there has been a decline in stroke and CHD incidence during the past 2 decades. The risk estimator (Table 2) incorporates the same traditional elements of the Framingham Risk Score and uses the variables of race, age, total cholesterol level, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) level, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and smoking status to approximate the 10‐year and lifetime risks of an ASCVD event. Patients are then stratified to a low (< 5%) 10‐year risk category or to a higher level at which a detailed risk discussion about starting a statin should take place.

Table 2.
Comparison of the ASCVD Risk Estimator and Other Risk Assessment Tools

The new risk estimator incorporates several important changes. First, there is a mechanism for predicting lifetime risk, which, when elevated, warrants early aggressive lifestyle and risk factor modification, even when the 10‐year risk may not. Because chronological age remains the dominant risk factor for the development of ASCVD, an estimated lifetime risk can also be a helpful tool for communicating risk to younger patients who are not yet high risk simply due to their young age. Accumulation of the risk factors used in this tool adds synergistically to long‐term (30‐year) risk even when 10‐year risk is not particularly high. – Second, the revised ASCVD risk estimator incorporates the risk of stroke. Finally, it distinguishes between men and women and between non‐Hispanic white and non‐Hispanic black races.

### Is it time for a cardiovascular primary prevention trial in the elderly? [^117Ki32n]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Statins have been shown conclusively to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in subjects with clinical cardiovascular disease or diabetes aged 65 to 80 years of age. However, few data are available for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in those aged ≥ 70 years.

Summary Of Review

A moderate-dose statin was of little benefit in a population aged 70 to 82 years when given for 3 years in the setting of suboptimally treated blood pressure. More evidence supports the use of blood pressure-lowering medications, but few data are available regarding the appropriate blood pressure target and most effective agents in the elderly. Some evidence also suggests that the elderly could experience higher mortality with antihypertensive treatment. These findings, along with greater safety concerns and an increasing number of competing risks and medical conditions with advancing age, make it imperative to carefully evaluate the risk/benefit balance from treating hypercholesterolemia and hypertension in persons aged ≥ 70 years.

Conclusions

We propose a 5-year 2×2 factorial trial of primary prevention in the elderly that will (1) evaluate whether statin therapy will reduce the risk of cardiovascular events when added to the treatment of hypertension to achieve a blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg in most patients and (2) determine the most appropriate blood pressure regimen for the prevention of cardiovascular and renal events.

Statin therapy, in addition to blood pressure-lowering drugs and efforts to reduce cigarette smoking, was a key component of the preventive cardiology renaissance that achieved a dramatic reduction in ASCVD-related mortality from the 1950s to 2010. However, deaths attributable to ASCVD have increased by approximately 13% in recent years, which are in part driven by incomplete treatment of risk factor burden starting in youth. Statins are a cornerstone of preventive cardiology practice, not only due to their lipid-lowering properties, but also in part due to their ability to exert pleiotropic effects that promote atherosclerotic plaque stability which reduces the likelihood of atherothrombotic clinical events. While the benefit of statin therapy undoubtedly depends on the presence and degree of atherosclerotic plaque burden, a broader statin allocation strategy on a population-based level should be considered especially in younger communities that are disproportionately affected by ASCVD risk factors. Thus, the era of precision medicine must be balanced with a pragmatic, cost-effective approach that maximizes ASCVD prevention across the life course. Herein, we examine the pros of statin pharmacotherapy in primary prevention while examining over three decades worth of basic science, translational, and clinical research in the setting of clinical practice guidelines.

### Statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention… [^112AGZFQ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

First, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or higher based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations and at least 1 risk factor — dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and/or smoking — are likely to derive moderate benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin. Second, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to less than 10% and at least 1 risk factor are likely to experience small net benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin, and thus clinicians should engage patients in shared decision-making.

Third, the Task Force concludes that there is insufficient evidence to fully assess the net harms and benefits of initiating statins in adults 76 years and older, regardless of estimated 10-year CVD event risk or presence of risk factors. The details of the updated recommendations merit further consideration. 5 The systematic review6 that accompanies the 2022 USPSTF recommendations examined 22 randomized clinical trials that compared statin therapy vs placebo or no statin, with a mean follow-up duration of 3 years. The updated evidence synthesis6 found that statins yielded a slightly smaller, but still statistically significant, reduction in all-cause mortality, as well as for myocardial infarction and stroke.

The USPSTF recommendations should be considered in the context of a meta-analysis, published in 2010, 8 which included only trials that enrolled patients receiving high-risk primary prevention; this study showed no benefit on all-cause mortality with statins. The USPSTF concluded that, among 19 RCTs and 3 observational studies examined, 6 statins did not have any statistically significant harms, namely in terms of myalgias, incident diabetes, liver enzyme elevations, cancer, kidney effects, cognitive harms, or cataracts.

Research needs and gaps — Priority evidence gaps include determining the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for primary prevention in adults 76 years or older; establishing the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40 years and the effects of earlier vs delayed initiation in persons with an estimated high long-term (longer than 10 years, lifetime) risk of CVD; conducting trials that directly compare titration to target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy and higher- vs lower-intensity statins powered for clinical outcomes; definitively determining whether statin therapy is associated with increased risk of diabetes in primary prevention populations; and clarifying the role of patient preferences across the spectrum of CVD risk.

### Benefits and risks associated with statin therapy for primary prevention in old and very old adults: real-world evidence from a target trial emulation study [^117WLKi8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is little consensus on using statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and all-cause mortality in adults aged 75 years or older due to the underrepresentation of this population in randomized controlled trials.

Objective

To investigate the benefits and risks of using statins for primary prevention in old (aged 75 to 84 years) and very old (aged ≥ 85 years) adults.

Design

Sequential target trial emulation comparing matched cohorts initiating versus not initiating statin therapy.

Setting

Territory-wide public electronic medical records in Hong Kong.

Participants

Persons aged 75 years or older who met indications for statin initiation from January 2008 to December 2015 were included. Participants with preexisting diagnosed CVDs at baseline, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), were excluded from the analysis. Among 69981 eligible persons aged 75 to 84 years and 14555 persons aged 85 years or older, 41884 and 9457 had history of CHD equivalents (for example, diabetes) in the respective age groups.

Intervention

Initiation of statin therapy.

Measurements

Incidence of major CVDs (stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure), all-cause mortality, and major adverse events (myopathies and liver dysfunction).

Results

Of 42680 matched person-trials aged 75 to 84 years and 5390 matched person-trials aged 85 years or older (average follow-up, 5.3 years), 9676 and 1600 of them developed CVDs in each age group, respectively. Risk reduction for overall CVD incidence was found for initiating statin therapy in adults aged 75 to 84 years (5-year standardized risk reduction, 1.20% [95% CI, 0.57% to 1.82%] in the intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis; 5.00% [CI, 1.11% to 8.89%] in the per protocol [PP] analysis) and in those aged 85 years or older (ITT: 4.44% [CI, 1.40% to 7.48%]; PP: 12.50% [CI, 4.33% to 20.66%]). No significantly increased risks for myopathies and liver dysfunction were found in both age groups.

Limitation

Unmeasured confounders, such as lifestyle factors of diet and physical activity, may exist.

Conclusion

Reduction for CVDs after statin therapy were seen in patients aged 75 years or older without increasing risks for severe adverse effects. Of note, the benefits and safety of statin therapy were consistently found in adults aged 85 years or older.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, cardiovascular risk factors, and predicted risk in young adults [^116SGy2D]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle interventions, which are the first‐line intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk, are beneficial, but often insufficient. The limitation of lifestyle interventions is in part due to the significant burden that can be required to change factors such as diet and exercise, particularly among disadvantaged young adults who may have less financial resources and access to healthcare compared to older adults. Though there is apprehension about long‐term LLT use in young adults, there is robust evidence of the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability for long‐term statin use, as evidence by pediatric patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Ten‐year risk estimation may be of little use to young adults (i.e. < 40 years of age) who have a low likelihood of near‐term event, but high long‐term risk. However, the PREVENT calculator was released which allows for cardiovascular risk to be calculated for adults as young as 30 years of age. Further guidance is needed on how to integrate the 30‐year CVD risk horizons into clinical decisions to utilize pharmacotherapy in concert with non‐pharmacotherapy interventions, especially for younger adults. While the advent of the PREVENT equation may help to identify young adults at high risk for CVD and determine the absolute risk reduction through early intervention, there remains little guidance on how we consider incorporating such a tool in the management of atherogenic lipids in young adults. It is possible that relying exclusively on risk scores for guiding treatment in young adults, as we do for many older adults, may not be appropriate. For example, in the YOUNG‐MI registry, over 50% of adults with a myocardial infarction before the age of 50 would not have been recommended statin therapy based on current risk‐based thresholds. Future trials may help inform how to approach LLT among young adults. The Prevent Coronary Artery Disease (PRECAD), a trial designed to reduce LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL among young adults who maintain optimal blood pressure and glucose may provide insight into the impact of early LDL‐C reduction with pharmacotherapy and subclinical atherosclerosis. The results of PRECAD will hopefully offer data to further guide clinical recommendations for when, and if, pharmacotherapy may be beneficial for young adults. While we currently lack analogous clinic trial data for young adults to those for adults in mid‐ and late‐life, future work to understand the long‐term clinical implications of targeting LDL‐C among high‐risk young adults, such as in the PRECAD trial, would be logically cogent with how we handle other risk factors for CVD in younger adults and may complement a holistic approach to cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^117GV1Kw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Statin therapy has been shown to reduce major vascular events and vascular mortality in a wide range of individuals, but there is uncertainty about its efficacy and safety among older people. We undertook a meta-analysis of data from all large statin trials to compare the effects of statin therapy at different ages.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years. We analysed individual participant data from 22 trials (n = 134537) and detailed summary data from one trial (n = 12705) of statin therapy versus control, plus individual participant data from five trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin therapy (n = 39612). We subdivided participants into six age groups (55 years or younger, 56–60 years, 61–65 years, 66–70 years, 71–75 years, and older than 75 years). We estimated effects on major vascular events (ie, major coronary events, strokes, and coronary revascularisations), cause-specific mortality, and cancer incidence as the rate ratio (RR) per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We compared proportional risk reductions in different age subgroups by use of standard χ² tests for heterogeneity when there were two groups, or trend when there were more than two groups.

Findings

14483 (8%) of 186854 participants in the 28 trials were older than 75 years at randomisation, and the median follow-up duration was 4.9 years. Overall, statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen produced a 21% (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77–0.81) proportional reduction in major vascular events per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We observed a significant reduction in major vascular events in all age groups. Although proportional reductions in major vascular events diminished slightly with age, this trend was not statistically significant (p trend = 0.06). Overall, statin or more intensive therapy yielded a 24% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.73–0.79) proportional reduction in major coronary events per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, and with increasing age, we observed a trend towards smaller proportional risk reductions in major coronary events (p trend = 0.009). We observed a 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.73–0.78) proportional reduction in the risk of coronary revascularisation procedures with statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen per 1.0 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol, which did not differ significantly across age groups (p trend = 0.6). Similarly, the proportional reductions in stroke of any type (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80–0.89) did not differ significantly across age groups (p trend = 0.7). After exclusion of four trials which enrolled only patients with heart failure or undergoing renal dialysis (among whom statin therapy has not been shown to be effective), the trend to smaller proportional risk reductions with increasing age persisted for major coronary events (p trend = 0.01), and remained non-significant for major vascular events (p trend = 0.3). The proportional reduction in major vascular events was similar, irrespective of age, among patients with pre-existing vascular disease (p trend = 0.2), but appeared smaller among older than among younger individuals not known to have vascular disease (p trend = 0.05). We found a 12% (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85–0.91) proportional reduction in vascular mortality per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, with a trend towards smaller proportional reductions with older age (p trend = 0.004), but this trend did not persist after exclusion of the heart failure or dialysis trials (p trend = 0.2). Statin therapy had no effect at any age on non-vascular mortality, cancer death, or cancer incidence.

Interpretation

Statin therapy produces significant reductions in major vascular events irrespective of age, but there is less direct evidence of benefit among patients older than 75 years who do not already have evidence of occlusive vascular disease. This limitation is now being addressed by further trials.

### Statin use in patients with cancer: drug interaction and statin usage [^115SoLEq]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer has been well characterized. CVD and cancer have been associated with some common risk factors such as age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Ideal cardiovascular health, as defined by the American Heart Association, is inversely associated with incident cancer. Exogenous cholesterol has been found to accumulate in cancer tissue, with increased dietary cholesterol associated with incident cancer. Furthermore, cardiac remodeling may potentiate cancer progression, suggesting early diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease may improve cancer treatment outcomes.

Statins are commonly prescribed for primary and secondary prevention of CVD and major adverse cardiovascular events. The time to benefit for primary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events per 100 adults aged 50 to 75 years old is over 2 years. Previous studies have assessed the risks and benefits of discontinuing statin therapy in the setting of life-limiting disease. A study in patients with life expectancy of less than 1 year and Karnofsky Performance Status of < 80% found that patients who discontinued statin therapy had better quality of life and saved $716.46 per patient over 212.6 days. Nonetheless, statins are often prescribed and filled by patients with life-limiting illnesses. The recognition of a life-limiting illness does not necessarily influence reduction in statin use in the last 6 months of lifeand one study reported that 31% of patients with cancer filled a statin prescription within 30 days of death.

### Lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for older people in the United kingdom: a modelling study [^112o3NEv]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statins are widely available generically and a cornerstone in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. High-quality randomised evidence has shown that statins reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke by about one quarter for every 1 mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). More intensive statin regimens achieve larger reductions in LDL-C and prevent more atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. However, there is less definitive evidence for statin benefit among older patients without CVD historyand guidelines stop short of making specific recommendations on initiating statins for primary CVD prevention in older people. Despite the growing proportion of older people (people ≥ 70 years old make up about 30% of those over the age of 40 years in the UK) and the markedly higher cardiovascular risk with increasing age, lower statin use is reported.

Evidence for treatments' long-term effects and cost-effectiveness guides healthcare decisions in many countries and healthcare systems, including in the UK. Such evidence ensures that by implementing cost-effective treatments, healthcare systems efficiently use their resources to maximise population health. Previous evidence has indicated that statin therapy is likely to be cost-effective for older people, but the estimates were sensitive to further adverse effects of statins or lower statin effectiveness. A recent individual participant data meta-analysis of large statin trials strengthened the evidence for efficacy and safety of statins in older people. Therefore, we set out to reassess the lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy in people ≥ 70 years old in the contemporary UK population, in categories by prior CVD, sex and LDL-C level, using this evidenceand a new UK CVD microsimulation model.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113puV6h]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Primary prevention with statins in the Elderly [^112EBHgP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-income countries is mostly borne by the elderly. With increasing life expectancy, clear guidance on sensible use of statin therapy to prevent a first and potentially devastating ASCVD event is critically important to ensure a healthy aging population. Since 2013, 5 major North American and European guidelines on statin use in primary prevention of ASCVD have been released by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society. Guidance on using statin therapy in primary ASCVD prevention in the growing elderly population (> 65 years of age) differs markedly. The authors discuss the discrepant recommendations, place them into the context of available evidence, and identify circumstances in which uncertainty may hamper the appropriate use of statins in the elderly.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115DgTEM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Cholesterol reduction — Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline recommendations specify statin treatment thresholds, targets, and monitoring for adults at metabolic risk. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 5.9 mmol/L), we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), we recommend a 10-year risk for ASCVD should be calculated. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy either to achieve an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences, to achieve either an LDL-C goal < 130 mg/dL (< 3.4 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of 30% to 50%. In individuals with metabolic risk, without diabetes, on statin therapy, we suggest monitoring glycemia at least annually to detect new-onset diabetes mellitus. In individuals aged > 75 years without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend discussing the benefits of statin therapy with the patient based on expected benefits vs possible risks/side effects; decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis and statin therapy should be calibrated to reach the recommended LDL targets.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116WNmHi]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — Initial risk stratification required the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and the magnitude of benefit was considered proportional to estimated risk, such that a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% provides at least a small net benefit and 10% or greater provides at least a moderate net benefit; the recommendation concerns initiating statins, and in adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins; these recommendations do not pertain to adults with familial hypercholesterolemia or a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L).

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111q6i8P]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Endocrine Society 2019 guideline — primary prevention of ASCVD and T2D in patients at metabolic risk recommends high-intensity statin treatment for ages 40 to 75 with increased metabolic risk and LDL-C of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or greater to achieve a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, and also for ages 40 to 75 with increased metabolic risk who have a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% to either achieve an LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), or a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C; for increased metabolic risk with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 5.0% to 7.5%, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended to achieve an LDL-C goal of < 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) or a 30% to 50% reduction in LDL-C, and in individuals aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes, high-intensity statin treatment is recommended if the 10-year risk is ≥ 7.5%, with the guideline recommending discussion with the patient of the risks/benefits for statin therapy on an individualized basis in order to reach a decision about statin treatment.

### Determining when to add nonstatin therapy: a quantitative approach [^114hwzF6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Costs and uncertainty about the benefits of nonstatin therapies limit their use.

Objectives

The authors sought to identify patients who might benefit from the addition of a nonstatin to background statin therapy.

Methods

We performed systematic reviews of subgroup analyses from randomized trials and observational studies with statin-treated participants to determine estimated 10-year absolute risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and to define high-risk and very high-risk patients. We used the relative risk reductions for the addition of a nonstatin to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) used to determine the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 ASCVD event over 5 years for each patient group and to allow comparisons with 5-year cost analyses.

Results

The 10-year ASCVD risk is at least 30% (very high risk) for statin-treated participants with clinical ASCVD and comorbidities, and 20% to 29% (high risk) for those with ASCVD without comorbidities or who have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Adding ezetimibe to reduce low-density LDL-C by 20% would provide a 5-year NNT ≤ 50 for very high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dl or for high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dl, and an NNT ≤ 30 for very high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dl. Adding a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody to lower LDL-C by at least 50% would provide an NNT ≤ 50 for very high-risk and high-risk patients with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dl, and an NNT ≤ 30 for very high-risk and high-risk patients with an LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dl.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies to maximally tolerated statin therapy may be cost effective in very high-risk and high-risk patients, depending on baseline LDL-C levels.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Secondary prevention — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or causes statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels.

### Drug insight: statin use in the elderly [^113hGSUw]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

The elderly represent a notable proportion of patients who present with myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes. This subgroup of patients also experiences a higher incidence of adverse outcomes than younger age-groups, and, therefore, has more to gain from effective, evidence-based therapies. The efficacy of statins in secondary cardiovascular disease prevention is firmly established. The starting of therapy soon after an acute coronary event has been shown to provide added benefit. Uncertainties about the effectiveness of statins in the elderly, however, have resulted in their underuse in this population. In this review we evaluate the evidence for statin use in this important and increasingly large group of patients.

### The causal-benefit model to prevent cardiovascular events [^114jw5tv]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Accordingly, we calculated the 30-year event rates at successive decades, beginning with those aged 30 to 39 in groups with different levels of non-HDL-C. Two different models were used: Model A assumes a constant benefit over time of statin therapy of a 22% reduction in risk per mmol/L decrease in LDL-C, whereas Model B combines this estimate as suggested by Ference et alwith a 54% reduction in risk over 40 years based on Mendelian randomization. With either model, the benefit is greater, the earlier the therapy begins, whereas with the second model, the benefit of therapy almost doubles if begun at the earliest time period. These analyses demonstrate the utility of incorporating cause as well as risk in developing a model of cardiovascular prevention. In summary, a long-term causal-benefit model would offer the option of prevention to younger adults and women, a potential for care that is not possible with the conventional risk model.

Hypertension and benefits

The contrast between the hypertension and the lipid guidelines illustrates how guidelines are a product of the attitude to evidence as well as the evidence itself. Just as there has been controversy about the role of cholesterol as a risk factor for ASCVD, there has been certainty about the role of hypertension as a cause for ASCVD. As a result, except for extreme elevations of LDL-C, the decision to lower LDL-C has been based on a calculated probability of a clinical event, a calculation that incorporates all the known determinants of cardiovascular risk, whereas the decision to lower blood pressure is based just on blood pressure. Because a causal role for blood pressure was virtually unchallenged from the beginning, although the quality of the evidence was no different than for cholesterol, the necessity to treat elevated blood pressure has been virtually unchallenged from the beginning. This contrast in approaches has persisted notwithstanding the differences in the risks and benefits associated with therapy. Therapies that lower LDL-C and, even more so apoB, with the exception of patients with end-stage renal disease, and aortic stenosis, have been almost uniformly successful: the lower the apoB, the greater the reduction in risk. By contrast, while there is no doubt that lowering markedly elevated blood pressure is beneficial, there continues to be some uncertainty about how low the targets for therapy should be, primarily because there are significant risks with antihypertensive therapy.

### Enhancing the value of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by identifying patients most likely to benefit. A consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^114YGkYo]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk stratification — definitions and thresholds: Extremely high risk is labeled as "45% 10-y ASCVD risk", and statin-treated heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) with coronary artery calcium (CAC) > 100 Agatston units has about a 45% 10-year ASCVD risk despite statin therapy. Very-high-risk patients are specified as "30%–39% 10-year ASCVD risk on maximal statin therapy", including less-extensive clinical ASCVD (no polyvascular ASCVD, no clinical peripheral arterial disease, a prior ASCVD event ≥ 2 years prior, and no coronary artery bypass grafting) and adverse or poorly controlled cardiometabolic risk factors such as age ≥ 65 years, lipoprotein(a) ≥ 37 nmol/L, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 1–3 mg/L. The high-risk category is " < 30% 10-year ASCVD risk" and includes ASCVD patients with well-controlled risk factors (LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg, and C-reactive protein < 1 mg/dL) and primary prevention patients with HeFH or SH LDL-C ≥ 220 mg/dL with no clinical ASCVD or CAC < 100 Agatston units.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — implementation — advises to consider the patient's age and, for adults aged 40 to 75 years, determine whether the patient has a cardiovascular risk factor, estimate CVD risk, and in patients with a cardiovascular risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater, initiate a moderate-intensity statin after discussing the rationale and provided the patient agrees; in patients with a cardiovascular risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%, clinicians should selectively offer a statin, taking patient values and preferences into account; for adults 76 years or older, the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against starting a statin.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

### The causal-benefit model to prevent cardiovascular events [^115BsYsZ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The causal-benefit model of cardiovascular prevention

The causal-benefit model extends the risk model by including the benefit obtained by treatment of a causal factor — reduction of the levels in plasma of the atherogenic lipoproteins. Benefit is estimated by the ARR, a measure that combines an individual's ASCVD risk and their expected risk reduction from a treatment as mediated by their baseline cholesterol or apoB level. The absolute reduction in risk over 10 years (ARR 10) can be calculated for each individual based on their calculated 10-year risk and the reduction in risk with statin therapy that produces a 40% reduction in LDL-C, a value that approximates the average result in multiple large-scale statin trials. A threshold ARR 10 of 2.3% is the value, which would produce equivalent minimum benefit with statin therapy in individuals with a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5% over 10 years. Application of the causal-benefit model allows subjects with lower calculated risk but higher measured LDL-C to become eligible for statin preventive therapy.

The practical impact of applying a causal-benefit model as opposed to the conventional risk model is outlined in our Central Illustration. Patient A is a 65-year-old male with a calculated pooled cohorts equation 10-year risk of 8% and an LDL-C of 116 mg/dL. Patient A is above the 7.5% threshold at which preventive statin therapy is recommended. Patient B is younger, 45 years old and female. Based on her 10-year pooled cohorts equation calculated risk of 6.5%, she would not be eligible for statin preventive therapy. However, her LDL-C is 155 mg/dL. Based on the causal-benefit model, her ARR would be greater than his (2.3% vs 1.6%). Accordingly, her number-needed-to-treat would be 43.5, whereas his would be 62.5. Thus, the lower-risk patient in this example would get greater benefit from therapy than the higher-risk patient.

### Refining statin prescribing in lower-risk individuals: informing risk / benefit decisions [^1122Jvkr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, as well as those from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense and the Joint British Societies all recommended treating more people with statins than previous guidelines. In each guideline, the decision-making process began with an assessment of overall cardiovascular risk. Each group proposed updated treatment thresholds, and all of them lowered the threshold compared with earlier guidelines. Since release of these new guidelines in 2013 and 2014, additional evidence has emerged to suggest a rationale for extending statin consideration to an even larger proportion of asymptomatic adults-even those with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk below 7.5%. This review discusses new findings since 2013 and proposes strategies emanating from the current guidelines to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions about long-term statin use, especially pertinent to lower-risk patients.

### Primary prevention of coronary heart disease in the elderly [^111mUNpi]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review relevant literature supporting the use of antihypertensive agents, lipid-lowering agents (i.e., statins), and aspirin therapy for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in an elderly patient population (age ≥ 65 y).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1988-January 2003) was conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Primary and tertiary literature involving the uses of antihypertensives, statins, and aspirin therapy in the elderly were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Mortality due to CHD in the US population has decreased 40–50% over the last 30 years; however, CHD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly persons. As the population continues to age, the number of older adults eligible for primary prevention will rise. The American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines for the primary prevention of CHD were updated in 2002; however, they are based on findings from clinical trials that enrolled predominantly middle-aged white men. The recommendations for elderly individuals are predominantly extrapolated from subgroup analyses of randomized clinical trials or cohort studies. This literature suggests that elderly persons are candidates for primary prevention measures and experience reductions in coronary events when treated with appropriate therapies.

Conclusions

Data suggest that use of antihypertensives, statins, and aspirin therapy in the elderly appears effective to an extent similar to, and often greater than, that observed in younger patients. We believe these agents should be prescribed to all appropriate high-risk elderly patients. Ongoing and future studies will more clearly elucidate the benefits of primary prevention therapy, particularly in persons ≥ 75 years of age.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

2018 Cholesterol clinical practice guideline — young adults with hypercholesterolemia are addressed with specific thresholds and assessment guidance: statin therapy is recommended for young adults with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dl. In young adults with persistent, moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C 160–189 mg/dL), especially when risk-enhancing factors are present, clinical judgment would suggest that these high risk young adults will benefit from long-term statin therapy. For risk assessment in those without phenotypically severe hypercholesterolemia, the pooled cohort equations can be used to estimate lifetime risk starting at age 21 years. Evidence gaps are noted as no long-term RCTs with cholesterol-lowering drugs have been carried out in those 20 to 39 years age, and while coronary artery calcium scores have been suggested to identify candidates, absence of RCT data precludes guideline recommendations at this time.

### Patient characteristics and general practitioners' advice to stop statins in oldest-old patients: a survey study across 30 countries [^115yNqBA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context of the Results

When cases included short life expectancy (< 1 year), 9 out of 10 GPs advised stopping statin treatment. Our study confirms results from population-based studies showing that statin treatment is more likely to be discontinued in older people in the last year of life, independent of the need for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. The importance of considering stopping preventive medication in older people with short life expectancy is increasingly recognised. We found that statin-related life expectancy was the main reason for GPs advising stopping statin treatment in patients aged over 80 years, consistent across countries. This study adds to the ongoing discussion about appropriate prescribing in older patients at the end of life reported in qualitative studies. Results of a recent trial suggest that stopping statin treatment in patients with short life expectancy (mean age 74.1 (SD 11.6) years) might be safe and improve quality of life. Although short life expectancy was the strongest independent predicator of GP advice to stop statin treatment in all countries, the proportion of GPs advising stopping statin treatment varied across countries. There are several possible explanations for this variation. A previous study showed thathigh CVD burden and low life expectancy at age 60 influences GPs decision to start antihypertensive treatment. These country-specific health characteristics could play a role in the decision to advice to stop statin treatment as well. In addition, perceptions of the patient population about statin therapy across the countries could play a role; these data were however not available for all countries.

We also investigated the influence of CVD on GP advice to stop statins in patients aged over 80 years. In cases with statin-related side effects, when CVD was present, most GPs advised lowering the dose or switching the type of statin; but when CVD was absent most GPs advised stopping the statin (Table 3). This suggests that GPs believe statins have a lower risk-to-benefit ratio for primary prevention than secondary prevention in patients aged over 80 years. However, current guidelines recommend treating patients with the maximum tolerated dose or using a different type of statin, irrespective of primary or secondary prevention.

While myalgia may be the main reason for statin discontinuation from a patient perspective, only 11% of GPs in our study chose side effects as the most important reason for stopping statins. The association between statin use and myalgia is still debated.

Consistent with the international literature, we found that GPs were more likely to advise stopping statin treatment when frailty was present.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults aged 20–39 years or > 75 years with diabetes — statin initiation or continuation thresholds: Risk may reach intermediate-risk levels by 30–39 years of age, especially with longstanding type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes of ≥ 20 years duration, and for adults aged 20–39 years with long duration of diabetes, albuminuria, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m², retinopathy, neuropathy, or ankle brachial index < 0.9, it may be reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Among adults aged > 75 years with diabetes, a meta-analysis of JUPITER and HOPE-3 demonstrated similar benefits in ASCVD reduction among those aged ≥ 70 years vs < 70 years, with approximately 21% of included patients aged ≥ 75 years and having diabetes; the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline recommends that it is reasonable to continue moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after the age of 75 years if therapy is well-tolerated. The benefit of initiation of statin therapy in individuals aged > 75 years with recent or newly diagnosed diabetes is not well known, so it may be reasonable to have a clinician-patient discussion, and the decision to initiate nonstatin therapy in individuals aged > 75 years should be individualized based on factors such as expected longevity, frailty, polypharmacy, susceptibility to adverse effects of treatment, and goals of care.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Statin effects on LDL-C and events in older adults are summarized from observational and trial data: LDL-C response to low to moderate-intensity statins was slightly greater (2–5% depending on statin and dose) among adults without ASCVD older than 75 years compared to those aged ≤ 50, and differences with high-intensity therapy were minimal. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, major vascular event reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction showed adjusted HR 0.76, 0.73, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.77 across age groups with no differences by age. Among individuals without ASCVD up to age 75 in randomized statin trials, the average time to benefit was 2.5 years. Across 28 major statin trials (n = 186,854), only 8% were over age 75 and only 2% of primary prevention participants were over age 75.

### Comparison of recommended eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy based on the US preventive services task force recommendations vs the ACC / AHA guidelines [^115pJVLU]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are important differences among guideline recommendations for using statin therapy in primary prevention. New recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) emphasize therapy based on the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and a 10-year global CVD risk of 10% or greater.

Objective

To determine the difference in eligibility for primary prevention statin treatment among US adults, assuming full application of USPSTF recommendations compared with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2009–2014) were used to assess statin eligibility under the 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines among a nationally representative sample of 3416 US adults aged 40 to 75 years with fasting lipid data and triglyceride levels of 400 mg/dL or less, without prior CVD.

Exposures

The 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy.

Results

Among the US primary prevention population represented by 3416 individuals in NHANES, the median weighted age was 53 years (interquartile range, 46–61), and 53% (95% CI, 52%-55%) were women. Along with the 21.5% (95% CI, 19.3%-23.7%) of patients who reported currently taking lipid-lowering medication, full implementation of the USPSTF recommendations would be associated with initiation of statin therapy in an additional 15.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.5%) of patients, compared with an additional 24.3% (95% CI, 22.3%-26.3%) of patients who would be recommended for statin initiation under full implementation of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. Among the 8.9% of individuals in the primary prevention population who would be recommended for statins by ACC/AHA guidelines but not by USPSTF recommendations, 55% would be adults aged 40 to 59 years with a mean 30-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%, and 28% would have diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this sample of US adults from 2009–2014, adherence to the 2016 USPSTF recommendations for statin therapy, compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, could lead to a lower number of individuals recommended for primary prevention statin therapy, including many younger adults with high mean long-term CVD risk.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1176EN33]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Risk–benefit gradient and patient discussion — The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on their absolute risk of having a future CVD event, the higher a person's 10-year risk of a CVD event, the greater the chance of benefit from statin use, and thus the expected benefit of statin therapy for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater exceeds the expected benefit for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%; clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin therapy.

### Do statins reduce mortality in older people? Findings from a longitudinal study using primary care records [^111HNhR3]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed significant absolute and relative reductions in all-cause mortality associated with statins for primary and secondary prevention of CVD at all ages over 65 years, including those at age 75 or older, in routine clinical practice over 25 years. This supports the use of statins, where clinically indicated and after discussion of the potential risks and benefits with the patient, in those aged over 75 years.

2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline — The expert panel recommended a paradigm shift away from a treat-to-goal strategy to treatment intensity using fixed doses across four statin benefit groups, including ASCVD, diabetes mellitus (DM), LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or a calculated 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%. Statin doses to achieve LDL-C reductions of ≥ 50% for patients with either ASCVD or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or 30–49% for persons with DM or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%, were recommended. A repeat lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation of statin therapy was recommended as a Class IA recommendation (should be performed), with measurement every 3–12 months thereafter, and monitoring of lipid levels was established as a Class IA recommendation.

### Is aggressive lipid-lowering effective and safe in the older adult? [^114JC223]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

With improvements in diet and health care over the last several decades, the elderly have become the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Along with this progress, however, has come increasing morbidity, much of which is attributable to cardiovascular disease, and which is burdensome both to patients and to the health-care system. New medications, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have the potential to prevent or delay the progression of disease and vascular events. Large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials continue to show that elderly patients benefit from statin therapy and that aggressive therapy is generally very safe in this population; however, statins remain under-used in older individuals. This paper reviews the benefits of statin therapy in the elderly and discusses the reality versus the perception of risk, selection of appropriate patients, and ways in which any risks that may exist can be minimized further.

### The ACC / AHA 2013 guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: the good the bad and the uncertain: a comparison with ESC / EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias 2011 [^11179jnJ]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time in both Europe and the rest of the world, accounting for the greatest expenditure in most healthcare budgets. Achieving consistency of clinical care, incorporating new evidence and their synthesis into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline committees throughout the world. Any change in a set of guidelines therefore can have far reaching consequences, particularly if they appear to be at variance with the existing guidelines. The present article discusses the recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines 2013 on the control of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults. When compared with the ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification in 2011, the ACC/AHA guidelines of 2013 differ markedly. Specifically, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials only, which excludes a significant body of data and promotes essentially a statin centric approach only; (ii) the abolition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in favour of specific statin regimens that produce a 30–50% reduction in LDL-C we believe will confuse many physicians and miss the opportunity for medication adherence and patient engagement in self-management; (iii) the absence of target LDL-C levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute risk or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians to consider the addition of lipid modification treatments and individualize patient care; (iv) a reduction in the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in a greater number of patients being prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients with high life time risk, but will result in a very large number of older patients offered therapy; and (v) the mixed pool risk calculator used to asses CVD risk in the guidelines for primary prevention has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the opinion that the ESC/EAS guidelines from 2011 seem to be the most wide ranging, pragmatic and appropriate choice for European countries.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115RDxGq]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — statin primary prevention recommendations state that the USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater; the USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years with 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to less than 10%, noting that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater; and for adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality.

### Recommendations for statin management in primary prevention: disparities among international risk scores [^115UN3sE]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the consensus-driven process of algorithmic risk stratification as the first step to determine statin allocation in primary prevention in many prominent lipid guidelines leads to marked heterogeneity on an international scale with respect to treatment eligibility and the potential need for ancillary testing. In the context of such heterogeneity, most algorithms systematically identify candidates for treatment who are predominantly male, are of advanced age, and have co-morbidities of hypertension and/or smoking. Whether this is the best approach for reducing or eliminating lipid-specific cardiovascular risk in the general population should be re-considered.

Perspectives: core clinical competencies

Risk algorithms induce profound variance in statin treatment decisions and the potential for reliance on ancillary testing. The results bring into question whether algorithm-based approaches are optimal for lowering lipid-related risk in primary prevention.

Translational outlook

Additional studies are required to establish an internationally accepted patient phenotype warranting primary prevention therapy with statins based on available randomized clinical trial data.

Diabetes mellitus — age-specific statin initiation considerations: Although the risk of ASCVD is high in adults > 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus who are not receiving statin therapy, the benefit of initiating statin therapy may be limited, and it may therefore be reasonable to have a clinician–patient discussion in which the potential benefits and risks of initiating statin therapy in this age group are reviewed. There is limited information on ASCVD rates among individuals 20 to 39 years of age with diabetes mellitus and no information on whether statin therapy is beneficial; although rates of ASCVD are low in those < 30 years of age, they may reach intermediate-risk levels by 30 to 39 years of age, especially with long-standing diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus of > 20 years' duration. Thus, it may be reasonable to have a discussion about initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy with patients who have had type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years or type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 20 years.

QUESTION 8
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, when should non‐statin therapies be considered for ASCVD risk reduction?

Synopsis

Due to a lack of randomized controlled trials, non‐statin therapy for adults older than 75 years without prevalent ASCVD was not addressed in recent US or ESC guidelines of cholesterol management. Ezetimibe as monotherapy has been evaluated since in a single randomized controlled open label trial, EWTOPIA 75 (Ezetimibe Lipid‐Lowering Trial on Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in 75 or Older) which showed a 2.6% absolute and 34% relative reduction in risk of MACE in the ezetimibe group. The combination of statin and ezetimibe has not been evaluated in outcomes trials among adults older than 75 years without ASCVD. Among adults older than 75 years in whom a decision is made to use LDL‐C lowering therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD, statins are preferred given the available evidence, but ezetimibe therapy may be considered as an alternative if statin therapy is not tolerated, deemed inadvisable, or based on patient preference.

Limited data on bempedoic acid among statin‐intolerant high‐risk primary prevention patients are available from a subgroup analysis of the CLEAR Trial (Bempedoic Acid and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Statin‐Intolerant Patients). Bempedoic acid reduced the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events by 30% (absolute risk reduction 2.3% (5.3% vs. 7.6%)). The mean age among primary prevention patients was 68 years. In the overall trial, 15% of participants were aged 75 years or older, but data specific to this subgroup were not provided. There was no interaction of treatment by age. Thus, among statin intolerant individuals older than 75 years in whom a decision is made to lower LDL‐C to reduce ASCVD risk, bempedoic acid may be considered.

Secondary prevention trials with both evolocumab and alirocumab suggest similar benefits and safety of PCSK9 inhibition in older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger individuals. To date, there are no large randomized controlled outcomes trials using PCSK9 inhibition for primary prevention of ASCVD. Current data are not sufficient to make a recommendation for the treatment of adults aged 75 or older without ASCVD.

Figure 3 summarizes some key steps in managing hypercholesterolemia among this population.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]) — primary prevention recommendations are as follows: In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL or higher (≥ 4.9 mmol/L), maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL or higher (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) who achieve less than a 50% reduction in LDL-C while receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and/or have an LDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), ezetimibe therapy is reasonable. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with a baseline LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL or higher (≥ 4.9 mmol/L), who achieve less than a 50% reduction in LDL-C levels and have fasting triglycerides 300 mg/dL or lower (≤ 3.4 mmol/L), while taking maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a bile acid sequestrant may be considered. In patients 30 to 75 years of age with heterozygous FH and with an LDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L) while taking maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered. In patients 40 to 75 years of age with a baseline LDL-C level of 220 mg/dL or higher (≥ 5.7 mmol/L) who achieve an on-treatment LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL or higher (≥ 3.4 mmol/L) while receiving maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered. Value Statement: Uncertain Value (B-NR) — Among patients with FH without evidence of clinical ASCVD taking maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, PCSK9 inhibitors provide uncertain value at mid-2018 US list prices.

### Patient characteristics and general practitioners' advice to stop statins in oldest-old patients: a survey study across 30 countries [^111AnAm5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). With advancing age, the risks of statins might outweigh the potential benefits. It is unclear which factors influence general practitioners' (GPs) advice to stop statins in oldest-old patients.

Objective

To investigate the influence of a history of CVD, statin-related side effects, frailty and short life expectancy, on GPs' advice to stop statins in oldest-old patients.

Design

We invited GPs to participate in this case-based survey. GPs were presented with 8 case vignettes describing patients > 80 years using a statin, and asked whether they would advise stopping statin treatment.

Main Measures

Cases varied in history of CVD, statin-related side effects and frailty, with and without shortened life expectancy (< 1 year) in the context of metastatic, non-curable cancer. Odds ratios adjusted for GP characteristics (OR adj) were calculated for GPs' advice to stop.

Key Results

Two thousand two hundred fifty GPs from 30 countries participated (median response rate 36%). Overall, GPs advised stopping statin treatment in 46% (95%CI 45–47) of the case vignettes; with shortened life expectancy, this proportion increased to 90% (95CI% 89–90). Advice to stop was more frequent in case vignettes without CVD compared to those with CVD (OR adj 13.8, 95%CI 12.6–15.1), with side effects compared to without OR adj 1.62 (95%CI 1.5–1.7) and with frailty (OR adj 4.1, 95%CI 3.8–4.4) compared to without. Shortened life expectancy increased advice to stop (OR adj 50.7, 95%CI 45.5–56.4) and was the strongest predictor for GP advice to stop, ranging across countries from 30% (95%CI 19–42) to 98% (95% CI 96–99).

Conclusions

The absence of CVD, the presence of statin-related side effects, and frailty were all independently associated with GPs' advice to stop statins in patients aged > 80 years. Overall, and within all countries, cancer-related short life expectancy was the strongest independent predictor of GPs' advice to stop statins.

NLA recommendations — older adults with dyslipidemia: In primary prevention, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of < 130 mg/dL and < 100 mg/dL are appropriate targets, and after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended whenever feasible; the NLA high-risk thresholds are ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event using the Pooled Cohort Equations and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator, and in patients ≥ 65 years of age with uncertainty about drug therapy it is reasonable to recommend moderate intensity statin therapy when there is 1 or more major ASCVD risk factor or when risk exceeds 15% or 10% by the respective calculators; in situations requiring additional objective information, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring may be considered and a score of zero in asymptomatic patients may suggest that non-pharmacologic approaches are reasonable; for those ≥ 80 years of age with atherogenic lipoproteins above goals, a provider-patient discussion should be undertaken and if statin intolerance is the primary issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens including low intensity or non-daily moderate intensity statin therapy, low dose statin combination therapy with ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, or niacin, or non-statin monotherapy, and in general, we recommend that providers try to achieve at least a 30% LDL-C reduction.
