## Question

Best treatment for vaginal yeast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment for vaginal yeast infection, i.e., vulvovaginal candidiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the infection phenotype into uncomplicated versus complicated disease. Then, I should verify first-line therapy options and their comparative effectiveness. Next, I will consider special populations such as pregnancy, HIV, and non-albicans species. After that, I need to address recurrent VVC and maintenance strategies. Finally, I should review emerging therapies, patient preference, and safety, and then synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation with caveats and follow-up guidance.

> Let me first confirm the disease classification because treatment hinges on it. Uncomplicated VVC is typical, sporadic, mild-to-moderate disease in immunocompetent women, whereas complicated VVC includes severe inflammation, recurrent episodes, non-albicans species, or disease in immunocompromised hosts, and this distinction drives regimen selection and duration [^116gSuNP] [^114eH2Mj].

> Now, for uncomplicated VVC, I should verify first-line options and their equivalence. High-quality guidelines consistently recommend either a topical azole or a single 150 mg oral dose of fluconazole, with no agent clearly superior and choice guided by patient preference, cost, and access; both routes achieve roughly 80–90% symptom relief and mycologic cure when therapy is completed [^1157kAV5] [^114eH2Mj] [^112mEV8c]. Wait, let me verify comparative effectiveness between oral and topical therapy; the Cochrane review suggests little to no difference in clinical cure but a probable modest advantage of oral therapy for mycologic eradication, which aligns with guideline flexibility rather than a mandate to prefer one route over another [^116ghHAD].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing specifics for topical options because patients often ask about duration. OTC regimens include clotrimazole 1% cream for 7–14 days, clotrimazole 2% cream for 3 days, miconazole 2% cream for 7 days, miconazole 4% cream for 3 days, and single-dose options like miconazole 1,200 mg suppository or tioconazole 6.5% ointment; prescription options include butoconazole 2% single-dose cream and terconazole 0.4% cream for 7 days or 0.8% cream for 3 days, all of which are acceptable first-line choices [^112mEV8c] [^111jC8Dh]. I should confirm that oil-based creams can weaken latex; yes, patients using condoms or diaphragms need counseling on this interaction [^112mEV8c].

> For severe VVC, I need to ensure I escalate appropriately. Severe disease warrants either 7–14 days of a topical azole or fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses, because short-course therapy underperforms in this phenotype; this approach improves clinical response and reduces persistence [^116Uyo2q] [^1177R1ku] [^111JtKjf]. Let me double-check that this applies across immunocompetent hosts; yes, the recommendation is consistent in major guidelines and supported by clinical data showing improved cure with multi-dose fluconazole in severe presentations [^1157kAV5] [^111JtKjf].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, because this is a critical exception. I initially thought a single 150 mg fluconazole dose might be acceptable in pregnancy, but wait, I need to correct that. Current guidance advises against fluconazole in pregnancy due to associations with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; instead, use topical azoles for 7 days, with clotrimazole or miconazole as common choices, and extend to 14 days if symptoms persist or if non-albicans is suspected [^111jsWwa] [^113pDjgW]. I should confirm that imidazoles are preferred over nystatin in pregnancy; yes, topical imidazoles outperform nystatin for eradication in this setting [^112Ky6Pn].

> For non-albicans VVC, I need to check species-specific nuances. C. glabrata often has reduced fluconazole susceptibility, so if azoles fail, topical boric acid 600 mg daily for 14 days is a recommended alternative with approximately 70% response; nystatin suppositories are another option, and flucytosine with or without amphotericin B may be considered in refractory cases, ideally with culture guidance [^114PwZrL] [^112gYPN8]. Hold on, I should verify that routine susceptibility testing is not required for uncomplicated cases; it is reserved for recurrent or refractory disease where non-albicans is more likely or azole failure occurs [^11311eR9].

> For recurrent VVC, I should confirm the induction-maintenance paradigm. Recurrent VVC is typically defined as four or more symptomatic episodes per year; management should start with 10–14 days of induction therapy (topical or oral fluconazole), followed by fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months, which reduces recurrences substantially during treatment but often relapses after cessation, necessitating individualized reassessment [^112Qp4CV] [^117Tr3xq]. Let me verify that suppressive therapy is not curative long term; yes, recurrence after maintenance is common, and some patients require repeated or alternative maintenance strategies, including intermittent topical therapy if fluconazole is not feasible [^112Qp4CV] [^115UT8QS].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with HIV. Treatment of VVC in women with HIV is the same as in those without HIV for uncomplicated disease, but severe or recurrent episodes warrant longer courses and consideration of suppressive strategies; however, routine chronic suppressive therapy is not recommended unless recurrences are frequent or severe, and any suppressive regimen should be reconsidered as immune status improves on ART [^111jsWwa] [^112xeyZm] [^113QfvGL]. Wait, I should double-check that fluconazole resistance is a concern in this group; yes, non-albicans species and resistance patterns can complicate management, reinforcing the need for culture in refractory cases and judicious use of suppressive therapy [^114CjmaX].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies and where they fit. Ibrexafungerp, a first-in-class oral glucan synthase inhibitor with fungicidal activity, is FDA-approved for acute VVC and offers an oral non-azole option; phase 3 data show superiority to placebo for clinical and mycologic cure, with a one-day BID regimen and a favorable safety profile, making it a reasonable alternative when azoles are contraindicated or ineffective [^112zwvtH] [^114CjmaX]. Oteseconazole, a selective fungal CYP51 inhibitor, has promising phase 2 data suggesting low recurrence and good tolerability, and is included as a suppressive option in HIV guidance, though access may be limited pending broader approval and formulary adoption [^116hjfo3] [^112xeyZm]. Let me reconsider whether these replace azoles; no, they expand options rather than replace first-line azoles in uncomplicated disease [^112mEV8c].

> I need to ensure I address patient preference and safety pragmatics. Many women prefer oral therapy for convenience, and guidelines endorse aligning route with preference when medically appropriate; oral fluconazole is contraindicated in pregnancy and should be used cautiously with interacting drugs, while topical therapy avoids systemic exposure but may cause local irritation and is messier to apply [^114eH2Mj] [^111jsWwa]. Hold on, I should verify hepatotoxicity risk with fluconazole; idiosyncratic liver injury is rare but real, so avoid in patients with significant hepatic disease and counsel on symptoms of liver dysfunction when using systemic azoles [^111aqmY3].

> But wait, what about probiotics and alternative remedies. I should confirm that current evidence does not support probiotics as primary or adjunctive therapy for acute VVC; although some trials suggest short-term benefits when combined with antifungals, the quality is low and long-term advantages are unproven, so probiotics are not guideline-recommended for treatment or prevention of VVC at this time [^116Z52HJ]. I need to ensure patients are counseled to avoid douching and unproven OTC products that can delay appropriate care and worsen symptoms [^116AQXqr].

> Next, I should review diagnostic confirmation and follow-up. Diagnosis is typically made by wet mount with KOH showing yeast forms in the context of normal pH, with culture reserved for negative microscopy with persistent symptoms, recurrent disease, or treatment failure; routine test-of-cure is unnecessary in uncomplicated cases, but patients should return if symptoms persist beyond a few days or recur within 2 months [^114yHRhx] [^112TpFPW]. Let me double-check that empiric treatment without confirmation is acceptable in select scenarios; yes, if classic symptoms and signs are present and microscopy is unavailable, empiric therapy can be considered, but persistent or atypical cases warrant culture and alternative diagnoses [^114yHRhx].

> Finally, I will synthesize the hierarchy of "best" treatments while acknowledging context. For most immunocompetent, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated VVC, either a single 150 mg oral fluconazole dose or a short-course topical azole is appropriate and effective, with the choice driven by preference, access, and cost; oral therapy offers slight mycologic advantages and convenience, whereas topical therapy avoids systemic exposure and is preferred in pregnancy [^1157kAV5] [^114eH2Mj] [^116ghHAD]. For severe disease, multi-dose fluconazole or extended topical therapy is preferred; for recurrent VVC, induction followed by 6 months of weekly fluconazole is standard; for non-albicans or azole-refractory cases, boric acid or nystatin are alternatives; and in pregnancy, topical azoles for 7–14 days are the mainstay, with fluconazole avoided [^116Uyo2q] [^112Qp4CV] [^114PwZrL] [^111jsWwa]. Emerging agents like ibrexafungerp and oteseconazole expand options for intolerance or resistance, but azoles remain first-line for uncomplicated disease pending broader access and longer-term data [^112zwvtH] [^116hjfo3].

---

The best treatment for vaginal yeast infection (vulvovaginal candidiasis) is **fluconazole 150 mg orally as a single dose** for uncomplicated cases, with **topical azoles** (clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, or butoconazole) as equally effective alternatives if oral therapy is unsuitable or declined [^1157kAV5] [^114eH2Mj] [^116ghHAD]. For severe or recurrent infections, use **fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses** or extend topical therapy to 7–14 days, followed by weekly fluconazole 150 mg for 6 months to prevent recurrence [^116Uyo2q] [^112Qp4CV] [^11311eR9]. In pregnancy, use **topical azoles for 7 days**; avoid oral fluconazole due to fetal risks [^111jsWwa] [^113pDjgW]. Non-albicans species may require **boric acid suppositories** or nystatin if azoles fail [^114PwZrL] [^114MYugG]. Treatment choice should consider patient preference, severity, and pregnancy status, with no clear superiority among azoles [^112xeTif] [^114LAujr].

---

## First-line treatments

### Oral therapy

Fluconazole 150 mg orally as a single dose is **highly effective** for uncomplicated VVC, with clinical cure rates of 80–90% [^1157kAV5] [^112mEV8c]. It is convenient, well-tolerated, and preferred by many patients [^116ghHAD].

---

### Topical therapy

Topical azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, butoconazole) are **equally effective** to oral fluconazole for uncomplicated VVC [^116ghHAD] [^114LAujr]. Options include single-dose, 3-day, and 7-day regimens, allowing flexibility based on patient preference and adherence [^112mEV8c].

---

## Treatment of severe or recurrent infections

### Severe vulvovaginal candidiasis

For severe disease, **fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses** is recommended to achieve higher cure rates [^116Uyo2q] [^111JtKjf]. Alternatively, extend topical azole therapy to 7–14 days [^1177R1ku].

---

### Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC)

RVVC is defined as **four or more symptomatic episodes per year** [^112Qp4CV]. Induction therapy with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses or topical azoles for 10–14 days is followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months, which reduces recurrence by about 50% [^112Qp4CV] [^117Tr3xq].

---

## Special populations

### Pregnant patients

In pregnancy, **topical azoles for 7 days** are recommended; avoid oral fluconazole due to potential fetal risks [^111jsWwa] [^113pDjgW].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **treat severe or recurrent infections with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses** or with topical azoles for 7–14 days [^116Uyo2q] [^1177R1ku].

---

## Alternative therapies

Non-albicans species may respond poorly to fluconazole; **boric acid suppositories** (600 mg daily for 14 days) or nystatin suppositories (100,000 units daily for 14 days) are recommended alternatives [^114PwZrL] [^114MYugG].

---

## Patient preference and adherence

Patient preference significantly influences treatment choice; oral therapy is often preferred for convenience, whereas topical therapy may be chosen to avoid systemic side effects [^116ghHAD]. Adherence is generally high with single-dose regimens, improving outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated VVC | Fluconazole 150 mg orally single dose or topical azoles (single-dose, 3-day, or 7-day regimens) [^1157kAV5] [^114eH2Mj] |
| Severe VVC | Fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses or topical azoles for 7–14 days [^116Uyo2q] [^1177R1ku] |
| Recurrent VVC | Induction: fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses or topical azoles for 10–14 days; Maintenance: fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months [^112Qp4CV] [^11311eR9] |
| Pregnancy | Topical azoles for 7 days; avoid oral fluconazole [^111jsWwa] [^113pDjgW] |
| Non-albicans species | Boric acid suppositories or nystatin suppositories for 14 days [^114PwZrL] [^114MYugG] |

---

Fluconazole 150 mg orally as a single dose is the **best first-line treatment** for uncomplicated vaginal yeast infection, with topical azoles as equally effective alternatives. Severe or recurrent infections require extended or maintenance therapy, and pregnancy necessitates topical treatment only.

### Candidiasis (vulvovaginal) [^1149dSp5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85% to 90% of cases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of alternative or complementary treatments for symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 61 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments; douching; drug treatments; garlic; intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil); oral fluconazole; oral itraconazole; treating a male sexual partner; and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).

### Interventions for prevention and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in women with HIV infection [^116yT39J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common fungal infections that recur frequently in HIV infected women. Symptoms of VVC are pruritis, discomfort, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Vulval infection presents as a morbiliform rash that may extend to the thighs. Vaginal infection is associated with white discharge, and plaques are seen on erythematous vaginal walls. Even though rarely or never resulting in systemic fungal infection or mortality, left untreated these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Prevention and treatment of this condition is an essential part of maintaining the quality of life for these individuals.

Objectives

-To compare the efficacy of various antifungals given vaginally or orally for the treatment and prophylaxis of VVC in HIV-infected women and to evaluate the risks of the same.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was comprehensive, iterative and based on that of the HIV/AIDS Cochrane Review Group. The aim was to locate all relevant trials, irrespective of publication status or language. Electronic databases :CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1980 to 1st October 2010. WHO ICTRP site and other relevant web sites were also searched for conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered. Participants were HIV positive women receiving one or more of the following:treatment / prophylaxis for VVC or HAART(Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. The quality of the evidence generated was graded using the GRADE PRO approach.

Main Results

Our search did not yield any trial investigating treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. Two trials dealing with prophylaxis were eligible for inclusion. One trial (n = 323) favoured the use of weekly Fluconazole as compared to placebo (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97). The second trial with three arms of comparison; Clotrimazole, Lactobacillus and Placebo gave no definitive results in preventing an episode of VVC. Clotrimazole against placebo (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.09), Clotrimazole against lactobacillus (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.76) and lactobacillus against placebo (RR 0.54 ;95% CI 0.26 to 1.13).

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practiceNo trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. In comparison to placebo, Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for research There is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV.

### Vulvovaginal candidosis [^1175cQrP]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Despite therapeutic advances, vulvovaginal candidosis remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society. Understanding of anti-candida host defence mechanisms in the vagina has developed slowly and, despite a growing list of recognised risk factors, a fundamental grasp of pathogenic mechanisms continues to elude us. The absence of rapid, simple, and inexpensive diagnostic tests continues to result in both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of vulvovaginal candidosis. I review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this infection, and also discuss management strategies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Qp4CV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112XUSc8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

VVC represents a spectrum of disease. Although there is a clear need for better use of diagnostic modalities and development of better treatment alternatives, most patients with VVC, even the complicated cases, at least have the perspective of achieving adequate control of their symptoms. Future advances, particularly in the area of home diagnostics, may help to optimize use of currently available medicines.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^1114UNYq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prevention of preterm birth remains one of the most important challenges in maternity care. We propose a randomised trial with: a simple Candida testing protocol that can be easily incorporated into usual antenatal care; a simple, well accepted, treatment intervention; and assessment of outcomes from validated, routinely-collected, computerised databases.

Methods/Design

Using a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) study design, we aim to evaluate whether treating women with asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis early in pregnancy is effective in preventing spontaneous preterm birth. Pregnant women presenting for antenatal care < 20 weeks gestation with singleton pregnancies are eligible for inclusion. The intervention is a 6-day course of clotrimazole vaginal pessaries (100 mg) and the primary outcome is spontaneous preterm birth < 37 weeks gestation.

The study protocol draws on the usual antenatal care schedule, has been pilot-tested and the intervention involves only a minor modification of current practice. Women who agree to participate will self-collect a vaginal swab and those who are culture positive for Candida will be randomised (central, telephone) to open-label treatment or usual care (screening result is not revealed, no treatment, routine antenatal care). Outcomes will be obtained from population databases.

A sample size of 3,208 women with Candida colonisation (1,604 per arm) is required to detect a 40% reduction in the spontaneous preterm birth rate among women with asymptomatic candidiasis from 5.0% in the control group to 3.0% in women treated with clotrimazole (significance 0.05, power 0.8). Analyses will be by intention to treat.

Discussion

For our hypothesis, a placebo-controlled trial had major disadvantages: a placebo arm would not represent current clinical practice; knowledge of vaginal colonisation with Candida may change participants' behaviour; and a placebo with an alcohol preservative may have an independent affect on vaginal flora. These disadvantages can be overcome by the PROBE study design.

This trial will provide definitive evidence on whether screening for and treating asymptomatic candidiasis in pregnancy significantly reduces the rate of spontaneous preterm birth. If it can be demonstrated that treating asymptomatic candidiasis reduces preterm births this will change current practice and would directly impact the management of every pregnant woman.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^111Nz9tQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

Search Strategy

The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted.

Selection Criteria

~Bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~Bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~Bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~Bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~Bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~Bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results.

Main Results

Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20(95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications: if women are purchasing their own treatment, they should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^116ghHAD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019 together with reference checking and citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breast feeding or diabetic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2). Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1) and one trial across multiple European countries, USA (7) Thailand (2), Iran (2), Japan (1) and Africa (Nigeria) (1). The duration of follow-up varied between trials. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was high. There was probably little or no difference shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short-term follow-up (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.43; 13 trials; 1859 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.50; 9 trials; 1042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of clinical cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 77%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 75% and 83%; if the rate of clinical cure at long term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 84%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 89%. Oral treatment probably improves mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50: 19 trials; 3057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.60; 13 trials; 1661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of mycological cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 80%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 85%; if the rate of mycological cure at long-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 66%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 67% and 76%. In terms of patient safety, there is a low risk of participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse drug effects for either treatment (23 trials; 4637 participants; high-certainty evidence). Due to the low certainty of evidence, it is undetermined whether oral treatments reduced the number of side effects compared with intra-vaginal treatments (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 16 trials; 3155 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of side effects with intra-vaginal treatment is 12%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 10% and 15%. We noted that the type of side effects differed, with intra-vaginal treatments being more often associated with local reactions, and oral treatments being more often associated with systemic effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms and headaches. Oral treatment appeared to be the favoured treatment preference over intra-vaginal treatment or no preference (12 trials; 2206 participants), however the data were poorly reported and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was little or no difference in time to first relief of symptoms between oral and intra-vaginal treatments: four trials favoured the oral treatment, four favoured intra-vaginal, one study reported no difference and one was unclear. The measurements varied between the 10 trials (1910 participants) and the certainty of the evidence was low. Costs were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral anti-fungal treatment probably improves short- and long-term mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. Oral treatment was the favoured treatment preference by participants, though the certainty of this evidence is low. The decision to prescribe or recommend an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration safety in terms of withdrawals and side effects, as well as cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of some oral anti-fungals is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^111KMDQs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

Search Strategy

The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted.

Selection Criteria

~bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results.

Main Results

Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Fluconazole [^115kGYPp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage and Administration in Adults:

Single Dose

Vaginal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline — vulvovaginal candidiasis management details dosing and alternatives for uncomplicated, severe, Candida glabrata, and recurrent disease. For uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis, a single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For severe acute Candida vulvovaginitis, fluconazole, 150 mg, given every 72 hours for a total of 2 or 3 doses, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For C. glabrata vulvovaginitis unresponsive to oral azoles, topical intravaginal boric acid, 600 mg daily, for 14 days is an alternative (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), nystatin intravaginal suppositories, 100 000 units daily for 14 days (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), or topical 17% flucytosine cream alone or with 3% AmB cream administered daily for 14 days (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis: topical or oral drugs? Single-day or multiple-day therapy? A network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113VLJpq]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess early (7–10 days) and late (24–35 days) clinical and mycological cure rates associated with single or multiple-day topical or oral treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (inception to 31 March 2024), MEDLINE, Ovid platform (1946–31 March 2024), Embase, (inception to 31 March 2024), Google Scholar (inception to 31 March 2024), US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and European Clinical Trials Register.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Fifty (N = 7208 subjects) randomized studies comparing different topical or oral drugs with or without placebo were included in the analysis. Confidence in the results of network meta-analysis was evaluated by using an online tool that combines confidence assessments arising from direct comparisons with network meta-analysis estimates. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using an interactive web-based tool with the R packages gemct and BUGSNET. Ranking success probabilities were computed on the basis of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve.

Results

Compared with placebo, all the treatments studied were highly efficacious (> 75%) for the clinical and mycological cure of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Single-day use of 150 mg of fluconazole was slightly more effective than multiple-day topical therapy in early clinical cure both in pairwise (pooled odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.31–2.74, I² = 0%) and network meta-analysis (odds ratio = 1.52, 95% confidence interval = 1.13–2.07) analyses. In the evaluation of late clinical cure, there were no significant differences in the odds ratios of success between oral and topical treatment, either as single or multiple-day therapy (3983 subjects in the network). Single dose fluconazole was marginally superior to multiple-day topical treatment in late mycological cure (odds ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval = 1–1.99). In the ranking analysis, single-day oral fluconazole treatment had the best chance of achieving early (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 74.1%) and late (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 84.2%) mycological cure. Multiple-day treatment with itraconazole scored best in early (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 99%) and late (surface under the cumulative ranking curve = 75.7%) relief of symptoms.

Conclusion

Given the high efficacy of both oral and topical drugs, a strict hierarchy of competing treatments for uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis is probably inappropriate; however, current guidelines should acknowledge that oral azoles have a higher chance of clinical success and microbiological eradication of Candida than topical drugs.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^116cnDP5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Candidiasis

Candidiasis commonly called "yeast infection" or "thrush" is a fungal infection (mycosis) which occurs when there is overgrowth of any of the Candida species, of which Candida albicans is the most common. Candida is normally found on skin or mucous membranes including the vagina. However, if the environment becomes imbalanced, such as when the normal acidity of the mucous membrane changes or when the hormonal balance changes, Candida can multiply. When that happens, symptomatic candidiasis can occur, ranging from oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons.

Vaginal candidiasis, usually (90%) due to Candida albicans, is often harmless and causes no symptoms. However it can also cause vaginal soreness, itching and discharge. Approximately 75% of all healthy women of fertile age suffer from at least one episode of vaginal candidiasis, with associated physical and psychological morbidity and approximately half will have a recurrence. Vaginal candidiasis (referred to as 'candidiasis' in this protocol) is not traditionally classified as a sexually transmitted infection, since it occurs in celibate women, and is considered part of the normal vaginal flora. This does not mean that sexual transmission does not occur, although the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of infection is unknown. Importantly treatment of male partners has not been effective in reducing recurrence of vaginal candidiasis.

Up to 40% of pregnant women may have vaginal colonisation by Candida species, a two-fold increase from the prevalence rate in non-pregnant women. This association is believed to be driven by increased levels of circulating oestrogens and deposition of glycogen and other substrates in the vagina during pregnancy.

Candidiasis and preterm birth

The role of Candida colonisation on the pathway to preterm birth has not been pursued with the vigour ascribed to bacterial vaginosis and other vaginal organisms, possibly because it is considered a normal vaginal commensal organism. However, several factors indicate an association between vaginal candidiasis and preterm birth:

- the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with untreated, asymptomatic candidiasis is higher than among women with normal flora - 7.6% versus 2.8% (P = 0.009) in a low-risk obstetric population,

- in a high-risk population, there was increased rate of preterm birth among women with non-albicans Candida compared with uncolonised women (15.4% versus 11.3%, P = 0.05)

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116gSuNP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^113sdd9D]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment Short-course topical formulations effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy. Over-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents. Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days OR Clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days. Treatment Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen. Oral fluconazole weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist. Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Severe VVC is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses is recommended.

### Probiotics for vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women [^116Z52HJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is estimated to be the second most common form of infection after bacterial vaginosis. The ability of probiotics in maintaining and recovering the normal vaginal microbiota, and their potential ability to resist Candidas give rise to the concept of using probiotics for the treatment of VVC.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to October 2017: Sexually Transmitted Infections Cochrane Review Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and eight other databases. We searched in following international resources: World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science and OpenGrey. We checked specialty journals, reference lists of published articles and conference proceedings. We collected information from pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) using probiotics, alone or as adjuvants to conventional antifungal drugs, to treat VVC in non-pregnant women. Trials recruiting women with recurrent VVC, coinfection with other vulvovaginal infections, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication were ineligible for inclusion. Probiotics were included if they were made from single or multiple species and in any preparation type/dosage/route of administration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and quality and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements through consensus. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Ten RCTs (1656 participants) met our inclusion criteria, and pharmaceutical industry funded none of these trials. All trials used probiotics as adjuvant therapy to antifungal drugs. Probiotics increased the rate of short-term clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.24, 695 participants, 5 studies, low quality evidence) and mycological cure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10, 969 participants, 7 studies, low quality evidence) and decreased relapse rate at one month (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68, 388 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence). However, this effect did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33, 172 participants, 1 study, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence) or mycological cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.71, 627 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence). Probiotics use did not increase the frequency of serious (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.94; 440 participants, 2 studies, low quality evidence). We found no eligible RCTs for outcomes as time to first relapse, need for additional treatment at the end of therapy, patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

Low and very low quality evidence shows that, compared with conventional treatment, the use of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy could increases the rate of short-term clinical and mycological cure and decrease the relapse rate at one month but this did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical or mycological cure. Probiotics use does not seem to increase the frequency of serious or non-serious adverse events. There is a need for well-designed RCTs with standardized methodologies, longer follow-up and larger sample size.

### Treatment of candidiasis… [^1157SL71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

### Treatment of asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy to prevent preterm birth: an open-label pilot randomized controlled trial [^111tHJFM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although the connection between ascending infection and preterm birth is undisputed, research focused on finding effective treatments has been disappointing. However evidence that eradication of Candida in pregnancy may reduce the risk of preterm birth is emerging. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of conducting a large randomized controlled trial to determine whether treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis in early pregnancy reduces the incidence of preterm birth.

Methods

We used a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) study design. Pregnant women presenting at < 20 weeks gestation with singleton pregnancies self-collected a vaginal swab. Those who were asymptomatic and culture positive for Candida were randomized to 6-days of clotrimazole vaginal pessaries (100mg) or usual care (screening result is not revealed, no treatment). The primary outcomes were the rate of asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis, participation and follow-up. The proposed primary trial outcome of spontaneous preterm birth < 37 weeks gestation was also assessed.

Results

Of 779 women approached, 500 (64%) participated in candidiasis screening, and 98 (19.6%) had asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis and were randomized to clotrimazole or usual care. Women were not inconvenienced by participation in the study, laboratory testing and medication dispensing were problem-free, and the follow-up rate was 99%. There was a tendency towards a reduction in spontaneous preterm birth among women with asymptomatic candidiasis who were treated with clotrimazole RR = 0.33, 95%CI 0.04–3.03.

Conclusions

A large, adequately powered, randomized trial of clotrimazole to prevent preterm birth in women with asymptomatic candidiasis is both feasible and warranted.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^111Qun81]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

It is estimated that 75% of all women experience at least one VVC infection during their childbearing years. Symptoms of VVC can include vulvar pruritus and burning, and soreness and irritation can lead to dyspareunia and dysuria. Concurrent fungal infections can worsen psoriasis; therefore, it is important for VVC to be identified and treated quickly in this population.

VVC is often diagnosed based on clinical history and physical examination showing signs of vulvar and vaginal erythema, edema, excoriation, fissures, and/or thick, curd-like vaginal discharge (Fig. 1 c). IDSA guidelines recommend confirming diagnosis with a wet-mount preparation in saline and 10% KOH, and a check of vaginal pH, which should be normal (< 4.5), before beginning antifungal treatment. Cultures should be obtained for patients with negative wet-mount findings.

Most (approximately 90%) cases of VVC are uncomplicated, and IDSA guidelines recommend treatment with topical antifungal agents (Table 2) or a single 150 mg dose of oral fluconazole (strength of recommendation: A). A number of topical antifungal agents are effective treatments for uncomplicated VVC, with no agent showing clear superiority. Response rates are generally high (> 90%) and comparable with topical versus oral therapies, whether given as a short course or as single-dose therapy. Because there are many available therapies that are safe and effective for uncomplicated VVC, patient preference (e.g. for oral vs. topical therapy) should be considered when making treatment decisions.

Table 2
Intravaginal treatments for vulvovaginal candidiasis

a Available with and without miconazole 2% external cream for use twice daily for 7 days

Complicated VVC is defined as severe or recurrent disease, infection due to a Candida species other than C. albicans, and/or VVC in an abnormal host. Such infections require treatment with topical therapy administered intravaginally daily for approximately 7 days, or multiple oral doses of fluconazole (150 mg every 72 h for three doses). For recurrent VVC, defined as four or more symptomatic episodes within a 1-year period, IDSA guidelines recommend 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical or oral triazole, followed by fluconazole 150 mg once weekly for 6 months (strength of recommendation: A).

### Topical treatment for vaginal candidiasis (thrush) in pregnancy [^112Ky6Pn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal candidiasis (moniliasis or thrush) is a common and frequently distressing infection for many women. It is even more common in pregnancy. There is no evidence that thrush in pregnancy is harmful to the baby.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of different methods of treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register. In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR) was searched. Date of last search: March 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of any treatment for vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Ten trials were included. Based on five trials, imidazole drugs were more effective than nystatin when treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.29). In turn, Nystatin was as effective as hydrargaphen in one trial (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.05–1.84). A trial of clotrimazole was more effective than placebo (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.31). Single dose treatment was no more or less effective than three or four days treatment. However, two trials involving 81 women, showed that treatment lasting for four days was less effective than treatment for seven days (odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 4.21 to 29.15). Based on two trials, treatment for seven days was no more or less effective than treatment for 14 days (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 1.05). Terconazole was as effective as clotrimazole (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.28–7.10).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Topical imidazole appears to be more effective than nystatin for treating symptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy. Treatments for seven days may be necessary in pregnancy rather than the shorter courses more commonly used in non-pregnant women.

### Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^111FWFLJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a common cause of significant morbidity in women in all strata of society affecting millions of women worldwide. Previously, RVVC occurrence was limited by onset of menopause but the widespread use of hormone replacement therapy has extended the at-risk period. Candida albicans remains the dominant species responsible for RVVC, however optimal management of RVVC requires species determination and effective treatment measures are best if species-specific. Considerable progress has been made in understanding risk factors that determine susceptibility to RVVC, particularly genetic factors, as well as new insights into normal vaginal defense immune mechanisms and their aberrations in RVVC. While effective control of RVVC is achievable with the use of fluconazole maintenance suppressive therapy, cure of RVVC remains elusive especially in this era of fluconazole drug resistance. Vaccine development remains a critical challenge and need.

### CD101 topical compared with oral fluconazole for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis: a randomized controlled trial [^1132axxq]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is an infection of the vagina's mucous membranes, caused by Candida albicans in more than 90% of acute VVC. Several topical and oral azole agents are available in a variety of formulations, and all seem to have similar effectiveness. Azoles are fungistatic, meaning that the fungi are inhibited from growth or replication but are not eradicated. Recurrent infection and developing azole resistance demonstrate a significant need for alternative treatments.

Materials and Methods

One hundred twenty-six women were randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment cohorts: CD101 3% gel (n = 50) applied intravaginally on days 1 and 2, CD101 6% ointment (n = 50) applied intravaginally on day 1, or oral fluconazole 150 mg (n = 26) on day 1. Primary outcomes of clinical and mycological cure, as demonstrated by changes in the vaginal scores and mycological culture, were assessed on day 7 (± 2 days), day 14 (± 2 days), and day 28 (± 7 days). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events.

Results

Ninety-nine women with positive Candida culture remained in the modified intent-to-treat population with 40 in each CD101 arm and 19 in the fluconazole arm. In the CD101 gel, CD101 ointment, and oral fluconazole groups, 35%, 30%, and 52.6% demonstrated clinical cure and 45%, 40%, and 57.9% had mycological cure at day 28, respectively.

Conclusions

CD101 3% gel and CD101 6% ointment were well tolerated and produced similar rates of clinical and mycological cure in patients with an acute, moderate-to-severe episode of VVC. However, cure rates for these 2 formulations and regimens of CD101 were lower than those in patients treated with fluconazole.

### Assessment and treatment of vaginitis [^1166aRMr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is the presenting symptom at millions of office visits each year in the United States. Although treatment of sporadic cases is often straightforward, recurrent cases present both diagnostic and treatment challenges. Molecular diagnostic tests are likely superior to in-office microscopy for most clinicians and most cases. In both recurrent bacterial vaginosis and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, national treatment guidelines recommend an extended treatment duration with one of the first-line agents. In cases in which such treatment is not successful, vaginal boric acid is likely the cheapest and easiest alternative option. New antifungal medications offer additional but limited treatment options. Probiotics are not recommended for prevention of vulvovaginal candidiasis; however, vaginal products containing Lactobacillus crispatus may have promise for recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Trichomoniasis should be treated with a 1-week course of metronidazole; this is the only sexually transmitted infection for which treatment recommendations vary by sex. In cases in which patients do not respond to initial treatment, the diagnosis should be reconsidered, and other potential causes such as desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, or vulvodynia should be considered.

### Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113kzSD8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Frequently ignored by the medical community, chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are relatively common and can frustrating for patients and physicians. Establishing a proper diagnosis will lay the foundation for an effective therapeutic therapeutic plan. Fungal cultures are an important component of the work-up. The most common causes of chronic vaginal symptoms are recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and irritant dermatitis. In patients with RVVC caused by Candida albicans, host factors may play an important role. Long-term oral antifungal therapy will break the pattern of recurrence in many patients. Infections caused by other species of yeast may be more resistant to standard treatment approaches.

### Establishing and sustaining a healthy vaginal environment: analysis of data from a randomized trial of periodic presumptive treatment for vaginal infections [^113GyWv5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Data from a randomized trial of oral periodic presumptive treatment (PPT) to reduce vaginal infections were analyzed to assess the effect of the intervention on a healthy vaginal environment (normal flora confirmed by Gram stain with no candidiasis or trichomoniasis). The incidence of a healthy vaginal environment was 608 cases per 100 person-years in the intervention arm and 454 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17–1.58). Sustained vaginal health (healthy vaginal environment for ≥ 3 consecutive visits) was also more frequent in the intervention arm (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.23–2.33). PPT is effective at establishing and sustaining a healthy vaginal environment.

### Fluconazole (Diflucan) [^111aqmY3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) is indicated for the treatment of:

Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida).
Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, DIFLUCAN was also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see CLINICAL STUDIES section. Studies comparing DIFLUCAN to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Prophylaxis:

DIFLUCAN is also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);
- proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and
- adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I² > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I² 40–70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (< 100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

As the mortality associated with invasive Candida infections remains high, it is important to make optimal use of available diagnostic tools to initiate antifungal therapy as early as possible and to select the most appropriate antifungal drug. A panel of experts of the European Fungal Infection Study Group (EFISG) of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) undertook a data review and compiled guidelines for the clinical utility and accuracy of different diagnostic tests and procedures for detection of Candida infections. Recommendations about the microbiological investigation and detection of candidaemia, invasive candidiasis, chronic disseminated candidiasis, and oropharyngeal, oesophageal, and vaginal candidiasis were included. In addition, remarks about antifungal susceptibility testing and therapeutic drug monitoring were made.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^113imtmU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of Candida in pregnancy

There are no randomised placebo-controlled trials of clotrimazole in pregnancy to reduce preterm birth. A Cochrane Systematic review, including 10 trials (1046 women), of treatment for thrush in pregnancy found: (i) topical treatment to be effective in eradicating candidiasis, (ii) topical imidazoles (such as clotrimazole) to be more effective than nystatin, and that (iii) a treatment regimen of 6 or 7 days is superior to those of shorter duration. Specifically vaginal clotrimazole for 6 days reduced Candida colonisation in pregnancy to 12% at 3–6 weeks post treatment compared with 58% of women receiving placebo (OR 0.14, 95%CI 0.06–0.31). Two trials involving 81 pregnant women show treatment lasting 7 days was more effective (98% eradication) than treatment for 4 days (49% eradication, OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03–0.24). However, the endpoint of these trials has been the successful eradication of Candida and importantly no pregnancy outcomes were reported. A randomised controlled trial of clotrimazole is necessary to provide the best evidence of whether treatment of asymptomatic Candida colonisation reduces preterm delivery.

Local application of clotrimazole vaginal pessaries or cream is generally well tolerated. Occasionally skin reactions (burning, stinging, or redness) can occur. Clotrimazole has been used by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed. A large population-based database study did not demonstrate risks to the fetus following exposure to clotrimazole in pregnancy. Furthermore, the susceptibility of both Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida vaginal isolates to azole antifungal agents such as clotrimazole supports the continued practice of azole antifungal agents for empirical therapy of uncomplicated Candida vaginitis.

### Dequalinium chloride for the treatment of vulvovaginal infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zKJ5z]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective/Purpose

Women at reproductive age frequently experience vulvovaginal infections and vaginitis. The most common etiologies are vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/aerobic vaginitis, and trichomoniasis. Various treatment options are available for these infections, such as specific antimicrobial or antiseptic agents. Dequalinium chloride (DQC) is a local antiseptic agent with a broad antimicrobial and antifungal spectrum. Multiple studies suggest that DQC is an efficient treatment for vaginal infections; however, it is not widely recommended as a first-line treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of DQC compared with that of standard treatment.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and clinicaltrials.org were searched to retrieve relevant reports up to October 2022.

Results

Four randomized controlled studies and 1 observational study were included in this review. Overall, DQC showed noninferiority to the reference treatments for BV and VVC, and to the evaluated treatment options for desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/aerobic vaginitis. For BV and VVC, this could also be confirmed in a meta-analysis including 3 randomized controlled studies. No serious adverse events were reported in any of these studies.

Conclusions

Dequalinium chloride offers a safe, well-tolerated, and efficient treatment option for vulvovaginal infections of different etiologies. However, further studies are needed to confirm our findings and allow inclusion of DQC as a first-line treatment into guidelines.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112mEV8c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis — treatment effectiveness and recommended regimens: short-course topical formulations (i.e., single dose and regimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC, and treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy; over-the-counter intravaginal options include clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days or clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days; miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days or miconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days; miconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days or miconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days or miconazole 1,200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 1 day; and tioconazole 6.5% ointment 5 g intravaginally in a single application. Prescription intravaginal agents include butoconazole 2% cream (single-dose bioadhesive product) 5 g intravaginally in a single application, terconazole 0.4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days, terconazole 0.8% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days, or terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 3 days; an oral agent option is fluconazole 150 mg orally in a single dose. The creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms.

### Fluconazole (Diflucan) [^1171YjcE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Single Dose

Vaginal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF DIFLUCAN (FLUCONAZOLE) IS THE SAME FOR ORAL (TABLETS AND SUSPENSION) AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of DIFLUCAN for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

Systemic Candida infections:

For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used.

Urinary tract infections and peritonitis:

For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients.

### Maintenance fluconazole therapy for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^117Tr3xq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

No safe and convenient regimen has proved to be effective for the management of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Methods

After inducing clinical remission with open-label fluconazole given in three 150-mg doses at 72-hour intervals, we randomly assigned 387 women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis to receive treatment with fluconazole (150 mg) or placebo weekly for six months, followed by six months of observation without therapy. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of women in clinical remission at the end of the first six-month period. Secondary efficacy measures were the clinical outcome at 12 months, vaginal mycologic status, and time to recurrence on the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

Weekly treatment with fluconazole was effective in preventing symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis. The proportions of women who remained disease-free at 6, 9, and 12 months in the fluconazole group were 90.8 percent, 73.2 percent, and 42.9 percent, as compared with 35.9 percent, 27.8 percent, and 21.9 percent, respectively, in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The median time to clinical recurrence in the fluconazole group was 10.2 months, as compared with 4.0 months in the placebo group (P < 0.001). There was no evidence of fluconazole resistance in isolates of Candida albicans or of superinfection with C. glabrata. Fluconazole was discontinued in one patient because of headache.

Conclusions

Long-term weekly treatment with fluconazole can reduce the rate of recurrence of symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis. However, a long-term cure remains difficult to achieve.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111jsWwa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) — sex partner management and special populations: For complicated VVC, no recommendation can be made for treating sex partners because no data exist to support this practice. In compromised hosts, efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made and more prolonged (i.e., 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary. During pregnancy, only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women, and a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used. In HIV infection, treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV; although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC, and the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112rc4Hd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common cause of vaginitis and is attributed to infection caused by Candida albicans in 85%–95% of women. Fifty percent of all women will experience ≥ 1 episode of VVC by 25 years of age, and approximately 75% of women will experience a VVC episode in their lifetime (with ≥ 2 episodes occurring in 40%–45% of women). Comorbid conditions including uncontrolled diabetes, genetic predisposition, immunocompromising conditions, and medications (eg, antibiotics) have been associated with VVC. Given the wide availability of over-the-counter therapies, which often results in patient self-treatment in lieu of professional care, the exact incidence of VVC is grossly under reported.

VVC treatments have historically been predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents. Routine treatment includes topical azole formulations, up to week-long courses, or oral fluconazole given as 150-mg single doses. Limitations of these treatments include possible intolerance to topical formulations, idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity with fluconazole, and fluconazole-associated risk of fetal harm if taken during pregnancy. Given the previous lack of approved non-azole therapies, treatment options for VVC have been limited in cases of azole-resistant organisms or for patients with azole intolerance or for whom its use is contraindicated. New oral treatments are warranted, particularly those with broad fungal coverage, a good safety profile (especially no risk of fetal harm), and limited drug-to-drug interactions.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112VojWm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Efficacy endpoints in the present study including clinical cure — defined as absence of all signs and symptoms of VVC (vulvovaginal signs and symptoms [VSS] = 0) and responder (successful) outcome (absence of signs and symptoms plus vaginal swab culture negative for growth of Candida species) — differed from previous studies that had established specific criteria (eg, clinical cure, VSS ≤ 2). Also different from some previous studies, test-of-cure (TOC) and follow-up (FU) visits occurred on days 7–14 and 21–30, respectively, in accordance with FDA guidance recommendations. The dose of ibrexafungerp used in this study — 300 mg twice a day (BID) for 1 day — was based on results from the phase 2 DOVE study that showed as total milligram dosing increased, gastrointestinal-related adverse events also increased without a corresponding improvement in efficacy.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 215 — severe vulvovaginal candidiasis management indicates that patients require a prolonged course with a topical intravaginal azole for 10–14 days or two to three doses of oral fluconazole taken orally 3 days apart, and suppressive weekly doses are not necessary in this population. Oral fluconazole can be prescribed every 3 days for 2–3 doses (days 1, 4, and 7), and a placebo-controlled randomized trial found that a second dose of fluconazole (150 mg given 3 days after the first dose) increased the cure rate from 67% to 80%.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention of sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114CjmaX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vulvovaginal itching and discharge. This article discusses the latest CDC STI Treatment Guidelines for VVC.

Methods

A literature search of relevant topics was performed, and a team of experts was convened to discuss (1) diagnosis/testing modalities; treatment of (2) uncomplicated VVC, (3) complicated VVC, and (4) VVC caused by non-albicans yeast; (5) alternative treatment regimens; (6) susceptibility testing of yeast; Special Populations: (7) pregnancy and (8) HIV and VVC.

Results

Yeast culture remains the gold standard for diagnoses. Newer molecular assays have been developed for the diagnosis of VVC and perform well. Azole antifungals remain the treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC. Two new drugs, TOL-463 and recently FDA-approved ibrexafungerp, appeared promising in clinical trials. For recurrent VVC, oteseconazole, not yet commercially available, may represent a new option. For non-albicans yeast infections in symptomatic patients, boric acid appears useful. No evidence supports the use of alternative treatments, including probiotics. Fluconazole during pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous abortion and craniofacial and heart defects. In women with HIV infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with increased rates of VVC, and VVC is associated with increased viral shedding. Treatment measures in women with HIV infection are identical to those women without HIV infection.

Conclusions

There has been significant new knowledge generated about VVC since the 2015 CDC Guidelines which have led to changing recommendations.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Terconazole vaginal cream 0.8% is indicated for the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). As terconazole vaginal cream 0.8% is effective only for vulvovaginitis caused by the genus Candida, the diagnosis should be confirmed by KOH smears and/or cultures.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112bWNDD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary efficacy outcome, therapeutic cure at day 28, was observed in the majority of participants across all treatment groups. Secondary outcome analyses showed similar results as the primary efficacy outcome. Generally, there was no statistical difference between VT-1161 and fluconazole treatment groups; however, the study was not prospectively powered for the primary end point, and sample sizes were small. While the current preliminary study did not differentiate between acute or recurrent VVC participants, requiring only an acute episode at presentation, analyses at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits found no indication of mycological recurrence in the VT-1161 groups, while 29% and 46% of participants in the fluconazole group had mycological recurrence at 3 and 6 months, respectively. During the 6-month trial, a higher percentage of fluconazole-treated participants reported TEAEs than VT-1161–treated participants.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112TpFPW]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Short-course topical formulations (i.e. single dose and regimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy.

Recommended Regimens for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
Over-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents
Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days
or
Clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days
or
Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days
or
Miconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days
or
Miconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days
or
Miconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days
or
Miconazole 1,200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 1 day
or
Tioconazole 6.5% ointment 5 g intravaginally in a single application
Prescription Intravaginal Agents
Butoconazole 2% cream (single-dose bioadhesive product) 5 g intravaginally in a single application
or
Terconazole 0.4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days
or
Terconazole 0.8% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days
or
Terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 3 days
Oral Agent
Fluconazole 150 mg orally in a single dose

The creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Patients should refer to condom product labeling for further information. Even women who have previously received a diagnosis of VVC by a clinician are not necessarily more likely to be able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an over-the-counter preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms < 2 months after treatment for VVC should be evaluated clinically and tested. Unnecessary or unapproved use of over-the-counter preparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment of other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse outcomes. No substantial evidence exists to support using probiotics or homeopathic medications for treating VVC.

Follow-Up

Follow-up typically is not required. However, women with persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be instructed to return for follow-up visits.

### ESCMID* guideline for the diagnosis and management of Candida diseases 2012: patients with HIV infection or AIDS [^113v5oT9]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Mucosal candidiasis is frequent in immunocompromised HIV-infected highly active antiretroviral (HAART) naive patients or those who have failed therapy. Mucosal candidiasis is a marker of progressive immune deficiency. Because of the frequently marked and prompt immune reconstitution induced by HAART, there is no recommendation for primary antifungal prophylaxis of mucosal candidiasis in the HIV setting in Europe, although it has been evidenced as effective in the pre-HAART era. Fluconazole remains the first line of therapy for both oropharyngeal candidiasis and oesophageal candidiasis and should be preferred to itraconazole oral solution (or capsules when not available) due to fewer side effects. For patients who still present with fluconazole-refractory mucosal candidiasis, oral treatment with any other azole should be preferred based on precise Candida species identification and susceptibility testing results in addition to the optimization of HAART when feasible. For vaginal candidiasis, topical therapy is preferred.

Isolation and identification of Candida from vaginal swabs

The detection and identification of Candida from vaginal swabs is readily achieved. The swab will be inoculated onto full-plates of chromogenic agar (CHROMagar™Candida, CHROMagar, Paris, France) to isolate, provisionally speciate and semi-quantitatively enumerate (scant, moderate, or heavy) Candida species and to obtain colonies for further work such as susceptibility testing by broth microdilution methods. This medium is chosen to ensure detection of mixed infections. Cultures will be incubated for 72 hours at 35°C in 5% CO₂. Identification to species level will be based on colony morphology, and colour.

Intervention

The treatment group will receive a 6-day course of commercially available vaginal clotrimazole pessaries (Canestan ®). Women will be advised to insert one pessary as gently and deeply as possible into the vagina while lying on her back, preferably at night, for 6 nights. We have chosen 6 days of treatment because this is: supported by the Cochrane Systematic Review of treatment for Candida eradication in pregnancy, this is how commercially available vaginal clotrimazole is marketed and this was the regimen used in the Kiss trial. Women who miss one or more daily doses will be advised to insert a single pessary as soon as they remember or the next evening, and continue using the pessaries until the course of treatment is finished.

Follow-up

A brief (< 5 minutes) follow-up questionnaire will collect information about symptoms of candidiasis, use of antibiotics and/or corticosteroids (risk factors for symptomatic candidiasis), treatment of candidiasis (including study medication, doctor prescribed and over-the-counter medications), treatment side-effects and compliance with the treatment regimen. The questionnaire will be web-based with email notification or mailed with a reply-paid envelope according to the participants stated preference at trial entry. These secondary outcomes will be collected at 28–32 weeks, a gestation when the potential for unmasking the 'no treatment' arm will be irrelevant.

Care of all women and their babies will be otherwise managed according to the standard practices of the model of maternity care she has chosen. Women who develop symptoms of Candida infection will be offered appropriate treatment. The results of the vaginal swab culture taken at the time of trial entry will not be disclosed nor be available in the pregnancy record.

Vaginal symptoms are common in the general population and are one of the most frequent reasons for patient visits to obstetrician-gynecologists. Vaginitis may have important consequences in terms of discomfort and pain, days lost from school or work, and sexual functioning and self image. Vaginitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and other infections of the female genital tract, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as adverse reproductive outcomes in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Treatment usually is directed to the specific cause of vaginal symptoms, which most commonly include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. The purpose of this document is to provide information about the diagnosis and treatment of vaginitis.

### Itraconazole vs fluconazole for the treatment of uncomplicated acute vaginal and vulvovaginal candidiasis in nonpregnant women: a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [^112GZdhB]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

In this metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) we aimed to compare the in vivo and in vitro activity and the safety of per os itraconazole and fluconazole treatment of uncomplicated acute vaginal/vulvovaginal candidiasis in nonpregnant women. We used PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify the studies that were relevant to our metaanalysis RCTs. Six RCTs were included in this study that comprised 1092 enrolled patients with signs and symptoms of vaginal/vulvovaginal candidiasis that was confirmed by microscopy and/or microbiologic cultures that were obtained from the ectocervix and/or vaginal fundus. Overall, there was no difference between itraconazole and fluconazole regarding clinical cure and improvement at the first and second scheduled visit assessments (pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.6–1.48] and 1.09 [95% CI, 0.68–1.75], respectively), mycologic cure at the first and second scheduled visit assessments (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.31–1.7] and 0.71 [95% CI, 0.49–1.03], respectively), withdrawal of patients because of severe adverse events (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.16–3.32]), and adverse events noted from the nervous and digestive systems (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.42–2.73] and 1.84 [95% CI, 0.3–11.27], respectively). In conclusion, effectiveness and safety of oral itraconazole and fluconazole in the treatment of acute uncomplicated vaginal/vulvovaginal candidiasis are similar.

### The vaginal microbiome: V. therapeutic modalities of vaginal microbiome engineering and research challenges [^116824zB]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

ENGINEERING THE VAGINAL MICROBIOME

As discussed in previous sections, modifying the VMB to one dominated by lactobacillimay be associated with better health outcomes. Vaginal microbiome modification may have impact on vaginitis (including bacterial vaginosis [BV]), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, prevention of transmission of sexually transmitted infections, or preterm labor. Current available treatments (antibiotic and antifungal medications) result in suboptimal cure levels and high recurrence rates. Bacterial vaginosis biofilms are not penetrated sufficiently by antibiotics, and antibiotic maintenance use for recurrent BV increases the probability of adverse effects, drug resistance, and candidiasis. Different approaches aiming to therapeutically "manipulate" an existing VMB have been described, including probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, acidifying agents, activated charcoal, phage therapy, and VMB transplantation. The following paragraphs summarize these modalities and the current data obtained regarding their effect.

Probiotics

The concept of using exogenous microorganisms as a means of inducing health benefits intrigued humans for centuries. Possible mechanisms by which exogenous lactobacilli strains might affect the VMB include vaginal recolonization, increased production or release of lactic acid and other antimicrobial compounds, and modulation of local mucosal immune response.

Probiotics are defined as "live microorganisms that confer a health benefit when consumed in adequate amounts". Probiotics are commonly used for treatment or prevention of vaginal disorders or as a complement to the standard, antimicrobial or antifungal, treatment. Probiotics are usually considered safe, but adverse effects and complications may range from gastrointestinal effects to sepsis and transferring of antibiotic resistance genes to host bacteria.

Probiotic VMB therapy has mostly focused on BV and less commonly on candidiasis and other forms of dysbiosis. The studies have commonly reported on a small study sample with huge differences in terms of: (1) studied population (symptomatic versus asymptomatic; acute or recurrent episodes, diagnostic criteria), (2) clinical entity evaluated (BV, abnormal microbiome, candidiasis, any "vaginitis"), (3) type and number of strains of lactobacilli administered, (4) routes of administration (oral and/or vaginal), (6) dosage, (7) duration of use, (8) antibiotic cotreatments, (9) primary outcome measures (clinical cure, microscopic cure, pH, self-perception), and (10) evaluation time points.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113XR548]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), more commonly known as vaginal yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vaginitis. In 80%–95% of women, VVC is caused by Candida albicans with fewer remaining infections caused by non- albicans Candida species including Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, or other fungi. Approximately 75% of women will have ≥ 1 episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40%–45% of women will experience ≥ 2 episodes. By the age of 25 years, an estimated 50% of all women will have experienced ≥ 1 episode of VVC after the onset of sexual activity. Current treatment options for VVC are predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents and include short courses of topical formulations of various agents or oral fluconazole given as a 150-mg single or multiple dose regimen. Limitations of available treatments include concerns of intolerance, adverse events (AEs), and with fluconazole, a potential risk of miscarriage and fetal harm. More recent VVC treatment limitations include an increasing prevalence of fluconazole resistance and intrinsic resistance or low susceptibility of non- albicans Candida species to azole antifungals.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112a7NfN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, women with uncomplicated acute VVC are treated with single-dose or short-course treatments; those with complicated, resistant, or recurring VVC (up to 20% of women) require therapy for ≥ 5–7 days and possibly maintenance therapy. Topical agents are limited by local side effects, especially burning, and are messy to apply; therefore, most women prefer oral regimens. Systemically administered available azoles, such as fluconazole, can exhibit toxicity and DDI issues and come with reproductive warnings. Furthermore, resistance surveillance studies have found that current azole therapies can have poor activity against C. glabrata, and cross-resistance among current azole antifungal agents has been observed.

In a previous study that compared a 6-month weekly maintenance fluconazole regimen to placebo in patients with recurrent VVC, the percentage of fluconazole-treated patients who had a recurrence (defined as a clinical severity score of ≥ 3 and vaginal culture positive for yeast) at the 6-month end of maintenance phase visit was 9%. At the 9-month and 12-month observation phase visits, this percentage increased to 27% and 57%, respectively. This trend of increasing recurrence rates in the 6 months following fluconazole treatment is similar to the mycological recurrence rates observed in fluconazole-treated participants in this trial and highlights the unmet medical need for these patients. We have previously reported the potential clinical utility of VT-1161 in women with recurrent VVC. Overall, recurrence rates of culture-proven VVC were only 4% in the 169 VT-1161–treated participants at 9 months after ending the study drug compared with 52% in the 46 women who received placebo. Our current study shows that VT-1161 may also be an effective treatment for acute VVC.

During this trial, VT-1161 was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow-up. As an initial phase 2 study with a small number of participants, its main limitation was that it was not powered to permit meaningful comparisons between different treatment groups. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that VT-1161 is worthy of further investigation for both acute and recurrent VVC.

### Treatment of asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy to prevent preterm birth: an open-label pilot randomized controlled trial [^111mcRFd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have demonstrated the feasibility of performing a randomized controlled trial of clotrimazole for pregnant women with asymptomatic candidiasis. The participation rate (64%) was acceptable, women were not inconvenienced by participation in the study, laboratory testing and medication dispensing were problem free, and the follow-up rate was 99%. Although there were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between treatment groups, the findings were in the direction of a treatment effect.

We chose a PROBE design to overcome some specific disadvantages associated with a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for answering our clinical question. First, for our hypothesis, a placebo arm would not represent current clinical practice (no screening and no treatment). Second we were concerned that knowledge of Candida colonization might change participants behavior such that they would seek active therapy (clotrimazole vaginal preparations are available over the counter in Australia). And finally, as a vaginally administered placebo will necessarily contain an alcohol preservative, it may be biologically active and have an independent effect on vaginal flora.

Uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) — diagnosis and testing: the diagnosis can be made when a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or when a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species, and Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (< 4.5); examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered; if Candida cultures cannot be performed, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina; the majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and yeast culture remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

### Long-term outcomes of women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis after a course of maintenance antifungal therapy [^115UT8QS]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Data about long-term clinical outcome after a course of maintenance fluconazole in those with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is lacking. We aimed to determine the rate of recurrence at a minimum of 6 months after completion of maintenance therapy.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of women with Candida albicans RVVC from January 2008 to January 2017 was performed using chart review to obtain information about recurrence after maintenance therapy. Patients were considered resolved if they had no further episodes of candidiasis, sporadic with less than 3 episodes yearly and ongoing with greater than 3 episodes yearly.

Results

Approximately 1,672 patients with C. albicans vaginal isolates were identified. Of these, 201 met the criteria for RVVC. The mean age was 40.4 years; 151 (77.4%) were white, 133 (66.2%) had comorbid vulvar conditions, and 76 (37.8%) had a risk factor for vulvovaginal candidiasis. One hundred twenty complete charts were further analyzed. The mean length of follow-up after discontinuing maintenance therapy was 39.9 months. After the initial course, 23 (19.2%), 21 (17.5%), and 76 (63.3%) were resolved, sporadic and ongoing, respectively. Risk factors, comorbid vulvar conditions, obesity, menopause status, and length of therapy were not associated with relapse. Age 40 or older was associated with relapse (p = .018). Of the 201 total patients with RVVC, 22 (10.9%) of patients self-reported at least 1 adverse event. The most common was gastrointestinal symptoms (8 [4%]).

Conclusions

Although RVVC can be controlled, relapse is common after an initial course of maintenance fluconazole. Ongoing maintenance remains the most effective treatment option.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^1127pghd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Mycological eradication rates at TOC were significantly higher with ibrexafungerp (49.5% [93/188 patients]) than placebo (19.4% [19/98 patients]) (RR = 2.87 [95% CI, 1.799–4.574]; P < .001) and in patients with C. albicans (51.4% [89/173 patients]) vs 18.9% [17/90 patients]), respectively; RR = 3.06 [95% CI, 1.860–5.030]; P < .001) (Figure 2A, 2B). Mycological outcomes at FU were limited, as samples were collected in only 20% of patients (samples not required in asymptomatic patients and those who received rescue antifungals). Overall success (both clinical cure and mycological eradication) rates at TOC visit was significantly higher with ibrexafungerp (36.0% [64/178 patients]) than placebo (12.6% [12/95 patients]) (RR = 3.19 [95% CI, 1.772–5.756]; P < .001) and in patients with C. albicans (37.4% [61/163 patients] vs 12.5% [11/88 patients]); respectively; RR = 3.52 [95% CI, 1.852–6.678]; P < .001) (Figure 2A, 2B).

Before the updated FDA guidance, a common definition of clinical cure was VSS ≤ 2. In a post hoc analysis, the ibrexafungerp clinical cure rate at TOC using VSS ≤ 2 was 70% (131/188 patients). In other post hoc analyses, clinical cure and clinical improvement rates with ibrexafungerp at TOC were similar for Black patients (54.8% [40/73 patients] and 63.4% [47/73 patients], respectively) compared with the overall clinical cure and clinical improvement rates (50.5% and 64.4%, respectively). In patients with BMI > 35, clinical cure and clinical improvement rates were similar (54.5% [24/44 patients] and 68.2% [30/44 patients], respectively) to the overall clinical cure and clinical improvement rates with ibrexafungerp.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^117PnxgC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

VANISH 303 (NCT03734991) evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral ibrexafungerp compared with placebo in female patients with acute VVC. Enrolled patients were ≥ 12 years of age with acute VVC, which was defined as a minimum composite VSS of ≥ 4 with at least 2 signs or symptoms having a score ≥ 2. Other inclusion criteria included a positive microscopic examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) revealing yeast forms and a normal vaginal pH (≤ 4.5) and use of contraception in patients of reproductive potential. Exclusion criteria included any condition that may have interfered with the diagnosis or evaluation of response to therapy including mixed infections; the use of systemic and/or topical (vaginal) antifungal treatment products within 28 days of baseline; patients pregnant or lactating; patients with a known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and/or receiving treatment that could compromise their immune response; and patients with active cervical/vaginal cancer.

Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive ibrexafungerp (300-mg BID for 1 day) or matching placebo administered BID for 1 day using an interactive response system. Randomization was stratified according to diabetes mellitus diagnosis (yes or no). All site and sponsor personnel were blinded to treatment assignments except for a team member who was responsible for drug distribution logistics. Study drugs were provided by SCYNEXIS, Inc. Patients could withdraw or be discontinued from the study if they withdrew consent, experienced an adverse event (AE) that warranted study discontinuation, or were lost to FU or if the investigator believed that it was in their best interest to withdraw.

This study was conducted in accordance with the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each study site obtained institutional review board approval before study initiation and each patient provided written consent for study participation.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112zwvtH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is largely limited to azole therapy. Ibrexafungerp is a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal with broad-spectrum anti-Candida fungicidal activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrexafungerp compared with placebo in patients with acute VVC.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive ibrexafungerp (300 mg twice for 1 day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms [VSS] = 0) at test-of-cure (day 11 ± 3). Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with mycological eradication, overall success (clinical cure and mycological eradication), clinical improvement (VSS ≤ 1) at test-of-cure, and symptom resolution at follow-up (day 25 ± 4).

Results

Patients receiving ibrexafungerp had significantly higher rates of clinical cure (50.5% [95/188] vs 28.6% [28/98]; P = 0.001), mycological eradication (49.5% [93/188] vs 19.4% [19/98]; P < .001), and overall success (36.0% [64/178] vs 12.6% [12/95]; P < .001) compared with placebo. Symptom resolution was sustained and further increased with ibrexafungerp compared with placebo (59.6% [112/188] vs 44.9% [44/98]; P = 0.009) at follow-up. Post hoc analysis showed similar rates of clinical cure and clinical improvement at test-of-cure for Black patients (54.8% [40/73] and 63.4% [47/73], respectively) and patients with a body mass index > 35 (54.5% [24/44] and 68.2% [30/44], respectively) compared with overall rates. Ibrexafungerp was well tolerated. Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal and mild in severity.

Conclusions

Ibrexafungerp provides a promising safe and efficacious oral treatment that mechanistically differs from current azole treatment options for acute VVC.

Treatment

Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy (e.g. 7–14 days of topical therapy or a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.

Oral fluconazole (i.e. a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Severe VVC (i.e. extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose 72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.

Non– albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Because approximately 50% of women with a positive culture for non– albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or have no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often difficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other causes of vaginal symptoms for women with non– albicans yeast. The optimal treatment of non– albicans VVC remains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy (7–14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or topical) is recommended. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for 3 weeks is indicated. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70%. If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.

Management of Sex Partners

No data exist to support treating sex partners of patients with complicated VVC. Therefore, no recommendation can be made.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112yR1jK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Based on patient convenience and efficacy and safety data in this study, ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day was the dosage selected for further evaluation in phase 3 studies. Our study suggested comparable clinical cure rates between ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day and fluconazole at TOC. In this phase 2 study, we found it encouraging that certain parameters, such as improved and sustained VSS scores, mycological eradication at day 25, and the need for rescue medication appeared to be improved with ibrexafungerp compared with fluconazole. Because our study was not statistically powered, these initial findings will need further study to see if the observed differences are meaningful.

In 2019, the FDA provided pharmaceutical industry guidance for drug development in the treatment of VVC and recommended clinical cure, defined as the complete absence of all VSS, as the primary efficacy endpoint. In our study, a clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of VSS (VSS score = 0) by the TOC visit without the need for further antifungal treatment. Mycological eradication was not a primary endpoint, as Candida is normally found in the vagina. Given variations in efficacy outcome definitions in previous studies of VVC, historical comparisons are difficult. However, some previous studies have reported a decreased sustained response with azole treatment from day 14 to day 35. In comparison, the percentage of patients receiving ibrexafungerp with no VSS increased from 51.9% at TOC to 70.4% at day 25 in our study suggesting continued improvement and sustained efficacy.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^116hjfo3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common among women, but current azole antifungal treatments are often associated with safety and resistance issues. VT-1161 (oteseconazole) is an oral agent with increased selectivity for fungal CYP51. In this phase 2 clinical study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of VT-1161 vs fluconazole in participants with moderate to severe acute VVC.

Methods

Participants presenting with an acute episode of VVC (n = 55) were randomized to receive VT-1161 300 mg once daily (q.d.) for 3 days, 600 mg q.d. for 3 days, or 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 days or to receive a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg (FDA-approved dose to treat acute VVC). Participants were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic (clinical and mycological) cure at day 28.

Results

A larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (78.6%) groups vs the fluconazole group (62.5%); differences were not statistically significant. At 3 and 6 months, no participants in the VT-1161 groups vs 28.5% and 46.1% in the fluconazole group, respectively, had evidence of mycological recurrence. No serious adverse events or treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported.

Conclusions

The majority of participants across all treatment groups achieved therapeutic cure at day 28. VT-1161 was well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow-up.
