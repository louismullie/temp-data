## Question

Risk of anaphylaxis in vasectomized patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vasectomy increases the risk of anaphylaxis, particularly in the context of protamine administration during heparin reversal, and how to interpret and act on that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the origin of the claim linking vasectomy to protamine anaphylaxis. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of the evidence across sources. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should review current guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations for perioperative risk assessment and management, including whether pretreatment is warranted and what to do if protamine is unavoidable.

> Let me first confirm the origin of the association. Older procedural and critical care guidance documents list vasectomy among risk factors for protamine hypersensitivity, alongside prior protamine-containing insulin (NPH), fish allergy, and prior protamine exposure, and they suggest pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines when risk is suspected, although they note this has not been proven to reduce adverse effects and should not delay urgent reversal [^112n4Fi7] [^115Bw3VC].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence behind that claim. The most authoritative, contemporary drug hypersensitivity guidance concludes that fish allergy and vasectomy have been alleged as risk factors for protamine reactions, but there is no substantiated evidence to support these associations, which effectively challenges the older teaching and suggests it may be a persistent myth rather than a validated risk marker [^113pyNLR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review mechanistic plausibility. The proposed mechanism for vasectomy-related protamine allergy is cross-reactivity from antisperm antibodies generated after vasectomy binding to protamine, which contains arginine-rich motifs, but this remains theoretical and lacks supportive clinical or translational data, whereas protamine reactions are well described via IgE-mediated and non–IgE-mediated pathways, including dose-related histamine release with rapid infusion, independent of vasectomy status [^113pyNLR].

> I need to check current guideline positions to see how they reconcile this discrepancy. Modern perioperative anaphylaxis parameters emphasize established risk factors such as male sex, emergency surgery, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor exposure, and they do not list vasectomy as a recognized risk factor for perioperative anaphylaxis or protamine hypersensitivity, which aligns with the conclusion that vasectomy is not a validated risk factor [^116dJnez] [^1128GXip].

> Let me consider the clinical implications for practice. Given the lack of substantiated evidence, vasectomy alone should not trigger protamine avoidance or routine pretreatment. Instead, risk stratification should focus on better-supported factors and on administration strategies that mitigate protamine reactions, such as slow infusion not exceeding 20 mg/min and avoiding boluses greater than 50 mg over 10 minutes, with consideration of pretreatment only when there is a compelling history suggestive of protamine allergy or prior protamine-containing insulin use, recognizing that pretreatment has not been proven to prevent anaphylaxis and should not delay life-saving reversal [^115Bw3VC] [^112n4Fi7] [^113pyNLR].

> But wait, what if protamine is absolutely necessary and there is a label of "vasectomy = high risk"? I should double-check the management pathway. If protamine must be used, employ slow infusion, ensure hemodynamic monitoring, and have epinephrine readily available; if there is a convincing history of prior protamine reaction or protamine-containing insulin use, a cautious approach with premedication may be reasonable, but this is extrapolated and unproven, and the team should be prepared to treat anaphylaxis promptly if it occurs, including fluids and repeat epinephrine as indicated [^115Bw3VC] [^112n4Fi7] [^117QdEHr].

> In summary, I should confirm that vasectomy is not a validated independent risk factor for protamine-induced anaphylaxis. The association is weak, mechanistically speculative, and contradicted by high-quality contemporary guidance, so routine protamine avoidance or pretreatment solely on the basis of vasectomy is not justified, and perioperative planning should instead rely on evidence-based risk factors and best-practice administration techniques [^113pyNLR] [^116dJnez] [^112n4Fi7].

Vasectomy does not increase the risk of anaphylaxis in general or perioperative settings. The only context where vasectomy has been linked to anaphylaxis is with **protamine sulfate** during heparin reversal, and even there the evidence is weak and inconsistent [^113pyNLR]. No guideline lists vasectomy as a risk factor for anaphylaxis, and routine allergy precautions are not indicated for vasectomized patients. If protamine is required, standard slow-infusion protocols and clinical vigilance suffice; pretreatment is not routinely recommended [^112n4Fi7] [^115Bw3VC].

---

## Evidence linking vasectomy to anaphylaxis

- **Protamine sulfate reactions**: Older anesthesia and critical care literature suggested vasectomy might increase protamine hypersensitivity risk, likely due to theoretical cross-reactivity with sperm proteins or fish allergens, but this remains unsubstantiated [^113pyNLR].

- **Contemporary evidence**: Recent allergy literature concludes there is no substantiated evidence that vasectomy increases protamine allergy risk, and vasectomy is not listed as a risk factor in current perioperative anaphylaxis guidelines [^113pyNLR].

- **Mechanistic plausibility**: The proposed mechanism is weak; no robust clinical or immunologic data support a causal link between vasectomy and protamine anaphylaxis [^113pyNLR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) **do not list vasectomy as a risk factor** for anaphylaxis. When protamine is indicated, standard slow-infusion protocols and clinical vigilance are recommended; pretreatment is not routinely advised [^116oB9Ss] [^115Bw3VC].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **General anesthesia**: Vasectomy does not increase anaphylaxis risk during general anesthesia; standard perioperative allergy precautions apply [^notfound].

- **Protamine administration**: If protamine is required, use slow infusion (≤ 20 mg/min) and monitor closely; pretreatment is not routinely indicated for vasectomized patients [^112n4Fi7] [^115Bw3VC].

- **Patient counseling**: Explain that vasectomy does not increase anaphylaxis risk, and no special allergy precautions are needed for routine care or surgery [^113pyNLR].

## Summary of evidence

| **Context** | **Evidence regarding anaphylaxis risk in vasectomized patients** |
|-|-|
| General anesthesia | No evidence of increased risk |
| Protamine sulfate administration | Weak, inconsistent evidence; not supported by recent guidelines |
| Clinical guidelines | Vasectomy not listed as a risk factor for anaphylaxis |

---

Vasectomy does not increase anaphylaxis risk in general or perioperative care. The only debated context is protamine use, where evidence is weak and guidelines do not support special precautions for vasectomized patients.

Perioperative anaphylaxis — testing, timing, and re-exposure: We suggest that immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (percutaneous and intradermal) and/or in vitro–specific IgE testing be performed, when available, to all potential pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic culprits used during the perioperative period. If testing is not possible, we suggest referral to another center or, if necessary, use of the most efficacious agents structurally dissimilar from the most likely culprit. We suggest that immediate hypersensitivity testing to suspected culprit (and alternative) agents be delayed after POA, unless repeat surgery cannot be postponed. If surgery with general anesthesia is needed sooner, then testing may be performed when needed. We suggest that challenges be performed, when feasible, to all potential culprit agents to which skin and/or in vitro testing is negative, before or in conjunction with the use of these agents for a future surgical procedure. We suggest that repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision-making and as directed by history and results of diagnostic evaluation.

Unfractionated heparin reversal — protamine sulfate dosing, kinetics, monitoring, and hypersensitivity risk — states that one milligram of protamine sulfate will neutralize approximately 100 units of heparin; after an IV bolus of 5,000 units of heparin, about 50 mg of protamine sulfate is given. Protamine sulfate has a half-life of about 7 min, and because the half-life of IV heparin is 60 to 90 min when given as an IV infusion, only heparin from the preceding several hours should be considered when calculating protamine dosing. For continuous infusion at 1,250 units/h, approximately 30 mg neutralizes heparin delivered in the past 2 to 2.5 h. Neutralization of subcutaneously administered heparin may require a prolonged infusion of protamine sulfate, the aPTT can be used to assess effectiveness, and administering the protamine slowly minimizes severe reactions such as hypotension or bradycardia. Patients who have previously received protamine sulfate-containing insulin, undergone vasectomy, or have known sensitivity to fish are at increased risk for allergic reactions including anaphylaxis; if there is concern about allergy, patients can be pretreated with corticosteroids and antihistamines. Although other substances/devices (hexadimethrine [Polybrene], PF4, heparinase [Neutralase], extracorporeal heparin removal devices, synthetic protamine variants) can neutralize UFH, none is approved for clinical use.

### Anaphylaxis: guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^1157MQJ9]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency, and all healthcare professionals should be familiar with its recognition and acute and ongoing management. These guidelines have been prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Taskforce on Anaphylaxis. They aim to provide evidence-based recommendations for the recognition, risk factor assessment, and the management of patients who are at risk of, are experiencing, or have experienced anaphylaxis. While the primary audience is allergists, these guidelines are also relevant to all other healthcare professionals. The development of these guidelines has been underpinned by two systematic reviews of the literature, both on the epidemiology and on clinical management of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening condition whose clinical diagnosis is based on recognition of a constellation of presenting features. First-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular adrenaline. Useful second-line interventions may include removing the trigger where possible, calling for help, correct positioning of the patient, high-flow oxygen, intravenous fluids, inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, and nebulized adrenaline. Discharge arrangements should involve an assessment of the risk of further reactions, a management plan with an anaphylaxis emergency action plan, and, where appropriate, prescribing an adrenaline auto-injector. If an adrenaline auto-injector is prescribed, education on when and how to use the device should be provided. Specialist follow-up is essential to investigate possible triggers, to perform a comprehensive risk assessment, and to prevent future episodes by developing personalized risk reduction strategies including, where possible, commencing allergen immunotherapy. Training for the patient and all caregivers is essential. There are still many gaps in the evidence base for anaphylaxis.

PH symptoms and exposure history — PH is a multisystem disorder, and it is characterized by skin lesions including urticaria, eczema, erythema multiforme, papulopustular lesions, vesiculobullous and vesiculopustular lesions, as well as stomatitis; non-dermatologic hypersensitivity symptoms including asthma and anaphylaxis have also been described, and both non-dermatologic and dermatologic manifestations have been described in the same patient. Use of high-dose progestogens in women undergoing in vitro fertilization may predispose them to the development of PH and make it difficult for patients to undergo fertility treatment, and a careful history of both symptom timing and exposures is crucial to making the diagnosis of PH.

### Identification and management of perioperative anaphylaxis [^114cMeUT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors present a case of a patient with multiple episodes of perioperative anaphylaxis. The incidence and the most common causes of perioperative anaphylaxis are reviewed. The most common causes can vary by country and the type of perioperative medications used. The unique environment and the multiple medications and substances used in the anesthesia and surgical setting that make a definitive diagnosis challenging are outlined. A systematic strategy to recognize the reaction, identify the culprit, and direct future management are demonstrated. Management of the patient experiencing perioperative anaphylaxis requires close collaboration between the anesthesia, surgical, and allergy teams.

### Adverse reactions to drugs and biologics in patients with clonal mast cell disorders: a Work group report of the mast cells disorder committee, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^116KdEE4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Adverse drug reactions during anesthesia in mastocytosis (Box 1) are addressed with risk identification and perioperative planning, noting that patients at greater risk of adverse reactions during anesthesia are those with a history of anaphylaxis, those who have undergone major surgeries, and those who have been exposed to general anesthesia. The benefit of administration of prophylactic antimediator therapy before anesthetic procedures has not been thoroughly evaluated, and there is no consensus about their routine administration, and premedication is recommended in patients with previous perioperative anaphylaxis in need of future general anesthesia if the culprit agent has not been identified. A reasonable approach is to choose those drugs with low capacity to elicit mast cell (MC) degranulation in each pharmacologic group and to use drugs with known tolerance by individual patients, with examples including aminosteroids, neuromuscular blockers, short-acting synthetic opioids, and amide derivatives among local anesthetics. After perioperative anaphylaxis, obtain a serum tryptase value 15 to 60 minutes after the acute episode and 24 or more hours after resolution of the episode. A complete allergic work-up before anesthesia is recommended for patients with mastocytosis who have experienced perioperative mediator-related symptoms in the past; however, routine preoperative skin testing with drugs to be used is not recommended.

### Perioperative anaphylaxis: diagnosis, evaluation, and management [^111QKooN]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Perioperative anaphylaxis can occur during or after surgery and can have life-threatening consequences. As anesthesia protocols become more complex and incorporate multiple agents to regulate physiologic processes intraoperatively, perioperative anaphylaxis is becoming increasingly recognized. The allergist should obtain detailed records from the anesthesiologist in order to perform appropriate testing to identify the likely causative agents. Testing should ideally be performed 4 to 6 weeks after the reaction to account for a refractory period after mast cell activation. This article includes 2 cases of perioperative anaphylaxis and reviews the historical elements that must be considered after a reaction has occurred.

Boxed warning regarding the use of testosterone undecanoate IM (also known as Kyzatrex, Aveed, Tlando, Jatenzo) and pulmonary oil microembolism, anaphylaxis: use extreme caution, as intramuscular testosterone undecanoate can cause serious pulmonary oil microembolism (POME) reactions (e.g., cough, dyspnea, syncope) and anaphylaxis, including life-threatening events. These reactions can occur at any time during therapy. Monitor patients for 30 minutes post-injection for potential adverse events. Intramuscular testosterone undecanoate is available only through the AVEED REMS Program due to the risk of serious POME reactions and anaphylaxis.

### The revenge of unintended consequences of anaphylaxis-risk overdiagnosis: how far we have come and how far we have to Go [^112s2uSW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Overdiagnosis of anaphylaxis risk is an underappreciated aspect of anaphylaxis prevention. Whereas the benefits of anaphylaxis-risk prevention are well known, potential harms resulting from preemptive approaches to mitigate anaphylaxis-risk are not insignificant. Still, great progress has been made in recent years to avoid the unintended consequences of anaphylaxis-risk overdiagnosis. Reflection on recent advances in the use of diagnostic testing, as well as the application of diagnostic labels, provides an important perspective to understand how far the specialty of allergy and immunology has come in improving the lives of patients and families. Examples of recent paradigm shifts in anaphylaxis-risk management include approaches to peanut allergy prevention without screening, deferral of corticosteroids to prevent biphasic anaphylaxis reactions, reevaluation of reflex use of emergency medical services for resolved community anaphylaxis, and an approach to penicillin allergy delabeling with direct oral challenge. Routine medical practices to decrease anaphylaxis risk can have lifelong impacts for patients-beyond just preventing anaphylaxis. As our understanding of these trade-offs evolves, it becomes necessary to weigh both the benefits and the harms of past management approaches. Because medicine remains a science of uncertainty and an art of probability, a critical approach to risk mitigation remains necessary to find the often-elusive balance in anaphylaxis prevention.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^116M7pYJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Epinephrine autoinjectors: when and how to prescribe — guidance covers prescribing to higher-risk patients, quantity decisions, administration timing, emergency activation, adverse event counseling, cost and device selection factors, and follow-up education. We recommend clinicians routinely prescribe EAIs to patients at higher risk of anaphylaxis, and when deciding whether to prescribe EAIs to lower-risk patients, we suggest that clinicians engage in a shared decision-making process that considers patients' risk factors, values, and preferences. We suggest that in jurisdictions where single-packs of EAIs are available, clinicians consider a patient's risk factors, values, preferences, and contextual factors when deciding whether to prescribe only one vs multiple EAIs, and we suggest they routinely prescribe more than one EAI when patients have previously required multiple doses of epinephrine and/or have a history of biphasic reactions. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers to give epinephrine at the first sign of suspected anaphylaxis and, in general, not to give epinephrine preemptively to an asymptomatic patient. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients that immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required with prompt, complete, durable response when additional epinephrine and care are readily available, and we suggest that patients always activate emergency medical services after epinephrine use if anaphylaxis is severe, fails to resolve promptly or completely or nearly completely, or returns or worsens. Serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine are rare and should not pose a barrier to prescription or early administration when indicated, and to manage risk we recommend counseling on proper EAI use, common side effects, and the need for immediate evaluation if serious adverse event signs or symptoms develop. We suggest discussing potential financial and psychosocial burdens during shared decision-making, and when selecting an EAI we suggest considering dosage, needle length, affordability, access, and patient treatment preferences. During visits after prescribing EAIs, we recommend routinely reviewing carriage, storage, and use; encouraging regular practice with a trainer device; and discussing strategies to manage barriers to adherence.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117LDSMa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Vasectomy — reliability for contraception and postprocedure recommendations: Semen analysis should be performed 8–16 weeks after a vasectomy to ensure the procedure was successful; the patient should abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until confirmation of vasectomy success by postvasectomy semen analysis; the patient should refrain from ejaculation for approximately 1 week after the vasectomy; motile sperm disappear within a few weeks after vasectomy, and by 12 weeks after the vasectomy, 80% of men have azoospermia and almost all others have rare nonmotile sperm (defined as ≤ 100,000 nonmotile sperm per mL); when azoospermia or rare nonmotile sperm has been achieved, patients can rely on the vasectomy for contraception, although not with 100% certainty, and the risk for pregnancy after a man has achieved postvasectomy azoospermia is approximately one in 2,000; a median of 78% (range = 33%–100%; across studies) of men return for a single postvasectomy semen analysis.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^115Qk24u]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) — risk‑stratified prescribing and context: Epinephrine is universally recommended as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, yet the rate of EAI prescription for patients at risk of anaphylaxis remains suboptimal. Recommendation 23 (CBS): We suggest clinicians routinely prescribe EAls to patients at higher risk of anaphylaxis. When deciding whether to prescribe EAls to lower risk patients, we suggest that clinicians engage in a shared decision-making process that considers the patients' risk factors, values, and preferences. Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of Evidence: Very Low. Allergic reactions range in severity from mild skin manifestations to life-threatening anaphylaxis, and there are risk factors that significantly increase the relative risk of anaphylaxis, although the absolute risk may remain small. For patients with food allergy, even small amounts of causative allergen may potentially trigger an allergic reaction — including anaphylaxis in some cases, and for some, EAI prescriptions are linked to improved quality of life; however, virtually all clinical trials report some severe allergic reactions.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^115ZJe2T]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2020 JTFPP recommends extended observation for patients with severe initial symptoms of anaphylaxis, based on a meta-analysis which found biphasic anaphylaxis was associated with a more severe initial presentation (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.23–3.61) or administration of > 1 dose of adrenaline (OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.70–8.58). The JTFPP otherwise suggests that 1 h observation may be reasonable for low-risk patients with resolved non-severe anaphylaxis; this is supported by a 2019 meta-analysis which reported that 1 h observation would capture 95.0% (95%CI 99.0–97.3%) of biphasic reactions. Extending this interval would only impact slightly on the rate of biphasic reactions "captured": 96.5% (95%CI 93.4–98.2%) for 4 h, 97.3% (95%CI 95.0–98.5%) for 6 h and 98.2% (95%CI 96.7–99.1%) for 12 h observation. Prolonged observation is inconvenient for many patients (and their carers), and is not cost-effective for patients at low risk of biphasic reactions.

After considering the available evidence, the working group was concerned that the previous RCUK recommendation might offer false reassurance in terms of mitigating against the risk of biphasic reaction. To balance the risks and benefits involved, we instead propose a pragmatic, risk-stratified and individualised approach to determining the length of observation following anaphylaxis (Table 5).

### Risks and complications of vasectomy [^1136a8y3]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Vasectomy is a safe and effective procedure for permanent contraception. Vasectomy is 30 times less likely to fail and 20 times less likely to have postoperative complications than its gynecologic counterpart. Complications from vasectomy are rare and minor in nature. Immediate risks include infection, hematoma, and pain. Complications seldom lead to hospitalization or aggressive medical management. Technique is surgeon dependent; however, certain techniques, such as fascial interposition, seem to decrease rates of vasectomy failure. Despite myriad vasectomy techniques, failure rates are less than those seen with tubal ligation. Available data suggest that vasectomized men do not seem at increased risk for immune-complex diseases.

### Anaphylaxis. what is monitored to make a diagnosis? How is therapy monitored? [^111ghcAT]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is one of the most life-threatening emergencies that can occur in the perioperative period. Multiple agents can be responsible, and nonallergic reactions can mimic anaphylaxis. Developing a therapeutic plan for the acute therapy of anaphylaxis is important. Prompt recognition with appropriate and aggressive therapy can help avoid a disastrous outcome.

### Polidocanol (Varithena) [^111LXec3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis. (5.1)
Tissue ischemia and necrosis: do not inject intra-arterially. (5.2)
Venous Thrombosis. (5.3)

5.1	Anaphylaxis

Severe allergic reactions have been reported following administration of liquid polidocanol, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Observe patients for at least 10 minutes following injection and be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately.

5.2	Tissue Ischemia and Necrosis

Intra-arterial injection or extravasation of polidocanol can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene Patients with underlying arterial disease, such as marked peripheral arteriosclerosis or thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's Disease) may be at increased risk for tissue ischemia. If intra-arterial injection of polidocanol occurs, consult a vascular surgeon immediately.

5.3 Venous Thrombosis

VARITHENA can cause venous thrombosis [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Follow administration instructions closely and monitor for signs of venous thrombosis after treatment. Patients with reduced mobility, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or recent (within 3 months) major surgery, prolonged hospitalization, or pregnancy are at increased risk for developing thrombosis.

Perioperative anaphylaxis (POA) — risk, likely culprits, and post-event evaluation are described: POA has a greater risk of death than other anaphylaxis types and occurs at a rate of 1.53 per 100,000 cases; multiple agents are often given in close succession, and antibiotics and paralytics (neuromuscular blocking agents [NMBAs]) are more common culprits. After POA, repeat anesthesia may proceed with shared decision-making guided by history and diagnostic results; immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (percutaneous and intradermal, if available) and/or in vitro–specific IgE testing should be performed to all potential and prominent pharmacologic culprits, including alternatives available at the facility. Delaying immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for 4 to 6 weeks after anaphylaxis is generally recommended due to a refractory period; graded challenge of agents with negative test results can proceed safely, and if testing or challenge is not feasible, avoidance of culprit exposures may be considered if equally efficacious, structurally unrelated alternatives are available.

Patients receiving β-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications — We suggest that patients with a history of insect sting anaphylaxis who are not receiving VIT may continue BB or ACEI medications when the medical necessity of the daily medication outweighs the chance of increased severity of anaphylaxis to a sting. We suggest that VIT may be prescribed to patients with a history of insect sting anaphylaxis who are treated with BB or ACEI medication, with shared decision-making regarding the potential benefits and potential harms of concurrent VIT treatment and medication, compared with withholding either the treatment or the medication. We suggest that, in most cases, treatment with BB or ACEI medication need not be changed or discontinued in patients receiving maintenance VIT. We suggest use of initial AIT may be considered in patients who are treated with BB or ACEI medication, with shared decision-making, and it would be preferable to replace the BB or ACEI, if there is a safe and effective alternative. We suggest that patients receiving maintenance dose AIT have minimal increased risk of severe anaphylactic reaction when receiving BB/ACEI medication and may consider continuing AIT and medications based on shared decision-making. For planned procedures, if the BB/ACEI medication cannot be safely interrupted, we suggest a shared decision-making discussion of the medical necessity of the procedure, the relative risk of anaphylaxis, the possibility of more severe reaction if the medication is continued, and the risk of stopping the medication. We suggest that all patients at significant risk for recurrent and unexpected anaphylaxis should be counseled about the risk of more severe anaphylaxis, and consider avoiding, where possible, the use of nonselective BBs or ACEIs.

### Vasectomy: an update [^115Gj73C]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Vasectomy remains an important option for contraception. Research findings have clarified many questions regarding patient selection, optimal technique, postsurgical follow-up, and risk of long-term complications. Men who receive vasectomies tend to be non-Hispanic whites, well educated, married or cohabitating, relatively affluent, and have private health insurance. The strongest predictor for wanting a vasectomy reversal is age younger than 30 years at the time of the procedure. Evidence supports the use of the no-scalpel technique to access the vasa, because it is associated with the fewest complications. The technique with the lowest failure rate is cauterization of the vasa with or without fascial interposition. The ligation techniques should be used cautiously, if at all, and only in combination with fascial interposition or cautery. A single postvasectomy semen sample at 12 weeks that shows rare, nonmotile sperm or azoospermia is acceptable to confirm sterility. No data show that vasectomy increases the risk of prostate or testicular cancer.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^114W7GrB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Allergy history-based evaluation and risk stratification tools can assess patients across all common drug allergy classes. Given the high prevalence of drug allergy labels and low rate of drug hypersensitivity confirmation, it is essential to identify those who are low-risk, as these individuals may be able to continue their care without an allergy specialist evaluation with the use of standardized collaborative protocols for rechallenge or desensitization. We recommend that all hospitals and ambulatory centers work with allergy specialists to consider low-risk approaches for each drug category to optimize the quality and safety of care (Figure 1). Low-risk patients and patients with non — immune-mediated reactions could be evaluated outside the allergy setting or with telehealth (e-consults) guiding care. Then, allergists could focus on the patients reporting moderate/high-risk reactions (eg, PEN-FAST more than 3) or higher-risk hosts (eg, patients with cystic fibrosis on home oxygen, pregnancy, pending bypass surgery, and hemodynamically unstable).

Any collaborative approach that includes nonallergists should include clear protocols, informed consent training, allergy record documentation training, and anaphylaxis training. All clinical sites where drug challenges or desensitizations are supervised should be equipped to diagnose and treat anaphylaxis. Finally, standardized recommendations for patients should be provided regarding the risk of reactions in the future. Patients with a reaction after delabeling should be instructed to document their reaction and seek evaluation by allergy/immunology.

There has been a recent paradigm shift in drug allergy, whereby allergy specialist assessment may not be necessary for all low-risk drug allergy patients, particularly for the low-risk penicillin allergyelabeled patient. Additional work is required to identify the best approach for non — β-lactam antibiotics, NSAIDs, contrast agents, and chemotherapeutics.

### Fatal anaphylaxis: mortality rate and risk factors [^115DDqZ3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We have summarized key clinical indicators of increased risk for fatal anaphylaxis and highlighted information that might be used for stratifying risk and making treatment decisions in at-risk patients. Published reports of fatal anaphylaxis have generally been obtained from national registers of death certificate data, and these data are subject to underreporting, miscoding, and significant discrepancies in coronial notification and subsequent investigation of suspected fatal anaphylaxis. In some regions, death from food or insect anaphylaxis may be coded as due to "natural causes". In most published datasets, a significant proportion of fatal anaphylaxis cases are classified as "unspecified cause". Improved diagnostic codes for anaphylaxis, and the maintenance of fatal anaphylaxis registries, are important to ensure data quality. With these caveats in mind, the available data do suggest that fatal anaphylaxis is a very rare event, and although fatal drug anaphylaxis may be increasing, data do not consistently support a change in incidence of fatal food or venom anaphylaxis in recent years. This may in part be due to improved delivery of emergency medical care and increased availability of epinephrine autoinjectors limiting any potential increase in anaphylaxis fatalities. Risk factors for fatal anaphylaxis are mainly cause-specific, although increased age and cardiovascular comorbidity are common risk factors for fatal venom and drug anaphylaxis, and upright posture during anaphylaxis is a feature of fatal venom and food reactions. Further work should focus on improving our ability to identify those at risk and prevent fatal anaphylaxis, amongst populations with known allergy to drugs, food, and venom.

Table 18 — risk factors and cofactors potentially associated with severe or fatal anaphylaxis are organized by trigger. Drug-induced anaphylaxis risk factors include Age > 60 y, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and antihypertensive drugs. Food-induced anaphylaxis risk factors include adolescence, uncontrolled asthma, alcohol consumption, peanut- or tree nut-induced reaction, and exercise. Venom bite- or sting-induced anaphylaxis risk factors include older age, male sex, hereditary α-tryptasemia, mast cell disorders, cardiovascular diseases, NSAIDs, and antihypertensive drugs. Non-trigger–related cofactors/risk factors listed are mast cell disorders, infections, perimenstrual period, NSAIDs, alcohol consumption, psychological burden, exercise, and unknown cause; NSAIDs refers to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Vasectomy: common questions and answers [^111Qutco]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasectomy is a highly effective form of permanent contraception. It is as effective as tubal sterilization and is safer, less costly, and associated with quicker recovery. In the United States, only 4% of men ages 18 to 45 years have had a vasectomy, indicating that it is underused despite the benefits. Vasectomy is typically performed in the outpatient setting, and most patients return to regular physical and sexual activity after 1 week. Opioids and antibiotics are not routinely needed. The no-scalpel vasectomy and other minimally invasive techniques for approaching and isolating the vas deferens have the lowest occurrence of adverse events such as hematoma, infection, sperm granuloma, recanalization, and chronic scrotal pain. After the vas deferens is isolated and segment is removed, mucosal cautery alone or facial interposition with mucosal cautery of both ends or abdominal end have occlusion failure rates of less than 1%. The addition of fascial interposition improves rates and decreases the time to azoospermia on semen analysis without a significant increase in adverse outcomes. Sterility is confirmed 3 months after vasectomy with a semen analysis that shows rare, nonmotile sperm (100,000/mL or fewer) on microscopy. Although vasectomy should be considered permanent, up to 6% of patients seek reversal. Successful reversal rates (return of sperm to semen) are high; however, pregnancy rates are variable.

### The pathophysiology of anaphylaxis [^11546DQr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anaphylaxis:

- **Definition**: Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of anaphylaxis involves the release of inflammatory mediators, primarily through the activation of IgE antibodies. This leads to systemic inflammation and can affect multiple organ systems.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of anaphylaxis in the US is estimated at 49.8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis are diverse and can include skin reactions (such as hives and itching), respiratory distress, cardiovascular complications (such as hypotension and tachycardia), gastrointestinal symptoms (such as vomiting and diarrhea), and psychological symptoms like anxiety.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of anaphylaxis can be severe, with the potential for rapid deterioration and fatal outcomes if not promptly treated. The severity of anaphylaxis can range from mild to severe.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^116dJnez]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anaphylaxis (POA) — incidence, mortality, risk factors, and mediator testing are summarized with quantified parameters. POA "occurs at a rate of 15.3 per 100,000 cases" and "can result in 2% excess mortality", and "has a greater risk of death than other forms of anaphylaxis". A multivariate analysis reported that "independent risk factors associated with a fatal outcome included: male sex… emergency surgery… history of hypertension… or other CVD… obesity… and BB exposure". For mediator testing, a French study observed an increase in serum tryptase "in 68% of suspected IgE-mediated POA but in only 4% of non–IgE–mediated POA". Using an "elevated serum tryptase level (> 11.4 ng/mL)", the "sensitivity (64%) and specificity (89%)" correspond to "a calculated positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 6 and a negative LR of 0.4". Interpretation is "based on international consensus recommendations noting a 1.2-fold increase plus 2 ng/mL", with timing important because the concentration "peaks within 30 to 90 minutes" and "returns to baseline in approximately 120 minutes (but up to 4 hours or more)", and tryptase "is stable for as long as 1 year" if frozen. Plasma histamine measurement "is generally not recommended", though "within 30 minutes of POA, a plasma histamine determination may be of value". Additional nuance includes that in mastocytosis or hereditary α-tryptasemia, a study found "a threshold acute/baseline tryptase level of 1.685", and to document a rise, "a repeat measurement should be performed when the patient has recovered to provide a baseline tryptase level".

### Risk of angioedema following invasive or surgical procedures in HAE type I and II – the natural history [^111uDNGz]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

To cite this article: Aygören-Pürsün E, Martinez Saguer I, Kreuz W, Klingebiel T, Schwabe D. Risk of angioedema following invasive or surgical procedures in HAE type I and II - the natural history. Allergy 2013; 68: 1034–1039.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant condition caused by a deficiency in C1-inhibitor (C1-INH), the primary control protein for the complement system that regulates vascular permeability–. In 85% of affected patients, the levels of functional C1-INH are low (~30% of normal levels) (HAE-I), while 15% of patients have normal or raised levels of nonfunctional C1-INH (HAE-II). C1-INH deficiency results in inappropriate or excessive activation of the complement pathway and allows the activation of kallikrein, which leads to production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin.

Clinical symptoms of HAE include edema of the subcutaneous (SC) tissues of the extremities, abdomen, face and larynx. Untreated attacks normally last for 3–5 days, and edema of the upper airways is considered life-threatening due to the risk of asphyxiation. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in childhood, with increased symptoms often seen during puberty, and recurrent attacks occurring throughout life. In most cases, HAE attacks are spontaneous in nature, and trigger factors cannot generally be identified, resulting in unpredictable first manifestations and recurrences. However, specific trigger factors associated with HAE attacks include oral surgery (including dental work), mechanical stress and exertion, minor injuries and trauma, infections, emotional stress and excitement, insect stings, certain foods and medicines, and menstruation. Precise trigger factors can vary from patient to patient and even within patients, thus making management of the disorder difficult.

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^1122WH64]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Vasectomy — Appendix B patient information states that vasectomy does not produce immediate sterility and that another form of contraception must be used until sterility is confirmed by the finding of no sperm or at most rare non-moving sperm on a semen analysis; it takes about 8–16 weeks before you can be sure that you are sterile, with confirmation by a post-vasectomy semen analysis (also known as PVSA). Even after sterility is confirmed, pregnancy occurs in 1 of 2,000 couples and the rare pregnancies can occur at any time, even years later. A second vasectomy is occasionally necessary when the original vasectomy does not produce sterility, and the chance that you will need a second vasectomy is less than 1%. Early complications include bleeding and infection, and the risk of these complications is 1–2%; medical journals report that about 1–2% of men develop significant chronic pain in the scrotal sac after vasectomy. Vasectomy does not cause any physical change in sexual performance, function, pleasure, sensation, interest, desire, satisfaction, penile erection, volume of semen or ejaculation. For fertility after vasectomy, options include vasectomy reversal and sperm retrieval with in vitro fertilization, and overall, about 50% of couples are able to have children with these techniques.

### Anaphylaxis: evidence-based long-term risk reduction in the community [^114wdKDs]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis occurs frequently in the community, and it can be fatal in community settings. Risk assessment and risk reduction should ideally be coordinated by an allergy/immunology specialist and focus on: (1) prevention of subsequent anaphylaxis episodes, (2) emergency preparedness, and (3) anaphylaxis education. Preventive strategies should include trigger avoidance, specific preventive measures, and optimal management of comorbidities. Despite best efforts to avoid anaphylaxis triggers they can be encountered inadvertently, and anaphylaxis episodes can and do recur. Risk reduction therefore also focuses on emergency preparedness: carrying self-injectable epinephrine, having a personalized Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan, and wearing accurate medical identification. Anaphylaxis education should involve not only at-risk individuals and their families, but also health care professionals and the general public.

We suggest that in jurisdictions where single-packs of EAIs are available, clinicians consider a patient's risk factors for severe anaphylaxis, their values and preferences, and contextual factors when deciding whether to prescribe only 1 vs multiple EAIs, and we suggest they routinely prescribe more than one EAI when patients have previously required multiple doses of epinephrine to treat an episode of anaphylaxis and/or have a history of biphasic reactions.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

There are limited clinical data available for LAGEVRIO. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with LAGEVRIO use.

5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAGEVRIO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of LAGEVRIO in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes; therefore, LAGEVRIO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. When considering LAGEVRIO for a pregnant individual, the prescribing healthcare provider must communicate the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy to the pregnant individual. LAGEVRIO is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use LAGEVRIO during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual.

Advise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently, as applicable, during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Prior to initiating treatment with LAGEVRIO, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated. Pregnancy status does not need to be confirmed in patients who have undergone permanent sterilization, are currently using an intrauterine system or contraceptive implant, or in whom pregnancy is not possible. In all other patients, assess whether the patient is pregnant based on the first day of last menstrual period in individuals who have regular menstrual cycles, is using a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently or have had a negative pregnancy test. A pregnancy test is recommended if the individual has irregular menstrual cycles, is unsure of the first day of last menstrual period or is not using effective contraception correctly and consistently [see Box].

5.2 Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with LAGEVRIO. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue LAGEVRIO and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Unfractionated heparin — protamine safety and administration considerations include that protamine should not be administered at a rate greater than 20 mg/min and no more than 50 mg should be given over any 10-min period, and adverse reactions (anaphylaxis, hypotension, bradycardia, and bronchoconstriction) are dose-dependent but can be attenuated by slowing the infusion. Patients who have previously received certain formulations of insulin (e.g., neutral protamine Hagedorn, or NPH), have undergone vasectomy, or have a known allergy to fish may be at increased risk of adverse reactions, and patients considered at risk for allergy may be pre-treated with corticosteroids and histamines, although this has not been shown to definitively decrease the risk of adverse effects and should not delay reversal. Recombinant Factor VIIa has demonstrated efficacy in reversing UFH in animal studies and case reports, although it remains unknown if there are any benefits over the use of protamine.

Reported risk factors include male sex, emergency surgery, history of hypertension or other cardiovascular disease, obesity, and BB exposure. The most common culprits are antibiotics and neuromuscular blocking agents. When a reaction occurs during an operation, a serum tryptase level drawn within 30 minutes of the reaction has been shown to be helpful in determining whether POA has occurred, and most data use the 20% + 2 rule.

Protamine hypersensitivity — phenotypes, triggers, and evidence — includes immediate reactions with urticaria, hypotension, and anaphylaxis via IgE- and non–IgE-mediated mechanisms, and dose-dependent hypotension after rapid infusion likely from nonspecific histamine release. Protamine is a rare cause of intraoperative anaphylaxis, most often reported during cardiac surgeries when quick reversal of heparin is required. Although fish allergy and vasectomy have been alleged as risk factors, there is no substantiated evidence to support this claim. Delayed hypersensitivity with erythematous plaques at injection sites has been reported to protamine-containing insulin, with 1 report including eosinophilia and renal dysfunction.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^112iAu8T]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

This practice parameter update focuses on 7 areas in which there are new evidence and new recommendations. Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis have been revised, and patterns of anaphylaxis are defined. Measurement of serum tryptase is important for diagnosis of anaphylaxis and to identify underlying mast cell disorders. In infants and toddlers, age-specific symptoms may differ from older children and adults, patient age is not correlated with reaction severity, and anaphylaxis is unlikely to be the initial reaction to an allergen on first exposure. Different community settings for anaphylaxis require specific measures for prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis. Optimal prescribing and use of epinephrine autoinjector devices require specific counseling and training of patients and caregivers, including when and how to administer the epinephrine autoinjector and whether and when to call 911. If epinephrine is used promptly, immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required if the patient experiences a prompt, complete, and durable response. For most medical indications, the risk of stopping or changing beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication may exceed the risk of more severe anaphylaxis if the medication is continued, especially in patients with insect sting anaphylaxis. Evaluation for mastocytosis, including a bone marrow biopsy, should be considered for adult patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis or recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis. After perioperative anaphylaxis, repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision-making and based on the history and results of diagnostic evaluation with skin tests or in vitro tests when available, and supervised challenge when necessary.

Literature searches used MEDLINE and POPLINE "from January 1949 to August 2011". Operative procedure inclusion criteria were conventional vasectomy (CV) and minimally-invasive vasectomy (MIV), including the no-scalpel vasectomy (NSV); all methods for occluding the vas, all settings, and all ages were included. Study designs were broadly included "except for single-group cohort studies on immediate post-operative complications with fewer than 500 participants". The evidence base was built after screening "Nearly 2,000 citations", resulting in "275 articles". Exclusions from scope were laparoscopic vasectomy, vasectomy reversal, post-vasectomy options for pregnancy, treatment of post-vasectomy pain syndrome, examination of antibodies to antigens other than sperm post-vasectomy, techniques for teaching vasectomy, and articles on antibiotic prophylaxis as covered by an AUA Best Practice Policy. Quality assessment for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative observational studies used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Vasectomies are safe and effective, achieving up to 99.7% in sterilization, with complication rates around 1–2%. As vasectomy uptake rises, physicians should stay informed about counseling, isolation and occlusion techniques, post-op recovery, and associated risks and complications. Historically, pre-vasectomy counseling has been performed in-person, but recent literature has shown that telehealth is a viable alternative, and a physical exam may not be necessitated. With regard to vas isolation and occlusion, current international guidelines support a minimally invasive approach such as no-scalpel vasectomy with mucosal cautery and fascial interposition, as they are the most effective in achieving vasectomy success and have the lowest complication rates. After a vasectomy, patients should undergo a post-vasectomy semen analysis 8–16 weeks after the procedure to ensure severe non-motile oligozoospermia (≤ 100,000 non-motile sperm/mL) or azoospermia. While risks and complications from vas isolation and occlusion are rare, patients should be informed about the potential for hematomas, infections, postoperative pain, and vas recanalization. In the U.S, vasectomies have increased in utilization from previous years, likely in the setting of increased access to telehealth and restricted female reproductive access. This trend raises questions about future fertility options such as vasectomy reversals and highlights the need for informed decision-making.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^115fRaPz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Despite numerous national and international guidelines and consensus statements, common misconceptions still persist in terms of diagnosis and appropriate management, both among healthcare professionals and patient/carers. We address some of these misconceptions and highlight the optimal approach for patients who experience potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^117VFVAd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Beta-blockers (BBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) — in patients at risk for anaphylaxis, clinicians should weigh potential benefits and harms, as these medications are associated with an increased relative risk that any anaphylactic reaction will be more severe, although the absolute risk is small, and one should not assume automatically that they are absolutely contraindicated; patients on maintenance immunotherapy (VIT, SCIT, or SLIT) face minimal risk and no change in medication is needed, while patients already on VIT for sting anaphylaxis, those initiating VIT, and those considering SCIT should be counseled about the increase in relative risk (but only a small increase in absolute risk) and discuss equally safe and effective alternatives with the prescribing clinician; modeling in cardiovascular disease suggests BBs increased estimated life expectancy by 9.4 and 17.4 months and were preferred unless annual moderate-to-severe anaphylaxis exceeded 6% and 15% for post–myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, respectively.

### Anaphylaxis: recognition and management… [^111VMXLU]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The average fatality rate is 0. 3% for most hospitalizations or emergency department presentations for anaphylaxis. 5 Risk factors for severe or fatal anaphylaxis include coexisting asthma, mast cell disorders, age older than 50 years, underlying cardiovascular disease, peanut and tree nut allergy, and drug-induced reactions. 6–10. Management of Anaphylaxis EPINEPHRINE The mainstay of treatment of acute IgE-mediated or nonimmune anaphylaxis is epinephrine. Epinephrine causes an increase in peripheral vascular resistance plus inotropic and chronotropic cardiac effects, leading to an increase in blood pressure. It causes bronchodilation and decreased mucosal edema through the vasodilation of the skeletal and smooth muscles in the airways and stabilization of mast cells and basophils. The onset of action of epinephrine is usually three to five minutes, and intramuscular administration into the anterolateral thigh is the preferred route.

8, 10, 25, 26, 33, 34 Epinephrine auto-injectors can be used in health care settings and are advantageous because they are quicker to administer and decrease dosing errors. 26 At recommended doses, the most common adverse effects of epinephrine include agitation, anxiety, tremulousness, headache, dizziness, pallor, and palpitations. There are no absolute contraindications to administering epinephrine for anaphylaxis. 8 During anaphylaxis, vascular dilation and increased permeability can lead to intravascular fluid shifting into the extravascular space, resulting in distributive shock. Therefore, it is essential to establish two large-bore intravenous access sites and administer fluids when signs or symptoms of shock occur. Placing a patient with hypotension in a recumbent position with the lower extremities raised is preferred to elevating the head, even if the patient has an upper airway obstruction. 8, 35.

45 A minimum observation period of four hours supports current guidelines, with longer observation periods recommended based on individualized factors such as previous biphasic reaction, severity of initial presentation, treatment with multiple doses of epinephrine, a previously protracted anaphylactic reaction, unknown anaphylactic trigger, or presence of risk factors for severe or fatal anaphylaxis.

### Association between vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis [^114uF8DA]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The debate over the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer has been lasted about 40 years and there is no sign of stopping. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether vasectomy is associated with prostate cancer based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date evidence available.

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched inception to March 14, 2021 without year or language restriction. Multivariable adjusted risk ratios (RRs) were used to assess each endpoint. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results

A total of 58 studies involving 16,989,237 participants fulfilled inclusion criteria. There was significant association of vasectomy with risk of any prostate cancer (risk ratio, 1.18, 95% CI, 1.07–1.31). Association between vasectomy and advanced prostate cancer (risk ratio, 1.06, 95% CI, 1.01–1.12), low-grade prostate cancer (risk ratio, 1.06, 95% CI, 1.02–1.10), and intermediate-grade prostate cancer (risk ratio, 1.12, 95% CI, 1.03–1.22) were significant. There was no significant association between vasectomy and prostate cancer-specific mortality (risk ratio, 1.01, 95% CI, 0.93–1.10).

Conclusions

This study found that vasectomy was associated with the risk of any prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer. From the current evidence, patients should be fully informed of the risk of prostate cancer before vasectomy.

Regarding specific circumstances for anaphylaxis, more specifically with respect to patients with perioperative anaphylaxis, AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (percutaneous and intradermal) and/or in vitro-specific IgE testing, when available, in all potential pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic culprits used during the perioperative period. Consider referring to another center if testing is not possible or, if necessary, use the most efficacious agents structurally dissimilar from the most likely culprit.

### Putative health risks associated with vasectomy [^111Xw51K]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Vasectomy is widely regarded as a safe method of contraception, but over the years there have been many reports suggesting putative health risks associated with the procedure. Concerns over the possible association of vasectomy with a number of medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, testicular cancer, prostate cancer, psychologic distress, and a variety of immune complex-mediated disease processes have been reported. Most recently, a manuscript from the neurology literature has described an association between vasectomy and primary progressive aphasia, a rare variety of frontotemporal dementia. This article reviews the literature surrounding each of these purported health concerns. Because the ultimate findings have important ramifications for both informed consent of vasectomy patients and for public health, the reported health risks in question should be critically evaluated.

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^114TXyie]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) vasectomy guideline — preoperative counseling points (Expert Opinion) state that vasectomy is intended to be a permanent form of contraception and does not produce immediate sterility. Following vasectomy, another form of contraception is required until vas occlusion is confirmed by post- vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA), and even after vas occlusion is confirmed, vasectomy is not 100% reliable in preventing pregnancy. The risk of pregnancy after vasectomy is approximately 1 in 2,000 for men who have post-vasectomy azoospermia or PVSA showing rare non-motile sperm (RNMS). Repeat vasectomy is necessary in ≤ 1% of vasectomies, provided that a technique for vas occlusion known to have a low occlusive failure rate has been used. Patients should refrain from ejaculation for approximately one week after vasectomy. Options for fertility after vasectomy include vasectomy reversal and sperm retrieval with in vitro fertilization; these options are not always successful, and they may be expensive.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^113wLuh8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and anaphylaxis risk management: Both BBs and ACEIs have been previously considered to be contraindicated in high-risk patients, but with more recent data and cardioselective options, shared decision-making is needed when weighing anaphylaxis risk while receiving BBs/ACEIs, the cardiac risk of stopping them, and alternatives. For patients with insect sting allergy who receive BBs/ACEIs, venom immunotherapy (VIT) may be considered as there seems to be little or no increased risk of reaction to VIT associated with these medications. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) may be pursued in patients on BBs or ACEIs, with shared decision-making; those on maintenance AIT have minimal increased risk of severe anaphylactic reaction when concurrently on BBs/ACEIs. For planned procedures with anaphylaxis risk (eg, radiocontrast media, challenge/desensitization, infusion), if BBs/ACEIs cannot be safely interrupted, shared decision-making is critical to balance medical necessity against the relative risk of anaphylaxis and the possibility of more severe reaction. Patients at significant risk for recurrent and unexpected anaphylaxis should receive counseling about the theoretical risk and should avoid nonselective BBs or ACEIs, if possible. There is insufficient evidence to distinguish angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) from ACEIs regarding the potential risk of more severe anaphylaxis.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113a3w3Z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

A strength of this meta-analysis is the high response rate from authors who were contacted to provide further clarification. Many authors shared anonymized raw data, which facilitated the analyses. However, the meta-analyses were undertaken by using aggregate data from individual studies rather than individual patient data (IPD). Although this allowed for inclusion of a greater number of studies, we were unable to further assess potential risk factors for the use of multiple epinephrine doses, which would have been possible with an IPD meta-analysis. Given the inconsistencies in reported risk factors for multiple epinephrine use, an IPD meta-analysis would help address this evidence gap.

Recommendations vary with respect to the number of EAIs that patients at risk of anaphylaxis should be prescribed — both between countries and within a single country in which guidelines from specialist societies may contradict official government advice. Many anaphylaxis reactions resolve spontaneously without treatment, and in this analysis, we found that only 50.4% of anaphylaxis reactions were treated with any epinephrine, a rate that is consistent with the literature. It is clearly inappropriate to not treat anaphylaxis with epinephrine, which is rightly the universal recommendation in all international guidelines. A single dose of epinephrine may be insufficient to terminate a reaction for multiple reasons, including the following: reaction progression; underdosing (international guidelines recommend that teenagers and adults receive 0.5 mg of epinephrine, but for most EAI devices, the highest dose available is 0.3 mg of epinephrine); incorrect administration; subcutaneous administration, which is associated with a prolonged onset of action; delayed administration; and biphasic course of reaction. Our analysis, which is based on more than 25,000 anaphylaxis events, provides an important estimate of the frequency of multiple epinephrine doses given to treat anaphylaxis. Whether patients could be risk-stratified to assess the need for repeat doses of epinephrine requires further analysis, as is discussed in a recent publication by Shaker et al.

Conclusions

Around 10% of patients receiving epinephrine for anaphylaxis have a suboptimal response to a single dose of epinephrine, as assessed by a health care professional. These data are important in informing guidance on the provision of EAI for patients at risk of anaphylaxis in the community.

Clinical implications

Around 10% of anaphylaxis reactions are treated with more than 1 dose of epinephrine, including when the decision to administer a further dose was made by a health care professional.

### Anaphylactic reactions during surgical and medical procedures [^111RvvpQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The most common agents that are responsible for intraoperative anaphylaxis are muscle relaxants. However, latex accounts for a significant number of these reactions, and the incidence of intraoperative anaphylaxis caused by latex is increasing. It is now probably the second most important cause of intraoperative anaphylaxis. Following muscle relaxants and latex are probably antibiotics and anesthesia induction agents. Other agents that are responsible include colloids, opioids, and radiocontrast material. However, they account for less than 10% of all reactions. The clinical manifestations of intraoperative reactions differ from those of anaphylactic reactions outside of anesthesia. Cutaneous manifestations are far less common; cardiovascular collapse may be more common. The diagnosis can be made more difficult because patients cannot express symptoms. There is a paucity of cutaneous findings; the patient is draped, and concomitantly administered drugs may alter the manifestations. These additional drugs can also complicate therapy. There are populations who are at-risk for anaphylaxis to latex during surgical procedures: individuals with a genetic predisposition (atopic individuals), individuals with increased previous exposure to latex (eg, anyone who requires chronic bladder care with repeated insertion of latex catheters or chronic indwelling catheters), health care workers who are exposed to latex mainly by inhalation, and possibly patients who have undergone multiple surgical procedures and therefore have been exposed to latex intravascularly and by catheterization on a number of occasions. It has been shown that pretreatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids that are used successfully for the prevention of reactions to radiocontrast material are not as effective in the prevention of anaphylactic reactions to latex. Therefore, the major emphasis has been on prevention. The key elements of prevention include an adequate history, testing for latex allergy in high-risk patients, preadmission measures, and the establishment of a "latex-free environment" while the individual is hospitalized. This is particularly important in the operating and recovery rooms.

Between 1.6% and 5.1% of US citizens are estimated to have experienced anaphylaxis, a systemic hypersensitivity reaction that can be rapidly fatal. An estimated, 1% of hospitalizations and 0.1% of emergency department attendances for anaphylaxis have a fatal outcome. Groups at risk of anaphylaxis include those with IgE-mediated food allergy (approximately 5% to 8% of US children and 2% to 3% of adults) and those with IgE-mediated drug or insect venom allergy. For these at-risk groups, the unpredictable possibility of fatal anaphylaxis can lead to significant anxiety and restriction of daily activities. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with information that can be used to identify and counsel those individuals at risk of fatal anaphylaxis. We review the incidence and time trends of fatal anaphylaxis due to the 3 main causes (drugs, food, and insect venom) from recent studies and summarize risk factors for fatal anaphylaxis associated with these triggers.

3.1 | Treatment of Refractory Anaphylaxis

3.1.1 | Adrenaline Is the Cornerstone of Anaphylaxis Treatment

IM adrenaline is the first-line anaphylaxis treatment in all current guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis in the community or hospital setting (Tables 2 and 3).

IM adrenaline is generally well-tolerated, in contrast to the IV route, where side effects are more common (sometimes due to dosing errors), including life-threatening arrhythmia when used by personnel not familiar with administering IV adrenaline. For this reason, the IV route is not recommended for the initial treatment of anaphylaxis in community and hospital settings except the perioperative setting. In the perioperative setting, adrenaline is always administered by personnel appropriately trained in the preparation and administration of adrenaline via the IV route, in well-monitored patients and thus the IV route is recommended (Tables 2 and 3). In addition, the absorption of IM adrenaline is slower than by IV route, less predictable and dependent on adequate circulation which is more likely to be compromised in perioperative anaphylaxis.

### Are ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers dangerous in patients at risk for anaphylaxis? [^112BtuPf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers and their effect on patients at risk for anaphylaxis. A literature search was conducted in PUBMED to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy. Some studies show an increased risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, whereas others studies do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective controlled trials are needed on this important topic. For those patients at risk of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors. However, for those patients with cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to increase life expectancy. Consideration should be given for the concomitant use of these medications while patients are receiving venom immunotherapy.
