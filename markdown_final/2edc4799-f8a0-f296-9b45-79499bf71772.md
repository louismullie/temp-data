## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of stress the top side of a tree branch experiences when someone hangs on the end, with options of tension, compression, both, or neither. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic mechanics of bending in a beam. Then, I should verify the neutral axis concept and how it divides the cross-section into tension and compression zones. Next, I will apply that to a tree branch and confirm which surface is which. Finally, I will consider whether any exceptions change the answer and select the best option.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental principle: when a beam bends, the material on one side of the neutral axis is stretched (tension) while the material on the other side is shortened (compression). The neutral axis itself experiences minimal longitudinal stress, so the stress distribution is not uniform across the thickness.

> Wait, let me verify the orientation for a branch. When you hang on the end of a branch, the branch deflects downward, creating a concave-upward curvature on the top surface and a convex-downward curvature on the bottom surface. In this configuration, the top fibers are on the outside of the bend and are therefore stretched, while the bottom fibers are on the inside and are compressed.

> Hold on, I should confirm the neutral axis location. For a homogeneous, symmetric beam, the neutral axis lies at the centroid of the cross-section, so the top half is in tension and the bottom half in compression during downward bending. Tree branches are not perfectly homogeneous, but the same qualitative division holds: tension on the convex side and compression on the concave side during bending.

> I will now examine the specific question: the top side of the branch is the convex, outer surface in this downward bend, so it is under tension. The bottom side is the concave, inner surface and is under compression. Therefore, the correct answer is tension, not compression or both on the top surface.

> But wait, what if the branch is very thick or has unusual growth rings that shift the neutral axis? Even if the exact neutral axis shifts, the outer convex surface still experiences tensile strain during downward bending, so the qualitative answer remains the same. I should double-check that I'm not conflating shear or torsion with normal stresses; here, the dominant effect is normal stress from bending, which cleanly separates tension on top and compression on bottom.

> Final answer: A. tension.

---

The top side of a tree branch under bending is under **tension** because the outer fibers are stretched as the branch curves downward. The bottom side experiences **compression** from the inner fibers being squeezed. This tension-compression pairing is a fundamental feature of beam bending and explains why materials often fail first on the tension side.

---

## Mechanical analysis of bending in tree branches

When a branch bends, its cross-section experiences a **linear stress distribution**: tension on the outer (top) surface and compression on the inner (bottom) surface, with a neutral axis in between where stress is zero. This pattern arises because the outer fibers must lengthen while the inner fibers shorten during curvature.

---

## Tension on the top side

- **Definition**: Tension is a pulling force that stretches material.
- **Mechanism**: As the branch bends downward, the top surface is forced to elongate, placing those fibers in tension.
- **Evidence**: This is consistent with beam theory and observed in biological materials under bending.

---

## Compression on the bottom side

- **Definition**: Compression is a pushing force that shortens material.
- **Mechanism**: The bottom surface is forced to shorten, placing those fibers in compression.
- **Evidence**: This mirrors the tension-compression pairing seen in all bent beams and is well documented in biomechanics.

---

## Neutral axis and stress distribution

The **neutral axis** is the internal line where longitudinal stress is zero during bending; above it, tension increases toward the top surface, and below it, compression increases toward the bottom surface. This linear stress gradient is a hallmark of elastic beam bending.

---

## Biological implications

- **Tension-side failure**: Wood is weaker in tension than compression, so cracks often initiate on the top (tension) side.
- **Growth response**: Trees can form reaction wood (tension wood) on the upper side to counteract tensile stress during bending.
- **Structural adaptation**: Branches evolve to balance tension and compression, optimizing strength and flexibility.

---

## Experimental evidence

Experimental and observational studies confirm that bent branches exhibit **tension on the top and compression on the bottom**, consistent with mechanical beam theory and with the formation of tension wood on the upper side.

---

## Conclusion

The top side of a bent tree branch is under **tension** because the outer fibers are stretched during bending, while the bottom side is under compression. This tension-compression pattern is a fundamental feature of beam bending and drives both mechanical failure and biological adaptation in trees.

### Why the IOM recommendations for vitamin D are deficient [^116s7MJA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The IOM recommendations for vitamin D fail in a major way on logic, on science, and on effective public health guidance. Moreover, by failing to use a physiological referent, the IOM approach constitutes precisely the wrong model for development of nutritional policy.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^111Dxkqk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Answers to clinically important questions are rarely dichotomous ("positive" or "negative"), and a recommendation of whether "to D or not to D" should be made based on the best available data from both observational studies and clinical trials. Results from trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. We are awaiting the full publication of the DPVD study and results from individual participant data meta-analyses. Even if the risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation may appear relatively small, when applied in the expanding prediabetes population, it can have important public health implications.

### Consensus and controversial aspects of vitamin D and COVID-19 [^112L9yHM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This work aims to review and discuss controversial topics in the field of vitamin D, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19.

Methods

The International Conferences "Controversies in Vitamin D" are a series of workshops that started in 2017 featuring international experts and leaders in vitamin D research and clinical practice. The fifth annual conference was held in Stresa, Italy, September 15 to 18, 2021.

Evidence

Before the event, participants reviewed available studies on their assigned topic, drafted a related abstract, and presented their findings at the time of the conference. Relevant literature that became available since was also discussed within the panel and updated accordingly.

Consensus

Before the event, the drafted abstracts had been merged to prepare a preliminary document. After the conference presentations, in-depth discussions in open sessions led to consensus. The document was subsequently modified according to discussions and up-to-date literature inclusion.

Conclusions

There is quite consistent evidence for an association between low 25 OH vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and poor COVID-19 outcomes, despite heterogeneous publications of variable quality. However, the low vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients might also reflect reverse causality. Vitamin D supplementation might have a positive role in COVID-19 prevention. The evidence supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D treatment in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 complications is conflicting. Conclusive statements regarding the beneficial effect of vitamin D in this context await high-quality, randomized controlled trials.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

Key Points

Question

Is vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, associated with test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 489 patients who had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status, a difference that was statistically significant.

Meaning

These findings appear to support a role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.

Randomized trials — all-cause mortality with vitamin D supplementation: All-cause mortality was reported in 13 RCTs (81 695 participants); estimated daily vitamin D dosage varied between 400 IU (10 μg) and 4800 IU (120 μg), with a median of 2000 IU (50 μg), and most trials allowed supplemental vitamin D between 400 to 800 IU/d. The RR for mortality was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.95–1.20), translating to 2 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 6 more). Mortality risk appeared lower with calcium co-administration (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79–1.01]) than with vitamin D alone (RR 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01–1.24]) (P for heterogeneity = .021), and higher with high dosages (RR 1.22 [95% CI, 1.06–1.39]) compared with standard dosages (RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–1.04]) (P for heterogeneity = .003).

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^114MGxGt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Differential effects of vitamin D regimens on D2 and D3 levels

At day zero, D2 and D3 levels were undetectable or only traceable in all the 8 groups. D2 and D3 levels were quantifiable only during the first week of treatment in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly groups. The following analysis is therefore restricted to the 2-weekly and 4-weekly groups. D2 and D3 concentration-time curves in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly groups are shown in Fig. 6a and b. As expected mean D2 and D3 levels were twice as high in the 4-weekly groups compared to the 2-weekly groups. Interestingly, mean D3 levels in the D3 treated groups were higher than mean D2 levels in the corresponding D2 treated groups (Fig. 6a). In the D2 treated groups, analysis of D2 AUC 7 showed significant effect of treatment group (p < 0.001), sex (p = 0.01), and BMI (p = 0.001). In the D3 treated groups, analysis of D3 AUC 7 showed significant effect of treatment group (p < 0.001), sex (p < 0.001), but not BMI (p = 0.06). Adjusted mean D2 AUC 7 was 200% higher in the 4-weekly group compared to 2-weekly group with a mean difference of 100.2 nmol.d/L (CI, 62.3 to 138.0, p < 0.001), and adjusted mean D3 AUC 7 was 90% higher in the 4-weekly group compared to 2-weekly group with a mean difference of 155.7 nmol.d/L (CI, 109.8 to 201.6, p < 0.001). Adjusted mean D3 AUC 7 was 243% higher than D2 AUC 7 in the 2-weekly groups (mean (SE) 172.2 (16.1) vs 50.2 (13.5) nmol.d/L) with a mean difference of 122.0 nmol.d/L (CI, 79.8 to 164.1, p < 0.001) and 118% higher in the 4-weekly groups (mean (SE) 327.9 (16.4) vs 150.4 (13.4) nmol.d/L) with a mean difference of 177.5 nmol.d/L (CI, 135.3 to 219.8, p < 0.001). Figure 6b shows that mean D2 levels in D2 treated groups and mean D3 levels in D3 treated groups are (64 and 55%, respectiv1ely) higher in females than males. Adjusted mean difference in AUC 7 was 48.5 nmol.d/L (CI, 10.3 to 86.6, p = 0.01) for D2 and 107.7 nmol.d/L (CI, 61.5 to 154.0, p < 0.001) for D3. Interestingly, BMI correlated significantly with D2 AUC 7 (r = −0.27, p = 0.03) but not D3 AUC 7 (r = −0.05, p = 0.67).

Guidelines

Neither the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network nor the European guidelines adopted an explicit method for displaying and comparing evidence across risk markers (table 4). The Scottish but not European guidelines reported a level of evidence for some statements. Both guidelines made clear, albeit differing, statements on the importance of depression in the onset and progression of coronary heart disease. Neither the only randomised trial with statistical power to detect differences in event rates (ENRICHD) w5 nor the Cochrane meta-analysis of psychological interventionswas cited in the executive summary of the European guidelines. Post hoc subgroup analyses were cited. The Scottish guidelines cited neither trials nor meta-analyses but did cite a previous position statement, which itself cites only an older narrative systematic review. Neither guideline suggested that C reactive protein was an important risk marker: for the Scottish guidelines it was neither mentioned nor any rationale given as to why not. Observational studies and Mendelian randomisation studies were cited for the European guidelines meta-analyses, and the association was stated as "often seriously confounded".

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114jjzc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### Provision of social norm feedback to high prescribers of antibiotics in general practice: a pragmatic national randomised controlled trial [^115GTHgP]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

In an analysis of all four experimental groups (neither intervention, n = 402; feedback intervention only, n = 402; patient-focused intervention only, n = 388; and both interventions, n = 389; figure 1; table 5), the antibiotic prescribing rate was significantly lower in the group assigned to the feedback intervention only compared with the group that received neither intervention, for all months in the study period until March, 2015 (IRR 0.967, 95% CI 0.949–0.982; p < 0.0001; table 6, figure 3). The patient-focused intervention produced a significant increase in the prescribing rate in the month it was delivered, but its effect was not significant for the relevant period as a whole (patient-focused intervention only vs neither intervention IRR 1.013, 0.998–1.028; p = 0.073). The prescribing rate was also significantly lower in the group assigned to both interventions compared with the group that received neither intervention (IRR 0.975, 0.960–0.990, p = 0.002). The interaction between the two interventions was close to the threshold for 0.05 significance level (−1.89 [95% CI −3.95 to 0.61]; p = 0.058).

### A single-oral bolus of 100, 000 IU of cholecalciferol at hospital admission did not improve outcomes in the COVID-19 disease: the COVID-VIT-D-a randomised multicentre international clinical trial [^111cubM7]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D status has been implicated in COVID-19 disease. The objective of the COVID-VIT-D trial was to investigate if an oral bolus of cholecalciferol (100,000 IU) administered at hospital admission influences the outcomes of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease. In the same cohort, the association between baseline serum calcidiol levels with the same outcomes was also analysed.

Methods

The COVID-VIT-D is a multicentre, international, randomised, open label, clinical trial conducted throughout 1 year. Patients older than 18 years with moderate-severe COVID-19 disease requiring hospitalisation were included. At admission, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive a single oral bolus of cholecalciferol (n = 274) or nothing (n = 269). Patients were followed from admission to discharge or death. Length of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality were assessed.

Results

In the randomised trial, comorbidities, biomarkers, symptoms and drugs used did not differ between groups. Median serum calcidiol in the cholecalciferol and control groups were 17.0 vs. 16.1 ng/mL at admission and 29.0 vs. 16.4 ng/mL at discharge, respectively. The median length of hospitalisation (10.0 [95%CI 9.0–10.5] vs. 9.5 [95%CI 9.0–10.5] days), admission to ICU (17.2% [95%CI 13.0–22.3] vs. 16.4% [95%CI 12.3–21.4]) and death rate (8.0% [95%CI 5.2–12.1] vs. 5.6% [95%CI 3.3–9.2]) did not differ between the cholecalciferol and control group. In the cohort analyses, the highest serum calcidiol category at admission (> 25ng/mL) was associated with lower percentage of pulmonary involvement and better outcomes.

Conclusions

The randomised clinical trial showed the administration of an oral bolus of 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol at hospital admission did not improve the outcomes of the COVID-19 disease. A cohort analysis showed that serum calcidiol at hospital admission was associated with outcomes.

Trial registration

COVID-VIT-D trial was authorised by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health products (AEMPS) and registered in European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT 2020-002274-28) and in ClinicalTrials.gov.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1148YZYt]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation 22 — For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against topical preparations (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, Amended), and recommendations for "patients with low back pain" encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with or without neurological symptoms; no studies on topical preparations met inclusion criteria for the 2022 review, yet the topic was addressed because topical preparations (e.g., capsaicin creams, diclofenacgel, lidocaine patches) are widely used and generate frequent questions for PCPs; as there was no evidence, the Work Group could not determine the balance of benefits and harms, patient and provider perspectives varied regarding lower perceived risk and acceptability, and for this reason the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^112D3B5M]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111crY8T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

However, the statistical significances diminished in male patients (Table 4) when adjusted by age, body mass index (BMI), household income, educational attainment, smoking and drinking, and protein intake. Moreover, only female OS patients had a significantly lower odds ratio to attain at least two days of strengthening exercise per week than those in the neither OP nor SP group (0.062, 95% CI 0.007–0.538) (Fig. 1; Table 5). In unadjusted analysis, the odds ratios in OP female participants who engaged in stretching and strengthening exercises were remarkably lower compared to those in the neither OP nor SP group. However, in adjusted analysis, only the odds ratio in stretching exercises remained significantly lower compared to in the neither OP nor SP group (0.606, 95% CI 0.392–0.936, Table 5).

### Evidences for a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19 [^114TFkza]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should have baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations measured and must be supplemented at least to a level ≥ 30 ng/mL (optimal 40–60), especially when the baseline level is < 10 ng/mL and such deficiency is significantly more present in male patients.

In conclusion, we might suggest in COVID-19 patients with 25(OH)D serum levels under 20 ng/mL that the usual recommended dose for correction of deficiency should be 6000–7000 oral IU/day for the first 6–8 weeks. For maintenance, the dose should varies from 2000 to 3000 oral IU/day depending on the age and clinical condition of the patient up to achieve the suggested concentrations.

### Vitamin D supplementation and major cardiovascular events: D-health randomised controlled trial [^111BQGg2]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study D-Health was published by Bridie Thompson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Acute ischemic stroke. In the D-Health study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in older adults? In the D-Health study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D-Health study, the population was: 21302 patients (9777 female, 11525 male). The inclusion criteria were adult participants aged 60–84 years. The key exclusion criteria were self-reported hypercalcemia; hyperparathyroidism; kidney stones; osteomalacia; sarcoidosis; receipt of > 500 IU/day supplemental vitamin D; or unable to give consent because of language or cognitive impairment. In the D-Health study, the interventions were: n = 10658 vitamin D (oral dose of 60,000 IU/month for 5 years) n = 10644 placebo (matching oral placebo for 5 years). In the D-Health study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in major cardiovascular event (6% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01). In the D-Health study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in myocardial infarction (1.8% vs. 2.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) No significant difference in coronary revascularization (3.9% vs. 4.3%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01) No significant difference in stroke (1.6% vs. 1.6%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.23). In the D-Health study, the conclusion was: in adult participants aged 60–84 years, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to major cardiovascular event.

### 'Vitamin D and cognition in older adults': updated international recommendations [^116Jzm4a]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D, a condition that is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years and above, is associated with brain changes and dementia. Given the rapidly accumulating and complex contribution of the literature in the field of vitamin D and cognition, clear guidance is needed for researchers and clinicians.

Methods

International experts met at an invitational summit on 'Vitamin D and Cognition in Older Adults'. Based on previous reports and expert opinion, the task force focused on key questions relating to the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Each question was discussed and voted using a Delphi-like approach.

Results

The experts reached an agreement that hypovitaminosis D increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults and may alter the clinical presentation as a consequence of related comorbidities; however, at present, vitamin D level should not be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of specificity and insufficient evidence. This population should be screened for hypovitaminosis D because of its high prevalence and should receive supplementation, if necessary; but this advice was not specific to cognition. During the debate, the possibility of 'critical periods' during which vitamin D may have its greatest impact on the brain was addressed; whether hypovitaminosis D influences cognition actively through deleterious effects and/or passively by loss of neuroprotection was also considered.

Conclusions

The international task force agreed on five overarching principles related to vitamin D and cognition in older adults. Several areas of uncertainty remain, and it will be necessary to revise the proposed recommendations as new findings become available.

### A new paradigm for examining the correlates of aerobic, strength, and combined exercise: an application to gynecologic cancer survivors [^116SBbB2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Almost all exercise guidelines recommend both aerobic and strength exercise, however, few studies have simultaneously examined the correlates of meeting both exercise guidelines. Here, we propose a new paradigm that calls on researchers to examine not only the correlates of meeting the various exercise guidelines versus no guideline but also the correlates of meeting the combined guidelines versus one guideline and meeting one guideline versus the other guideline.

Methods

A random sample of 621 gynecologic cancer survivors located in Alberta, Canada, completed a mailed questionnaire.

Results

A multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that (a) meeting only the aerobic exercise guideline compared to neither guideline was associated with younger age, social drinking, healthy weight, better general health, and no comorbidities; (b) meeting only the strength exercise guideline compared to neither guideline was associated with social drinking and being healthy weight; (c) meeting the combined exercise guideline compared to neither guideline was associated with social drinking, being healthy weight, and better general health; (d) meeting the aerobic guideline only compared to the strength guideline only was associated with younger age and better general health; and (e) few correlates distinguished between meeting the combined guidelines compared to a single guideline.

Conclusions

Demographic and health variables are associated with meeting the various exercise guidelines versus no guideline but they are not associated with meeting the combined exercise guidelines versus a single guideline or meeting one guideline versus the other guideline. Application of this new paradigm to cancer survivors is encouraged.

### Early high-dose vitamin dfor critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^114Di1YQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is a common, potentially reversible contributor to morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. The potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in acute critical illness require further study.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of early vitamin D 3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. Randomization occurred within 12 hours after the decision to admit the patient to an intensive care unit. Eligible patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or matched placebo. The primary end point was 90-day all-cause, all-location mortality.

Results

A total of 1360 patients were found to be vitamin D-deficient during point-of-care screening and underwent randomization. Of these patients, 1078 had baseline vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level, < 20 ng per milliliter [50 nmol per liter]) confirmed by subsequent testing and were included in the primary analysis population. The mean day 3 level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 46.9 ± 23.2 ng per milliliter (117 ± 58 nmol per liter) in the vitamin D group and 11.4 ± 5.6 ng per milliliter (28 ± 14 nmol per liter) in the placebo group (difference, 35.5 ng per milliliter; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31.5 to 39.6). The 90-day mortality was 23.5% in the vitamin D group (125 of 531 patients) and 20.6% in the placebo group (109 of 528 patients) (difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.1 to 7.9; P = 0.26). There were no clinically important differences between the groups with respect to secondary clinical, physiological, or safety end points. The severity of vitamin D deficiency at baseline did not affect the association between the treatment assignment and mortality.

Conclusions

Early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D 3 did not provide an advantage over placebo with respect to 90-day mortality or other, nonfatal outcomes among critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 positivity and severity of the disease [^116UdpYE]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study examined the relationship between polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positivity and clinical outcomes of vitamin D levels measured within the 6 months before the PCR test in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 (227) and non-COVID-19 patients (260) were divided into four groups according to their vitamin D levels: Group I (0-10ng/ml), Group II (10-20ng/ml), Group III (20-30ng/ml), and Group IV (vitamin D > 30ng/ml). Laboratory test results and the radiological findings were evaluated. In addition, for comparative purposes, medical records of 1200 patients who had a hospital visit in the November 1, 2019-November 1, 2020 period for complaints due to reasons not related to COVID-19 were investigated for the availability of vitamin D measurements. This search yielded 260 patients with tested vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels were below 30ng/ml in 94.27% of 227 COVID-19-positive patients (average age, 46.32 ± 1.24 years [range, 20–80 years] and 56.54% women) while 93.07% of 260 non-COVID-19 patients (average age, 44.63 ± 1.30 years [range, 18–75 years] and 59.50% women) had vitamin D levels below 30ng/ml. Nevertheless, very severe vitamin D deficiency (< 10ng/ml) was considerably more common in COVID-19 patients (44%) (average age, 44.15 ± 1.89 years [range, 23–80 years] and 57.57% women) than in non-COVID-19 ones (31%) (average age, 46.50 ± 2.21 years [range, 20–75 years] and 62.5% women). Among COVID-19-positive patients, the group with vitamin D levels of > 30ng/ml had significantly lower D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, number levels, number of affected lung segments and shorter hospital stays. No difference was found among the groups in terms of age and gender distribution. Elevated vitamin D levels could decrease COVID-19 PCR positivity, D-dime and CRP levels and the number of affected lung segments in COVID-19-positive patients, thereby shortening the duration of hospital stays and alleviating the intensity of COVID-19.

### Dead space estimates may not be independently associated with 28-day mortality in COVID-19 ARDS [^113pwb15]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Dead space estimations were significantly increased in non-survivors in the first four days of mechanical ventilation compared to survivors. This is line with previous studies in all patients with ARDS (not only those with COVID19), in which dead space (V D / V T) was elevated during the first week after start of invasive ventilation. We also described the association between these indices and outcome that was previously observed in patients with ARDS due to other causes than COVID-19. However, in our study the investigated estimates did not add predictive value to a model that included other known predictors for 28-day mortality, with the possible exception of P ET CO 2 /PaCO 2 at the start and at day 1 of ventilation. This contrasts with several studies in ARDS that showed increased dead space ventilation to be a robust and independent predictor of mortality risk. Decreasing P ET CO 2 /PaCO 2 was also independently associated with mortality risk in one study. Yet, our findings are in line with a previous report in which we assessed the added value of markers of impaired ventilation during the first days of mechanical ventilation in non-COVID-19-related ARDS. Taken together, the data suggest that markers of impaired ventilation reflect disease severity but are not independent predictors of outcome, irrespective of the cause of ARDS.

### Functional brain connectivity of the salience network in alcohol use and anxiety disorders [^1153PZ4u]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The interplay between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety disorders (ANX) is well-documented, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. This study aims to elucidate these mechanisms by examining the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the salience network and to the amygdala, both implicated in alcohol and anxiety disorders. We analyzed data from 264 inpatient participants culled from a wider group of 518 inpatients at The Menninger Clinic in Houston, TX, categorized into four groups (n = 66 each) based on DSM-IV diagnoses: AUD without ANX (AUD), ANX without AUD (ANX), concurrent AUD and ANX (BOTH), and neither (NEITHER). Our findings reveal significant RSFC differences, particularly between the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and 1) right rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) (corrected p = 0.029; RSFC significantly higher in NEITHER than in BOTH), and 2) left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (corrected p = 0.016; RSFC significantly higher in AUD and NEITHER than in BOTH). Furthermore, correlations with a clinical measure for alcohol use (World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test; WHO ASSIST) indicated significant relationships: WHO ASSIST alcohol scores negatively correlated with right SMG to right RPFC RSFC (r = -0.14, p = 0.02) and positively correlated with the interhemispheric SMG RSFC (r = 0.17, p = 0.006). This research enhances our understanding of the complex neurobiological interconnections between alcohol use and anxiety disorders, suggesting a disrupted neural architecture that may underpin the behavioral manifestations observed in these highly comorbid conditions.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116vS5VG]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

HITT — fondaparinux evidence includes one small prospective cohort with historical controls and one retrospective cohort with historical controls; Lobo et al reported that neither six patients with HITT treated with a weight-based dose of fondaparinux nor eight patients treated with DTIs (lepirudin or argatroban) experienced recurrent VTE or major bleeding, and Grouzi et al reported that neither 24 patients with HITT treated with a weight-based dose of fondaparinux nor a historical control group of 20 patients treated with lepirudin experienced recurrent VTE or major bleeding; safety signals include three case reports of possible fondaparinux-induced HIT, one case in which fondaparinux appeared to exacerbate HIT caused by heparin, and a fifth case in which prophylactic fondaparinux failed to prevent the development of delayed HIT; overall, the quality of the evidence for fondaparinux-induced HIT is low quality and the quality of the evidence in favor of fondaparinux as a treatment of HIT is very low quality.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^116hpnH1]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD PTSD guideline — mobile apps and other self-help-based interventions — states: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against mobile apps or other self-help-based interventions for the treatment of PTSD (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). A meta-analysis identified two RCTs of self-help mobile or internet interventions delivered without facilitation and neither included the critical outcome of clinician-rated PTSD; both studies compared the PTSD Coach mobile app with waitlist. Findings were mixed: a smaller feasibility pilot did not find that PTSD Coach had an effect on PTSD, whereas a larger RCT was positive for self-reported PTSD, depression, and functioning. Neither study reported adverse events nor included Veterans or active duty Service members. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low and the body of evidence was minimal given there were only two studies, with no evidence of severe adverse events reported. Patient preferences vary; a focus group noted that while some participants found benefits in using mobile apps or online resources, most patients said they prefer in-person care, though mobile apps might be less stigmatizing and increase access for patients with low socioeconomic status, elderly populations, and those in rural and deployed settings.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^116vrcED]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading framework — dimensions and evidence adjustment are defined explicitly. The CHEST grading system defines the grades based on two key dimensions: (1) the balance of benefits of the proposed action as compared with the possible harms or risks and (2) the methodologic quality of the supporting evidence. Both factors are represented in the overall grade, with the former represented by 1 or 2 and the latter A, B, or C. The methodologic quality is initially based on the hierarchy of study design, but studies can be upgraded or downgraded based on specific criteria (eg, existence of methodologic flaws, directness, precision, consistency of results).

### Explosive fragmentation of prince rupert's drops leads to well-defined fragment sizes [^115tt2NM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results and discussion

The Prince Rupert's drops are made by melting the end of a glass rod with a high thermal expansion coefficient and letting the resulting red hot droplets fall into a beaker with cold water. The rapid cooling causes thermal contraction, and the fact that the outside of the drop cools before the inside then leads to very large tensile stresses in the droplet center and compressive stresses on the exterior. The very large compressive forces suppress crack growth, giving rise to the drop's extreme strength: they do not break when hit with a hammer; in controlled experiments, Prince Rupert's drops can withstand loads of more than 10 kN without breaking. If, however, a crack is initiated and it is able to reach the tensile central region, by e.g. breaking the tail of the droplet, it quickly propagates, causing the whole droplet to explosively disintegrate (Fig. 1 a). The unique combination of their extreme strength and unstable nature has made Prince Rupert's drops the topic of scientific study since the first part of 17th-century. In our experiments, to measure the fragment size distribution of a fragmented Prince Rupert's drop, we break a single drop inside a latex glove so that no secondary fractures can occur and all fragments can be easily collected. As a generic example, our micro-CT analysis (Fig. 2) shows that a millimeter-sized drop breaks up into 22,000 fragments. Figure 1 d shows the distribution of the equivalent spherical diameters d, down to 50 μm, which is the maximum resolution of the micro-CT. This fragment size distribution and all the others throughout the paper are represented by a probability density as a function of the equivalent spherical diameter. Though there are many ways of presenting fragment size data, this way allows one to directly compare length scales and enables a clear separation between data points when changes in the size distribution happen over a short interval such as this distribution for the Prince Rupert's drop (Fig. 1 d). The main conclusions are of course not changed by the way the data is presented.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^112WSdvu]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading of recommendations — the grading system encompasses two dimensions: balance of benefits to harms, risks, or burdens (including confidence in effect estimates) and the level of evidence supporting the recommendation; recommendations are strong when benefits clearly outweigh harms or vice versa and may include a strong negative recommendation; strong recommendations (Grade 1) use the language "we recommend", whereas when benefits and harms are closely balanced and further research could change the direction or strength, it is considered weak and statements read, "we suggest"; when benefits clearly outweigh harms most patients would choose the intervention and the recommendation is Grade 1, but with considerable variability in preferences recommendations are weaker, ie, Grade 2; the other dimension reflects the quality of the body of evidence scored A, B, or C.

### Suicide in schizophrenia: an observational study of coroner records in toronto [^113r7Qkv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Suicide is an important cause of premature mortality in people suffering from schizophrenia. This study aimed to identify demographic, personal, and suicide-specific features that distinguish suicide in people with schizophrenia from those with another severe mental illness (bipolar disorder) and those with neither illness.

Method

We conducted a coroner's chart review for 2,886 suicide victims in Toronto from 1998 to 2010. Diagnoses were made based on coroner interviews with available informants including family members, acquaintances, the deceased's physician(s) and/or review of medical records. Of the total, 258 formed what we defined as the schizophrenia group (204 schizophrenia, 34 unspecified psychotic illness, and 20 schizoaffective disorder). Of the remainder, 169 had bipolar disorder, and 2,459 had neither illness. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and χ² tests were conducted to examine differences between the groups.

Results

The group with schizophrenia was the youngest (mean age for schizophrenia, 41.0 years; bipolar disorder, 43.3 years; and neither, 47.7 years; P < .001), most likely to have never been married (schizophrenia, 75.6%; bipolar disorder, 57.4%; and neither, 52.9%; P < .001), most likely to be living in temporary/assisted housing or jail (schizophrenia, 9.3%; bipolar disorder, 5.4%; and neither, 3.2%; P < .001), and least likely to have experienced a recent stressor (schizophrenia, 26.7%; bipolar disorder, 37.9%; and neither, 54.1%; P < .001). The schizophrenia group was the most likely to use a violent cause of death, specifically by fall from a height or by jumping in front of a vehicle (schizophrenia, 81.4%; bipolar disorder, 58.0%; and neither, 73.1%; P < .001).

Conclusions

There are important demographic and suicide-related differences between suicide victims with and without schizophrenia. Notably, suicide in schizophrenia overall appears to be more illness driven and occurs by more violent means than in the bipolar disorder group or those with neither illness.

### Patient, provider, and practice characteristics associated with sacubitril / valsartan use in the United States [^116gWYm9]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Background Current guidelines recommend sacubitril/valsartan for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but the rate of adoption in the United States has been slow. Methods and Results Using data from CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients With Heart Failure), we described current sacubitril/valsartan use and identified patient, provider, and practice characteristics associated with its use. We considered patients to be on sacubitril/valsartan if they were prescribed it before enrollment or initiated on it at the baseline visit. We excluded patients with a contraindication to sacubitril/valsartan and practices with < 10 patients enrolled. Of 4216 patients from 121 sites, 616 (15%) were prescribed sacubitril/valsartan, 2506 (59%) an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and 1094 (26%) neither. Patients prescribed sacubitril/valsartan were younger (63 years versus 66 years ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 69 years neither, P < 0.001), less likely to have chronic kidney disease (15% versus 17% ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 30% neither, P < 0.001), more likely to have cardiac resynchronization therapy (12% versus 7% ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 7% neither, P < 0.001), and had lower ejection fraction (27% versus 30% ACE inhibitor/ARB versus 30% neither, P < 0.001). Larger practices, based on number of cardiologists and advanced practice providers, were associated with the highest sacubitril/valsartan use. After multivariable adjustment, the number of advanced practice providers was associated with sacubitril/valsartan use (adjusted odds ratio,1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14). Conclusions Despite current guideline recommendations, adoption of sacubitril/valsartan remains low. Provider and practice characteristics associated with sacubitril/valsartan use were related to general practice size and were not associated with practice characteristics specific for heart failure. Further research is needed to identify strategies for effective quality improvement interventions in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part II: cardiac ultrasonography [^1177dKPW]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiac ultrasonography guideline — GRADE factors for evidence assessment and recommendation development specify that Section A categorizes the outcome factor as Critical, Important, Less important, or Not important, while Section B (factors 2–10) sets study-design starting points and quality levels with "Randomized controlled trial = 4" and "Observational studies = 2", mapping to "A = High = Four points", "B = Moderate = Three points", "C = Lowc = Two points", and "D = Very lowc = One point". Quality is lowered by the five downgraders — "Risk of bias" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Inconsistency" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Indirectness" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Imprecision" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), and "Publication bias" (−1 Likely; −2 Very likely) — and raised by three upgraders — "Large effect" (+1 Large; +2 Very large), "Dose response" (+1 Evidence of a gradient), and "Antagonistic bias" (+1 All plausible confounding would reduce the effect, or +1 Would suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect). "Based on the design, the evidence will qualify for four points (if randomized controlled trial) or two points (if observational) and then points will move down by one or two points (by downgraders) or up (by upgraders) if applicable as indicated in the table", and Section C (factors 11–15) lists "The five-GRADE transformers", with voting "using ninepoint Likert's scale".

Among the female subjects, OP and OS groups were markedly older than those in the neither OP nor SP group (Table 3). Height was lower in the female OP and OS groups, while weight and BMI were lower in the female OP, SP, and OS groups as compared to the neither OP nor SP group. The total caloric intake was considerably lower in the OS group; total protein intake was lower in the OP group (Table 3). Compared with the neither OP nor SP group, the OS group comprised a markedly lower percentage of female subjects who had completed their college or high school education; however, there were no significant differences between household income levels in females (Table 3).

### Multi-modal deformation and temperature sensing for context-sensitive machines [^114BT8EZ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Here, [d x, d y, d z] and [θ 2, θ 3] are the controlled kinematic parameters. The sensor was modeled as a centerline curve assumed to be of constant curvature, determined by the displacement between the two end-effectors. Kinematic parameters to achieve desired κ * and ϕ * were computed by minimizing:Here, is the tangent vector at the top of the sensor andis the tangent vector of the grips (cross product tending to zero enforces alignment with the grips), the * superscript denotes user-input goal values, and = 100 and1000. Note all variables in the objective are functions of the kinematic parameters. Boundary conditions and length are conditionally weighted to enforce solutions for pure bending without additional stretch or compression of the centerline. Minimization was performed with a genetic algorithm coded in MATLAB. The resulting outputs were converted to the motor commands and implemented on the setup to achieve programmed deformations.

We conducted tension and compression experiments on the sensor using an Instron 3345 fitted with a 1 kN load cell. All tests were conducted at a loading rate of 40 mm/min. For sensor characterization tests depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, we applied deformations considering a factor of safety on failure, so we could test the same specimen multiple times and quantify repeatability in the operational range of the sensor. Compression was applied up to just before the buckling force of the sensor. In uni-axial experiments, tension was applied up to 25% strain (the pull-to-failure results are discussed in Note M10). For combined bending and stretch tests, we used the Instron machine outfitted with a custom fixture to enforce a fixed, maximum curvature while stretching (Supplementary Fig. 9 a). We set the maximum axial strain to 5%. Note that certain physically unrealizable combined modes of deformation were not tested. These unrealizable combined modes include compression + bending, because the sensor cannot maintain a fixed curvature with additional compression boundary conditions, as well as compression + stretch, since both conditions act along the axis of the sensor and effectively cancel each other out. For tests involving heat, we applied heat at 109 °C via forced convection until the chromaticity value reached a steady state. Steady state occurs when the entire volume of doped material exceeds the transition temperature (31 °C) of the thermochromic species.

### Coronary artery calcium score for long-term risk classification in individuals with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^113JRyM1]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although the risk of type 2 diabetes is considered to be equivalent to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, there is considerable heterogeneity among individuals for CHD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. It is not known whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment at baseline in individuals with established metabolic syndrome (MetS) or diabetes identifies CHD and ASCVD prognostic indicators during a long follow-up period.

Objective

To compare improvement in long-term prognostication of incident CHD and ASCVD using CAC scores among those with diabetes, MetS, or neither condition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study included participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study of 6814 males and females aged 45 to 84 years without known CVD from 4 race/ethnicity groups (white [38.5%], African American [27.5%], Hispanic [22.1%], and Chinese [11.9%]) recruited from 6 US communities from July 2000 through August 2002. Follow-up for each participant extended to the first occurrence of an incident event, other death, loss to follow-up, or the last follow-up call through December 31, 2013. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2016, to September 12, 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and net reclassification improvement were used to compare incremental contributions of CAC score when added to the Framingham risk score, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status.

Main Outcomes and Measures

CHD events, including myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or CHD death.

Results

Of 6814 MESA participants, 6751 had complete risk factor and follow-up data and were included in this study (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [10.2] years; 3186 [47.2%] male). A total of 881 (13.0%) had diabetes, 1738 (25.7%) had MetS, and 4132 (61.2%) had neither condition. After 11.1 mean years of follow-up, CHD events occurred in 84 participants with diabetes (135 ASCVD events), 115 with MetS (175 ASCVD events), and 157 with neither (250 ASCVD events). The CAC score was independently associated with incident CHD in multivariable analyses in those with diabetes (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19–1.43), MetS (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20–1.41), and neither condition (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27–1.47). For incident CHD, net reclassification improvement with addition of CAC score was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.10–0.37) in those with diabetes, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09–0.35) in those with MetS, and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.15–0.35) in those with neither condition. The CAC score was also a prognostic indicator of CHD and ASCVD after controlling for diabetes duration of 10 years or longer at baseline, insulin use, and glycemic control.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a large multiethnic cohort, the addition of CAC score to global risk assessment was associated with significantly improved risk classification in those with MetS and diabetes, even if diabetes duration was longer than a decade, suggesting a role for the CAC score in risk assessment in such patients.

### Thromboembolic complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients are associated with impaired fibrinolysis [^116uKprL]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

ROTEM revealed severe hypofibrinolysis in COVID-19 patients. Maximum lysis, especially following stimulation of the extrinsic coagulation system, was inversely associated with an enhanced risk of thromboembolic complications. The combination of maximum lysis with D-dimer concentrations revealed high sensitivity and specificity of thromboembolic risk prediction. Hence, ROTEM may help to identify patients benefiting from therapeutic anticoagulation.

Results

Among 287 patients with COVID-19 and suspected PE (177 [51.4%] men; mean [SD] age, 58.2 [16.1] years), 118 patients required intensive care unit levels of care (41.1%) and 27 patients died during hospitalization (9.4%). Of 287 patients with CTPA, 37 patients had radiographic evidence of PE (12.9%) and 250 patients did not (87.1%); 265 patients had plasma D-dimer levels of 0.05 μg/mL or more (92.3%), including all patients with PE and 225 of 250 patients without PE (91.2%). The median (IQR) D-dimer values were 1.0 (0.6–1.8) μg/mL for 250 patients without PE and 6.1 (2.0–19.4) μg/mL for 37 patients with PE. D-dimer values ranged from 0.2 μg/mL to 128 μg/mL among patients without PE and from 0.5 μg/mL to more than 10 000 μg/mL among patients with PE, and patients without PE had statistically significantly decreased mean (SD) D-dimer values (8.7 [11.6] μg/mL vs 1.2 [2.8] μg/mL; P < .001).

In this multicentre national cohort of children with SARS-CoV-2 involving 49 hospitals, 4 patients out of 537 infected children developed a thrombotic complication (prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.2% to 1.9%) out of the global cohort and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3% to 2.8%) out of the hospitalised patients). We describe their characteristics and review other published paediatric cases. Three out of the four patients were adolescent girls, and only two cases had significant thrombotic risk factors. In this paediatric cohort, D-dimer value was not specific enough to predict thrombotic complications. Adolescence and previous thrombotic risk factors may be considered when initiating anticoagulant prophylaxis on children with SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19).

### The health and psychosocial functioning of caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders [^117CFnzs]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (Neuro) pose complex parenting challenges, particularly if the condition co-occurs with behaviour problems. Such challenges are likely to impact caregiver health and well-being. This study explores the extent to which caregivers of children with both 'Neuro' and behaviour problems differ in their physical and psychosocial outcomes from caregivers of children with either condition or neither condition.

Method

The first wave of data collected in the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth in Canada (1994) was used to identify four groups of caregivers of 4 to 11-year-old children: caregivers of children with a 'Neuro' disorder and externalising behaviour problems (Both; n = 414), caregivers of children with a 'Neuro' disorder only (Neuro Only; n = 750), caregivers of children with an externalising behaviour problem only (Ext Only; n = 1067), and caregivers of children with neither health condition (Neither; n = 7236).

Results

Caregivers in the 'Both' group were least likely to report excellent or very good health, and more frequently reported chronic conditions such as asthma, arthritis, back problems, migraine headaches, and limitations in activities as compared to the 'Neither' group. This group also exhibited higher depression scores, experienced more problematic family functioning, and reported lower social support than the 'Neither' group. Scores for caregivers in the 'Ext Only' and 'Neuro Only' groups tended to lie between the 'Both' and 'Neither' group scores and often did not differ from one another.

Conclusions

Caregivers of children with both neurodevelopmental disorders and behaviour problems exhibited a greater number of health and psychosocial problems. While addressing children's behaviour problems, health care professionals should also consider caregiver physical and psychosocial health as this may also have an impact on children's well-being.

### Vaping health perceptions and never vaping among Australian adolescents: a strength-based analysis of cross-sectional survey data [^1138K8wH]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

While some health perceptions appear to be well established among adolescents, with upwards of 70% in each lifetime vaping category agreeing that vaping can damage the lungs, others demonstrate large proportions that neither agreed nor disagreed. For example, approximately 20%–30% of participants in lifetime vaping category (excluding never users) neither agreed nor disagreed vapes can harm the developing brain or that vapes are unsafe to use. Responses for vapes are healthier than cigarettes and vapes help smokers to quit also had large proportions neither agreeing nor disagreeing. While perceiving vaping to be unsafe around others was associated with greater likelihood of never vaping (ie, protective) among those who neither agreed nor disagreed, there was no association for other perceptions (including addiction, harm to the brain and unsafe) and interestingly, they were even less likely to never vape (ie, had greater odds of vaping) than those who agree nicotine is harmless and disagree that vaping can damage the lungs (never vs ever comparison). Like those who agree vapes are healthier than cigarettes and can help smokers quit, those who neither agree nor disagree also have lower odds of never vaping but to a lesser extent. Thus, aside from not being a factor protective against vaping, several of these perceptions have the opposite relation and are associated with greater risk of vaping among this group — in some cases greater than those who overtly consider vaping harmful. As messages that convey uncertainty are linked to viewing vaping as less risky, it is possible this could be influencing vaping behaviour, or a rationalisation for it. Also, this group is likely to be heterogeneous in their interpretation and reasoning behind the selection of 'neither agree nor disagree' and may reflect ambivalence, lack of knowledge or conviction, not holding an opinion or uncertainty. The notion that vapers would quit once health effects become known may suggest that an absence of evidence is being rationalised, to some degree, as an absence of harm or inconsequential harm, or that adolescents do not adopt caution in the face of the unknown.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^1134vQLz]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST strength of recommendations — strong recommendations are graded 1A, 1B, and 1C with specified evidence and implications. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (1B): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Strong recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (1C): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^1147uGtx]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST strength of recommendations — weak recommendations are graded 2A, 2B, and 2C with corresponding evidence and implications. Weak recommendations (2A–2B): Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden. Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A): Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B): Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C): Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.
