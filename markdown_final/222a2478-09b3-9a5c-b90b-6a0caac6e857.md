## Question

Can vasculitis cause ulcers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vasculitis can cause ulcers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking vasculitis to tissue injury and ulceration. Then, I should verify which vasculitis subtypes most commonly produce ulcers and why. Next, I will review epidemiologic and clinical evidence quantifying ulcer occurrence in vasculitis. After that, I need to check diagnostic pitfalls and how to distinguish vasculitic ulcers from mimics. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and outline practical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic plausibility. Vasculitis is inflammation of vessel walls that compromises perfusion, leading to ischemia, hemorrhage, and necrosis; when ischemia is severe enough, tissue necrosis progresses to ulceration, so yes, vasculitis can directly cause ulcers via ischemic injury and inflammatory destruction of vessels, particularly in the skin and mucosa where small- and medium-caliber vessels are abundant and accessible to biopsy confirmation [^113z9eb9] [^115eqzAo] [^1141gdxS].

> Wait, let me verify which vasculitides most often ulcerate. Small-vessel vasculitides frequently produce palpable purpura and can progress to hemorrhagic bullae and punched-out ulcers when deeper dermal or subcutaneous vessels are involved; medium-vessel vasculitides like polyarteritis nodosa and ANCA-associated vasculitides also cause ulcers via necrotizing vasculitis and ischemia, and Behçet disease is classically associated with recurrent oral and genital ulcers as a direct vasculitic manifestation, so the clinical spectrum spans superficial purpura to deep necrotic ulcers depending on vessel size and activity [^113z9eb9] [^112d3C7r] [^112TFPGf].

> I should double-check the epidemiologic signal. In population-based leg ulcer series, vasculitis accounts for a meaningful minority of nonvenous ulcers, around 5% in one large dataset, and in connective tissue disease cohorts with leg ulcers, vasculitis is a leading etiology in roughly 20% of cases; moreover, patients with vasculitic ulcers have a high prevalence of hypercoagulability, which may amplify ischemia and ulcer severity, reinforcing the causal link and its clinical relevance [^116ewFuE] [^114kUC9p] [^111YrqQd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about morphology equaling etiology. Vasculitic ulcers can mimic pyoderma gangrenosum and other inflammatory ulcers, and misdiagnosis is common, with up to 36% of presumed pyoderma gangrenosum cases ultimately proving to be alternative diagnoses including vasculitis; this means I need to ensure histopathology and appropriate serologies are pursued rather than assuming an inflammatory ulcer is sterile and autoimmune without proof [^113ZkKzs] [^112UxEUZ].

> Next, I should review how to confirm vasculitis as the cause of an ulcer. Let me think about biopsy strategy: sampling the periulcer edge or an early purpuric lesion, extending to subcutis, maximizes yield for necrotizing vasculitis, whereas ulcer bed tissue is often nonspecific; direct immunofluorescence helps distinguish IgA vasculitis from IgG/IgM immune complex vasculitis, and ANCA testing supports ANCA-associated vasculitis when combined with compatible histology and systemic features, so I need to ensure the right tissue is biopsied and the lab panel is targeted [^115eqzAo] [^111gUeCp] [^113z9eb9].

> I will now examine management implications briefly to ensure clinical completeness. The cornerstone is control of the underlying vasculitis with immunosuppression tailored to disease severity and organ involvement, while local wound care addresses infection, moisture balance, and debridement; importantly, standard venous ulcer compression is contraindicated if there is concurrent arterial insufficiency or vasculitic ischemia, so I should confirm perfusion and etiology before committing to compression-only protocols [^116DdUTM] [^1133wSkN] [^114dZ1Qb].

> But wait, what if the ulcer is multifactorial in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. I need to check for mixed etiologies such as venous stasis, arterial insufficiency, calciphylaxis, infection, or medication effects, because vasculitis often coexists with these contributors and alters both prognosis and treatment response; in such cases, a multidisciplinary approach and repeated biopsies may be necessary to align therapy with the dominant pathophysiology at each stage [^114kUC9p] [^114jB98n] [^113fbQUF].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: yes, vasculitis can cause ulcers, and it does so via ischemic necrosis from inflamed, obstructed, or destroyed blood vessels, with clinical manifestations ranging from small superficial erosions to deep necrotic ulcers depending on vessel caliber and disease activity; accurate diagnosis hinges on correlating morphology with histopathology and serologies, and management requires disease-directed immunosuppression plus meticulous wound care to restore perfusion and heal tissue [^113z9eb9] [^115eqzAo] [^116DdUTM].

Vasculitis can cause **ulcers** by damaging blood vessel walls, leading to ischemia, necrosis, and tissue breakdown [^113z9eb9]. Ulcers from vasculitis are most often due to **small- or medium-vessel vasculitis** (e.g. ANCA-associated vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid vasculitis) and present as painful, irregular ulcers with undermined edges, often on the lower extremities [^112d3C7r] [^116voHA1]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical features plus biopsy** showing vasculitis, and management requires controlling the underlying vasculitis with immunosuppression plus wound care [^115aL7Mt] [^1133wSkN]. Ulcers can also occur in Behçet disease and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and vasculitic ulcers must be distinguished from mimics like pyoderma gangrenosum and venous ulcers [^112TFPGf] [^116btFo3] [^113ZkKzs].

---

## Pathophysiology of ulcer formation in vasculitis

Vasculitis causes **ulcers** through several mechanisms:

- **Inflammation and necrosis**: Immune-mediated inflammation damages vessel walls, causing necrosis and ischemia, leading to tissue death and ulceration [^113z9eb9].

- **Thrombosis and occlusion**: Inflammation promotes thrombosis, further reducing perfusion and causing ischemic necrosis [^1141gdxS].

- **Direct tissue injury**: Inflammatory infiltrates injure surrounding tissue, impairing healing and promoting ulceration [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations of vasculitic ulcers

Vasculitic ulcers have **distinct clinical features**:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Appearance | Painful, irregular ulcers with undermined edges; necrotic base; often on lower extremities [^notfound] |
| Associated symptoms | Purpura, livedo reticularis, nodules, digital gangrene, systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, arthralgia) [^113z9eb9] |
| Common vasculitides | - ANCA-associated vasculitis <br/> - Polyarteritis nodosa <br/> - Rheumatoid vasculitis <br/> - Behçet disease <br/> - Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis [^112d3C7r] [^112TFPGf] [^116btFo3] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis of vasculitic ulcers requires a **multimodal approach**:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history, exam, and review of systems to identify systemic features and exclude mimics [^111gUeCp].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR/CRP, ANCA, ANA, RF, anti-CCP, cryoglobulins, hepatitis B/C serologies, and coagulation profile [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or angiography to assess vessel involvement and exclude arterial disease [^114kUC9p].

- **Histopathology**: Skin biopsy is the gold standard, showing inflammation of vessel walls, necrosis, and thrombosis; periulcer biopsies can improve yield [^115eqzAo] [^115aL7Mt].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires **two-pronged therapy**:

### Control of underlying vasculitis

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: First-line for most vasculitides; rapid anti-inflammatory effect [^116DdUTM].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab for induction/remission [^116DdUTM].

- **Biologic therapies**: Rituximab or TNF inhibitors for refractory cases (e.g. ANCA-associated vasculitis, rheumatoid vasculitis) [^116DdUTM] [^116PWPF7].

---

### Local wound care

Local care emphasizes **moist wound healing** with appropriate dressings, infection control with culture-guided antibiotics, and debridement to remove necrosis and promote granulation [^1133wSkN] [^1111rGmG]. Offloading and compression (if no arterial disease) reduce pressure and edema to support healing [^114dZ1Qb].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on **vasculitis control** and comorbidities; persistent inflammation delays healing and increases recurrence risk [^1177TzPx]. Complications include infection, scarring, permanent tissue loss, and significant quality-of-life impairment due to pain and disability [^111fzzF1].

---

## Differentiation from other ulcerative conditions

Vasculitic ulcers must be distinguished from:

- **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Inflammatory ulcers with undermined edges, often associated with IBD or autoimmune disease; biopsy shows neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis [^113ZkKzs].

- **Venous ulcers**: Shallow ulcers on the medial malleolus with venous insufficiency; biopsy shows fibrosis and hemosiderin deposition [^notfound].

- **Arterial ulcers**: Deep, punched-out ulcers with distal ischemia; ABI < 0.5 [^notfound].

---

Vasculitis can cause **ulcers** through ischemia and tissue necrosis from vessel inflammation; management centers on controlling the vasculitis and providing meticulous wound care, with outcomes tied to disease control and comorbidities.

### Leg ulcers: uncommon presentations [^115WPEsQ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Uncommon presentations like vasculitis or other immunologic causes and malignancy account for about 1% to 2% of patients suffering from leg ulcers. We focus on such uncommon leg ulcers including: cutaneous vasculitis causing cutaneous ulceration, other immunologic or metabolic cutaneous lesions such as pyoderma gangrenosum and necrobiosis lipoidica, and ulcers based on neoplastic etiology. A short description on leg ulcers in the tropics is also included. The described uncommon presentations of leg ulcers are typically difficult to diagnose and treat; it is a specialist's job to take care of patients with these types of ulcers. Multidisciplinary specialized wound healing concepts integrated in the national health care system, as an accepted expert function, is the ideal way to organize the wound healing area. Such a system would result in an earlier diagnosis and more sufficient treatment for patients with uncommon presentations of leg ulcers.

### Causes, investigation and treatment of leg ulceration [^115SrnJy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic ulceration of the lower leg is a frequent condition, with a prevalence of 3–5% in the population over 65 years of age. The incidence of ulceration is rising as a result of the ageing population and increased risk factors for atherosclerotic occlusion such as smoking, obesity and diabetes. Ulcers can be defined as wounds with a 'full thickness depth' and a 'slow healing tendency'. In general, the slow healing tendency is not simply explained by depth and size, but caused by an underlying pathogenetic factor that needs to be removed to induce healing. The main causes are venous valve insufficiency, lower extremity arterial disease and diabetes. Less frequent conditions are infection, vasculitis, skin malignancies and ulcerating skin diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum. But even rarer conditions exist, such as the recently discovered combination of vasculitis and hypercoagulability. For a proper treatment of patients with leg ulcers, it is important to be aware of the large differential diagnosis of leg ulceration.

### Inflammatory and vaso-occlusive ulcers: part I-clinical presentation and diagnosis [^111V75qz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this CME, we review 2 specific categories of ulcers: inflammatory (where inflammation is the primary pathologic process leading to ulceration) and vaso-occlusive (where occlusion is the primary process). Inflammatory ulcers include pyoderma gangrenosum and vasculitides, whereas livedoid vasculopathy, calciphylaxis, and Martorell ulcers are vaso-occlusive ulcers. Determining the causes of ulcers in these conditions may require laboratory evaluation, biopsy, and imaging.

### Unusual causes of cutaneous ulceration [^113WVoSC]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Skin ulceration is a major source of morbidity and is often difficult to manage. Ulcers caused by an inflammatory cause or microvascular occlusion are particularly challenging in terms of diagnosis and treatment. The management of such ulcers requires careful assessment of associated systemic conditions and a thorough analysis of the ulcer's clinical and histologic findings. In this article, the authors discuss several examples of inflammatory ulcers and the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these ulcers.

### Basic approach to inflammatory ulcers [^116aTPPN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Cutaneous ulcers are a difficult problem. A multidisciplinary approach is often adapted in caring for patients with nonhealing wounds. Internists, surgeons, dermatologists, and nurses must work together to provide a patient with the most comprehensive care possible. Dermatologists are consulted for a number of reasons, particularly if the ulcers are secondary to an inflammatory process. In this discussion, we describe a basic and useful approach to the diagnosis and management of inflammatory ulcers. The spectrum of these conditions is wide, ranging from vasculitis, to pyoderma gangrenosum, to ulcers resulting from the antiphospholipid syndrome and cryoprecipitates. The present authors will emphasize that the approach needs to be all-encompassing, and not focused on the ulceration alone. Certain clues are critical to diagnosis. The management, whereas often difficult, can be very rewarding.

3.11 Background/purpose

Vasculitis refers to a disease in which the vascular structure is damaged through immune cell infiltration in the vascular wall, inducing ischemia‐related tissue/organ disorder. The pathogenesis of vasculitis remains to be clarified. Diagnosis/treatment methods have not been sufficiently established. In the Chapel Hill classificationpublished in 1994, the classification of vasculitis based on vascular thickness (large, medium, and small blood vessels) was proposed. In a revision in 2012, it was subdivided in consideration of the etiology and underlying disease. In addition, the Nomenclature of Cutaneous Vasculitis: Dermatological Addendum to the CHCC 2012was published in 2018, providing a detailed description of individual skin lesions associated with vasculitis. In the skin, the incidence of medium/small vessel vasculitis is high. Cutaneous vasculitis induces various dermal symptoms, but skin ulcers may occur.

For the treatment of vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers, it is the most important to control primary disease activity. However, there are cases in which it is difficult to evaluate which treatment is useful for treating skin ulcers, especially when physicians other than dermatologists are responsible for treatment. In this section, we establish the CQ "Are there any drugs effective for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers?" and aim to present the directivity of treatment for vasculitis‐related skin ulcers based on the literature previously reported.

Behçet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis affecting arteries and veins of all sizes as well as recurrent oral, genital, and intestinal ulcers, skin lesions, predominantly posterior uveitis, and parenchymal brain lesions. These can be present in various combinations and sequences over time and diagnosis is made by recognizing the manifestations, as there are no diagnostic biomarkers or genetic tests. Treatment modalities include immunomodulatory agents, immunosuppressives and biologics, tailored according to prognostic factors, disease activity, severity, and patients' preferences.

1 CHAPTER 1: GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE/VASCULITIS‐ASSOCIATED SKIN ULCERS (THIRD EDITION)

1.1 Background to the drafting of guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease/vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers (third edition)

Guidelines are "documents systematically prepared to support medical experts and patients for making appropriate judgments in particular clinical situations". Various clinical departments contribute to the management of connective tissue diseases and vasculitis, but dermatologists play a central role in evaluating skin lesions and treating skin ulcers. The Japanese Dermatological Association prepared these guidelines with an emphasis on the treatment of connective tissue disease– and vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers in the clinical setting of dermatology. Such ulcers occur against a background of various types of diseases, typically systemic sclerosis (SSc), but also include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), various vasculitides, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Therefore, in preparing the present guidelines, we considered the appropriate diagnostic/therapeutic approach for each of these disorders and developed corresponding algorithms and commentaries. The present guidelines aim to improve the quality and level of connective tissue disease– and vasculitis‐associated skin ulcer diagnosis/treatment in Japan by systematically presenting evidence‐based recommendations supporting clinical judgments.

1.2 Position of the guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease/vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers (third edition)

The Wound, Pressure Ulcer, and Burn Guidelines Drafting Committee was composed of members delegated by the Board of Directors of the Japanese Dermatological Association. It held several meetings and online meetings after the first meeting on June 3, 2018, and has drafted the explanations on wounds in general, and five other related guidelines, including these guidelines, by taking into consideration the opinions of the Scientific Committee and the Board of Directors of the Japanese Dermatological Association. The present guidelines reflect the current standards for diagnosis and treatment of skin ulcers in Japan. Background factors, such as the severity of symptoms and complications, vary among patients with connective tissue disease/vasculitis; therefore, physicians responsible for treatment should decide therapeutic strategies with patients. It is unlikely that the optimized treatment for an individual patient is in absolute agreement with these guidelines. Any deviation from these guidelines should not be the basis for citation in lawsuits or legal disputes. On the other hand, for treatment, the present situation in which treatment guidelines are quoted in lawsuits must be considered.

### Atypical ulcers [^116XJRqt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical ulcers of the skin challenge the dermatologist with respect to recognition, diagnosis, management, and treatment. The entire gamut of pathogenic categories including vascular, inflammatory, neoplastic, genetic, medication-related, and infectious processes may give rise to atypical ulcers. By definition, these ulcers are unusual, and accurate diagnosis may ultimately require the clinician to violate the dictum that "common things are common". Atypical ulcers may present with features that the clinician has not previously encountered, or may present with seemingly typical features that actually mislead due to phenotypic mimicry. Because skin ulcers are inherently tissue-destructive, and may reflect an underlying systemic disease process, there is heightened urgency to achieving an accurate diagnosis and initiating appropriate therapy.

3.20 Possibility of future research

With respect to treatment for rheumatoid vasculitis, there are many options, but no intervention study has investigated the efficacy of a drug/treatment method for ulcers as a primary outcome. Currently, there are only observational studies, of which the evidence level is low. A high‐quality RCT should be performed. Recently, JAK inhibitors became commercially available as a new drug for RA or vasculitis. The efficacy of JAK inhibitors was verified, establishing articular symptoms of RA as an outcome. However, no clinical study regarding rheumatoid vasculitis with skin ulcers was extracted. In Japan, the frequency of use has increased since approval in 2013. Therefore, if the efficacy for rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers is examined, and if a comparative study with conventional treatment methods is performed, a clear answer to the question "which drug should be recommended for rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers?" may be obtained.

### Cutaneous vasculitis: review on diagnosis and clinicopathologic correlations [^113z9eb9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous vasculitis is an inflammatory disease affecting the dermal blood vessel walls. The skin is a privileged organ in the setting of vasculitis since it is easily accessible for physical examination and safe biopsy, allowing an accurate characterization of inflammatory lesions. The skin is often involved. Also, cutaneous vasculitis can reflect a cutaneous component of a systemic vasculitis, a skin-limited or skin-dominant expression or variant of a systemic vasculitis, or be a single-organ vasculitis per se. Vasculitis lesions are multiple and polymorphic. They may induce a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations depending on the location and the size of the vessels involved. The depth of affected vessels is correlated with the type of cutaneous lesions. Involvement of small superficial vessels results mostly in urticarial, but relatively persistent plaques, papules, and palpable purpura. Involvement of vessels in the dermohypodermic junction or hypodermis results in ulcers, nodules, or livedo. The type of inflammatory infiltrate is also a key finding for the diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is not a disease per se but the result of a pathophysiological process common to different causes. A better knowledge of the vascular anatomy of the skin, elementary lesions, and histological characteristics of dermatologic manifestations would allow a more relevant and more efficient diagnostic approach. We also propose a list of additional exams to be performed in front of skin lesions suggestive of vasculitis. The aim of our article is to provide an overview of elementary skin lesions and clinicopathologic correlations in cutaneous and systemic vasculitis.

4.8 Wound bed preparation

Management of the wound surface environment to promote wound healing. Specifically, necrotic tissue is removed, the bacterial load is reduced, wound drying is prevented, excessive exudates are controlled, and pockets and wound margins are treated.

4.9 Moist wound healing

Maintaining a moist wound surface. This retains multinucleated leukocytes, macrophages, enzymes, and cell growth factors within exudates on the wound surface. Such an environment promotes autolysis and the removal of necrotic tissue and does not interfere with cell migration.

4.10 Raynaud phenomenon

Finger/toe vasospasm triggered by cold or psychological stress, causing clearly bordered color changes in the fingers/toes. Three‐phase color changes of white–purple–red are typically observed.

4.11 Finger/toe tip ulcer

Skin ulcer occurring at the end of a finger or toe primarily due to peripheral circulatory disorders. This usually painful condition occurs frequently in patients with SSc but is also observed even in patients who show no skin sclerosis and do not satisfy the diagnostic criteria for SSc.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^116ewFuE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonvenous causes of leg ulcers (Guideline 3.2) We recommend identification of medical conditions that affect ulcer healing and other nonvenous causes of leg ulcers. Differentiation of venous from nonvenous leg ulcers is important before initiation of therapy. In a defined Swedish population, prevalence of active leg ulcers was 0.31%, with 54% classified as venous and 46% nonvenous. In a population-based study from Germany including 31,619 patients, venous reflux was the causative factor in 47.6%, arterial insufficiency in 14.5%, and combined arterial and venous reflux in 17.6%. Rarer causes included vasculitis (5.1%), exogenous factors (3.8%), pyoderma gangrenosum (3.0%), infection (1.4%), neoplasia.

### Increased incidence of hypercoagulability in patients with leg ulcers caused by leukocytoclastic vasculitis [^111YrqQd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is a rare cause of leg ulceration. It is unclear why severe skin infarction develops in some patients with vasculitis, whereas others have only mild symptoms such as purpura, erythema, or urticaria. A coincidence of vasculitis and hypercoagulability may lead to more extensive thrombotic occlusion and hence explain the occurrence of large ulcers in a subset of patients. Our aim was to investigate whether patients with vasculitis ulcers have an increased incidence of hypercoagulability. Thirteen consecutive patients admitted to the hospital with necrotic ulcers caused by histologically confirmed vasculitis were screened for clotting disorders. In 7 of 13 patients (53%), hypercoagulable conditions were found. Five patients had factor V Leiden (38%), and 2 had lupus anticoagulant (15%). The normal frequency of these conditions is 5% to 6% and 3.6%, respectively. These data indicate that there is an increased incidence of hypercoagulable disorders in patients with vasculitis ulcers. We recommend screening these patients routinely for hypercoagulability.

### Vasculitic and autoimmune wounds [^113fbQUF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic wounds are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 20% to 23% of nonhealing wounds that are refractory to vascular intervention have other causes, including vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and other autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this article was to review the literature across medical and surgical specialties with regard to refractory chronic wounds associated with vasculitis and autoimmune diseases and to delineate clinical outcomes of these wounds in response to vascular and other interventions.

Methods

An electronic search encompassing MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus was completed using the following search terms: rheumatoid arthritis; systemic sclerosis; systemic lupus erythematosus; antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; mixed connective tissue disease; antiphospholipid syndrome; pyoderma gangrenosum; thromboangiitis obliterans; cryoglobulinemia; hydroxyurea; sickle cell; atrophie blanche; livedoid vasculitis; cholesterol emboli; calciphylaxis; antiphospholipid antibodies; prothrombotic; combined with the terms: chronic wound and leg ulcer. Full-text articles published in English up to March 1, 2016, that investigated the clinical outcomes of chronic wounds associated with autoimmune diseases were included. Review articles and evaluations of management of chronic wounds were also reviewed. Primary outcomes included in the review were amputation, ulcer healing, reduction in wound size, overall survival, and freedom from reintervention. Owing to the heterogeneity of data reporting among articles, qualitative analysis is also reported.

Results

Vasculitis and autoimmune diseases play a role in 20% to 23% of patients with chronic lower extremity ulcers. Furthermore, patients with autoimmune disease have a significantly high rate of split thickness skin graft failure (50% compared to 97% in patients without autoimmune disease; P = 0.0002). The management of leg ulcers associated with autoimmune diseases is discussed.

Conclusions

Autoimmune and vasculitic causes should be considered in patients with chronic wounds who do not respond to appropriate vascular intervention and standard local wound care. A multidisciplinary approach with the involvement of rheumatologists allows investigation for underlying systemic disease and improves clinical outcomes for many of these challenging patients.

### Wound, pressure ulcer, and burn guidelines (2023)-4: guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease / vasculitis-associated skin ulcers, third edition [^115aL7Mt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In skin ulcers suspected to be due to vasculitis, histopathological findings by skin biopsy are extremely important for the definitive diagnosis. When performing a skin biopsy, the sampling sites should be carefully evaluated; if possible, samples should be obtained from several sites. However, skin ulcer sites are usually densely infiltrated by inflammatory cells including neutrophils; even if necrotizing vasculitis is present, its histological profile is difficult to detect in samples including tissue from the ulcerated area. Moreover, as a skin biopsy may enlarge or exacerbate skin ulcers, caution is necessary.

Meanwhile, livedo reticularis, nodules, infiltration, and tender erythema or purpura are often observed in addition to skin ulcers as skin symptoms of vasculitis. Therefore, in conducting a skin biopsy of the diagnosis of skin ulcers suspected to be due to vasculitis, histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis is more likely to be obtained by carefully evaluating rashes other than ulcers. Also, if signs of necrotizing vasculitis cannot be detected in conventional skin biopsy specimens, they may be revealed in sections other than those examined. Therefore, it may also be necessary to examine deep‐cut sections in certain cases.

The present guidelines mainly discuss skin ulcers in primary (idiopathic) vasculitis by excluding secondary vasculitis due to cancer, infections, or drugs. The therapeutic algorithm is shown in Figure 4, and the details are described in CQ3 and Explanation 5. In evaluating treatments for skin ulcers due to vasculitis, the manner of controlling the activity of the primary disease is important. While the present guidelines also mention treatments for vasculitis itself, see the "Guidelines for vasculitis and vasculopathy" by the Japanese Dermatological Associationfor details.

FIGURE 4
Therapeutic algorithm for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers. CQ, clinical question.

2.2.5 ‐associated skin ulcers

Causes of RA‐associated skin ulcers are broadly divided into "vasculitic" and "nonvasculitic". The nonvasculitic skin ulcers can be further classified into "lower leg ulcers due to venous stasis", "ulcers due to ischemic necrosis of soft tissue associated with compression", "traumatic ulcers based on skin fragility", and "other diseases that are likely to complicate rheumatoid arthritis". Pyoderma gangrenosum is also likely to complicate RA and cause skin ulcers. Therefore, in treating skin ulcers in RA patients, it is important to differentiate among these causes and diseases. Regarding the differentiation procedure, it is important to first definitively differentiate between vasculitic and nonvasculitic ulcers because their treatments differ.

### Inflammatory ulcers [^112sJvgZ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Skin ulcerations may develop as a manifestation of a variety of different diseases or may result from some nondisease phenomena. Inflammatory ulcers refer specifically to those ulcerations in which inflammation is the primary pathologic process resulting in lesion formation; that is, inflammation is the cause rather than the consequence of the ulcer. This review will consider several types of inflammatory ulcers that the clinician may encounter in his or her practice.

According to the Minds Manual for Clinical Practice Guideline Development 2020, accompanying working templates were used.

1.7.1 Evaluation of individual reports (step 1)

Systematic review teams responsible for individual CQs evaluated the bias risk (selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, patient attrition bias, other biases) and indirectness (differences in the study patient population/intervention/comparison/outcome measurement) of each study design (interventional study, observational study) with respect to the outcome‐based literature, and extracted the number of patients. When effect‐index‐presenting methods differed, they were unified to the risk ratio or risk difference, and described as total evidence.

1.7.2 Summary on total evidence (step 2)

The total evidence integrated across outcomes was assessed with respect to a summary on total evidence, and the certainty of evidence was decided on one. The bias risk and indirectness were again evaluated. In addition, inconsistency, inaccuracy, and publication bias were assessed. The certainty (strength) of evidence was classified, as shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Classification of certainty (strength) of evidence.

1.7.3 Quantitative systematic review (meta‐analysis)

When the study design was similar, with the high‐degree similarity of each item of PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome), a meta‐analysis to quantitatively integrate effect indices was performed, and the integrated result was considered as an item for examining the strength of total evidence.

1.7.4 Qualitative systematic review

When it was difficult to perform a quantitative systematic review (meta‐analysis), we performed a qualitative systematic review.

1.7.5 Preparation of a systematic review report

The results of the above quantitative or qualitative systematic review were summarized in a systematic review report as the strength of total evidence, and used as materials for preparing recommendations with a summary on total evidence.

5.4.1 Dermatomyositis‐associated skin ulcers occur by various mechanisms of pathogenesis: primary disease–related ulcers to ulcers related to secondary factors such as infection. To evaluate the pathogenesis, skin biopsy and microbiology tests for bacteria/fungus/acid‐fast bacteria should be performed

The incidence of dermatomyositis‐associated skin ulcers is 3% to 19% according to several case series studies. There are various etiologies of dermatomyositis‐associated skin ulcers: primary disease–related ulcers to secondary factor–related ulcers. Primary factors include vasculopathy, vasculitis, excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells at the dermoepidermal junction, infectious disease, and erosion associated with pruritus‐related scratching behavior. Therefore, it is recommended to perform skin biopsy and microbiology tests for bacteria/fungus/acid‐fast bacteria and closely investigate the etiology of ulcers.
Yamasaki et al.performed case series analysis and extracted "skin ulcer" as an independent risk factor for the prognosis of dermatomyositis.

Vascular and ulcers

Six references were included in the domain 'Vascular & Ulcers'.

First, the North American Working Group regarding the classification of digital ulcers (DUs) in SSc developed a consensus for the classification of DUs, which after training of rheumatologists with SSc expertise could be used with fair reliability to classify DUs and to measure ulcer area.

Second, Fujimoto et al described, on behalf of the Wound/Burn Guidelines Committee of the Japanese Dermatological Association, recommendations for the management of skin ulcers associated with CTD/vasculitis. In this way, an algorithm for SSc-related ulcers was proposed, as well as a reply to frequently asked questions in the care of SSc-related ulcers. Third, Hughes et al published, on behalf of the UKSSG, a best practice consensus recommendation for digital vasculopathy intended as a reference tool to inform management. In this way algorithms for the management of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), DUs and critical digital ischaemia in patients with SSc have been proposed.

Fourth, in the recommendations by expert groups of Pistorius et al, on behalf of the French Society of Vascular Medicine and the French Society for Microcirculation, clinical guidelines (more specifically clinical examination, nailfold capillaroscopy and antinuclear antibodies) as a work-up of patients with RP were defined. Besides this, a consensus-based recommendation was recently developed to diagnose RP and primary RP. Unfortunately, high evidence level guidelines based on the combination of a representative committee, systematic review and synthesis of evidence are lacking on the topic of primary versus secondary RP.

Interestingly, points to consider for clinical trials in SSc-associated RP have also been suggested by Cutolo et al.

Gastrointestinal

Three references were included concerning 'GI' recommendations.

Alantar et al described, on behalf of a French multidisciplinary working group, recommendations for the care of oral involvement (prevention of oral and dental complications, as well as SSc-tailored dental treatment) in patients with SSc.

Baron et al published, on behalf of the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group, recommendations for the screening and management of malnutrition and GI-related manifestations. Lastly, Hansi et al proposed, on behalf of the UKSSG, symptom-based algorithms as a useful tool and point of reference concerning gastro-oesophageal symptoms, abdominal pain and distention, weight loss and nutritional issues, diarrhoea, incontinence and constipation.

### Inflammatory and vaso-occlusive ulcers: part II-management [^1133wSkN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the second part of this CME, we present an approach for the management of inflammatory and vaso-occlusive ulcers and highlight the need for further research in this field. The 3 overarching principles for management are etiology-specific treatment, ulcer care, and consideration of patient comorbidities and risk factors for poor healing. Both etiology-specific treatment and management of patient comorbidities and risk factors often require collaboration with providers from other specialties. Ulcer care is governed by tissue debridement, infection control, management of moisture imbalance, and epithelial edge advancement. As wound healing is a dynamic process, management should be adapted to changes in the status of the ulcer.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum-like skin ulceration in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a retrospective case series [^112UxEUZ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) can be associated with various cutaneous manifestations. Several case reports have described skin ulceration resembling pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), particularly in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA); however, the true incidence of this PG-like ulceration in various diseases is unknown. In addition, PG is frequently misdiagnosed, and diagnosis may rely on exclusion of other causes of ulcers. We aimed to describe clinical and histopathological features of PG-like ulcerations occurring in association with AAV and identify clues to differentiate these ulcers from PG. Retrospective search was conducted to include patients with AAV presenting with PG-like ulcers treated at our institution. This large case series highlights presentation of PG-like ulcers occurring in patients with AAV. Care should be taken to avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of AAV. Distinction between AAV and PG is challenging yet mandatory for proper treatment. Diagnosis relies on a constellation of detailed cutaneous clinical examination, systemic symptoms or illness, histopathological features and laboratory tests.

3.15 Possibility of future research

Vasculitis is rare, and it may be difficult to accumulate a sufficient number of patients at a single institution. The literature primarily consisted of descriptive studies. In the future, the efficacy of each drug should be examined in a multicenter cooperative study, establishing skin ulcers as a primary endpoint. Furthermore, the condition may differ among types of vasculitis, and which immunosuppressant is effective for skin ulcers associated with respective disease types must be investigated in the future. With recent marked advances in vasculitis treatment, the efficacy of biological preparations, such as anti–interleukin 6 receptor antibody, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and C5a receptor inhibitors has been clarified. In the future, the efficacy of these new drugs for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers should also be further examined.

CQ4: Are there any treatment methods effective for rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers?

3.16 Background/purpose

Rheumatoid vasculitis is a general term for RA‐related vasculitis. Clinically, heterogeneity is strong, and various blood vessels (small to large) are damaged. Vasculitis at various levels can be observed in the skin, ranging from leukocytoclastic vasculitis of dermal venules to necrotizing vasculitis of adipose tissue arterioles, often inducing skin ulcers. For the treatment of rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers, standard drugs for skin ulcers are ineffective, and vasculitis‐targeting treatment is necessary. However, many treatment options, such as steroids, immunosuppressants, diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS), TNF‐α inhibitors, rituximab, leukocytapheresis/granulocytapheresis (LCAP/GCAP), and JAK inhibitors, are listed as candidates. It is often difficult to determine which treatment method should be used in clinical practice. We aim to present the directivity of treatment by examining the effects of each treatment method on rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers using the EBM method.

3.17 Scientific basis

A literature search on drugs that are used for the treatment of rheumatoid vasculitis in Japan (steroids, cyclophosphamide + steroid pulse, azathioprine, DDS, TNF‐α inhibitors, rituximab, LCAP/GCAP, JAK inhibitors, methotrexate) was performed, and 15 articles verifying their usefulness for treating rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers were adopted: two RCTs, one non‐RCT, six cohort studies, and six case series studies. Statistical examination was not performed in any study.

2.2.4 Vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers

Vasculitis, a group of diseases caused primarily by necrotizing vasculitis observed histopathologically, is often a direct cause of skin ulcers. It is described by the Chapel Hill classification issued in 1994 (commonly called "CHCC 1994"), which was revised in 2012 (commonly called "CHCC 2012", Table 2). In addition to the traditional three size‐based categories of large‐, medium‐, and small‐vessel vasculitis, the CHCC 2012 includes a total of seven categories by the addition of variable vessel vasculitis, single‐organ vasculitis, vasculitis associated with systemic disease, and vasculitis associated with probable etiology.

TABLE 2
Types of vasculitis in the Chapel Hill classification (2012) that commonly cause lesions such as skin ulcers.

Small‐vessel vasculitis includes a total of seven diseases: microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–related vasculitides; IgA vasculitis; cryoglobulinemic vasculitis; hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis; and anti‐glomerular basement membrane disease, in which immune complexes are involved. Medium‐vessel vasculitis includes polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease, while large‐vessel vasculitis includes giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. Of these diseases, the three ANCA‐related vasculitides in small‐vessel vasculitis, IgA vasculitis, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis are closely related to skin ulcers as their possible causes. Also notable are polyarteritis nodosa at the medium‐vessel level and cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis and cutaneous arteritis (corresponding to cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa) among single‐organ vasculitides.

### Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: pathophysiological mechanisms and diagnosis [^115UPZQt]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cryoglobulins (CG) are immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold, and dissolve at 37°C. In vivo, in cold exposed tissues and organs, they can induce vasculitis and occlusive vasculopathy after deposition on vascular endothelium under low temperature and high concentration conditions. Clinical manifestations are cutaneous (purpura, ulcers, vasomotor symptoms, and livedo reticularis), rheumatological (arthralgia and arthritis), and peripheral neuropathy (paresthesia and pain in the lower limbs). In profound organs such as the kidneys, CG deposition is less temperature-dependent, favored by local protein and anion concentrations, and can lead to glomerulonephritis. This review will focus on cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and vascular lesion, and their diagnosis.

Recent Findings

The mechanisms of vascular lesions of pathogenic CG in function of CG type and their characteristics are better defined. Optimal conditions for CG detection are critical. The importance of looking for underlying diseases, especially hepatitis C virus status in mixed CG, is reminded.

Summary

A decision diagram for CG vasculitis diagnosis based on clinical and biological parameters is proposed.

5.5 Explanation 5: Treatment for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers

5.5.1 To treat vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers, conservative treatment should be prioritized. As there is no sufficient evidence on the usefulness of surgical treatment including osteotomy/disarticulation, it should not be readily performed

For skin ulcers that may not be cured by conservative treatment, minimally invasive surgical treatment should be initially considered. One study performed pinch skin grafting in patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, and the number of patients with relief was small.
Another study adopted a combination of bone marrow–exposing occlusive dressing and suction blister epidermal grafting in vasculitis patients with refractory skin ulcers, but there was no response, ultimately requiring osteotomy.
According to another study, epithelization was achieved in most patients by continuing conservative treatment for vasculitis‐related ulcers. On the other hand, the recurrence rate of vasculitis‐related ulcers is high, and there are few cases in which surgical treatment is indicated.
No study has reported that the results of surgical treatment for vasculitis‐related ulcers are better than those of conservative treatment. Surgical treatment cannot be recommended. If extensive gangrene requires osteotomy/disarticulation, whether these are indicated should be carefully examined after sufficiently evaluating the state of vasculitis and blood flow.

6.20 Outcome

An improvement in skin ulcers: importance of outcome 6, the prevention of recurrent skin ulcers: importance of outcome 5, an improvement in the QOL: importance of outcome 6, and treatment‐related complications: importance of outcome 5 were adopted as outcomes. The importance of outcome was determined by all guideline‐drafting members' agreement (consistency rate for all imaging procedures: 100%).

6.21 Literature screening

On primary screening, 312 documents, consisting of 244 obtained by literature searching from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Japanese Medical Abstracts Society and 68 obtained by hand searching, were adopted. For hand searching, the literature adopted in the "Guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease/vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers (2017)" by the Japanese Dermatological Association, "Guidelines for Management of Vasculitis Syndrome (JCS 2017)", and MHLW Grants‐in‐Aid for Scientific Research (Intractable Disease Policy Research Project) for Research on "Intractable Vasculitis Guidance for treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and rheumatoid vasculitis 2020" was included. Of these, 27 were adopted for secondary screening. As a result of secondary screening, 15 documents examining the usefulness for treating rheumatoid vasculitis with skin ulcers and meeting the PICO (two RCT, one non‐RCT, six cohort studies, six case series studies) were used for analysis. A flow chart of the literature search is presented in Figure 23.

6.22 Evaluation of individual references

No study has limited participants to rheumatoid vasculitis patients with skin ulcers in whom vasculitis was histologically demonstrated. Therefore, there are many studies in which the patients had rheumatoid vasculitis but not skin ulcers, and there are many patients in whom the etiology of skin ulcers was unclear. Many articles with a high bias risk were adopted. Furthermore, there were no studies involving statistical analysis.

The Japanese Dermatological Association prepared guidelines focused on the treatment of skin ulcers associated with connective tissue disease/vasculitis practical in clinical settings of dermatological care. Skin ulcers associated with connective tissue diseases or vasculitis occur on the background of a wide variety of diseases including, typically, systemic sclerosis but also systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), various vasculitides and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Therefore, in preparing the present guidelines, we considered diagnostic/therapeutic approaches appropriate for each of these disorders to be necessary and developed algorithms and clinical questions for systemic sclerosis, SLE, dermatomyositis, RA, vasculitis and APS.

### Updates in cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis [^111K5bsf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The main purpose of this review is to present newly reported cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis, updates in investigations to verify systemic involvement in cases with cutaneous vasculitis and new therapeutic guidelines. The spectrum of COVID-19-related vasculitis is also covered.

Recent Findings

Only a few reports highlighted new cutaneous presentations or associations with some systemic vasculitic entities. For example, the association of inflammatory disorders with Takayasu arteritis, the importance of considering Kawasaki disease in febrile children with erythema nodosum, the development of necrotic ulcers on fingers and toes in Behçet's disease and the possible presence of polyarteritis nodosa-like pathological features in vulvar ulcers of Behçet's disease. New attempts to classify cutaneous manifestations of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and the diagnostic investigations for cutaneous vasculitis cases to verify systemic involvement are discussed. Treatment of systemic vasculitis with cutaneous vasculitis should be tailored according to disease status. A plethora of reports in the past 2 years focused on the broad spectrum of COVID-19 vasculitic manifestations.

Summary

Although newly reported cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis are relatively uncommon, the plethora of reports in the past 2 years on COVID-19 vasculitis necessitates the expansion of the classification of vasculitis associated with probable cause to include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) vasculitis.

6.16 Evaluation of individual references

For the one RCT selected on secondary screening, the selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attribution bias, and other biases were assessed based on the Minds Manual for Guideline Development 2020 version 3.0. Blinding was not performed, and we considered that there was a bias. The study examining the effects of warfarin on cutaneous arteritis was a descriptive one, and was excluded on assessment.

6.17 Evaluation of the outcome

In the RCT extracted this time, the effects of rituximab on cryoglobulinemic vasculitis were examined, and a total of 57 patients were investigated. Of these, five in the rituximab‐treated group and two in the nonrituximab‐treated group had skin ulcers; the number of patients was limited. This was not considered to be appropriate for quantitative analysis.

6.18 Results

It was difficult to perform a meta‐analysis based on the studies extracted on this screening. Furthermore, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is rare, and the efficacy of drugs for other types of vasculitis was unclear; therefore, when preparing an explanatory text for CQ3, a broad range of studies, including descriptive research, was introduced, and drugs that may be effective for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers were qualitatively evaluated (Figures 21 and 22).

Based on these results, a summary of the results (SoF) was prepared, and presented at a panel meeting.

CQ4: Are there any treatment methods effective for rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers?

6.19 Literature search

A request to the Japan Medical Library Association was combined with retrieval by manual search (refer to Supplement Materials with respect to the retrieval style and search results).

Databases used: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Japanese Medical Abstracts Society.

Search period: January 1980 to December 2020.

Results: Literature searching was performed with respect to drugs that are used to treat rheumatoid vasculitis in Japan (steroids, cyclophosphamide + steroid pulse, azathioprine, DDS, rituximab, LCAP/GCAP, biological preparations, methotrexate), and 15 documents examining their usefulness for treating rheumatoid vasculitis with skin ulcers and meeting the PICO (two RCTs, one non‐RCT, four cohort studies, eight case series studies) were adopted.

ACG clinical guideline — colon ischemia (CI) anti-inflammatory and adjunctive therapies states that "Glucocorticoids are not recommended for CI, except when it is a complication of a vasculitis", and in such cases "the steroids are used to treat the vasculitis and not the CI", with "no published experience to support the use of local or systemic glucocorticoids, sulfasalazine, aminosalicylates, or fatty acid enemas to treat CI". It adds that although "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally accepted to be a cause of colonic ulcerations", one large trial showed "a lack of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use at the time of diagnosis was independent factors associated with severe disease", and "This potentially protective effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was an indirect observation and not directly proven". A retrospective report notes "fatty acid enemas have helped to heal the necrotic mucosa of two patients with otherwise unresponsive CI, although there are no formalized publications supporting this intervention".

### The rashes that lead to cutaneous ulcers [^111PGBXn]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Skin rashes have exanthema as a synonym, a term derived from the Greek words exanthem, meaning "to appear", and anthos, which denotes "flourishing". The relevant factors for characterization of a rash include distribution, configuration, and organization of the lesions, in addition to evidence of systemic involvement through toxemia, adenopathy, and conjunctive lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, excoriations or phlogosis, neck rigidity, or neurologic dysfunction. A rash may evolve to cutaneous ulceration in many instances, which is relevant for the diagnosis, the followup, and the therapeutic management of the patient. Systemic diseases with exanthemas that result in ulcerations prevail over diseases that are restricted to signs and/or merely cutaneous clinical manifestations. A variety of etiologies can present cutaneous rashes with ulcers, subject or not to systemic involvement by the underlying disease, among which stand out the bullous diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, noninfectious granulomatous diseases, vasculitis, paraneoplastic syndromes, autoimmune diseases of the connective tissue, neutrophilic diseases, lichen planus, and drug hypersensitivity syndrome. The authors present a detailed review of some diseases corresponding to each one of the mentioned etiologies, updating the clinical manifestations and therapeutic proposals.

### Cutaneous vasculitis: diagnosis and management [^114PTuzA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is histologically defined as inflammatory cell infiltration and destruction of blood vessels. Vasculitis is classified as primary (idiopathic, eg, cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, Wegener's granulomatosis) or secondary, a manifestation of connective tissue diseases, infections, adverse drug eruptions, or a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Cutaneous vasculitis, manifested as urticaria, purpura, hemorrhagic vesicles, ulcers, nodules, livedo, infarcts, or digital gangrene, is a frequent and often significant component of many systemic vasculitic syndromes such as lupus or rheumatoid vasculitis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated primary vasculitic syndromes such as Churg-Strauss syndrome. In most instances, cutaneous vasculitis represents a self-limited, single-episode phenomenon, the treatment of which consists of general measures such as leg elevation, warming, avoidance of standing, cold temperatures and tight fitting clothing, and therapy with antihistamines, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. More extensive therapy is indicated for symptomatic, recurrent, extensive, and persistent skin disease or coexistence of systemic disease. For mild recurrent or persistent disease, colchicine and dapsone are first-choice agents. Severe cutaneous and systemic disease requires more potent immunosuppression (prednisone plus azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil). In cases of refractory vasculitis, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin are viable considerations. The new biologic therapies that work via cytokine blockade or lymphocyte depletion such as tumor alpha inhibitor infliximab and the anti-B-cell antibody rituximab, respectively, are showing benefit in certain settings such as Wegener's granulomatosis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, Behçet's disease, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.

3.5 Possibility of future research

There are many articles describing the usefulness of calcium antagonists for treating SSc‐related Raynaud phenomenon, These agents may reduce peripheral circulatory disorder. On the other hand, there is only one RCT on the prevention of new skin ulcer onset and healing. No RCT of which the evidence level is high has been performed. Calcium antagonists may be useful for preventing the onset of new skin ulcers and achieving skin ulcer healing in patients with SSc, but may this has not been sufficiently evaluated. As they are frequently used in clinical practice, evidence should be established in the future. Concerning botulinum, there is one RCT each on botulinum toxin type A/B with respect to the prevention of new skin ulcer onset and healing. Botulinum toxin type B was confirmed to inhibit the onset of new skin ulcers and promote skin ulcer healing. Currently, it is not covered by health insurance, but its effects should be demonstrated by accumulating cases in the future as a remedy from Japan.

CQ2: Are there any treatment methods effective for connective tissue disease–associated calcinosis cutis?

3.6 Background/purpose

In patients with connective tissue disease, dermal to subcutaneous calcinosis is often observed. Among various types of connective tissue diseases, calcinosis is most commonly induced by SSc (18%–49%) and dermatomyositis (in adults: ≤ 30%, in children: 30%–70%). Calcinosis cutis often causes ulceration through bacterial infection–related secondary infection or self‐destruction. Furthermore, calcinosis may induce pain, leading to a limitation in the range of motion and muscle atrophy. For skin ulcers that follow calcinosis, general drugs for skin ulcers alone are not effective, and calcification‐targeting treatment is necessary. In clinical practice, various drugs, including warfarin and diltiazem hydrochloride, are used to treat small, calcified lesions. Furthermore, surgical resection is sometimes considered for large, extensive calcified lesions, considering invasiveness. Therefore, the treatment of calcinosis cutis with pain or ulceration is clinically an important issue, and we aim to examine the effects of each treatment method on connective tissue disease–related calcification using the EBM method and present the directivity of treatment.

### Histopathologic vasculitis from the periulcer edge: a retrospective cohort study [^112dxQW2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Histopathologic vasculitis is often reported in periulcer specimens, but the frequency and clinical significance of this finding have not been evaluated.

Objective

We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of histopathologic vasculitis from the periulcer edge for detecting ulcers due to cutaneous vasculitis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with leg ulcers at a tertiary hospital between 2009 and 2016. Histopathologic slides were evaluated by 2 dermatopathologists who were blinded to the etiology of ulcer. Focal vasculitis was defined as involvement of fewer than 3 vessels.

Results

Vasculitis at the periulcer edge was seen in 51.6% of the specimens (32 of 62). Of the specimens with histopathologic vasculitis, focal vasculitis was seen in the majority of specimens (71.9% [23 of 32]), whereas diffuse vasculitis was observed in 28.1% (9 of 32). Periulcer vasculitis yielded a high sensitivity (100% [95% confidence interval, 29%-100%]). Furthermore, the specificity was low (50.9% [95% confidence interval, 38.1%-63.6%]) for detecting vasculitis-induced ulcers.

Limitations

Small number of vasculitis-induced ulcers.

Conclusion

Focal vasculitis from the periulcer edge is a nonspecific finding and provides little diagnostic value in determining the etiology of lower leg ulcers. Emphasis should be placed on the combination of clinical history and examination, histology, and laboratory findings when diagnosing ulcers.

### Cytomegalovirus-induced cutaneous ulcers: a case series [^113x1e2i]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human herpes virus (HHV) family encompasses a broad range of pathogens and are well-documented causes of skin lesions, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (HHV-4), HHV-6 and HHV-7 (implicated in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome), HHV-8 (known to cause Kaposi sarcoma), and cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5).

CMV is a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus that affects a large portion of the global population, estimated to have infected 60% to 70% of those in industrialized countries and nearly 100% in emerging countries.CMV infections are generally asymptomatic or mild in immunocompetent individuals, with clinical manifestations possibly including rash, fever, and leukocytosis.CMV remains dormant over the life of the host in myeloid cells, reactivating in the setting of immunosuppression. Infection in immunocompromised hosts can cause life-threatening manifestations in a variety of organ systems, potentially causing retinitis, colitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, myocarditis, encephalitis, neuritis, and meningitis. The growing population of immunocompromised individuals raises concerns about susceptibility to infections with atypical presentations and prolonged illnesses.

Cutaneous manifestations of CMV have been previously reported, with ulceration representing the most common presentation. Other cutaneous findings reported in the literature include necrotizing vasculitis, thrombosis leading to limb ischemia, Degos-like skin lesions, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, among others.

We present a case series of 4 immunocompromised individuals presenting with CMV cutaneous ulcerations with evidence of CMV viremia and positive CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swabs. Available histopathologic data are also included.

5.6.1 There are many reports on RA suggesting the onset/deterioration of rheumatoid vasculitis during therapy with‐α inhibitors. In patients in whom the causal relationship is strongly suspected,‐α inhibitors should be discontinued, and a switch to other drugs should be considered

A cohort studyon the relationship between the onset of rheumatoid vasculitis and TNF‐α inhibitors was conducted and showed that insufficient treatment for a primary disease may be involved in the onset/deterioration of rheumatoid vasculitis. In addition, there are patients in whom the use of TNF‐α inhibitors is suggested. In those with RA in whom the onset/deterioration of vasculitis is suspected, the presence or absence of TNF‐α inhibitor therapy should be investigated. If the involvement of this drug in the onset/deterioration is strongly suspected, the use of this agent should be discontinued, and a switch to other drugs should be considered.
With the recent widespread use of TNF‐α inhibitors, their usefulness for treating many autoimmune diseases, including RA, has been established. On the other hand, many reports on adverse reactions to these drugs have been accumulating. Primary adverse reactions include severe infectious disease, opportunistic infection such as tuberculosis, demyelinating disease, and lymphoproliferative disease. However, recently, patients who developed autoimmune diseases, such as vasculitis, SLE, and interstitial lung disease, after the use of these drugs have been increasingly reported.
In 1999, Brion et al.reported the first patient who developed rheumatoid vasculitis after the use of a TNF‐α inhibitor. Since then, similar reports, have been successively presented, including a patient in whom the use of a TNF‐α inhibitor worsened their rheumatoid vasculitis, a patient who developed optic neuropathy, a patient who developed glomerulonephritis, and patients who developed ANCA‐associated vasculitis. Ramos‐Casals et al.investigated 226 patients with autoimmune diseases after the use of TNF‐α inhibitors (187 with RA, 17 with Crohn disease, seven with ankylosing spondylitis, six with psoriatic arthritis, five with juvenile RA, three with other conditions), and reported the onset of vasculitis in 113 patients (95 with RA). Histopathologically, leukocytoclastic vasculitis accounted for 63%, necrotic vasculitis for 17%, and lymphocytic vasculitis for 6% of cases. Findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are most commonly observed.
Concerning the incidence of vasculitis, Flendrie et al.performed a cohort study, and reported an incidence of 3.9%. The relationship between the use of TNF‐α inhibitors and onset of vasculitis remains to be clarified. However, their causal relationship is strongly suspected for the following reasons: (i) the timing of vasculitis onset is consistent with the start of treatment with TNF‐α inhibitors; (ii) exanthema at the site of injection initially occurred and enlarged to the whole body in some RA patients who developed vasculitis after etanercept use; (iii) vasculitis was relieved in ≥ 90% of patients after the discontinuation of TNF‐α inhibitors; (iv) the additional administration of TNF‐α inhibitors led to recurrent exanthema/recrudescence in 75% of patients; and (v) vasculitis occurs even in the presence of diseases of which the pathogeneses do not involve vasculitis, such as psoriasis.

On the other hand, many of the causes of nonvasculitic skin ulcers are characterized by circulatory disturbances. Even in the absence of vasculitis, many blood vessels are known to degenerate regardless of their size or whether they are arteries or veins in the skin of RA patients, potentially leading to "lower leg ulcers due to venous stasis", "ulcers due to ischemic necrosis of soft tissue associated with compression" (caused by joint deformity or contracture or inappropriate application of orthoses), and "traumatic ulcers based on skin fragility".

In the present guidelines, a therapeutic algorithm (Figure 5) was prepared for the treatment for RA‐associated skin ulcers based on the above considerations, and the details are described in CQ4 and Explanation 6.

2.3 ‐associated skin ulcers

APS is diagnosed when the patient tests positive for antiphospholipid antibodies and develops arterial or venous thrombosis or female infertility. Because arterial or venous thrombosis occurs in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, various skin symptoms develop and intractable skin ulcers frequently form.

Symptoms often observed in APS include arterial or venous thrombosis of the brain, heart, lungs, and limbs; recurrent miscarriage; thrombocytopenia; psychiatric or neurological symptoms, such epilepsy; skin symptoms; eye symptoms such as thrombosis of the central retinal artery or vein; and liver or kidney disorders. Among them, skin lesions are important as the initial manifestations of APS. Frances et al.evaluated 200 patients with APS and reported that skin lesions were observed in 31% of patients as the initial manifestations and in 49% throughout the disease course, and that livedo reticularis was the most frequently reported rash (observed in 25% of all patients). Similarly, Cervera et al.evaluated 1000 cases of APS and reported that skin lesions were observed as the initial manifestations in 29% and throughout the disease course in 40% of patients, and that livedo reticularis and necrosis due to skin infarction were noted in 24% and 5.5% of patients, respectively. Therefore, as skin lesions are the initial manifestations in many patients with APS, an aggressive examination for the presence or absence of APS should be performed if livedo reticularis or skin ulcers are present even without thrombosis of other organs.

Introduction

Rheumatoid vasculitis (RV) is an extraarticular complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that commonly appears in the lower extremities, malleolus, and upper portion of the calf as necrotizing vasculitis in small-to-medium–sized vessels. The cause of RV is unclear; however, high levels of serum circulating immune complexes have been observed, which reportedly contribute to vessel inflammation and ischemia. The incidence of RV is declining with advancements in diagnosis and RA management. However, RV mortality remains high due to the absence of established therapeutic regimens. The treatment of severe systemic RV typically involves high doses of corticosteroids and aggressive immunosuppression by azathioprine, methotrexate (MTX), and anti–tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α), although TNF-α inhibitors may induce vasculitis in some patients. We herein describe the successful use of certolizumab pegol (CZP), an anti–TNF-α variant with an uncommon antibody structure, for RV-associated leg ulcers that were unresponsive to other anti–TNF-α agents.

### Clinical approach to cutaneous vasculitis [^111gUeCp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is an inflammatory process affecting the vessel wall and leading to its compromise or destruction and subsequent hemorrhagic and ischemic events. Vasculitis can be classified as a primary phenomenon (e.g. idiopathic cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis or Wegener granulomatosis) or as a secondary disorder (connective tissue disease [CTD], infection, or adverse drug eruption-associated vasculitis). Cutaneous vasculitis may present as a significant component of many systemic vasculitic syndromes such as rheumatoid vasculitis or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated primary vasculitic syndromes (Wegener granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis). Cutaneous vasculitis manifests most frequently as palpable purpura or infiltrated erythema indicating dermal superficial, small-vessel vasculitis, and less commonly as nodular erythema, livedo racemosa, deep ulcers, or digital gangrene implicating deep dermal or subcutaneous, muscular-vessel vasculitis. A biopsy extending to the subcutis taken from the most tender, reddish or purpuric lesional skin is the key to obtaining a significant diagnostic result and serial sections are often required for identifying the main vasculitic lesion. Coexistence of pan-dermal small-vessel vasculitis and subcutaneous muscular-vessel vasculitis usually indicates CTD, ANCA-associated vasculitis, Behçet disease, or malignancy-associated vasculitis. A concomitant biopsy for direct immunofluoresence evaluation contributes to accurate diagnosis by distinguishing IgA-associated vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) from IgG-/IgM-associated vasculitis, which has prognostic significance. Treatment for cutaneous vasculitis should include avoidance of triggers (excessive standing, infection, drugs) and exclusion of vasculitis-like syndromes (pseudovasculitis) such as thrombotic disorders (e.g. anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome). In most instances, cutaneous vasculitis represents a self-limited condition and will be relieved by leg elevation, avoidance of standing, and therapy with NSAIDs. For mild recurrent or persistent disease, colchicine and dapsone are first-choice agents. Severe cutaneous disease requires treatment with systemic corticosteroids or more potent immunosuppression (azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide). A combination of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is required therapy for systemic vasculitis, which is associated with a high risk of permanent organ damage or death. In cases of refractory vasculitis, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin are viable considerations. The new biologic therapies that act via cytokine blockade or lymphocyte depletion, such as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor infliximab and the anti-B-cell antibody rituximab, respectively, are showing benefit in certain settings such as CTD and ANCA-associated vasculitis.

For thrombosis, the administration of anticoagulants, such as warfarin and various antiplatelet drugs, is necessary. As mentioned above, because thrombi may develop in stagnant blood due to circulatory disturbances or SLE may be concurrent with APS, the possibility of the involvement of multiple causative factors must be considered.

In vasculitis and panniculitis, necrosis of the cutaneous or subcutaneous tissue may occur in active lesions, leading to ulcer formation, or the ulceration of old scarred lesions may be triggered by the infection. For treating active vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers, the priority is to control the underlying disease primarily using steroids or immunosuppressants. However, if the skin ulcer is complicated by infection, intensification of the steroid or immunosuppressant therapy may exacerbate the ulcer due to the patient's increased susceptibility to infection. If there are signs of infection, its treatment must be performed simultaneously.

In panniculitis, judging whether the clinical symptoms, such induration and redness/heat, are caused by connective tissue diseases or infection is often difficult. Because blood test data indicate an elevated inflammatory reaction in either case, early differentiation is difficult. The examination of procalcitonin by blood sampling is also useful for confirming infection status because its levels often do not rise even in cases of high connective tissue disease activity. However, attention is required for the possibility of a false‐negative result caused by a nonspecific reaction in patients positive for rheumatoid factors and the fact that insurance coverage for procalcitonin measurement is limited to sepsis alone. Although a histopathological examination should be actively considered, it takes time to complete, and antibacterial drugs are often administrated as a diagnostic treatment in the actual clinical setting.

Calcium deposits also often cause ulcer formation if they spontaneously collapse. Regarding calcinosis, oral therapies, such as warfarin therapy, may be considered for treating small lesions, but large calcified lesions are not generally resolved by internal treatment alone and require surgical resection. However, as calcified lesions causing ulceration may extend broadly and occasionally deeply, early resection while the calcium deposits are still small may also be considered depending on treatment invasiveness if the patient responds poorly to internal treatment.

### Hydroxyurea (Siklos) [^1152F1hs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Vasculitic Toxicities (Including Leg Ulcers)

Cutaneous vasculitic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, have occurred in patients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxyurea. These vasculitic toxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of, or currently receiving, interferon therapy. Due to potentially severe clinical outcomes for the cutaneous vasculitic ulcers reported in patients with myeloproliferative disease (a condition for which SIKLOS is not approved), treatment with SIKLOS should be discontinued and/or its dose reduced if cutaneous vasculitic ulcerations develop. Rarely, ulcers are caused by leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Avoid use of SIKLOS in patients with wounds on the legs (leg ulcers).

5.5 Risks with Concomitant Use of Antiretroviral Drugs

Pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy have occurred when hydroxyurea was administered concomitantly with antiretroviral drugs, including didanosine and stavudine [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.6 Risks with Concomitant Use of Live Virus Vaccine

Avoid use of live virus vaccine in patients taking SIKLOS. Concomitant use of hydroxyurea with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus and/or may increase the adverse reactions of the vaccine virus and result in severe infections [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Patient's antibody response to vaccines may be decreased. Consider consultation with a specialist.

5.7 Macrocytosis

SIKLOS may cause macrocytosis, which is self-limiting, and is often seen early in the course of treatment. The morphologic change resembles pernicious anemia, but is not related to vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency. This may mask the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended.

5.8 Test Interference

Interference with Uric Acid, Urea, or Lactic Acid Assays is possible, rendering falsely elevated results of these in patients treated with hydroxyurea [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

Hydroxyurea may falsely elevate sensor glucose results from certain continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and may lead to hypoglycemia if sensor glucose results are relied upon to dose insulin.

If a patient using a CGM is to be prescribed hydroxyurea, consult with the CGM prescriber about alternative glucose monitoring methods.

6.13 Literature search

A request to the Japan Medical Library Association was combined with retrieval by manual search (refer to Supplement Materials with respect to the retrieval style and search results).

Databases used: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Japanese Medical Abstracts Society.

Search period: January 1980 to December 2020.

Results: No useful RCT on the treatment of vasculitis‐related skin ulcers was confirmed. When changing some retrieval styles for searching, one RCT of rituximab for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis finally remained. In addition, one case series study of warfarin for cutaneous arteritis was extracted.

6.14 Outcome

As a result of consideration by the systematic review team, an improvement in skin ulcers: importance of outcome 6, the prevention of recurrent skin ulcers: importance of outcome 5, an improvement in the QOL: importance of outcome 6, and treatment‐related complications: importance of outcome 5 were adopted. The importance of outcome was determined by all guideline‐drafting members' agreement (consistency rate for all imaging procedures: 100%).

6.15 Literature screening

When searching for the treatment of vasculitis‐related skin ulcers, we selected 146 of a total of 153 documents (PubMed [84], Cochrane Library [67], and Ichushi [two]), excluding documents duplicated between PubMed and the Cochrane Library. As articles that were not hit using retrieval styles, but were useful, we extracted a total of five: an RCT of rituximab involving patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, three quoted in our previous guidelines and regarded as candidates for a systematic review, and a new systematic review article on cutaneous arteritis. Of all these articles, a total of 11 were extracted on primary screening, and the contents were reviewed on secondary screening. Finally, one RCT of rituximab for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and one case series study of warfarin for cutaneous arteritis remained. A retrospective study by Daoud et al. of 79 patients with cutaneous arteritis reported the effects of systemic steroid administration on vasculitis‐related skin ulcers, including 39 with skin ulcers. In addition, one study reported that prednisolone administration at 60 to 80 mg/day was associated with marked improvements in pain, subcutaneous nodules, and skin ulcers, but the actual number of responders is unclear; therefore, this article was not included in the systematic review. A flow chart of literature search is presented in Figure 20.

Concerning LCAP/GCAP, there were three cohort studies, and one case series study. All studies showed an improvement in skin ulcers, and there was no serious adverse reaction or complication. However, patients in whom the etiology of ulcers was unclear were included. The bias risk of each study is high, as represented by combination therapy with immunosuppressants. Furthermore, in these reports, the number of rheumatoid vasculitis patients with skin ulcers was small (Mori et al.: three patients, Hidaka et al.: two patients, Winkelstein et al.: six patients, Itoh et al.: three patients). Thus, the strength of total evidence is D (very weak), and the recommendation level is weak.

Concerning steroids, JAK inhibitors, and methotrexate, their efficacy for rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers and safety were verified only in case reports. Concerning DDS, there is one case series study, but it involved only two patients. Neither RCTs nor cohort studies of these drugs were adopted.

3.19 Precautions for clinical use

In many patients with rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers included in this CQ, some form of medication had already been administered at the start of ulcer treatment under a diagnosis of RA. In most of the clinical studies reviewed at this time, several drugs, including steroids, had also been administered. This made it extremely difficult to verify the efficacy of individual drugs. Furthermore, many of the above clinical studies examined the efficacy of treatments for rheumatoid vasculitis, and patients with skin ulcers were limited; the number of patients was small, and statistical analysis was not possible.

Concerning steroids, there is no clinical study to evaluate their efficacy for the treatment of ulcers, and this could not be verified in this CQ. However, steroids have been routinely used as a first‐choice drug for rheumatoid vasculitis for many years. There are case series studies demonstrating the efficacy of steroids; therefore, their effects are indisputable. In the present guidelines, the recommendation level is not presented, but systemic steroid administration should also be considered as an option for rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers.

In clinical practice, physicians are responsible for determining treatment, taking into account both the efficacy for rheumatoid vasculitis, as an underlying cause of the ulcers, and the treatment of the skin ulcers themselves. DDS, methotrexate, and JAK inhibitors, which may be effective for rheumatoid vasculitis, in addition to steroids, may also be available as treatment options.

### Cutaneous vasculitis and quality of life… [^111fzzF1]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Cutaneous manifestations of vasculitis can cause itching, pain, and ulceration, but their health-related quality of life outcomes have not been systematically evaluated. This study assessed the HRQOL in patients with skin vasculitis using validated measures. A total of 190 complete responses were received, a completion rate of 15. 6% among patients in the VPPRN database who reported ever having had skin lesions of vasculitis. Of these, 107 patients had experienced active skin vasculitis within the preceding 4 weeks and were included for analysis. Most patients reported having vasculitis for at least 5 years before data collection. Patients with a variety of vasculitides completed the survey. Analyzed using the Prinsen thresholds, most patients were found to have severely or very severely diminished HRQOL in each domain of the Skindex-29: emotions:

77. **6%, symptoms**:
78. **5%, functioning**:

60.

7%, and total
75. 7%. The HRQOL was below average in 6 of the 8 SF-36 domains, and most patients had summative physical component scores and mental component scores below 50. Greater disease severity and more recent diagnosis showed a substantial negative association with HRQOL. Vasculitides in which skin disease predominated had an HRQOL outcome as bad as or worse than other types of vasculitis. Patients with cutaneous manifestations of vasculitis had markedly diminished HRQOL across multiple domains, suggesting that cutaneous vasculitis is an important factor in patient well-being, symptoms, and self-perception of health. Potential limitations of this study include generalizability of VPPRN survey responses to the broader population of patients with vasculitis.

The waxing and waning nature of vasculitis resulted in exclusion of survey recipients who previously had active skin vasculitis but not at the time of the survey, resulting in decreased response rate.

RA‐associated vasculitides is collectively called "rheumatoid vasculitis", which is characterized by the marked diversity of the affected vascular levels compared with other vasculitides (polyarteritis nodosa, IgA vasculitis, granulomatosis polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangiitis; Table 2). Thus, rheumatoid vasculitis has characteristics of both necrotic vasculitis of the small arteries in the adipose tissue and leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the small veins in the dermis. (In Japan, RA accompanied by the former is customarily called "malignant rheumatoid arthritis" and the latter is called "rheumatoid vasculitis" in a narrow sense; internationally, all cases of RA‐associated vasculitides including both are called "rheumatoid vasculitis".)

Therefore, its clinical symptoms are diverse, and all kinds of rash suggestive of vasculitis may occur, including subcutaneous nodules, livedo reticularis, skin ulcers, palpable purpura, hemorrhagic blisters, red papules, red nodules, scarlatiniform eruption, macular erythema, purpura, and white atrophy. If such skin symptoms are observed in RA patients, a skin biopsy is essential for the definitive diagnosis, as the accurate identification of the vascular level affected by vasculitis contributes to the selection of appropriate treatments and the determination of the prognosis.

Rheumatoid vasculitis may cause various extraarticular manifestations of RA, such as interstitial pneumonia, gastrointestinal lesions, cardiac lesions, and mononeuritis multiplex, in addition to the cutaneous symptoms. The frequency of the complication of RA by rheumatoid vasculitis is reportedly 0.7% to 5.4%. Rheumatoid vasculitis is usually observed in a period in which RA activity is enhanced and in patients with a long history of illness (mean illness duration, 10–17 years) such as those with advanced joint destruction. This occurs more frequently in males than in females, as well as in those with high rheumatoid factor levels. Skin symptoms are observed in approximately 75% to 89% of patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, and they often lead to its diagnosis because they are the initial extraarticular manifestations. Because the prognosis of rheumatoid vasculitis accompanied by systemic symptoms is poor, it is extremely important to invariably perform skin biopsy and ensure early diagnosis and early treatment if suspicious skin lesions are observed.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for nonhealing vasculitic ulcers [^115WsKZF]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous nonhealing ulceration is a threatening manifestation of vasculitis. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), frequently used as adjuvant therapy for patients with ischaemic ulcers, exerts additional beneficial effects on the vascular inflammatory response.

Aim

To evaluate the effect of HBO on vasculitis-induced nonhealing skin ulcers.

Methods

The study population comprised 35 patients aged ≥ 18 years with severe, nonhealing, vasculitis-induced ulcers that had not improved following immunosuppressive therapy. Baseline ulcer tissue oxygenation was evaluated at room air concentration (21% O2), at 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA) breathing 100% O2, and at 2 ATA breathing 100% O2. The baseline treatment protocol consisted of a 4-week course of 100% O2 for 90 min at 2 ATA, five times/week.

Results

The mean baseline ulcer tissue oxygenation (3.1 ± 2.4 kPa at room air concentration), was significantly increased to 13.9 ± 11.9 kPa at 1 ATA breathing 100% O2 (P < 0.001), and subsequently increased further to 59.1 ± 29.8 kPa at 2 ATA breathing 100% O2 (P < 0.001). At the end of the hyperbaric therapy, 28 patients (80%) demonstrated complete healing, 4 (11.4%) had partial healing and 3 (8.6%) had no improvement. None of the patients had any side-effects related to the HBO therapy.

Conclusion

HBO therapy may serve as an effective safe treatment for patients with vasculitis having nonhealing skin ulcers. Further studies are needed to evaluate its role as primary therapy for this group of patients.

5.6.2 For the treatment of RA‐associated skin ulcers, the use of peripheral circulation‐improving drugs/antiplatelet drugs, such as argatroban hydrate, alprostadil, sarpogrelate hydrochloride, cilostazol, and beraprost sodium, should be considered

Chen et al.reported that various blood vessels: dermal venules to adipose tissue arterioles were damaged in patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, and that degeneration of various blood vessels (small/medium/large) was observed even in clinically healthy skin. Furthermore, Westedt et al.and Fitzgerald et al.reported that vasculitis was histopathologically observed even in apparently healthy skin in approximately 30% of patients with RA. Such abnormalities may cause circulatory disturbance in the phase of ulcer healing regardless of vasculitis‐related and nonvasculitis‐related conditions, hindering wound healing. Peripheral circulation‐improving drugs/antiplatelet drugs that are routinely used to treat skin ulcers associated with other connective tissue diseases may be useful. Therefore, no study has reported their effectiveness for treating skin ulcers in patients with RA, but argatroban hydrate injection, alprostadil injection, and oral peripheral circulation‐improving drugs/antiplatelet drugs, such as sarpogrelate hydrochloride, cilostazol, and beraprost sodium, may also be used for the treatment of skin ulcers in patients with RA.

### Mucocutaneous ulcers in an immunocompromised patient [^113nCrsJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Cutaneous manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
B. Cutaneous cytomegalovirus (CMV)
C. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)
D. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
E. Behçet's disease (BD)

Answers:
A. SLE – Incorrect. Oral ulceration is common in SLE, especially during flaring. Cutaneous ulcerations are more likely associated with SLE vasculitis on the lower extremities. The pathology would show leukocytoclastic vasculitis, not the cytoplasmic inclusions seen in Fig 2.
B. CMV – Correct. Ulcers are the most common cutaneous manifestation of cutaneous CMV infection. Histopathology for cutaneous CMV shows neutrophilic vasculitis and enlarged endothelial cells with large basophilic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by a clear halo(Fig 2). This patient was susceptible to CMV infection due to chronic immunosuppression.
C. PG – Incorrect. Even though PG can develop in the setting of immunosuppression, the ulcers most commonly occur on the arms and legs, and the ulcers are usually ill-defined with gray overhanging borders, unlike this patient. PG is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and acute myelogenous leukemia.
D. HSV – Incorrect. Morphologically, HSV can present very similarly to CMV. CMV may have a deeper, more ragged border. However, the patient was polymerase chain reaction-positive for genital HSV on a prior inpatient admission and received acyclovir, but the ulcers remained. On pathology, cellular margination, molding, and multinucleation are more characteristic of HSV infections.
E. BD – Incorrect. Behçet's disease is an autoimmune inflammatory condition causing orogenital ulcers in addition to systemic involvement affecting the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. Cutaneous inflammation, uveitis, and a positive pathergy test are common. This patient had no systemic involvement at the time of presentation.

4.15 Livedo reticularis

Livedo reticularis presents as reddish purple reticular macules as a symptom resulting from peripheral circulatory disorder of the skin. Related conditions include cutis marmorata, livedo reticularis, and livedo racemosa. Cutis marmorata is transient, appearing when the skin is exposed to cold outdoor air and disappearing when it is warmed, and can be considered a physiological phenomenon. Livedo reticularis and livedo racemosa are persistent conditions caused by organic changes in blood vessels. The rings of the retiform pattern are closed in livedo reticularis and open in livedo racemosa.

4.16 Antiphospholipid antibody

Commonly measured antiphospholipid antibodies include: (i) IgG‐ or IgM‐type anticardiolipin antibodies; (ii) IgG‐ or IgM‐type cardiolipin‐dependent anti–β2‐glycoprotein I antibodies; and (iii) lupus anticoagulants, which are immunoglobins that do not inhibit the activities of individual clotting factors but phospholipid‐dependently inhibit the blood‐clotting reaction. This reaction is measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time, diluted Russell viper venom time test, and platelet neutralization test, among others, and is detected by a method according to the Lupus Anticoagulant Guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. When one of these is detected two or more times at a 12‐week interval, the condition is classified as APS. Phosphatidylserine‐dependent antiprothrombin antibody is attracting attention as a new antiphospholipid antibody. This antibody is correlated with the clinical symptoms of APS and the presence of lupus anticoagulants and can be measured in the serum, while the measurement of lupus anticoagulants requires high‐quality plasma.

4.17 Venous thrombosis

Thrombosis in a vein that involves a coagulation reaction in its pathogenic mechanism. The condition is caused by fibrin thrombi containing a large number of erythrocytes. Skin ulcers caused by venous thrombosis are typically shallow and have indistinct margins because they are caused by hypoxia of the skin tissue due to venous stasis. These ulcer often cause bleeding from the ulcer floor due to congestion.

4.18 Arterial thrombosis

Thrombosis occurring in an artery. Platelet coagulation is involved in its pathogenic mechanism. Skin ulcers due to arterial thrombosis are deep and have distinct margins, and bleeding from the ulcer floor is often unremarkable because they are caused by ischemia of the skin tissue supplied by the affected artery.

Abstract

Cutaneous vasculitis, either as a single organ or part of systemic vasculitis, can take various forms. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in the respiratory tract and vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized blood vessels. Skin-limited GPA, an uncommon presentation, poses diagnostic challenges and may result in delayed diagnosis. We describe a 32-year-old man with painful ulcers and black eschars on both lower limbs, evolving from purpura. Despite lacking typical anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and systemic involvement, histopathology revealed granulomatous vasculitis. Treatment with prednisolone and methotrexate led to complete symptom resolution within 8 months. Skin-limited GPA, often without anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity, warrants clinical suspicion, early intervention, and increased awareness to enhance patient outcomes.

### The histological assessment of cutaneous vasculitis [^115eqzAo]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is defined as inflammation directed at vessels, which compromises or destroys the vessel wall leading to haemorrhagic and/or ischaemic events. Skin biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis, whose manifestations include urticaria, infiltrative erythema, petechiae, purpura, purpuric papules, haemorrhagic vesicles and bullae, nodules, livedo racemosa, deep (punched out) ulcers and digital gangrene. These varied morphologies are a direct reflection of size of the vessels and extent of the vascular bed affected, ranging from a vasculitis affecting few superficial, small vessels in petechial eruptions to extensive pan-dermal small vessel vasculitis in haemorrhagic bullae to muscular vessel vasculitis in lower extremity nodules with livedo racemosa. Skin biopsy, extending to subcutis and taken from the earliest, most symptomatic, reddish or purpuric lesion is crucial for obtaining a high-yielding diagnostic sample. Based on histology, vasculitis can be classified on the size of vessels affected and the dominant immune cell mediating the inflammation (e.g. neutrophilic, granulomatous, lymphocytic, or eosinophilic). Disruption of small vessels by inflammatory cells, deposition of fibrin within the lumen and/or vessel wall coupled with nuclear debris allows for the confident recognition of small vessel, mostly neutrophilic vasculitis (also known as leukocytoclastic vasculitis). In contrast, muscular vessel vasculitis can be identified solely by infiltration of its wall by inflammatory cells. Extravasation of red blood cells (purpura) and necrosis are supportive, but not diagnostic of vasculitis as they are also seen in haemorrhagic and/or vaso-occlusive disorders (pseudovasculitis). Vasculitic foci associated with extravascular granulomas (palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis), tissue eosinophilia, or tissue neutrophilia signal the risk for, or co-existence of systemic disease. This essential histological information coupled with direct immunofluorescence and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic data and clinical findings enables more precise and accurate diagnosis of localized and systemic vasculitis syndromes.

3.12 Scientific basis

Systemic steroid administration is inexpensive, effective, and fast‐acting; therefore, it is ranked as a first‐choice drug for the treatment of vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers, and routinely used. According to a study presented by Daoud et al.in which 39 patients with cutaneous arteritis (conventionally termed "cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa") with skin ulcers and 40 without skin ulcers were retrospectively investigated, the duration of disease was slightly prolonged in the former, and the incidence of concomitant neuropathy was high. Furthermore, prednisolone administration at 60 to 80 mg/day reduced pain, subcutaneous nodes, and skin ulcers in most patients with skin ulcers, but dose reduction led to recurrence in most patients. Combination therapy with immunosuppressants was attempted. Kumar et al.reported eight patients with childhood cutaneous arteritis and terminal gangrenes. Systemic steroid administration resulted in remission in all patients, but recurrence was noted in four patients and spontaneous falling of the fingers or toes in six, leading to amputation of the right leg in one patient. In addition, there are many case reports on polyarteritis nodosa, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitisin which a combination of systemic steroid administration and immunosuppressants reduced skin ulcers.

### Biotherapies in Behçet's disease [^116RGe7o]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic large-vessel vasculitis characterized by a wide clinical spectrum including recurrent oral and genital ulcerations, uveitis, vascular, neurological, articular, renal and gastrointestinal manifestations. Therapeutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments with corticosteroids are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvements, more aggressive approach with immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations such as posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, vascular, and neurological and gastrointestinal involvements. However, some patients still have refractory disease, relapse, sight threatening eye disease, or irreversible organ damage. Recent improvements in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms have led to the identification of potential targets and future biological therapies for BD. In contrast to current non-specific immunosuppressive agents, the emergence of biotherapies provides the possibility of interfering with specific pathogenic pathways. Novel targeted biotherapies might be used in the future for BD.

### Painful medial thigh ulcer [^113Z32SM]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old female with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and warfarin presented with a new, painful ulcer on her left inner thigh. Gross examination showed retiform purpura with central ulceration and black-brown crusting (Fig 1, A). A biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the lesion showed full-thickness ischemic necrosis with overlying ulceration and diffuse dermal angiomatosis with scattered calcification deposits around the subcutaneous vessels in the subcutaneous septae (Fig 1, B). Grocott methenamine silver and gram stains were negative for fungal or bacterial organisms.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Calciphylaxis
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis
E. Venous ulcer

Answer:
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis – Incorrect. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a condition characterized by a transient hypercoagulable state that causes thrombotic skin and subcutaneous tissue necrosis on dorsal or distal extremities within days of initiating warfarin.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Affecting the skin and kidneys, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that often presents with asymmetric polyneuropathy and abdominal pain.
C. Calciphylaxis – Correct. Characterized by small- and medium-vessel calcification causing chronic, low-grade ischemia, calciphylaxis most often occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease, known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Calciphylaxis can also occur in the absence of renal disease (nonuremic calciphylaxis). Risk factors include elevated calcium and phosphate levels, female sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, high alkaline phosphatase, warfarin therapy, low serum albumin, and systemic corticosteroid use. Clinical manifestations include intense local pain with ulceration of the medial thighs from microthrombi causing local infarction with diffuse calcification of small capillaries in the subcutaneous tissue.
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis – Incorrect. Levamisole-induced vasculitis arises from cocaine that has been laced with levamisole, an anthelminthic drug that can be reduced to a fine white powder but has been discontinued for humans. Widespread ulcers often involve the ears and affect at least 10% total body surface area.
E. Venous ulcer – Incorrect. While venous ulcers are the most common etiology of lower extremity ulceration, they are often shallow and present on calves and ankles.

### Small bowel ulcers: when is it not inflammatory bowel disease? [^1174MQKk]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Increasing use of small bowel endoscopy unravels ulcers in a relevant number of patients. Although often attributed to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), these ulcers may be unspecific or caused by a variety of other diseases. This review summarizes the recent literature related to differential diagnosis of small bowel ulcers.

Recent Findings

NSAID enteropathy is the major differential diagnosis to IBD in patients with small bowel ulcers. Intestinal tuberculosis must be considered in patients at risk. Rare causes for small bowel ulcers are autoinflammatory, neoplastic, vascular diseases, or nontuberculous infections. Morphology of small bowel ulcers cannot provide a reliable differentiation, and even histology is not specific in all cases. History with special focus on NSAID medication and clinical symptoms not typical for IBD, laboratory tests in the search of systemic disease, and microbiologic testing of biopsies can be helpful. Genetic testing allows identification of few rare entities like defects in prostaglandin metabolism.

Summary

Due to a massive overlap in the endoscopic appearance of small bowel ulcers between possible causes, diagnosis should be based on broad information also including history, histology, imaging, and laboratory tests.

### Cryoglobulinaemia [^116btFo3]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Cryoglobulinaemia refers to the serum presence of cryoglobulins, which are defined as immunoglobulins that precipitate at temperatures < 37°C. Type I cryoglobulinaemia consists of only one isotype or subclass of monoclonal immunoglobulin, whereas type II and type III are classified as mixed cryoglobulinaemia because they include immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM. Many lymphoproliferative, infectious and autoimmune disorders have been associated with mixed cryoglobulinaemia; however, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the aetiologic agent in most patients. The underlying mechanism of the disorder is B cell lymphoproliferation and autoantibody production. Mixed cryoglobulinaemia can cause systemic vasculitis, with manifestations ranging from purpura, arthralgia and weakness to more serious lesions with skin ulcers, neurological and renal involvement. This Primer focuses on mixed cryoglobulinaemia, which has a variable course and a prognosis that is primarily influenced by vasculitis-associated multiorgan damage. In addition, the underlying associated disease in itself may cause considerable mortality and morbidity. Treatment of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis should be modulated according to the underlying associated disease and the severity of organ involvement and relies on antiviral treatment (for HCV infection), immunosuppression and immunotherapy, particularly anti-CD20 B cell depletion therapies.

### Vasculitis [^112mKDUP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is defined by the presence of blood vessel inflammation. It can be observed in a wide variety of settings, which can be broadly grouped as secondary vasculitides, which occur in association with an underlying disease or trigger, or primary vasculitides, in which vasculitis is occurring for as-yet unknown causes. The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a range of disease entities that are uniquely identified by their clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic characteristics. Individual diseases predominantly affect blood vessels of a particular size, which influences their clinical manifestations and has been used in their classification. The vasculitides can also differ in their severity, extending from self-limited illnesses to those that can be life-threatening in the absence of prompt initiation of treatment. Immunosuppressive agents are used to treat many vasculitic diseases. Although such approaches can be effective, the patient's long-term course can be influenced by organ damage from their initial presentation, disease relapses, and medication toxicity. Recent investigations have focused on understanding disease pathophysiology and the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches.

3.13 Commentary

Although high‐level evidence in the literature is limited, as noted above, systemic steroid administration is routinely selected as a base remedy for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers in clinical practice, and its effects have been reported. We considered it useful, but the recommendation level is weak.

Other drugs include cyclophophamide, rituximab, methotrexate, azathioprine, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Cyclophophamide is routinely used for remission induction and maintenance therapies in patients with polyarteritis nodosa, ANCA‐associated vasculitis, or giant cell arteritis. Many studies have reported on the therapeutic effects of combination therapy with systemic steroid administration for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers. Rituximab was shown to be as effective as cyclophosphamide in performing remission induction therapy for ANCA‐associated vasculitis. Its usefulness for treating skin ulcers related to ANCA‐associated vasculitis has been reported. In an RCT in 57 patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, rituximab administration led to the remission of skin ulcers in all five patients with skin ulcers. Concerning methotrexate, there are case reports showing its efficacy for steroid‐resistant polyarteritis nodosa–associated skin ulcers. Several studies reported the efficacy of azathioprine in combination with systemic steroid administration for cutaneous arteritis– or polyarteritis nodosa–associated skin ulcers. Concerning intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, there are case reports demonstrating its effectiveness for skin ulcers associated with refractory polyarteritis nodosa or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Thus, systemic steroid administration or immunosuppressive therapy for vasculitis control may also be useful for treating vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers. However, with respect to individual drugs, there are few articles of which the evidence level is high, and they should be further examined in the future.

3.14 Precautions for clinical use

As long‐term systemic steroid administration induces various adverse reactions, such as infection, diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis, caution is needed. If sufficient treatment with steroids or immunosuppressants does not reduce skin ulcers, skin ulcer–deteriorating factors, such as thrombus formation, venous return disturbance, and concomitant infection, must also be considered. For the use of azathioprine, an NUDT15 gene polymorphism test must be performed to evaluate whether this drug should be indicated. Methotrexate is not covered by health insurance for vasculitis in Japan. For its use, caution is recommended.

Other cutaneous symptoms of APS reported to date include gangrene, subungual hemorrhage, pyoderma gangrenosum‐like rash, fulminant purpura, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, Degos disease–like rash, and macular atrophy. In addition, reticular purpura observed in the lower leg is not specific to APS but should be differentiated from livedo vasculopathy, polyarteritis nodosa, cutaneous arteritis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, rheumatoid vasculitis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, hypergammaglobulinemic purpura, protein C/S deficiency, erythema induratum of Bazin, and syphilis. If livedo reticularis is observed in addition to intractable skin ulcers, the differentiation from the above diseases is difficult based on the clinical profile alone, and the cause must be evaluated by blood tests and histological examinations. While examinations that could risk enlarging the ulcerated surface are typically avoided if there are painful ulcers, a skin biopsy is essential to clarify whether thrombosis or vasculitis is involved in the cause of skin ulcers, and for evaluating the depth and thickness of the affected blood vessels. Because this examination is invasive, it is preferable to collect reliable tissue samples from the epidermis to the adipose tissue in as few attempts as possible, avoiding unnecessary repetition.

A therapeutic algorithm based on the above principles is shown in Figure 6, and the details are described in Explanation 7. Anticoagulants are the mainstay treatment for APS. The concomitant use of circulation‐improving drugs is occasionally effective and worth attempting. Steroid administration may induce hypercoagulability but may also be useful for treating ulcers by suppressing secondary inflammation associated with skin ulcer formation. However, there is no consensus on the use of steroids, and the matter remains open to debate.

### Clinical analysis and identification of pediatric patients with colonic ulceration [^113pUqBt]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonic ulcerations are a kind of localized defect of mucosal surface tissue found in colon and rectum. The etiology of colonic ulceration is multiple, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious colitis, allergic colitis, et al. A differential diagnosis is required for further treatment and prognosis evaluation. It is challenging, and misdiagnosis is not rare in clinical practice. Many diseases (including infection, drug-induced disease, vascular disorders, diverticular disease, diversion proctocolitis, and immune disorders) can mimic IBD in clinical and pathological features. Inflammatory factors like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin (FCP) have been found for potential clinical diagnosis value with IBD but still need higher specificity. In most cases, acute infectious colitis is easily identified by clinical symptoms with no requirement for colonoscopy. But the patients with negative findings in pathogen tests, who present gastrointestinal bleeding, respond poorly to treatment, or have previous chronic gastrointestinal disorders, may undergo colonoscopic examination and confront the complex differential diagnosis. Gastrointestinal-involved vasculitis, such as Immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), could be very similar to IBD in the symptoms, endoscopic findings, and histological assessment. European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) recommended some features to help in the differential diagnosis between primary vasculitis and IBD. The imaging, serological, fecal, and molecular tests could assist differentiation.

The manifestation of IBD in the pediatric population is more complicated and less specific than in adults for a higher ratio of genetic factors involved. IBD is diagnosed based on a comprehensive analysis of clinical manifestations, endoscopic examination, histopathological examination, and needed to distinguish from diseases like intestinal infectious diseases, and intestinal lesions of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it is prone to be overdiagnosed in patients with colonic ulceration. Pediatricians should also pay attention to gastrointestinal allergic diseases, which are more prevalent in children and increasing. The data focused on the pediatric population is limited. To avoid diagnostic pitfalls, we observed the colonoscopy findings of ulcer features and combined them with the clinical manifestations and biochemical indexes of patients for the further recognition of related diseases, especially between IBD and non-IBD diseases. We summarized the differential manifestations of patients in the study and hoped to provide an alert for the misdiagnosis of children with colonic ulceration.

5.3.2 Etiological factors for‐related leg ulcers include vasculitis, thrombosis including antiphospholipid syndrome, circulatory disorder such as venous ulcers and peripheral arterial obstruction, infectious disease, and pyoderma gangrenosum. To investigate the etiology, hematology, skin biopsy, culture tests for causative bacteria, testing for venous insufficiency/thrombosis using lower limbs venous ultrasound, and testing for limb ischemia with the ankle pressure, ankle brachial pressure index, and skin perfusion pressure should be performed

Chia et al.examined 29 patients with connective tissue disease with leg ulcers, including eight with SLE. The most frequent etiological factor was "venous ulcer" (34.5%), followed by multifactorial ulcers (24.1%), vasculitis (20.7%), nontuberculous mycobacteriosis (7.0%), pyoderma gangrenosum (7.0%), peripheral arterial obstruction (3.4%), and iatrogenic ulcers (3.4%). Dabiri et al.performed a case series study, and reported that the frequent sites of leg ulcers in patients with SLE were the medial and lateral malleoli, upper areas of the medial and lateral malleoli, and anterior tibial region, and that etiological factors included vasculitis, venous insufficiency, thrombosis (including antiphospholipid syndrome), lupus erythematosus profundus, and concomitant lichen planus. They found that local treatment at the ulcer site was insufficient in many cases, suggesting the importance of primary disease treatment.
Based on the above findings, skin biopsy, infectious disease testing by culture tests, and detailed examination for circulatory disorder may be necessary for differentiating the pathogenesis of leg ulcers in patients with SLE (with respect to testing for venous leg ulcers, refer to guidelines for the management of lower leg ulcers/varicose veins). For the differentiation of antiphospholipid syndrome, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and β2‐glycoprotien I‐dependent anti‐CL IgG/IgM antibodies are covered by health insurance in Japan.
Minimally invasive examinations for limb ischemia related to arterial obstruction include measurement of the ankle pressure, ankle brachial pressure index, and skin perfusion pressure. If these tests indicate an abnormality, magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, and angiography should be performed (with respect to the diagnosis/treatment of arterial obstruction–related ulcers, refer to guidelines for the management of diabetic ulcers and gangrene).

### Vasculitis affecting the skin… [^114Zf5BZ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE SKIN and subcutaneous tissues are frequently involved by a number of systemic vasculitides, as demonstrated and discussed in the article by Frances et al, 1 and also can be the sole site of vascular inflammation, as observed in the patients described by Siberry et al2 in this issue of the Archives. Various patterns of cutaneous discoloration, swelling, hemorrhage, and necrosis may be the initial or most accessible manifestations of localized or systemic vasculitis, thus often involving dermatologists and dermatopathologists in the diagnosis and management of patients with vasculitis. To conclude that a patient has vasculitis confined to the skin, the known systemic manifestations of vasculitides must be looked for and found absent. Even if initially absent, systemic features may subsequently develop.

When systemic features accompany cutaneous vasculitis, the patient must be categorized into one of the recognized clinicopathologic vasculitis syndromes for appropriate prognostication and treatment: 899–906.

3.18 Commentary

In the two RCTs identified in the literature search, the efficacy of azathioprine for treating rheumatoid vasculitis was verified. In one, combination therapy with steroids was performed. In the other, azathioprine was combined with anti‐inflammatory analgesic drugs including steroids. The two studies have a high risk of bias (randomized –2, blind –2, intention‐to‐treat –2), and patients with skin ulcer‐free vasculitis were included, making it impossible to assess the impact on skin ulcers. Thus, the strength of total evidence is D (very weak). Furthermore, these RCTs did not show any significant effects of azathioprine on skin ulcers, recrudescence, or complications. However, in clinical practice, azathioprine is routinely used as a base drug for rheumatoid vasculitis, and there are many reports of its utility. Thus, the recommendation level is weak.

Concerning the effects of cyclophosphamide on rheumatoid vasculitis, there is only one case series study verifying the efficacy of oral administration. However, for combination therapy with cyclophosphamide and steroid pulse, there is one nonrandomized open study. Of 45 patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, cyclophosphamide + steroid pulse therapy was selected in 21 severe‐status patients, and conventional drugs (azathioprine, prednisolone, D‐penicillamine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide alone, methotrexate, prostaglandin) were used in the other 24 patients. Cyclophosphamide + steroid pulse therapy reduced skin ulcers in 67% of the patients, whereas an improvement was achieved in only 25% of the patients in the other treatment group. Furthermore, the incidence of recurrent skin ulcers was 10% in the cyclophosphamide + steroid pulse therapy group, whereas it was 33% in the other treatment group, suggesting the inhibitory effects of cyclophosphamide + steroid pulse therapy on recurrent skin ulcers. However, this study has a high risk of bias (randomized −2, blind −2, intention‐to‐treat −2, others −2). Thus, the strength of total evidence is D (very weak), and the recommendation level is weak.

2.2.2 ‐associated skin ulcers

SLE exhibits various rashes and occasionally erosion or ulcers. Representative skin manifestations of SLE are as follows: among the diagnostic criteria in Japan are the butterfly rash (malar rash), discoid LE, oral ulcers, and photosensitivity; while those not among the diagnostic criteria include chilblain LE, LE profundus, nodular cutaneous lupus mucinosis, bullous LE, and lupus tumidus. SLE rashes alone are rarely an indication for systemic administration of a steroid or an immunosuppressant and are treated topically. Oral treatment with hydroxychloroquine may also be used. As an exception, the early systemic administration of a steroid is indicated for LE profundus because of the possibility of subsequent scarring or pit formation. Nonspecific skin symptoms observed in SLE include those due to peripheral vascular or circulatory disorders, and skin ulcers or gangrene may appear. Skin biopsy and various blood tests are necessary for their differentiation from exanthema due to APS or vasculitis. Circulation‐improving drugs and antiplatelet agents are administrated to treat peripheral vascular and circulatory disorders as needed. If APS or vasculitis has been diagnosed, treatment for these conditions becomes necessary. For details, see the relevant sections of the present guidelines or other guidelines of the Japanese Dermatological Association. In addition, because such patients are often immunocompromised, ulcers can frequently be caused by various infectious diseases, and cases of squamous cell carcinoma forming from scars at intractable ulcers found in discoid LE have been reported.

Based on the above concept, an algorithm for SLE‐associated skin ulcers and oral ulcers (Figure 2) was prepared, and the details are described in Explanation 3.

### A rare case of granulomatous wegener with multiple pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers [^114q8Cpc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare form of systemic vasculitis characterized by necrotic granulomas around the blood vessels. We report a case of a healthy 43-year-old man presented with multiple ulcerated lesions in head and all over the body, that has appeared spontaneously. It was characterized by a giant deep ulceration covered by thick purulent, in size from 3 to 4cm, deep; sub febrile temperature, and minimal pain associated. Skin biopsies results pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)-like features: anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA) positive. Six months later, the patient developed dispea episodes. CT scan (CT) result with multiple focal opacities. He was diagnosed with wegener granulomatosis (WG) and was treated with corticosteroids and ciclophosphamide. Skin involvement in WG is not common and lesions in the skin vary from purpura, paniculitis to ulceration. In our case, skin elements are the first manifestations. Whether these elements are Wegener manifestation or we have coexistence of PG with WG, it remains a still uncertain question to answer. There is no histopathologic pathognomic elements for both. Skin involvement in WG with PG-like lesions have been rarely reported. In front of this type of widespread ulcerations, resistant to treatment we should be aware that one of the reasons may be a disease of autoimmune etiology such as WG.

### Diagnosis and treatment of venous stasis ulcers… [^114dZ1Qb]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Venous stasis disease most commonly occurs in patients with obesity, congestive heart failure or diabetes. Ulcers often begin during the working years, adding lost productivity costs to the already substantial direct medical costs of treating this disease. The typical signs of chronic venous insufficiency include pedal edema, varicose veins and skin hyperpigmentation. Stasis ulcers most commonly occur at the medial malleolus, but any part of the lower limb can be involved. Patients with stasis ulcers typically note pain at the ulcer site and heaviness in the limb caused by edema. Within the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers related to venous stasis are less common ulcers resulting from arterial insufficiency, vasculitic disease or skin malignancy. Noninvasive measurement of arterial function by use of a blood pressure cuff and Doppler probe to assess the ankle-brachial index is an effective method of screening for arterial insufficiency.

Biopsy of any nonhealing ulcer can guide the physician in the choice of antibiotic and exclude the possibility of vasculitis or skin malignancy. Diuretics are commonly used in the treatment of venous insufficiency but are generally ineffective without the concomitant use of compressive dressings. Antibiotic use should be based on tissue culture of the wound. The most important intervention is effective compression of the edematous limb. The Unna boot, when properly applied, is a time-honored treatment but cannot be used if there is a large amount of wound drainage. Various types of compressive stockings are also available. Knee-high stockings are better tolerated by patients than thigh-high styles. Intermittent pneumatic compression pumps may be used as adjunctive therapy.

Maintenance of a moist wound microenvironment and debridement of necrotic tissue increase wound healing rates and reduce pain. Moist, occlusive dressings also decrease ulcer pain. Prolonged use of topical antiseptic agents should be avoided. Newer technologies for management of venous stasis ulcers follow those used in the care of diabetic ulcers. Topically applied compounds containing various growth factors have been helpful in some studies. Ligation of refluxing veins near the ulcer site or split-thickness skin grafting has been used in the most refractory cases.

5.3.3 Many‐associated oral ulcers are painless, being related to a primary disease. However, there are some cases of discoid lupus erythematosus of the mucosa. Diseases to be differentiated include recurrent aphthous stomatitis, lichen planus, leukoplakia, and infectious diseases such as herpes simplex and fungal infection. When it is difficult to make a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, skin biopsy, including direct immunofluorescence, and investigation for infectious disease are recommended for detailed examination for the etiology. Furthermore,‐associated oral ulcers may reflect the disease state, and it should be re‐evaluated using blood biochemistry/immunological examination and urinalysis

In patients with SLE, the prevalence of oral lesions varies among reports, ranging from 2% or 3% to 50%. The lesion site is painless in some cases but painful in others. The ulcer site sometimes becomes painful, affecting lifestyle. Typical oral lesions include painless ulcers, which often occur in the upper palate in the acute stage, and discoid lupus erythematosus of the mucosa. However, various disease types, such as recurrent aphthous stomatitis, lichen planus‐like exanthema, leukoplakia, and red plaque, have been reported.
In patients with SLE receiving systemic administration of immunosuppressants, secondary infection with herpes virus or fungus may induce oral ulcers; therefore, microscopy, Tzanck test, and viral antigen tests must be performed. If herpetic gingivostomatitis or oral candidiasis is observed, treatment with antiviral or antifungal drugs should be performed.
Immunoglobulin deposition in the basement membrane is observed on direct immunofluorescence in ≥ 70% of patients with SLE‐related oral lesions, whereas the positive rate in patients with lichen planus–like exanthema or leukoplakia is ≤ 10%. It is useful for the differential diagnosis. In the case of refractory ulcers at the site of discoid lupus erythematosus, the possibility of scar carcinoma must also be considered.
Oral lesions are adopted for many criteria as a parameter of SLE activity. Therefore, if oral lesions are observed in patients with SLE, SLE activity should be initially evaluated, and the systemic administration of steroids or immunosuppressants should be performed if necessary. The systemic administration of steroids or immunosuppressants is also useful for treating oral lesions.
Systemic treatment for SLE‐associated oral ulcers is beneficial, but no study has directly evaluated the utility of local therapy. However, there is one systematic review on local treatment for recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Topical steroid therapy is the first choice of therapy.

### Treatment-resistant bacterial keratitis: challenges and solutions [^115n3UjQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis is required for both infectious and noninfectious corneal ulcers. Fungi, amoebae (Acanthamoebae), and nematodes from infectious ulcers can also cause infiltrative keratitis. On the other hand, the possibility of superinfection by these agents with bacterial keratitis should also be kept in mind. Some members of the herpes virus family (herpes simplex, herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr) may produce immune-mediated infiltrates that mimic bacterial, fungal, and acanthamoeba keratitis.

Although clinical presentation, history, and symptoms provide some guidance, culture of corneal swab and scrape samples is the main differential diagnostic method.

If there is clinical uncertainty regarding the etiology until microbiological analysis results are available, then empirical treatment should also include antibacterial therapy.

Connective tissue diseases and vasculitic disorders also produce noninfectious corneal infiltrates. These types of immune ulcers are generally parallel to the limbus, arc-shaped, and peripheral.

### Refractory pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcerations in granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated successfully with rituximab [^116yUV1f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a small-to-medium vessel vasculitis that can affect the skin, respiratory tract, kidneys and other organs. A rare cutaneous manifestation of GPA is pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)-like ulcerations, which can have debilitating and disfiguring consequences. We report the case of a man in his 40s with refractory PG-like ulcerations secondary to GPA, not responsive to conventional immunosuppression, who was successfully treated with rituximab. This case emphasises the need for early recognition of this rare manifestation to allow for prompt initiation of treatment.

### Cutaneous vasculitis [^114iKsrK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Vasculitis can range in severity from a self-limited single-organ disorder to a life-threatening disease with the prospect of multiple-organ failure. This condition presents many challenges to the physician, including classification and diagnosis, appropriate laboratory workup, treatment, and the need for careful follow-up. The physician must not only be able to recognize vasculitis but also be able to provide a specific diagnosis (if possible) as well as recognize and treat any underlying etiologic condition. Most diagnostic criteria are based on the size of vessel involvement, which often correlates with specific dermatologic findings. This may allow the dermatologist to provide an initial diagnosis and direct the medical evaluation. This article reviews the classification and diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitic syndromes and current treatment options; it also presents a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating the patient with suspected cutaneous vasculitis. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2003;48:311–40.)

Learning Objective

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the classification and clinical features of the various forms of cutaneous vasculitis. They should also have a rational approach to diagnosing and treating a patient with vasculitis.

### Delayed relapse of Churg-Strauss syndrome manifesting as colon ulcers with mucosal granulomas: 3 cases [^111YKqQc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is characterized by small vessel vasculitis and extravascular granulomas. The American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for CSS include asthma, eosinophili, and clinical manifestation of vasculitis. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations occur in 30% of patients, but are inaugural in only 16%. They denote vasculitis of the stomach and small bowel wall, and consist in protean, nonspecific pain. GI involvement is of adverse prognostic significance in CSS. Ulcer formation in the GI tract mucosa is a rarer manifestation, usually discovered upon laparotomy or autopsy. We describe 3 new cases of colonic ulcers in CSS. Unusual features were diagnosis of the ulcers during a delayed relapse and presence of eosinophilic granulomas within the mucosa.

### Diagnostic approach in patients with suspected vasculitis [^1128e1Eo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the common feature of inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Vasculitis can be a systemic or localized process and depending on the disorder can affect large, medium, or small vessels. Vascular physicians including interventional radiologists often may be involved early in these cases before the establishment of a diagnosis as these patients may present with manifestations attributable to occlusive vascular syndromes. In this article, we discuss the presenting signs and symptoms of patients with vasculitis as well as laboratory and imaging studies required to further evaluate these disorders and treatment options, which include interventional as well as noninterventional options.

### Can cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) be diagnosed in a patient with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exposure? [^116yf1et]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The differential diagnosis for ulcerating small bowel strictures is extensive and includes exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Crohn's disease, infections, gastrointestinal lymphoma and vasculopathy. It also encompasses the exceptionally rare and poorly understood diagnosis of cryptogenic multifocal ulcerative stenosing enterocolitis (CMUSE), often a diagnosis of exclusion and considerable difficulty. We present a case of persistent proximal jejunal ulcerating stenoses in a 75-year-old Caucasian man, which continued despite cessation of NSAIDs. After extensive clinical, radiographic, laboratory and ultimately surgical pathological appraisal-as well as failure to improve with both misoprostol and budesonide-he was diagnosed with CMUSE and managed with limited small bowel resection. In the presentation of this case, we aim to underscore the diagnostic challenges that clinicians face in differentiating CMUSE from other more common diagnoses, particularly NSAIDs-induced enteropathy.

### Small-vessel vasculitis [^112V4ywN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The term vasculitis is defined as inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Small-vessel vasculitides affect post-capillary venules, mostly in the skin. Defining the different types of small-vessel vasculitides is important as they may be associated with systemic manifestations, may require additional patient evaluation and may require more than only supportive care. Evaluation of a patient with suspected small-vessel vasculitis requires skin biopsy, evaluation of the extent of the disease, and an attempt to define an etiology. Management is based on providing supportive care, treating any underlying condition, avoiding any triggers, and treating based on severity of skin lesions and systemic involvement.

5.4.4 Panniculitis in patients with dermatomyositis reflects the disease state and may cause scars/ulcers; therefore, systemic steroid administration is selected for treatment. If there is no response to steroid treatment, the systemic administration of immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, and azathioprine, should be considered

Panniculitis is reportedly observed in approximately 9% of patients with dermatomyositis. Douvoyiannis et al.investigated 24 dermatomyositis patients with panniculitis in the United Kingdom and reported that frequent sites were the gluteal region, femur, and arms. Histopathologically, lobular panniculitis is typically noted, primarily consisting of lymphocyte infiltration. Several studies have shown that concomitant diseases, such as interstitial lung disease, were frequent in the presence of membranocystic changes, suggesting that these changes contribute to a poor prognosis. Furthermore, membranocystic changes in the adipose tissue and interstitial lung disease may be pathologically associated with microvascular damage.
For treatment, systemic steroid administration or dose elevation is attempted in many cases, and the responsiveness to treatment is relatively favorable. According to a report by Douvoyiannis et al.an improvement in exanthema was achieved in 89% (eight of nine) of patients treated with steroids alone. A rapid reduction in the steroid dose resulted in the deterioration of panniculitis or dermatomyositis in two patients. However, in these patients, additional steroid dose elevation led to an improvement. The dose of steroids ranged from 0.3 to 2 mg/kg per day.
According to a summary on previous case reports in Japan published by Fujisawa et al.prednisolone at 10 to 60 mg/day had been administered. Of the patients, 69% (11 of 16) responded to this therapy, whereas 31% (five of 16) did not respond, including patients who died. The nonresponders included patients with membranocystic changes and those with interstitial lung disease. Attention should be paid to membranocystic changes in the adipose tissue.
Oral immunosuppressants are also used in combination with oral steroids. As the type of immunosuppressants, cyclosporine (≤ 3 mg/kg per day), methotrexate (2.5–7.5 mg/week), and azathioprine (2–3 mg/kg per day) are combined with steroids.
Furthermore, there are case reports in which intravenous immunoglobulin led to dramatic improvements in two patients who did not respond to these immunosuppressive therapies.
Thus, systemic steroid administration (dose elevation) should be initially considered for panniculitis in patients with dermatomyositis. Immunosuppressants should be administered based on the treatment responsiveness.

### Ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis [^112eMiaT]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis is a rare side effect. It has only been described in 10 case reports since 1989. However, recently we were confronted with two cases within 1 month. In one patient the vasculitis resolved after termination of the ciprofloxacin therapy; in the other patient the ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis was superimposed on a severe forefoot infection, leading to progressive gangrene and a below-knee amputation. Ciprofloxacin is among the standard treatments for infected ischemic ulcers; in the rare case of ciprofloxacin-induced hemorrhagic vasculitis, it might be interpreted as progression of infection, instead of a complication of the treatment, thus leading to faulty diagnosis and treatment. The intention of this case report is to raise awareness for anyone prescribing ciprofloxacin as treatment for infected diabetic and ischemic ulcers.

### Clinical features… [^1141gdxS]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Vasculitis refers to a heterogenous group of disorders in which there is inflammation and damage in blood vessel walls, leading to tissue necrosis. These are relatively uncommon disorders, with a reported annual incidence of 40 to 54 cases per 1 million persons. 1 The incidence appears to be affected by geography, age, and seasonal challenges. Vasculitis may be limited to skin or other organs, or may be a multisystem disorder with multiple manifestations. In 1994, the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference proposed a nomenclature defining 10 primary vasculitides based on vessel size. 4 The nomenclature includes microscopic polyangiitis and defines it as vasculitis involving microscopic vessels. Microscopic polyangiitis is distinguished from polyarteritis nodosa by the presence of microscopic vessel involvement.

Polyarteritis nodosa must have no involvement of microscopic vessels, including no glomerulonephritis. Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of vasculitides is poorly understood. Three possible mechanisms of vascular damage are immune complex deposition, ANCAs, and T-lymphocyte response with granuloma formation. 7, 8 The end result of these various pathways is endothelial cell activation, with subsequent vessel obstruction and ischemia of dependent tissue. This may cause hemorrhage in the surrounding tissues and, in some cases, weakening of the vessel wall, which leads to the formation of aneurysms. For almost all forms of vasculitis, the triggering event initiating and driving this inflammatory response is unknown. Many small vessel vasculitides have a paucity of vascular immune deposits and, therefore, other mechanisms have been sought for these so-called pauci-immune vasculitides.

TISSUE BIOPSY The definitive diagnosis of vasculitis is established by biopsy of the involved tissue, which determines the pattern of vessel inflammation. The presence of immunoglobulins and complement found by immunofluorescence on the tissue section may be helpful in elucidating the specific type of vasculitis. Biopsies are particularly valuable in ruling out other causes, but a negative biopsy does not rule out vasculitis.

### Reticular rash on the lower extremities [^1111AA9d]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Answers:
A. Classic polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is characterized by palpable purpura, but livedo racemosa and retiform purpura can also be seen. Systemic signs include weight loss, fever, arthralgias, and renal failure. Histology findings show vasculitis rather than vascular thrombosis.
B. Rheumatoid vasculitis – Incorrect. Rheumatoid vasculitis occurs in less than 5% of rheumatoid arthritis patients and can involve the skin, nervous system, heart, and kidneys. Because rheumatoid vasculitis can affect small or medium-sized vessels, cutaneous findings range from palpable purpura to acral ulcerations and infarcts. A skin biopsy would most likely show vasculitis and not vascular occlusion.
C. Type I cryoglobulinemia – Correct. Type I cryoglobulinemia represents a thrombotic vasculopathy caused by monoclonal immunoglobulin occlusion of vessels in patients with hematologic malignancy, such as multiple myeloma, and can be associated with elevated serum viscosity. Cutaneous findings range from livedo reticularis to necrotic ulcerations and may be accompanied by neuropathy, arthralgias, and renal disease.
D. Mixed cryoglobulinemia – Incorrect. Mixed cryoglobulinemia describes both type II and type III cryoglobulinemia in which cryoglobulins are polyclonal immunoglobulins. Unlike type I cryoglobulinemia, mixed cryoglobulinemia results in vasculitis of the small and medium-sized vessels and is associated with underlying infection (most commonly hepatitis C), connective tissue disease, and, less frequently, lymphoproliferative disorders.
E. Antiphospholipid syndrome – Incorrect. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a systemic disorder of coagulation resulting in arterial or venous thrombosis. Dermatologic findings include livedo reticularis, ulceration, retiform purpura, livedoid vasculitis, and splinter hemorrhages. Diagnosis requires two positive antiphospholipid antibody tests at least 12 weeks apart.

5.3.1 If blister formation is observed in patients with, direct/indirect immunofluorescence, histopathological examination, and examination for infectious diseases should be performed for differential diagnosis, considering various conditions including bullous lupus erythematosus

In patients with SLE, bullous rash is relatively rare. Based on its pathogenesis, it is classified into three types: type 1 involves a rash in which marked liquefaction degeneration progresses to blister formation; type 2 consists of a rash complicated by other bullous diseases; and type 3 features a rash with histological findings similar to those of Duhring dermatitis herpetiformis, in which anti–type VII collagen autoantibody is typically present. Type 3 corresponds to narrow‐sense bullous lupus erythematosus. The diagnostic criteria prepared by Camisa et al.include: (i) the diagnostic criteria for SLE established by the American College of Rheumatology are met; (ii) blister formation in both sun‐exposed and nonexposed areas; (iii) histopathologically, the condition resembles Duhring dermatitis herpetiformis; (iv) antibasement membrane circulating antibody–negative or –positive reactions on indirect immunofluorescence with human skin samples; and (v) basement membrane IgG/IgA/IgM deposition is observed on direct immunofluorescence.
Thus, detailed histopathological examination, including the fluorescent antibody method, is necessary for differentiation from diseases such as autoimmune bullosa. The fluorescent antibody method is not available in all institutions (direct immunofluorescence [outsourced examination is possible] for bullosa is covered by health insurance), but even only pathological examination should be performed. When differentiation is difficult, immunoelectron microscopy is necessary in some cases.
Many patients with SLE are in an immunosuppressive state, and various infectious diseases may concomitantly occur. The possibility of various infectious diseases, including herpesvirus infection and contagious impetigo, other than primary disease–related conditions, should be considered, and microbiological testing is also necessary.
Bullous rash often appears on SLE deterioration or in the presence of concomitant nephritis; caution is needed. Treatments include systemic steroid administration and hydroxychloroquine therapy. The usefulness of hydroxychloroquine for treating cutaneous/SLE was reported in Japan.
Many studies have reported the effectiveness of DDS. In this case, low‐dose (25–50 mg/day) DDS administration resulted in the loss of new blisters in 24 to 48 h, leading to the disappearance of rash in 7 to 10 days. However, for the use of DDS, the risk of drug eruption in patients with SLE should be considered.

### Vasculitis [^115392S9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is histologically defined by the presence of blood vessel inflammation. It can be observed in a wide variety of settings, either occurring secondarily to another process or as the pathologic foundation of a primary vasculitic disease. The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a broad group of disease entities that are uniquely identified by the nature of their clinical, histopathologic, or therapeutic characteristics. Individual diseases often predominantly affect blood vessels of a particular size, the pattern of which influences their clinical manifestations and has been used in their classification. The vasculitides span a wide range of disease severity, extending from illnesses that rarely produce death to those almost universally fatal before the introduction of effective therapy. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents are used to treat many vasculitic diseases. Although such approaches can be effective, long-term treatment may be complicated by chronic sequelae from organ damage, disease relapses, and medication side effects. Recent investigations have focused on understanding the pathophysiology of these diseases, which may lead to more efficacious and less toxic therapeutic options.

### Update of management of connective tissue diseases: livedoid vasculopathy [^112DJnzj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Livedoid vasculopathy (LV) is characterized by painful purple macules and papules that subsequently ulcerate. The lesions heal over weeks to months resulting in smooth, porcelain-white, atrophic plaque-like areas with surrounding telangiectases and hyperpigmentation. The specific cause of LV is still to be determined and it is believed to be multifactorial in nature. Despite numerous available therapeutic agents, there is not a single best efficacious treatment for LV. Most of the available treatment options are based on isolated case reports or case series. In this article, studies on the pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches to LV are reviewed.

Question 3: Which of the following is not a cutaneous manifestation of essential thrombocythemia?
A. Livedo reticularis
B. Erythromelalgia
C. Polyarteritis nodosa
D. Raynaud phenomenon
E. Lower extremity ulcers

Answers:
A. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. This is a purplish, net-like vascular pattern on the skin commonly occurring due to vascular pathology. In ET, the livedo reticularis pattern may be more limited and asymmetric in comparison with the classic/benign form.
B. Erythromelalgia – Incorrect. This is a rare condition characterized by burning pain and erythema at the distal extremities, exacerbated by heat and exercise. While rare, it has been documented in ET.
C. Polyarteritis nodosa – Correct. Polyarteritis nodosa is a medium-vessel vasculitis often affecting numerous organs, while classically sparing the lungs. It is commonly associated with hepatitis B infection, and may also be triggered by blood dyscrasias such as hairy cell leukemia. However, ET is not a known trigger of polyarteritis nodosa.
D. Raynaud phenomenon – Incorrect. This condition results from vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries due to cold exposure. It is associated with ET, and can be treated with avoidance of cold, warm clothing, and calcium channel blockers.
E. Lower extremity ulcers – Incorrect. Ulceration may occur from chronic coagulopathy, as in the case of ET. It may also result from chemotherapeutics, such as hydroxycarbamide, which are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.

### Skin ulcers misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum [^113ZkKzs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the misdiagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum can result in substantial complications in patients who have other causes of severe cutaneous ulceration.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of 240 patients with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum who were evaluated at our institution from 1975 through 2000, including 157 consecutive patients treated for presumed pyoderma gangrenosum from 1984 through 1992. We also reviewed the English-language literature.

Results

Ninety-five patients (49 from our institution and 46 described in the literature) had skin ulcers with a clinical resemblance to pyoderma gangrenosum. The final diagnoses were vascular occlusive or venous disease, vasculitis, cancer, primary infection, drug-induced or exogenous tissue injury, and other inflammatory disorders. Of the 95 patients studied, 64 had been treated for pyoderma gangrenosum for a median of 10 months (range, 3 to 180). These 64 included 15 of the 157 consecutive patients treated for pyoderma gangrenosum at our institution (10 percent). Of the ulcers in the 64 patients treated for pyoderma gangrenosum, it was clear that those in 23 patients (36 percent) did not respond to treatment directed at pyoderma gangrenosum, those in 8 (12 percent) were exacerbated by such treatment, and those in 15 (23 percent) improved with such treatment.

Conclusions

The misdiagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is not uncommon and exposes patients to risks associated with its treatment. A thorough evaluation is required in all patients suspected of having pyoderma gangrenosum in order to rule out alternative diagnoses.

### Small vessel vasculitis of the skin [^116cWkhk]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Small vessel vasculitis in the skin manifests with palpable purpura on the lower extremities. This clinical presentation prompts a complete physical examination, history, and review of systems, as well as biopsies for routine processing and direct immunofluorescence to confirm the diagnosis. The presence of vasculitis in other organs, associated underlying conditions, and the severity of cutaneous manifestations dictate management. The majority of cases are self-limited, and overall the prognosis is favorable. Still, a subset of patients can have serious complications and chronic or recurrent disease.

### Response of livedoid vasculitis to intravenous immunoglobulin [^115T7GZU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Livedoid vasculitis is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent painful ulceration of the lower limbs, which heals to leave atrophie blanche surrounded by hyperpigmentation and telangiectasia. We report two patients with livedoid vasculitis who, after failure of conventional therapies, responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). There was healing of areas of active ulceration and improvement of erythema, swelling and pain. IVIg has been used successfully to treat a variety of vasculitic disorders and appears to be well tolerated. We suggest that this treatment is offered to patients who have livedoid vasculitis that is unresponsive to other therapies.

### Cutaneous vasculitis update: diagnostic criteria, classification, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation and prognosis [^111sHmZr]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2005). Low credibility.

Vasculitis, inflammation of the vessel wall, can result in mural destruction with hemorrhage, aneurysm formation, and infarction, or intimal-medial hyperplasia and subsequent stenosis leading to tissue ischemia. The skin, in part due to its large vascular bed, exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent presence of stasis, is involved in many distinct as well as un-named vasculitic syndromes that vary from localized and self-limited to generalized and life-threatening with multi-organ disease. To exclude mimics of vasculitis, diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis requires biopsy confirmation where its acute signs (fibrinoid necrosis), chronic signs (endarteritis obliterans), or past signs (acellular scar of healed arteritis) must be recognized and presence of extravascular findings such as patterned fibrosis or collagenolytic granulomas noted. Although vasculitis can be classified by etiology, many cases have no identifiable cause, and a single etiologic agent can elicit several distinct clinicopathologic expressions of vasculitis. Therefore, the classification of cutaneous vasculitis is best approached morphologically by determining vessel size and principal inflammatory response. These histologic patterns roughly correlate with pathogenic mechanisms that, when coupled with direct immunofluorescent examination, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) status, and findings from work-up for systemic disease, allow for specific diagnosis, and ultimately, more effective therapy. Herein, we review cutaneous vasculitis focusing on diagnostic criteria, classification, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, and evaluation of the cutaneous vasculitis patient.

### Leg ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis – a prospective study of aetiology, wound healing and pain reduction after pinch grafting [^115UZrKC]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the aetiology of leg ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to study healing and pain relief after pinch grafting.

Methods

Twenty patients with RA and leg ulcers were studied. Diagnosis of the ulcers was founded on the clinical picture and measurements of the ankle-brachial pressure index. To detect vasculitis, skin biopsies were taken for immunohistochemistry and histopathology. Pain severity was assessed pre- and post-operatively using a visual analogue scale.

Results

Ten of the 20 patients had ulcers with multifactorial aetiology. Fifteen had signs of venous insufficiency, 11 had histopathological evidence of vasculitis, four had reduced arterial circulation and two patients had diabetes. Healing after pinch grafting was found in eight patients, all of whom had an ulcer area less than 15 cm². Eleven out of 18 patients had pain reduction after pinch grafting.

Conclusion

The causation of leg ulcers in patients with RA was found to be multifactorial, with vasculitis and venous insufficiency as the main determinants. Pinch grafting seems to be a good alternative to conservative treatment for minor leg ulcers for these patients, regarding both wound healing and pain relief.
