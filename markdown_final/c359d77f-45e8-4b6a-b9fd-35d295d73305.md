## Question

Latent Tb doesn't require airborne precautions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) requires airborne precautions and how to justify that conclusion with clinical reasoning and references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of LTBI versus active TB. Then, I should verify the biological basis for transmission and whether LTBI involves infectiousness. Next, I will review authoritative guidelines on airborne precautions and when they are indicated. After that, I should check for any exceptions or edge cases that might blur the distinction. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note practical implications for care and counseling.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. LTBI is a state of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection without clinical, radiographic, or microbiologic evidence of active disease. Persons with LTBI are asymptomatic and not infectious, whereas active TB disease is clinically apparent and, when pulmonary or laryngeal, can be transmissible via airborne droplet nuclei.

> Wait, let me verify the transmission biology before jumping to infection-control conclusions. Active pulmonary or laryngeal TB transmits via 1–5 micron aerosolized droplet nuclei generated during coughing or other forceful respiratory maneuvers; LTBI reflects containment of bacilli within granulomas, so viable organisms are not present in sputum and there is no mechanism for airborne spread, which is why persons with LTBI are not contagious [^113sZofq] [^116Mbs1Q] [^112MvpnN].

> I should confirm what the guidelines say about airborne precautions. CDC and ATS/IDSA guidance direct airborne infection isolation for patients with suspected or confirmed infectious TB of the lungs, airway, or larynx, and specify criteria for discontinuation such as three negative sputum smears or NAAT results; none of these isolation recommendations apply to LTBI because LTBI is noninfectious by definition [^117Neby6] [^114fWvtn] [^113fVpaC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — are there any edge cases where LTBI might still warrant airborne precautions? I need to check for scenarios of early subclinical disease or diagnostic uncertainty. Even in contact investigations, the public health action is to identify and treat LTBI to prevent future disease, not to isolate, reinforcing that LTBI itself is not a transmission risk; likewise, contemporary discussions of a TB spectrum do not imply infectiousness in LTBI, and pediatric guidance emphasizes prompt recognition and isolation for suspected active disease, not for LTBI [^113avqQ2] [^112MvpnN] [^1119NJBK] [^114ghDie].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the bottom line. LTBI does not require airborne precautions because the bacilli are sequestered and nontransmissible. Airborne precautions are reserved for persons with suspected or confirmed infectious pulmonary or laryngeal TB, with decisions to discontinue isolation guided by serial negative microbiology and clinical judgment, whereas LTBI care focuses on evaluation and preventive therapy rather than isolation [^113avqQ2] [^117Neby6] [^114opoTs].

> I should confirm practical implications for clinicians. For patients with LTBI, counsel that they are not contagious, arrange treatment to reduce progression risk, and avoid unnecessary isolation. For patients with cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss, maintain a high index of suspicion for active TB and initiate airborne precautions while diagnostic evaluation proceeds, de-escalating only when TB is excluded or the patient is deemed noninfectious by clinical and microbiologic criteria [^112MvpnN] [^114fWvtn] [^117Neby6].

Latent TB infection (LTBI) **does not require airborne precautions** because individuals with LTBI are not infectious and cannot transmit TB to others [^112MvpnN] [^113avqQ2]. Airborne precautions are only necessary for patients with **active pulmonary or laryngeal TB**, who can spread TB through airborne droplets [^114fWvtn] [^117Neby6]. LTBI is managed with **preventive therapy** to reduce future disease risk, but no isolation or airborne precautions are needed [^114opoTs] [^112MvpnN].

## Definition and characteristics of latent TB infection

LTBI is a state in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria are present in the body but are **contained by the immune system**, causing no symptoms or clinical evidence of active disease [^1161xq6n]. Individuals with LTBI:

- Are asymptomatic and **not contagious** [^117V6iDj] [^113avqQ2].
- Have a positive TB skin test or IGRA but normal chest radiographs and negative sputum smears/cultures [^112VCkno].
- Cannot spread TB to others [^112VCkno].

---

## Transmission risk of latent TB infection

LTBI is **non-infectious** because the bacteria are dormant and contained within granulomas, preventing transmission [^116Mbs1Q]. Transmission occurs only when active pulmonary or laryngeal TB is present, allowing bacteria to be expelled in airborne droplets [^115xSg11].

---

## Airborne precautions: definition and indications

Airborne precautions are infection-control measures used to prevent transmission of infectious agents via airborne droplets. They include:

- Use of negative-pressure rooms (airborne infection isolation rooms [AIIRs]) [^113fVpaC].
- N95 respirators or higher-level respiratory protection for healthcare workers [^113fVpaC].
- Strict adherence to isolation protocols [^114fWvtn].

Airborne precautions are indicated for patients with **active pulmonary or laryngeal TB**, who are infectious and can transmit TB through airborne droplets [^117Neby6] [^1169aUm4].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations regarding airborne precautions for latent TB

Major public health organizations, including the CDC and WHO, **do not recommend airborne precautions for LTBI** because individuals with LTBI are not infectious and cannot transmit TB [^113avqQ2] [^117V6iDj]. Airborne precautions are only necessary for patients with active pulmonary or laryngeal TB [^117Neby6].

---

## Clinical implications of latent TB infection

Although LTBI is non-infectious, it carries a **risk of progression to active TB disease**, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^113avqQ2]. The lifetime risk of progression is approximately 5–10% in immunocompetent individuals, and higher in those with HIV or other immunosuppressive conditions [^116uEdHZ]. Therefore, identifying and treating LTBI is essential to prevent future transmission and disease burden [^115ztHKw].

---

## Management of latent TB infection

LTBI is managed with **preventive therapy**, typically using isoniazid, rifampin, or combination regimens such as isoniazid plus rifapentine [^114opoTs]. These regimens significantly reduce the risk of progression to active TB disease [^115dezHu]. No isolation or airborne precautions are required during treatment of LTBI [^112MvpnN].

## Airborne precautions for TB

| **Tb status** | **Infectiousness** | **Airborne precautions required?** |
|-|-|-|
| Latent TB infection (LTBI) | Non-infectious | No |
| Active pulmonary TB | Infectious | Yes |
| Active laryngeal TB | Infectious | Yes |
| Extrapulmonary TB (non-pulmonary, non-laryngeal) | Non-infectious | No |

Latent TB infection **does not require airborne precautions** because individuals with LTBI are not infectious and cannot transmit TB to others [^117V6iDj]. Airborne precautions are only necessary for patients with active pulmonary or laryngeal TB, who can spread TB through airborne droplets [^117Neby6]. LTBI is managed with preventive therapy to reduce the risk of progression to active disease, but no isolation or airborne precautions are needed [^114opoTs].

### Evidence for the use of triage, respiratory isolation, and effective treatment to reduce the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in healthcare settings: a systematic review [^1142CWct]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Evidence is limited for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures reducing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) transmission in health facilities. This systematic review, 1 of 7 commissioned by the World Health Organization to inform the 2019 update of global tuberculosis (TB) IPC guidelines, asked: do triage and/or isolation and/or effective treatment of TB disease reduce MTB transmission in healthcare settings?

Of 25 included articles, 19 reported latent TB infection (LTBI) incidence in healthcare workers (HCWs; absolute risk reductions 1%–21%); 5 reported TB disease incidence in HCWs (no/slight [high TB burden] or moderate [low burden] reduction) and 2 in human immunodeficiency virus-positive in-patients (6%–29% reduction). In total, 23/25 studies implemented multiple IPC measures; effects of individual measures could not be disaggregated.

Packages of IPC measures appeared to reduce MTB transmission, but evidence for effectiveness of triage, isolation, or effective treatment, alone or in combination, was indirect and low quality. Harmonizing study designs and reporting frameworks will permit formal data syntheses and facilitate policy making.

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with ACTEMRA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

If a serious infection develops, interrupt ACTEMRA until the infection is controlled.

Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients, except those with COVID-19, should be tested for latent tuberculosis before ACTEMRA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to ACTEMRA use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, and pneumocystis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

The risks and benefits of treatment with ACTEMRA should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with ACTEMRA, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections have occurred in patients receiving ACTEMRA. (5.1)
If a serious infection develops, interrupt ACTEMRA until the infection is controlled. (5.1)

Introduction

Human infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces an active form of disease known as tuberculosis (TB) or an asymptomatic form known as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). In LTBI, M. tuberculosis has been assumed to exist in a quiescent state, constrained by host immune responses within granulomas or other protected sites. LTBI carries an ~5–15% risk of progressing to active TB within the first two years after infection. This is followed by an additional ~5% risk of developing active TB over the remaining lifetime of the infected host, usually due to waning immunity from disease or aging –, although the true incidence of late TB recurrence during latency has recently been questioned. Almost two billion of the world's population shows evidence of past M. tuberculosis infection, and if latently infected, may represent a major reservoir for new disease and a source of new M. tuberculosis transmission. Recent studies have challenged a binary model of M. tuberculosis infection, which subdivides disease states into latent infection and active disease –. Instead, LTBI has been proposed to represent a spectrum ranging from immunological reactivity to a past cured infection, to sustained quiescent infection, to early low-level TB disease. This model not only redefines latency, but also suggests that different types of preventive treatment might be more appropriate for different types of LTBI, assuming that the states of LTBI could be better identified in individual patients.

Strategies for TB Prevention and Control

This report reemphasizes the importance of three priority strategies for TB prevention and control that have been well established for decades:

Identification of and completion of treatment for persons with active TB disease to render their condition noninfectious
Finding and screening persons who have had contact with TB patients to determine whether they have active TB disease themselves; whether they have been infected with M. tuberculosis; or for children and other persons at high risk, whether they require window prophylaxis (preventive treatment of presumed TB infection during the time that it would normally take for a tuberculin skin test [TST] or interferon gamma-release assay [IGRA] to become positive after exposure) and whether to administer treatment
Screening, testing, and treatment of other selected persons and populations at high risk for latent TB infection (LTBI) and subsequent active TB disease to detect persons who can most benefit from treatment for LTBI, which is essential for TB elimination because of new immunosuppressive drugs and therapies used for different illnesses, immigration from areas where TB is endemic, and diminished knowledge and reduced recognition of TB by clinicians as a result of decreased incidence

Although the three priority strategies focus on individual patients, they serve broader epidemiologic functions because they reduce current and future transmission of M. tuberculosis in the community.

Key messages

Two billion people worldwide are thought to be asymptomatically (latently) infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and at risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB)
The prevalence of latent TB infection is inferred from tests that detect immunoreactivity to mycobacterial antigens rather than live bacteria and from mathematical modelling
Longitudinal studies and clinical trials show that this TB immunoreactivity can persist after curative treatment
Most people with TB immunoreactivity do not develop active TB upon immunosuppression, suggesting that they have cleared their infection while retaining immunological memory to it
TB immunoreactivity cannot distinguish cleared from persistent infection, emphasising the urgent need for tests that can identify people with asymptomatic infections

A critical component of the World Health Organization's End TB strategy is the prevention of active tuberculosis (TB) by treating people with latent TB infection. This requires knowledge of who is latently or asymptomatically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As there are no direct tests for asymptomatic infection, it is inferred from the presence of TB immunoreactivity, determined by either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). The use of immunoreactivity as a proxy for infection is based on the assumption that those testing positive harbour live bacteria, which might be quiescent now but can spring to activity to cause disease later, especially if the host becomes immunocompromised.

Is this assumption valid? Knowing this would be useful for several interested parties — public health officials, TB researchers, people showing TB immunoreactivity, and doctors. We tested the assumption that TB immunoreactivity equals persistent infection by analysing the natural history of TB immunoreactivity in people given preventive treatment and of active TB in immunoreactive people with various forms of severe immunosuppression.

Contact investigation and outbreak control — risk among close contacts and public health responsibilities are characterized as follows: Among close contacts, approximately 30% have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and 1 to 3% have progressed to TB disease. Without intervention, approximately 5% of contacts with newly acquired LTBI progress to TB disease within 2 years of the exposure. The prevalence of TB among close contacts is approximately 1,000/ 100,000 population (> 100-fold higher than in the general population). In the United States, state and local public health agencies perform 90% of contact investigations as part of the public health mandate for TB control, and public health TB-control programs are responsible for ensuring that contact investigations are conducted effectively and that all expected contacts are identified, provided with access to adequate care, and followed to completion of therapy.

Value of Contact Identification and Evaluation

Contact identification and evaluation have been key components of TB-control measures in most low TB–incidence countries for at least the past 75 years, and a strong scientific basis exists for most, but not all, elements of this activity. Although the same information and approaches apply in generally resource-poor, high TB–incidence countries and although international guidelines exist, implementation of routine contact investigations has been very limited. In the setting of TB, effective contact investigations have addressed stigma, community engagement, training of interviewers, and use of specific operational guidelines. These same elements will likely prove crucial to the effectiveness of COVID-19 contact tracing.

At least 3 important differences exist between factors that should be considered when engaging in contact identification and evaluation for COVID-19 compared with TB. First, because of the short interval between exposure and disease onset, estimated to be a median of 4.1 days for COVID-19, the timeframe for contact identification and evaluation is much shorter than for TB. In addition, infection with M. tuberculosis in immunocompetent hosts most commonly results in latent infection, which can last decades and in most cases never progresses to active TB disease. Second, persons with COVID-19 are most infectious in the immediate presymptomatic and early symptomatic phases, when the viral titers are at their peak, again indicating the need for speed in the contact process for maximal effectiveness. Third, SARS-CoV-2 clearly is transmitted from person to person predominantly through respiratory secretions that may be inhaled, settling on the mucosal lining of large airways, or be self-inoculated onto nasal mucosa or into the eyes. Unlike TB, the droplets with the SARS-CoV-2 viral cargo might also contaminate and persist on surfaces, although the role played by surface or fomite transmission is not well-quantified. However, increasing controversies and concerns exist as to the relative contribution of aerosols to overall transmission.

### Tuberculosis: common questions and answers [^11592vQU]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 10 million people worldwide were infected with tuberculosis (TB) in 2019, resulting in 1.4 million deaths. In the United States that same year, there were nearly 9,000 reported cases of TB disease and up to 13 million people were living with latent TB infection (LTBI), which is an asymptomatic, noncommunicable infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Without treatment, LTBI will progress to active TB disease in approximately 5% to 10% of affected people. Individuals with symptoms of TB disease warrant testing. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends testing individuals at increased risk of LTBI with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing. Because the incidence of LTBI in health care professionals is similar to that of the general population, periodic retesting is not recommended. After a positive test result, chest radiography should be performed and, in patients with suspected pulmonary TB disease, sputum collected for diagnosis. Both suspected and confirmed cases of LTBI and TB disease must be reported to local or state health departments. Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI include isoniazid in combination with rifapentine or rifampin, or rifampin alone for a duration of three and four months, respectively. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease includes an eight-week intensive phase with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), followed by a continuation phase lasting 18 weeks or more, with two drugs based on susceptibility testing results. Consultation with a TB expert is necessary if there is suspicion or confirmation of drug-resistant TB.

Primary prophylaxis during the window period for high‑risk tuberculosis contacts — because tuberculin skin test results might take 8 to 10 weeks to become positive after infection, a second test should be placed 8 to 12 weeks after the last exposure, and during the 8- to 12-week window period contacts with initially negative tests should receive treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) after TB disease is ruled out if they are (1) contacts younger than 5 years (with highest priority given to those younger than 3 years) and (2) contacts with HIV infection or who are otherwise immunocompromised. If the second skin test result is negative (< 5 mm), the contact is immunocompetent and no longer exposed, treatment for LTBI may be discontinued and further follow-up is unnecessary. If the second skin test is negative but the contact is immunocompromised, a course of therapy for LTBI should be completed. If the second skin test result is negative but the person remains in close contact with an infectious patient, treatment for LTBI should be continued if the contact is younger than 5 years, aged 5 to 15 years at the clinician's discretion, or HIV‑seropositive or otherwise immunocompromised.

LTBI and TB prevention

The natural history of TB begins with the acquisition of infection through the inhalation of MTB that subsequently enters a replication cycle and disseminates within the host, whose immune system usually reacts and leads to containment of viable bacilli. The result of this process is asymptomatic LTBI, a condition in which TB bacteria remain in the body in a quiescent state, without making any damage and therefore without causing transmission to other susceptible individuals.

Although it is substantially impossible to test everybody, mathematical models estimate that about a third of the global population has LTBI, an incredibly large pool from which TB cases actually arise each year.

Most people remain latently infected for their whole life, often unaware of their condition, and do not constitute a public health problem. However, ~5–15% of them may experience reactivation at some point in time, thus becoming TB cases with transmission potential. It is thought that reactivation actually leads to as many as 80% of the global TB cases, which is particularly true in low-incidence countries. The risk of progression from latent infection to active disease is considerably higher in some populations that therefore requires special attention and targeted interventions. The management of LTBI is now fully recognised as a core component of the End-TB Strategy, as demonstrated by the recent development of specific guidelines by WHO. Among the main objectives of this document is the definition of the so-called 'high-risk groups', i.e. those who are more likely to undergo TB reactivation. People living with HIV and children under 5 years of age who are household or close contacts of a TB case represent the priority target, being the most vulnerable categories in any setting. All such individuals should be systematically put on LTBI treatment whenever active TB is excluded. Other populations should be carefully considered according to the local resources in high- and upper middle-income countries with low TB incidence; they include candidates to tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor treatment, patients with silicosis, transplant recipients and patients requiring haemodialysis, for whom systematic testing and treatment is strongly recommended. In addition to those mentioned above, other at-risk groups may be identified such as migrants from high TB-burden countries, prisoners, healthcare workers, homeless people or injection drug users, who may also benefit from LTBI treatment if feasible. Current diagnostic tests do not allow direct identification of dormant TB microorganisms in a latently infected subject. For this reason, LTBI can only be diagnosed by evaluating the immunological response to in vivo or in vitro stimulation by mycobacterial antigens, which is the underlying principle of the tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assays.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: fruitful or futile? [^114QBWPo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) constitutes part of the TB disease spectrum. The diagnosis and treatment of LTBI is important, as global eradication targets will not be attainable without treating LTBI. These considerations also apply to drug-resistant TB, which threatens to derail control efforts. The World Health Organization has recently recommended that close contacts of index cases of TB, even in TB endemic countries, should be considered for LTBI treatment (even if they are HIV-uninfected or not children). However, the diagnosis of LTBI is challenging. Unlike with active TB, in humans there is no microbiological or histopathological reference standard for LTBI, and one can only infer the potential presence of LTBI using immunodiagnostic tests, which enumerate the magnitude of relatively antigen-specific T-helper cell type 1 effect or T-cell responses. However, it is epidemiologically well-recognized that only a small proportion of individuals with presumed LTBI (∼5–10%) will progress to active TB over a lifetime. Thus, the more important public health question is whether, and how, we can accurately target treatment by identifying individuals who are most likely to progress to active TB. This state is broadly defined as "incipient TB" and is characterized by a lack of TB-related symptoms and appropriate chest radiographic abnormalities at the time of testing, as well as lack of any microbiological evidence of active TB, but a high likelihood of progression to active TB in the short-term, with the potential for perpetuating the transmission cycle. The duration from initial exposure to incipient TB or active disease is variable and will depend on several host, mycobacterial, and environmental factors. Epidemiological data suggest that of those infected, ∼5% will progress to active TB over the course of a 5-year period, with the highest risk being within the first 2 years of exposure. Biomarkers to identify incipient TB has remained one of the "Holy Grails" of TB research.

### NTCA guidelines for respiratory isolation and restrictions to reduce transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis in community settings [^1142Ks4T]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Community exposure duration, masking, and contact precautions note that there is no minimum duration or proximity of exposures that defines a likelihood of transmission, but one set of criteria suggested in prior contact investigation guidelines and algorithms suggests a threshold of 120 hours of exposure per month to stratify transmission risk associated with exposure, and eight hours of exposure in a closed space has also been suggested as a threshold for contact investigations based upon evidence derived from air travel. Overall, lower-risk activities that result in only transient exposures (eg, less than a few [1–3] hours) in well-ventilated indoor spaces for essential activities may be considered as part of midlevel restrictions. Masks (surgical or KN95 or N95 if available) can be used for persons with infectious TB in indoor spaces to reduce aerosol dispersion and transmission risk, and N95 or KN95 respirators offer the best protection. Individuals with infectious TB should avoid contact with individuals with an increased vulnerability to TB disease (including children under age 5 or immunosuppressed populations), and the visitation of these contacts should preferentially take place in outdoor or well-ventilated space with additional risk-mitigation strategies.

### American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America: controlling tuberculosis in the United States [^112FDueh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis — determinants and contact infection rates — person-to-person transmission is determined by characteristics of the source-case, the exposed person, and the environment in which the exposure takes place, and the virulence of the infecting strain might also be a determining factor for transmission. By the time persons with pulmonary tuberculosis come to medical attention, 30 to 40% of persons identified as their close personal contacts have evidence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and because only 30 to 40% of persons with close exposure to a patient with pulmonary TB become infected, the highest rate of infection among contacts follows intense exposure to patients whose sputum smears are positive for acid-fast bacilli.

Basic principles of TB control — United States goal and core strategies focus on preventing transmission and progression from latent infection. "The goal of TB control in the United States is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by TB by (1) preventing transmission of M. tuberculosis… and (2) preventing progression from LTBI to TB disease… " "Four fundamental strategies are used to achieve this goal… as follows: Early and accurate detection, diagnosis, and reporting of TB cases leading to initiation and completion of treatment; Identification of contacts of cases of infectious TB and treatment of those at risk with an effective drug regimen; Identification of other persons with LTBI at risk for progression to TB disease and treatment of those persons with an effective drug regimen". Within these strategies, "A suspected or confirmed case of TB should be reported immediately to the jurisdictional public health agency". "The evaluation of contacts of persons with infectious TB is one of the most productive methods of identifying adults and children with LTBI at high risk for progression to TB disease and persons in the early stages of TB disease", and "Targeted testing is intended to identify persons other than TB contacts who have increased risk for acquiring TB and to offer such persons diagnostic testing for M. tuberculosis infection and treatment, if indicated, to prevent subsequent progression to TB disease".

Considerations for Infection Control

CDC recommends airborne infection isolation (AII) precautions for patients with suspected TB disease of the lungs, airway, or larynx in health-care settings. AII precautions may be discontinued when contagious TB disease is considered unlikely and either 1) another diagnosis is made that explains the clinical syndrome or 2) the patient has three consecutive sputum smears negative for acid-fast bacilli on microscopy. Because of the intermittent presence of TB bacilli in the sputum of patients with TB, three specimens separated in time have been recommended to have a sufficiently high predictive value for excluding contagious disease.

Because NAA testing, including that with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, is significantly more sensitive and specific for the detection of MTBC than microscopy alone, substitution of Xpert MTB/RIF assay results that are negative for MTBC for microscopy results increases the negative predictive value for MTBC. Therefore, in ruling out contagious TB, specimens can be tested by microscopy, NAA, or a combination of the two (Table 2). Three sputum specimens, each collected 8–24 hours apart, with one being an early morning specimen, should be collected to inform decisions regarding the discontinuation of AII precautions for patients with suspected TB in health-care settings. For patients with a diagnosis of TB, decisions regarding discontinuation of AII precautions should be based on microscopy (i.e. three consecutive negative smears) and other clinical criteria.

Identification, Management, and Treatment of Persons with LTBI

Importance of Screening, Testing, and Treatment for LTBI

LTBI is the presence of M. tuberculosis organisms (tubercle bacilli) without signs and symptoms or radiographic or bacteriologic evidence of TB disease. Therefore, persons with LTBI do not experience clinical illness; they are asymptomatic, and their infection is not transmissible. The only evidence of infection might be a reaction to a TST or a positive IGRA test. In persons with LTBI, TB infection can persist for decades, and those with M. tuberculosis infection can remain at risk for progressing to TB disease, especially if the immune system becomes impaired. An estimated 13 million persons have LTBI in the United States.

Since the early 1980s, TB prevention and control in the United States has expanded with treatment of persons with LTBI to prevent TB disease. Approximately 80% of the active TB disease cases in the United States are believed to be caused by reactivation of LTBI. As TB disease rates in the United States decrease, finding and treating persons at high risk for LTBI has become a higher priority and a cornerstone strategy for TB elimination. LTBI treatment is important because it can substantially reduce the risk that persons infected with M. tuberculosis will progress to TB disease. However, LTBI treatment can be associated with adverse events; therefore, the goal of preventive therapy is to treat those for whom prophylaxis for LTBI carries substantially more benefit than potential harm.

United States TB control guideline structure and essential components — the statement provides comprehensive guidelines structured in eight sections, including detailed recommendations for the core elements of TB control: case detection and management, contact investigations, and targeted testing and treatment of LTBI. Guidelines are provided for conducting a systematic, step-by-step contact investigation, and all jurisdictional TB-control programs are urged to develop written policies and procedures on the basis of these guidelines; recommended procedures include conducting surveillance for such activities, and reports should be made to CDC to help plan. A set of five clinical scenarios is presented in which a diagnosis of TB should be undertaken in primary medical practice, and for targeted testing and treatment for LTBI, persons who are readily accessible and have preexisting access to health care services should receive the highest priority.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^112qWMWC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

These updated guidelines were developed by NTCA and CDC. The LTBI treatment guidelines committee members, who are the authors of this report, were nominated on the basis of their expertise in treatment of LTBI. The committee had expertise in epidemiology, domestic and international TB control, clinical trials, and treatment of LTBI in adults and children. A methodologist with expertise in the GRADE approach served as a consultant to the guideline development committee.

Evidence Search

The committee determined that the following clinical question should be addressed in the updated guidelines: "Which regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection have the greatest effectiveness and least toxicity?" The question was written in the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format, and then the outcomes were rated as critical, important, or not important. Comparison of regimen toxicities was limited to hepatotoxicity because this was the only toxicity that could be consistently compared across studies.

A systematic literature review was initiated in December 2017. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and gray literature were searched for studies evaluating the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. Search terms included "latent tuberculosis", "latent TB", "LTBI", " Mycobacterium tuberculosis, " "tuberculosis infection" AND "isoniazid", "rifampin", "rifapentine", or "pyrazinamide". Articles were included if the study design was a randomized controlled trial and outcomes included prevention of TB disease and drug-related hepatotoxicity. Studies that included persons with suspected or confirmed TB disease were excluded from the review.

The initial search located a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis published in August 2017 that examined the effectiveness of LTBI treatment regimens. The study authors were contacted and asked for access to the extracted data. Study characteristics, types of participants, interventions, the outcomes measured, and results were extracted from each study. If the data were amenable to pooling, effects were estimated via meta-analysis. For the meta-analyses, a random effects model was used unless otherwise specified, and effect estimates were reported as odds ratios. All statistical analyses were conducted using the "metafor" package in R, versions 3.4.3. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to conduct a bias assessment. Analyses conducted in 2018 included combined data from the studies in the previous review and articles identified during an updated search for studies published during June 2017–August 2018 (Figure).

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1600 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA 30329, USA 800-INFO TTY: 232–6348 Since TB is an airborne disease that can be transmitted from one person to another, it is important to practice appropriate infection control procedures to protect others from getting TB. This is especially important for health care facilities and other congregate settings such as nursing homes, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, drug treatment centers, and other places that serve clients who are at risk for being infected with M. tuberculosis. All health care facilities need an infection control program. This program should be designed to ensure early and prompt. The minimum respiratory protection a health care worker should wear is a filtering facepiece respirator to prevent the inhalation of airborne droplet nuclei. Patients with infectious TB should wear a surgical mask to prevent expelling droplet nuclei into the air.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) control can be particularly problematic in correctional and detention facilities, in which persons from diverse backgrounds and communities are housed in close proximity for varying periods. This report provides a framework and general guidelines for effective prevention and control of TB in jails, prisons, and other correctional and detention facilities. Recommendations were developed on the basis of published guidelines and a review of the scientific literature. Effective TB-prevention and -control measures in correctional facilities include early identification of persons with TB disease through entry and periodic follow-up screening; successful treatment of TB disease and latent TB infection; appropriate use of airborne precautions (e.g., airborne infection isolation, environmental controls, and respiratory protection); comprehensive discharge planning; and thorough and efficient contact investigation. These measures should be instituted in close collaboration with local or state health department TB-control programs and other key partners. Continuing education of inmates, detainees, and correctional facility staff is necessary to maximize cooperation and participation. To ensure TB-prevention and -control measures are effective, periodic program evaluation should be conducted.

Latent tuberculosis infection — risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (< 2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children < 5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

### Research roadmap for tuberculosis transmission science: where Do we Go from here and how will we know when we' re there? [^1127b9CW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Once Mtb is aerosolized in an indoor environment, multiple infection control interventions that reduce exposure and inhalation ("environmental controls") have been shown to be effective, including natural or mechanical ventilation and upper room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. Reducing crowding in hospital and clinic waiting areas will further limit the effective contact rate between infectious persons and potentially susceptible contacts. Yet, cost of installation, logistics of maintenance, and practical considerations (eg, climate that precludes opening doors and windows) often present barriers to implementation of environmental controls. Innovations are needed that simplify and reduce costs of healthcare facility redesign, with monitoring of airborne infectious particles, alerts when they above a critical level, and direct "cleansing" of shared air.

The determinants behind the probability of aerosol deposition of Mtb in a susceptible host are yet another unknown. There are a number of recent efforts to characterize cough aerosol production and exposure, but there is no current standard for determining whether a particular individual was exposed to Mtb. For close contacts of tuberculosis patients with a negative tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), there is no way to know whether they were indeed "adequately" exposed to Mtb, whether they had successful "early clearance" without mounting a T-cell–mediated adaptive immune response, or whether they are simply anergic with a false-negative TST or IGRA. This inability to characterize and quantify recent exposure, including among animal models, poses a substantial impediment to studies of transmission and transmissibility. Efforts to offset host vulnerability and enhance selective immune responses may prove critical for the design of a tuberculosis vaccine that is capable of preventing infection and not simply diminishing bacterial burden.

### Tuberculosis [^116Mbs1Q]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by organisms of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Although primarily a pulmonary pathogen, M. tuberculosis can cause disease in almost any part of the body. Infection with M. tuberculosis can evolve from containment in the host, in which the bacteria are isolated within granulomas (latent TB infection), to a contagious state, in which the patient will show symptoms that can include cough, fever, night sweats and weight loss. Only active pulmonary TB is contagious. In many low-income and middle-income countries, TB continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and drug-resistant TB is a major concern in many settings. Although several new TB diagnostics have been developed, including rapid molecular tests, there is a need for simpler point-of-care tests. Treatment usually requires a prolonged course of multiple antimicrobials, stimulating efforts to develop shorter drug regimens. Although the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is used worldwide, mainly to prevent life-threatening TB in infants and young children, it has been ineffective in controlling the global TB epidemic. Thus, efforts are underway to develop newer vaccines with improved efficacy. New tools as well as improved programme implementation and financing are necessary to end the global TB epidemic by 2035.

### Duration of exposure among close contacts of patients with infectious tuberculosis and risk of latent tuberculosis infection [^117TYbFW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Predictors of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among close contacts of persons with infectious tuberculosis (TB) are incompletely understood, particularly the number of exposure hours.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled adult patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB and their close contacts at 9 health departments in the United States and Canada. Patients with TB were interviewed and close contacts were interviewed and screened for TB and LTBI during contact investigations.

Results

LTBI was diagnosed in 1390 (46%) of 3040 contacts, including 624 (31%) of 2027 US/Canadian-born and 766 (76%) of 1013 non-US/Canadian-born contacts. In multivariable analysis, age ≥ 5 years, male sex, non-US/Canadian birth, smear-positive index patient, and shared bedroom with an index patient (P < .001 for each), as well as exposure to > 1 index patient (P < .05), were associated with LTBI diagnosis. LTBI prevalence increased with increasing exposure duration, with an incremental prevalence increase of 8.2% per 250 exposure hours (P < .0001). For contacts with < 250 exposure hours, no difference in prevalence was observed per 50 exposure hours (P = 0.63).

Conclusions

Hours of exposure to a patient with infectious TB is an important LTBI predictor, with a possible risk threshold of 250 hours. More exposures, closer exposure proximity, and more extensive index patient disease were additional LTBI predictors.

Definitions — latent tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis disease: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)/TB infection (TBI) is defined as a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by antigens of bacteria in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex without any clinical, radiographic, or microbiologic evidence of disease; people with LTBI/TBI are not contagious and have no signs or symptoms of tuberculosis disease, yet they are at increased risk for developing TB disease and becoming contagious, and diagnosing and treating LTBI/TBI can help prevent progression to TB disease. Tuberculosis disease occurs when a person with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex has clinical signs and/or symptoms, radiographic evidence, or viable mycobacteria recovered from a clinical specimen, and disease can be pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or both. The terms "active" and "latent" are noted as not universally accepted because there is a continuum from infection to disease, particularly in children who often have paucibacillary disease.

Updated Recommendations

Recommendations from the 2005 CDC guidelines that are outside the scope of health care personnel screening, testing, treatment, and education remain unchanged (Table); this includes continuing facility risk assessments for guiding infection control policies and procedures. Here, TB screening is defined as a process that includes a TB risk assessment, symptom evaluation, TB testing for M. tuberculosis infection (by either IGRA or TST) for health care personnel without documented evidence of prior LTBI or TB disease, and additional workup for TB disease for health care personnel with positive test results or symptoms compatible with TB disease. This update does not include recommendations for using an IGRA versus a TST for diagnosing LTBI, which have been published elsewhere.

† All other aspects of the Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-Care Settings, 2005 remain in effect, including facility risk assessments to help guide infection control policies and procedures.

Baseline (preplacement) screening and testing. All U.S. health care personnel should have baseline TB screening, including an individual risk assessment (Box), which is necessary for interpreting any test result. The 2005 guidelines state that baseline test results provide a basis for comparison in the event of a potential or known exposure to M. tuberculosis, facilitate detection and treatment of LTBI or TB disease in health care personnel before placement, and reduce the risk to patients and other health care personnel. The risk assessment and symptom evaluation help guide decisions when interpreting test results. For example, health care personnel with a positive test who are asymptomatic, unlikely to be infected with M. tuberculosis, and at low risk for progression on the basis of their risk assessment should have a second test (either an IGRA or a TST) as recommended in the 2017 TB diagnostic guidelines of the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC. In this example, the health care personnel should be considered infected with M. tuberculosis only if both the first and second tests are positive.

Child and adolescent tuberculosis (TB) — contact investigations and primary prevention: The majority of infants and children who acquire TB disease do so within 3 to 12 months of contracting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and infants and toddlers younger than 3 years are especially prone to rapid progression and severe forms. The cornerstone of TB prevention among children is high-quality, contact investigations of adults with active pulmonary TB, with an average of 50% of childhood household contacts having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or TB disease. A tuberculin skin test might take 2 to 3 months after infection to become positive in an infant or toddler, but the incubation period for severe TB might be only 4 to 6 weeks; failure to give empiric treatment for LTBI to exposed infants and young children with negative tuberculin skin test results, particularly those younger than 3 years, might therefore result in rapid acquisition of disease.

2016 TB National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines imply that contacts of extrapulmonary TB do not require screening for latent TB infection. At our high TB prevalence site, we identified 189 active cases of TB for whom there were 698 close contacts. 29.1% of the contacts of pulmonary TB and 10.7% of the contacts of extrapulmonary TB had active or latent TB infection. This supports screening contacts of extrapulmonary TB at our site and presents a way to access high-risk individuals. We propose to continue to screen the contacts of our patients with extrapulmonary TB and recommend other TB units audit their local results.

Infection Control

TB control programs should serve the medical community as sources of information and consultation regarding infection control practices for TB. During interactions with the medical community, TB control programs should emphasize the need for maintaining a high level of suspicion for TB when evaluating patients who have TB symptoms and also the importance of early diagnosis, isolation, and prompt therapy initiation. The programs should give expert advice or provide referrals to experts for information about infection control measures for different settings (e.g. hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, and drug treatment centers). Guidance for how to use new diagnostic tests for release from airborne isolation in hospitals is now available; use of these techniques is specific to each case and should be in accordance with local TB control requirements.

TB control programs should educate facility staff providing care for TB patients about the need for routine periodic evaluation of infection control practices and might also assist in the evaluation process. Assistance can include providing updated recommendations and regulations to the facility, providing names of experts in infection control, or providing access to personnel involved in programmatic evaluations.

TB increases in certain geographic areas are related to the high risk for TB among immunosuppressed persons who have HIV infection. Transmission of M. tuberculosis to HIV-infected persons is of particular concern because, if coinfected with M. tuberculosis, these persons are at higher risk for the rapid development of TB disease. Program staff should be particularly alert to the need for preventing transmission of M. tuberculosis in settings where HIV-infected persons work or receive care. Administrative controls should be established on the basis of CDC, federal, and state guidelines. This might include surveillance for TB exposure among employees or fit testing of respirators for certain employees.

Tuberculosis contact evaluation — contacts with a negative tuberculin skin test should be retested approximately 8 to 12 weeks after the first test unless the initial test was performed more than 8 weeks after the last exposure. Every 3 months, all contacts with negative skin test results who remain in close contact with an infectious patient should receive a repeat tuberculin skin test, and if symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) disease are present, a chest radiograph. A contact whose repeated test is positive (≥ 5 mm) should receive a chest radiograph; if the radiograph is normal, the contact should be evaluated for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and if it is abnormal, the patient should be evaluated for TB disease or other causes.

Airborne transmission and infection control

Contrary to the widespread belief that previous treatment is a major risk factor for MDR-TB, recent studies suggest that most MDR-TB is transmitted rather than acquired, accounting for 96% of new and 61% of previously treated cases of MDR-TB. Modelling studies estimate that 85% of TB in India in 2032 will be MDR-TB, all due to primary transmission. Healthcare facilities in India have poor airborne infection control systems, with only 10% of healthcare workers wearing N95 masks. This is reflected in the high prevalence of latent and active TB among healthcare workers in India.WGS studies have demonstrated transmission of TB between patients in healthcare facilities in India, suggesting they could serve as sites for spread of DR-TB. Improvements in infection control will reduce the transmission of TB (especially MDR-TB) within healthcare facilities. Identifying transmission networks in the community using traditional and molecular epidemiological methods will be necessary to locate hotspots that require targeted interventions.

Establishment and persistence of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Tuberculosis is a communicable disease and infection is initiated by inhalation of droplet nuclei (1–5 μm in diameter particles) containing M. tuberculosis, expectorated by patients with active pulmonary or laryngeal TB, typically when the patient coughs. Active transmission occurs more frequently in small households and crowded places in countries with a high incidence of TB and the risk of infection is dependant on several factors such as the infectiousness of the source case, the closeness of contact, the bacillary load inhaled and the host's immune status (Figure 1). Molecular epidemiological studies have shown that there are distinct differences in the disease presentation and population demographics in low TB incidence and high TB incidence countries. In several African and Asian countries, the vast majority of mycobacterial infections are caused by M. tuberculosis and incidence rates are highest among young adults, with most cases resulting from recent episodes of infection or reinfection. On the contrary, in low TB incidence countries of Western Europe and North America, a higher proportion of active TB cases occur in older patients or among immigrants from high TB incidence countries. Pulmonary TB accounts for > 85% of active TB cases in high TB incidence countries while extrapulmonary TB is more common in low TB incidence countries, particularly among HIV infected individuals and immigrants originating from TB endemic countries.

Figure 1
Natural progression of events and outcome in an immunocompetent individual following exposure of human subjects (contacts of TB patients) to droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis expectorated by a source case of sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB. Every year, ~50 million people worldwide are infected with M. tuberculosis. Complete elimination of tubercle bacilli is achieved in ~10% individuals only while in ~90% of infected individuals, bacterial growth is stopped but some bacilli survive and persist leading to latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The waning of dormant bacilli in persons with LTBI can be accelerated by therapy with isoniazid for 9 months (denoted by *). The vaccines currently in clinical trials are designed to prevent or delay the reactivation of latent infection in persons with LTBI (denoted by).

Treatment of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Tracing contacts of infectious pulmonary TB cases (sputum smear-positive) for exposure to tubercle bacilli leading to latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and treatment of latently-infected individuals at high risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease has proven extremely effective in the control of TB in the United States and other low TB-burden countries. Treatment of LTBI in infected persons substantially reduces the likelihood of activation of dormant infection and subsequent development of active TB disease (Figure 1). The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines in 2000 for the treatment of LTBI which were also endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Academy of Pediatrics. An update to these guidelines was published in 2005 that also included recommendations for pediatric subjects. The treatment options currently available for LTBI are summarized in Table 2.

In the United States, older adults comprise 22% of cases of tuberculous disease but only 12% of the population. Most cases of tuberculosis (TB) occur in community dwellers, but attack rates are highest among frail residents of long-term-care facilities.

### Revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis [^114DX9SH]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

WHO has pledged to eliminate TB by 2035 through its End TB Strategy. Its staged implementation plan includes "new tools: a vaccine, new drugs, and treatment regimens for treatment of active TB disease and latent TB infection", which again reflects the concern that the large reservoir of people with latent TB infection may stymie efforts to achieve this goal. We hope that the evidence that most TB cases occur within 18–24 months of infection will lead to reconsideration of the current strategy. If focused attention was given to those with active TB disease and their newly infected contacts, TB elimination might be achieved sooner than projected.

Key messages

The current thought is that Mycobacterium tuberculosis frequently establishes a latent infection following which there is a reactivation process that leads to active TB disease, after a long and variable incubation period
Rather, the incubation period of TB is typically several months to two years, and after that, disease is relatively infrequent
There is no evidence for a bimodal distribution of TB that distinguishes primary progressive TB from reactivation TB
Immunoreactivity to TB does not necessarily indicate the presence of live bacteria, as reactivity can persist after infection has been cleared
Classifying two billion people with evidence of immunoreactivity as having latent TB infection may divert fundamental research and public health interventions away from transmissible active TB disease and newly infected people at highest risk of progression to disease

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^113mCPNe]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) screening program requirements for health care workers (HCWs) — the purpose of TB screening is to exclude active TB disease and identify latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); surveillance screening must be done on hire and after known TB exposures (at baseline and 8–12 weeks afterwards); initial screening at hire when changing employers must comprise either "2-step" tuberculosis skin testing (TST) or a single interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA); facilities exceeding minimal risk must perform periodic testing based on current CDC guidelines; TST and IGRAs are approved for TB surveillance testing for LTBI, neither test is approved for the diagnosis of active TB, and IGRAs are more specific in detecting prior exposure to M tuberculosis versus positive tests from prior BCG vaccination or some atypical mycobacteria.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection spectrum and latent tuberculosis infection definitions: Persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have a broad array of presentations, ranging from those with clinical, radiographic, and microbiological evidence of tuberculosis (TB disease) to those who are infected with Mtb but have no clinical evidence of TB disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Individuals with LTBI who have been recently exposed have an increased risk of developing TB, whereas those with remote exposure have less risk over time unless they develop a condition that impairs immunity. Operationally, recent exposure can be defined either epidemiologically (ie, as might occur in the setting of the household of an infectious case or occupational exposure) or immunologically (ie, conversion of a tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay [IGRA] from negative to positive).

### Rifapentine (Priftin) [^1161x1iN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis

PRIFTIN®(rifapentine) is indicated in adults and children 12 years and older for the treatment of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PRIFTIN must always be used in combination with one or more antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs to which the isolate is susceptible [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Limitations of Use

Do not use PRIFTIN monotherapy in either the initial or the continuation phases of active antituberculous treatment.

PRIFTIN should not be used once weekly in the continuation phase regimen in combination with isoniazid (INH) in HIV-infected patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis because of a higher rate of failure and/or relapse with rifampin (RIF)-resistant organisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

PRIFTIN has not been studied as part of the initial phase treatment regimen in HIV-infected patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis.

1.2 Latent Tuberculosis Infection

PRIFTIN is indicated in adults and children 2 years and older for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients at high risk of progression to tuberculosis disease (including those in close contact with active tuberculosis patients, recent conversion to a positive tuberculin skin test, HIV-infected patients, or those with pulmonary fibrosis on radiograph) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Limitations of Use

Active tuberculosis disease should be ruled out before initiating treatment for latent tuberculosis infection.

PRIFTIN must always be used in combination with isoniazid as a 12-week once-weekly regimen for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

PRIFTIN in combination with isoniazid is not recommended for individuals presumed to be exposed to rifamycin-resistant or isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis.

### Tocilizumab (tocilizumab-anoh) [^111SuWn7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with tocilizumab products including Tocilizumab-anoh are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

If a serious infection develops, interrupt Tocilizumab-anoh until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients, except those with COVID-19, should be tested for latent tuberculosis before Tocilizumab-anoh use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to Tocilizumab-anoh use.
Invasive fungal infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, and pneumocystis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

The risks and benefits of treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections have occurred in patients receiving tocilizumab products. (5.1)
If a serious infection develops, interrupt Tocilizumab-anoh until the infection is controlled. (5.1)
Perform test for latent TB (except patients with COVID-19); if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Tocilizumab-anoh. (5.1)
Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. (5.1)

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^114opoTs]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221–47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States. The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g., with low-quality evidence). These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93-e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens. In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6–9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.

### Clinical overview of latent tuberculosis infection… [^112VCkno]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- People with latent TB infection are infected with TB bacteria, but they do not have TB disease.
- However, if these bacteria become active and multiply, latent TB infection can develop into TB disease.
- Treating people with latent TB infection substantially reduces the risk that latent TB infection will progress to TB disease. People with latent TB infection:

- Have a small number of TB bacteria in their body that are alive but inactive Cannotspread TB bacteria to others
- Do notfeel sick, but may become sick if the bacteria in their bodies become active
- Usually have a positiveTB blood test or TB skin test results indicating TB infection
- Have typically normalchest radiographs
- Have negativesputum smears and cultures
- Should consider treatment for latent TB infection to prevent TB disease
- Do notrequire respiratory isolation.

Eliminating TB in the United States requires testing and treatment of latent TB infection CDC estimates that up to 13 million people in the United States have latent TB infection. While not everyone with latent TB infection will develop TB disease, without treatment about 5%–10% of infected people will develop TB disease over their lifetimes. People with latent TB infection are at risk for TB disease. Finding and treating people with latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease in the United States. Treatment for latent TB infection is effective for preventing TB disease. For Everyone: About Inactive Tuberculosis.
- Lymph nodes,
- Lungs,
- Kidneys,
- Brain, and
- Bone. Within 2 to 8 weeks, special immune cells called macrophages ingest and surround the tubercle bacilli. The cells form a barrier shell called a granuloma that keeps the bacilli contained and under control. This condition is known as latent TB infection.

How it spreads People with latent TB infection cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However, if these bacteria become active and multiply, latent TB infection can develop into TB disease. Once active, TB can be spread from person to person through the air. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens over 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy. Short-course latent TB infection treatments are effective, safe, and have higher completion rates than treatment regimens.

### Nosocomial tuberculosis in India [^115aFtAY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Implementing many of the recommended engineering controls is not feasible in most healthcare facilities because of the high costs of such measures (e.g. negative-pressure isolation rooms). However, separation or segregation of smear-positive TB patients in private or semiprivate rooms or wards with simple mechanical exhaust ventilation (e.g. window fans) could be feasible in some settings, particularly in the private sector and well-funded public hospitals. These measures have been shown to be useful in terminating an outbreak of nosocomial tuberculosis. This intervention is particularly necessary at centers that manage patients with MDRTB; at such centers, patients with infectious TB must not be admitted to the same wards as patients with HIV infection.

Personal respiratory protection measures (e.g. N95 respirators) are probably not feasible because of the high cost. Respirators may be relatively costly to implement and of limited effectiveness in high-incidence, resource-limited settings. The use of respirators may have a role in hospitals that manage MDRTB, but more successful and affordable measures include improving natural ventilation through open windows and sunlight. The efficacy of UV germicidal lights is being evaluated in other low-income countries, and results of such studies are needed to determine their value in reducing nosocomial transmission. In developing TB infection control programs, crucial issues are educating healthcare workers about nosocomial TB and measures that can help prevent such transmission, educating patients on cough procedures, and using simple surgical masks on patients with infectious TB (especially if they are not segregated) who are coughing.

Periodic testing of healthcare workers for latent TB and treating those with latent infections who are at high risk for progression to active TB might be feasible in selected settings, particularly among trainees and junior staff (who seem to be disproportionately affected). Screening for latent TB infection with newer, blood-based IGRAs may not be feasible in most settings at this time. Although IGRAs have some advantages over TST, including increased specificity and the ability to discriminate between infection with M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, they have limited applicability in many resource-limited settings because of the high costs and the need for laboratory infrastructure. However, new data suggest that IGRAs hold promise for serial testing of healthcare workers and can overcome some of the limitations of serial tuberculin testing. A recent study from India showed that in a setting with intensive nosocomial exposure, healthcare workers had strong interferon-γ responses that persistently stayed elevated even after treatment for latent infection. Persistence of infection or reexposure might account for this phenomenon.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^113v2fGP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Other Considerations

Following are several considerations for the use of these guidelines. First, the committee did not include cost-effectiveness in evaluating the evidence; recommendations were based on evaluating effectiveness and toxicity of the regimens. Second, the committee did not evaluate evidence regarding how to implement these regimens programmatically (e.g. who to test and treat and management of side effects). Third, these guidelines focus on treatment regimens for persons with LTBI living in countries with low TB disease incidence. These guidelines do not address other empiric TB prevention strategies (e.g. 1 month of isoniazid plus rifapentine among HIV-positive persons living in settings with a high TB incidence regardless of results from the TST or an interferon-gamma release assay). Finally, shorter regimens should not be used for patients in whom rifamycins are contraindicated, including those taking medications with significant drug-drug interactions with rifamycins.

### Simple estimates for local prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection, United States, 2011–2015 [^111KWMSB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an asymptomatic equilibrium between the immune response of the host and the infectious process. Although not infectious, LTBI can be activated years later as infectious tuberculosis (TB), which is why diagnosing and treating LTBI in high-risk populations is a key component of the World Health Organization End TB Strategy.

Most countries have established systems for surveillance of active TB. Public health interventions to control TB include timely detection and treatment of active cases and prompt investigations of persons with recent contact with someone who has infectious TB. However, few jurisdictions have estimates of local LTBI prevalence. Having such estimates could help direct TB prevention efforts for persons with the highest risk for infection, highest risk for progression to TB, and greatest benefit from treatment to prevent progression (2‒4). We describe a simple method that uses genotyping results from active TB cases to derive a population estimate of untreated LTBI prevalence for any jurisdiction.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^116hhuQV]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Despite the fact that control and management of TB in many low TB incidence countries is centered around the identification and subsequent treatment of individuals latently infected with M. tuberculosis (LTBI), actual identification of LTBI in human subjects is presently not feasible. The current diagnostic tests (such as the tuberculin skin test or more recently developed T cell-based assays) are only designed to measure the adaptive immune response of the host exposed to M. tuberculosis, typically six to eight weeks after exposure to the bacilli.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) measures cell-mediated immunity in the form of a DTH response to a complex cocktail of > 200 M. tuberculosis antigens, known as purified protein derivative (PPD) and the test result is usually read as induration (in mm) recorded 48 to 72 hours after intradermal injection of PPD. The criteria for a positive TST vary considerably and depend on the inoculum and type of PPD preparation used in the test. In the United States, 5 tuberculin units (TUs) are generally used and the induration of ≥ 5 mm in HIV-seropositive or organ transplant recipient or in a person in contact with a known case of active TB is considered as positive. However, in foreign-born persons originating from high TB incidence countries or persons at higher risk of exposure to M. tuberculosis (such as health care professionals), induration of ≥ 10 mm is regarded as positive TST. In most European countries, 2 TUs are used and the induration of ≥ 10 mm in immunocompetent adults is considered as positive. In the United Kingdom, 10 TUs are used and the induration of 5–15 mm in BCG unvaccinated and ≥ 15 mm in BCG vaccinated immunocompetent adults is considered as positive. Skin test reaction over 20 mm is usually due to active disease; however, a negative skin test in an active TB patient may also result from anergy or incorrect administration of the test or improper storage of the test reagents, thus compromising the sensitivity of the test. Skin testing is most suitable for detecting M. tuberculosis infection in developing countries where > 80% of the global TB cases occur, as it does not require extensive laboratory facilities and health care workers are already familiar with administering and reading skin tests. However, TST has several inherent problems as the antigens present in PPD are also present in the vaccine strain M. bovis BCG and several environmental mycobacteria. Hence, TST has lower specificity as the test can not differentiate between infection with M. tuberculosis, prior vaccination with M. bovis BCG or sensitization with environmental mycobacteria. Furthermore, sensitivity of TST is limited in immunocompromised individuals due to anergy. These factors have compromised the sensitivity and specificity of tuberculin skin test for the diagnosis of LTBI.

Foreign-born persons and detection/reporting — Once predominantly affecting U.S.-born persons, tuberculosis (TB) now affects a comparable number of foreign-born persons who reside in the United States, although such persons make up only 11% of the U.S. population, and during 1993–2003 incidence among foreign-born persons changed little; to limit transmission, new cases of infectious TB should be diagnosed and reported as early as possible, but delays in case detection and reporting continue to occur due to medical and patient factors, and only half of at-risk contacts complete a course of treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI).

### Transmission of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis and the critical importance of airborne infection control in the era of HIV infection and highly active antiretroviral therapy rollouts [^112MSpBq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Comprehensive and successful tuberculosis (TB) care and treatment must incorporate effective airborne infection-control strategies. This is particularly and critically important for health care workers and all persons with or at risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Past and current outbreaks and epidemics of drug-susceptible, multidrug-resistant, and extensively drug-resistant TB have been fueled by HIV infection, with high rates of morbidity and mortality and linked to the absence or limited application of airborne infection-control strategies in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings. Airborne infection-control strategies are available — grouped into administrative, environmental, and personal protection categories — and have been shown to be associated with decreases in nosocomial transmission of TB; their efficacy has not been fully demonstrated, and their implementation is extremely limited, particularly in resource-limited settings. New research and resources are required to fully realize the potential benefits of infection control in the era of TB and HIV epidemics.

### Previously treated latent tuberculosis infection is associated with less severe acute COVID-19: a cohort study [^11377Y5o]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is estimated to infect around 25% of the world's population, cause 10.8 million cases of TB and 1.3 million deaths per year. Since its emergence in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 777 million confirmed cases and 7.09 million deaths.

The COVID-19 pandemic reversed recent improvements in TB control, resulting in an 18% reduction in TB case notifications and 20% fall in patients receiving treatment. It has been estimated that there were almost 7000 excess deaths from TB in the WHO European Region between 2020–2022 of the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic on Mtb transmission remains controversial. The use of face masks, social distancing and restrictions in physical mobility may have reduced transmission and decreased TB notification. In contrast, the increases in global and regional TB incidence and mortality seen shortly after notifications declined could have been due to increased transmission and reduced access to care. However, beyond the impact on TB control programmes, little is understood about the interaction between Mtb and SARS-CoV-2, despite their potential for co-infection and crosstalk.

There are conflicting reports on the impact of active TB disease (ATB, defined as a pathological state of Mtb infection which results in symptomatic disease) and COVID-19 co-infection on clinical outcomes. The interaction between latent TB infection (LTBI, defined as evidence of immune sensitisation to Mtb antigens in the absence of features of symptomatic disease) and COVID-19 has been much less studied, but some evidence suggests immunomodulation between pathogens. The ability of natural mycobacterial infection to induce trained immunity is unknown and given the global incidence of these pathogens, a better understanding of the interplay between Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 is important. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of ATB and LTBI on the incidence of severe COVID-19 (defined as individuals requiring hospital admission) in a large cohort of individuals in a setting of low TB endemicity.

### Tuberculosis screening, testing, and treatment of U.S. health care personnel: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2019 [^112hwpC1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Serial screening and testing for health care personnel without LTBI. In the absence of known exposure or evidence of ongoing TB transmission, U.S. health care personnel (as identified in the 2005 guidelines) without LTBI should not undergo routine serial TB screening or testing at any interval after baseline (e.g. annually). Health care facilities might consider using serial TB screening of certain groups who might be at increased occupational risk for TB exposure (e.g. pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or in certain settings if transmission has occurred in the past (e.g. emergency departments). Such determinations should be individualized on the basis of factors that might include the number of patients with infectious pulmonary TB who are examined in these areas, whether delays in initiating airborne isolation occurred, or whether prior annual testing has revealed ongoing transmission. Consultation with the local or state health department is encouraged to assist in making these decisions.

Health care personnel might have risks for TB exposure that are not related to their work in the United States, or they might have risks for TB progression after baseline testing that necessitate special consideration. If these risks are unrecognized, these health care personnel might experience TB disease and transmit TB to patients, coworkers, or other contacts. Therefore, health care facilities should educate all health care personnel annually about TB, including risk factors, signs, and symptoms; facilities also should encourage health care personnel to discuss any potential occupational or nonoccupational TB exposure with their primary care provider and occupational health clinician. The decision to perform TB testing after baseline should be based on the person's risk for TB exposure at work or elsewhere since that person's last test.

Evaluation and treatment of health care personnel with positive test results. Health care personnel with a newly positive test result (with confirmation for those persons at low risk as described previously) should undergo a symptom evaluation and chest radiograph to assess for TB disease. Additional workup might be indicated on the basis of those results. Health care personnel with a prior positive TB test and documented normal chest radiograph do not require a repeat radiograph unless they are symptomatic or starting LTBI treatment. The local public health department should be notified immediately if TB disease is suspected.

Written TB-control plan — policies and procedures should reflect national and local standards of care and should offer guidance in the management of TB disease and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). A written TB-control plan that is updated regularly should be distributed widely, assign specific roles and responsibilities, define essential communication pathways among providers, laboratories, and the public health system, and assign sufficient resources, including a responsible case manager for each suspected and verified case of TB. The plan should include expert consultation and oversight, provide special guidance to laboratories, assist local authorities with contact or outbreak investigations and directly observed therapy (DOT), and provide culturally appropriate information to the community. Systems to minimize or eliminate financial and cultural barriers should be integral, and persons with TB and those at highest risk with TB infection should receive culturally appropriate education and clinical services, including treatment, with no consideration for ability to pay. The plan should be consistent with current legal statutes related to TB control, and relevant laws and regulations should be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to ensure consistency with currently recommended clinical and public health practice.

### Evidence for the use of triage, respiratory isolation, and effective treatment to reduce the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in healthcare settings: a systematic review [^115mrAwE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This review found 25 studies implementing triage, isolation, or effective treatment, and measuring the incidence of LTBI or TB disease or both. Overall, packages of IPC measures appeared to reduce MTB transmission, but studies were of low quality and evidence for the effectiveness of individual or combined measures was indirect and of limited utility; heterogeneity of the data prevented meta-analysis. More data are needed from high-burden, lower-income, primary care settings. Harmonization of study designs and reporting frameworks will allow for more formal data syntheses, creating a better platform for policy making. The development of specific guidance around conducting and reporting studies to determine the efficacy of TB IPC measures should be prioritized by governing and stakeholder bodies.

### Evidence for the use of triage, respiratory isolation, and effective treatment to reduce the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in healthcare settings: a systematic review [^111GuEW3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The review protocol was registered on 12 February 2018 on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (ref. CRD42018085226). Countries were classified as high or low TB burden based on WHO lists published in 2016.

Population, Interventions, Comparators, and Outcomes

Populations of interest were HCWs and non-HCWs working in/attending healthcare settings with applied intervention/s. Interventions of interest, specified by the WHO GDG, were (1) triage based on signs, symptoms, or diagnosis of TB; (2) respiratory isolation (or spatial separation); and (3) effective treatment of TB based on bacteriologic susceptibility. WHO commissioned separate reviews to examine the use of environmental and personal protective measures. Comparators used were HCWs and non-HCWs working in/attending healthcare settings with no or different intervention/s. Outcomes of interest were differences in latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or TB disease incidence/prevalence or measures of relative difference in incidence/prevalence (Appendix 1).

Search Strategy, Terms, and Sources

Search strategies were constructed and run by an experienced professional librarian (final search 30 November 2017). Details of search terms and sources are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Selection of Studies and Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Sifting (using criteria in Table 1) and data extraction were conducted in duplicate by 2 reviewers, with unresolved disagreements resolved by a third, independent reviewer, who also checked included articles. Citation tracking was conducted in Web of Science and/or Scopus® (details in Appendix 1). Systematic reviews meeting the inclusion criteria were used to find additional articles describing primary research and were not themselves included in the analysis.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Used During Sifting Process

Data Management and Assessment of Risk of Bias

Data management procedures are described in Appendix 1. Bias assessments were conducted at study level (using the Cochrane tool for experimental and prospective cohort studies and Downs & Black for other observational studies) and at outcome level for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE; using scales for before/after studies and cross-sectional studies [adapted Newcastle-Ottawa]).

### Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a high school and school-based supervision of an isoniazid-rifapentine regimen for preventing tuberculosis-Colorado, 2011–2012 [^113BwFUj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

The Colorado experience with the weekly 12-dose isoniazid-rifapentine regimen is one of the earliest reported after the controlled clinical trials. The regimen shows promise for congregate settings, where treatment is convenient for the patients and efficient for the health department. Adverse events in this report resembled those in the treatment trials and limited or changed treatment for three of 65 patients. CDC is collaborating with health departments and institutions nationwide in collecting data on this regimen in routine usage.

What is already known on this topic?

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by a contagious airborne bacterium, can be widely transmitted in congregate settings. Tracing contacts and treating new infections are complex, time-intensive, interventions in congregate settings, and completion of treatment for preventing TB is historically 70% or less. An investigative approach starting with contacts who had the most exposure, with interim analyses of findings, clarifies the need for including contacts with less exposure. In jurisdictions with low TB incidence, TB control programs might not have sufficient local resources to respond to extensive transmission.

What is added by this report?

Screening at a school of 1,249 (90.4%) contacts of a student with TB found one person with pulmonary TB disease and 162 with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI), of whom 159 started LTBI treatment regimens for preventing progression to TB disease and 153 completed a regimen. A state emergency response plan pulled together dozens of health professionals, who devoted hundreds of hours to testing persons who were exposed to TB and providing care for those with TB disease and LTBI.

What are the implications for public health practice?

TB control programs and other public health agencies should be aware that investigating TB in a school can outstrip the response capabilities of local agencies and require large-scale mobilization with state and county leadership. Public health agencies should have a plan for keeping the public informed and educated about TB and apportion the necessary resources to meet the acute needs until they are resolved.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^1169aUm4]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) risk and control measures in medical centers — although the incidence of active tuberculosis (TB) has fallen steadily in the US over the past 2 decades, exposure is an ongoing risk for health care workers (HCWs), and an increasing percentage of TB cases result from reactivation of disease in foreign-born persons, with other significant risk factors including HIV and other immune-compromising conditions, incarceration, and homelessness. Health care institutions should maintain TB control programs addressing early identification, early isolation, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), HCW TB screening, and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) among HCWs to decrease the risk of transmission and infection. TB transmission occurs via inhalation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis droplet nuclei produced by coughing, other exhalations, or disruption of surgical, pathologic, or microbiologic specimens, and administrative policies should guide HCWs to have a high index of suspicion and to initiate airborne isolation as early as possible with the goal of maintaining engineering controls until TB infection is ruled out, and for the duration of infectious potential if TB is ruled in. Engineering controls can include negative pressure rooms with adequate air exchanges, appropriate venting of contaminated air, high-efficiency particulate air filter units, and germicidal irradiation (where available), and in ambulatory settings and during transport, when these resources are limited, patients with suspected TB should be temporarily masked to prevent transmission.

### Relevance of latent TB infection in areas of high TB prevalence [^115hkp81]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

About one-third of the world population has latent TB infection (LTBI), the majority of which is distributed in 22 high-burden countries. Early diagnosis and treatment of active TB remains the top priority in resource-poor countries with high TB prevalence. Notwithstanding, because LTBI contributes significantly to the pool of active TB cases later on, its diagnosis and treatment is essential, especially in high-risk groups. The lack of a gold standard and several limitations of currently available tools, namely the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assays, are major constraints for LTBI diagnosis. In areas with high TB prevalence, interferon-γ release assays have not shown superiority over the conventional tuberculin skin test and are yet to be systematically studied. Decisions regarding LTBI treatment with isoniazid preventive therapy should be made, keeping in mind the high prevalence of isoniazid resistance in these settings. Although efforts to shorten the LTBI treatment duration are encouraging, most trials have focused on adherence and toxicity. Future trials on short-duration regimens in high-burden settings should address drug efficacy issues as well. LTBI management, therefore, should comprise a targeted screening approach and individualization of LTBI treatment protocols. In addition, efforts should focus on airborne infection control measures in high-burden countries. A high prevalence of drug-resistant TB, the HIV epidemic, and delays in the diagnosis of active TB cases are other major concerns in areas of high TB prevalence. There is ample space for further research in these countries, whose outcomes may strengthen future national guidelines.

Tuberculosis infection control — administrative controls and HCW measures (Box 7) — state that administrative controls, designed to ensure the prompt recognition, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with infectious TB, are the most important elements of an infection-control program (AII), and that a high index of suspicion for TB should be maintained by health care providers with airborne-infection isolation implemented as soon as TB is suspected in emergency care, hospital evaluation, or clinic settings (AIII). When indicated, standard therapy for TB should be promptly initiated and the diagnosis confirmed or excluded as soon as possible (AII), surveillance should ensure airborne-infection isolation rooms function properly and a risk assessment should determine the number of such rooms needed (AIII), and institutions not providing TB care should have a plan for isolation and prompt transfer of suspected patients (AIII). Patients with infectious TB should be discharged only when arrangements prevent contact with susceptible individuals (AIII), health care facilities should cooperate with public health agencies to ensure outpatient management so that treatment is continued until a complete course of curative therapy has been administered (AIII), all health care workers (HCWs) should undergo baseline testing for latent TB infection with subsequent testing based on risk (AII), HCWs with latent TB infection should be encouraged to start and complete treatment when indicated with surveillance and analysis of serial testing results conducted (AII), and employees should regularly receive education on TB (BIII).

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^116rEKeE]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221–47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States.

The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g. with low-quality evidence).

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93–e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens.

In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6–9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.

### Elephant-to-human transmission of tuberculosis, 2009 [^115aqg78]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Considerable effort has gone toward developing methods for early and reliable diagnosis of latent M. tuberculosis infection among elephants. TST is unreliable, but serum antibody tests appear promising. Although serologic tests can detect infection with M. tuberculosis years earlier than trunk-wash cultures, negative serologic results cannot exclude the possibility of infection. In February 2010, USDA added serologic testing (ElephantTB STAT PAK Kit; Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc. Medford, NY, USA) to its annual trunk-wash culture requirement for all elephants.

Knowledge gaps exist about the timing between elephant exposure, seroconversion, latent infection, active disease, and shedding. To improve medical management of elephants and to reduce the risk for transmission to other animals and humans, a better understanding of M. tuberculosis infection among elephants is crucial. Gaps also exist in knowledge regarding treatment and cure of elephants with M. tuberculosis infection. Although antituberculous medications used to treat humans are thought to be effective for treating active TB in elephants, little evidence is available to guide decisions regarding medication choice, dosage, length of treatment, or assessment for cure. Also unclear is whether treatment of elephants with M. tuberculosis infection successfully prevents progression to active TB disease.

Our findings highlight the effects of gaps in scientific knowledge and provide new information on potential risk factors for zoonotic transmission of M. tuberculosis. First, in this outbreak the inability to accurately and expeditiously detect M. tuberculosis infection and disease in elephants contributed to unrecognized, and therefore uncontrolled, risk. Improved methods for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in elephants are needed. Second, infection control practices were insufficient to protect employees, creating an argument for detailed evidence-based guidelines and a more comprehensive approach to implementation. Third, employees were largely unaware of the risk for zoonotic M. tuberculosis transmission and the need to use adequate respiratory protection. Because risk cannot be eliminated, a strong occupational health and training program is needed for employees who work in facilities that house elephants potentially exposed to M. tuberculosis. Finally, our study suggests that employees without close contact with elephant L were infected through indirect transmission of M. tuberculosis aerosolized during routine barn maintenance (i.e. pressure washing or sweeping waste) or suspended in shared air. Reasonable efforts to reduce aerosol-generating practices and to limit aerosol spread in this unique environment should be considered.

### Recent advances in testing for latent TB [^114FyxKQ]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

After more than a century of relying on skin testing for the diagnosis of latent TB infection, clinicians now have access to blood-based diagnostics in the form of interferon γ release assays (IGRAs). These tests are generally associated with higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of latent TB infection. This article reviews the indications for testing and treatment of latent TB infection in the overall context of a TB control program and describes how IGRAs might be used in specific clinical settings and populations, including people having close contact with an active case of TB, the foreign born, and health-care workers.

Key points
- People with latent TB infection are infected with TB bacteria, but they do not have TB disease.
- However, if these bacteria become active and multiply, latent TB infection can develop into TB disease.
- Treating people with latent TB infection substantially reduces the risk that latent TB infection will progress to TB disease. People with latent TB infection:

- Have a small number of TB bacteria in their body that are alive but inactive Cannotspread TB bacteria to others
- Do notfeel sick, but may become sick if the bacteria in their bodies become active
- Usually have a positiveTB blood test or TB skin test results indicating TB infection
- Have typically normalchest radiographs
- Have negativesputum smears and cultures
- Should consider treatment for latent TB infection to prevent TB disease
- Do notrequire respiratory isolation. People with latent TB infection are at risk for TB disease.

Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U. S. TB cases. Finding and treating people with latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease in the United States. Treatment for latent TB infection is effective for preventing TB disease. For Everyone: About Inactive Tuberculosis.
- Lymph nodes,
- Lungs,
- Kidneys,
- Brain, and
- Bone. Within 2 to 8 weeks, special immune cells called macrophages ingest and surround the tubercle bacilli. The cells form a barrier shell called a granuloma that keeps the bacilli contained and under control. This condition is known as latent TB infection. How it spreads People with latent TB infection cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However, if these bacteria become active and multiply, latent TB infection can develop into TB disease. Once active, TB can be spread from person to person through the air.

Treatment and recovery People with latent TB infection should be treated to prevent the development of TB disease. Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U. S. TB disease cases. Treating latent TB infection is 90% effective in preventing the development of TB disease. There are several standard treatment regimens for the treatment of latent TB infection. Regimens use the drugs isoniazid, rifapentine, and/or rifampin.

Tuberculosis

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by infection of the lungs and other organ systems with Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. TB is transmitted by small airborne respiratory droplets that may remain suspended in the air and travel long distances. It usually spreads only through air and not by contact with surfaces or objects.

Individuals with active TB should be considered contagious until they are treated with antituberculosis medications. They will receive follow-up testing to prove that they are no longer contagious. Those who are most at risk of getting TB have shared the same air space for a prolonged period in an enclosed environment with a person who has an active TB infection.

A person can have latent TB (LTBI) after infection with M. tuberculosis. This occurs when the bacteria remain in the body but do not cause disease. A person with LTBI and no symptoms is not contagious. Sometimes the bacteria cause active disease in a person with untreated LTBI. This can occur at any time after their infection, but most commonly it happens 1–6 months following the infection. It is characterized by fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, and cough. There is no vaccine available in the United States to prevent TB infection.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with active tuberculosis from entry to the family-centered residential facility until they have written medical clearance from the treating licensed clinician or local public health department that they are considered non-infectious. Verbal medical clearance by direct telephone consultation with a public health official is also acceptable.
Allow individuals with LTBI infection to enter the facility.
Restrict all family members who were exposed to a person with active TB from entering the facility until they have written medical clearance from the treating licensed clinician or the local public health department that they are considered non-infectious. Verbal medical clearance by direct telephone consultation with a health department official is also acceptable.
Ask any guest with a new diagnosis of active TB and their family members to leave the facility immediately. Require written medical clearance for readmission to the facility per the instructions above. Based upon consultation with the local public health department, the program manager may need to identify and notify all exposed guests and instruct them to seek medical attention.

### Evidence for the use of triage, respiratory isolation, and effective treatment to reduce the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in healthcare settings: a systematic review [^1147zyVJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Incidence of LTBI or TB disease in HCWs are useful ways to estimate MTB transmission from patients in health care settings. Transmission between patients and from HCWs to patients does, of course, occur, although this was measured by only 2 studies, both in low TB burden, high-income countries. Choice of at-risk population, outcomes, and outcome measurement are critical when studying MTB transmission, but can also make study design more complex. In high TB burden countries, a high proportion of HCWs already have LTBI, limiting the size of the at-risk population. Using TST to measure LTBI incidence (as in several of the included studies) can also be problematic, as reactions can vary based on host factors. The development of TB disease, though easier to measure, is also dependent on a number of interconnected host factors and, in the absence of complementary molecular epidemiological data, is more difficult to reliably attribute to a congregate setting transmission event. More detailed descriptions of at-risk HCW populations would allow for better extrapolation of findings to other key populations, particularly HIV-positive individuals, and provide better guidance on how to prevent TB in HCWs. As discussed by Harries et al, robust occupational health programs are critical to the well-being of frontline HCWs; embedding TB IPC studies within existing occupational health frameworks may allow for better reporting of individual HCW risk profiles and improve long-term fidelity to interventions.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117V6iDj]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Definitions of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active tuberculosis: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), latent tuberculosis infection or LTBI is an infection with M tuberculosis in which the bacteria are alive but contained by the immune system, persons with LTBI have no apparent symptoms, do not feel sick, cannot spread tuberculosis to others, and usually have a positive tuberculin skin test result or positive tuberculosis blood test reaction, and persons with LTBI may develop tuberculosis disease if they do not receive treatment for LTBI. Active tuberculosis or tuberculosis disease is an illness in which tuberculosis bacteria are multiplying and attacking a part of the body, usually the lungs; tuberculosis disease may be symptomatic (including weakness, weight loss, fever, no appetite, chills, sweating at night, bad cough, pain in the chest, or coughing up blood), and a person with tuberculosis disease may be infectious and spread tuberculosis bacteria to others.

HIV coinfection and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) — contact investigation, testing, and treatment — require targeted approaches. HIV-coinfected patients are clearly capable of transmitting Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their contacts have comparable rates of LTBI; offering HIV counseling and testing to all contacts has been recommended but would be resource-intensive, and while prevalence of HIV among contacts of HIV-infected persons is high, it is negligible among contacts of persons with TB without HIV infection or with undetermined status. HIV coinfection is the most important known risk factor for persons with LTBI acquiring active TB, and treatment of LTBI is effective in reducing progression to TB disease, so all possible efforts should be made to ensure HIV-infected persons are tested for M. tuberculosis infection and complete treatment if latent infection is found. Some knowledge of HIV status in LTBI evaluation is desirable for interpreting tuberculin skin test results — e.g., ≥ 5 mm of induration is considered a positive test among persons with HIV infection — and for counseling; the role of QFT-G for testing persons with HIV infection for LTBI has not been determined. According to current guidelines, persons evaluated for LTBI should be counseled and tested for HIV infection by using ELISA with Western blot confirmation when appropriate, and the decision to offer an ELISA should be based on clinical judgment and knowledge of the risk profile.

Conclusion

For patients without drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions, short-course (3–4 months) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over the longer-course (6–9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt these guidelines for individual clinical circumstances. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.

### Tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection in close contacts of people with pulmonary tuberculosis in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tVZzA]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Investigation of people exposed to cases of infectious tuberculosis (contact investigation) is key to tuberculosis control in countries with low tuberculosis incidence. However, in countries in which the incidence of tuberculosis is high, contact investigation is not commonly done. Increasing concerns about the failure to meet case-detection targets and about the spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis have prompted a reassessment of the potential benefits of contact investigation. We did a systematic review to determine the yield of household contact investigation. The yield for all tuberculosis (bacteriologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed) was 4.5% (95% CI 4.3–4.8, I(2) = 95.5%) of contacts investigated; for cases with bacteriological confirmation the yield was 2.3% (95% CI 2.1–2.5, I(2) = 96.6%). Latent tuberculosis infection was found in 51.4% (95% CI 50.6–52.2, I(2) = 99.4%) of contacts investigated. The substantial heterogeneity in all analyses indicated high variability among studies that was not accounted for by subgroup analyses. These results suggest that contact investigation merits serious consideration as a means to improve early case detection and decrease transmission of M tuberculosis in high-incidence areas.

Evidence is limited for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures reducing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) transmission in health facilities. This systematic review, 1 of 7 commissioned by the World Health Organization to inform the 2019 update of global tuberculosis (TB) IPC guidelines, asked: do triage and/or isolation and/or effective treatment of TB disease reduce MTB transmission in healthcare settings? Of 25 included articles, 19 reported latent TB infection (LTBI) incidence in healthcare workers (HCWs; absolute risk reductions 1%-21%); 5 reported TB disease incidence in HCWs (no/slight [high TB burden] or moderate [low burden] reduction) and 2 in human immunodeficiency virus-positive in-patients (6%-29% reduction). In total, 23/25 studies implemented multiple IPC measures; effects of individual measures could not be disaggregated. Packages of IPC measures appeared to reduce MTB transmission, but evidence for effectiveness of triage, isolation, or effective treatment, alone or in combination, was indirect and low quality. Harmonizing study designs and reporting frameworks will permit formal data syntheses and facilitate policy making.
