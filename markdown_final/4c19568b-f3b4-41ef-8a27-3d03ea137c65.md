Neonatal absence syndrome

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)/Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS), covering definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, management, outcomes, controversies, and research gaps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and terminology. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and contributing factors. Next, I will review epidemiology and burden. After that, I need to check diagnostic criteria, tools, and their limitations. Then, I will examine nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management strategies, including emerging models. I should also review discharge readiness and follow-up, and finally appraise long-term outcomes, controversies, and key research gaps before summarizing practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and terminology so I don't conflate entities. NAS describes withdrawal after prenatal exposure to multiple substances, whereas NOWS specifically refers to opioid-related withdrawal in neonates; I initially almost treated these as interchangeable, but I should correct that to maintain diagnostic precision in clinical and policy contexts [^114FeP3n] [^115AJfFS]. Wait, let me verify that guideline language explicitly distinguishes them; yes, the AAP emphasizes NOWS as the opioid-specific subset within the broader NAS construct, and both are typically postnatal withdrawal syndromes with multisystem features, not prenatal toxicity syndromes [^115AJfFS] [^114FeP3n].

> I need to ensure I articulate the pathophysiology accurately. NAS/NOWS arises when chronic placental opioid transfer abruptly ceases at birth, leading to a predictable rebound hyperirritability across CNS, autonomic, GI, and respiratory systems; genetics and co-exposures modulate severity, though mechanisms remain incompletely defined [^114FeP3n] [^117DNdrv]. Hold on, I should verify that clinical severity reflects receptor-level withdrawal physiology plus developmental and environmental modifiers; current evidence supports both neurobiologic susceptibility and modifiable perinatal factors influencing expression [^114FeP3n] [^117DNdrv].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and burden, and I need to check that I'm using contemporary figures. The incidence of NAS in the U.S. increased from roughly 1.2 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 7.3 per 1,000 in 2017, with substantial regional variability and high Medicaid coverage of costs, underscoring a major public health burden [^11683Va3] [^112TYS5R]. I should double-check that these estimates align with CDC summaries; yes, CDC surveillance and peer-reviewed analyses converge on a several-fold rise and persistent geographic heterogeneity, with hospital charges and lengths of stay placing substantial strain on systems [^11683Va3] [^1128sfTF].

> Now, diagnosis and assessment — this is where I need to be careful about tool limitations. The AAP recommends standardized assessment with a commonly used tool such as the modified Finnegan score, while emphasizing that diagnosis of NOWS is made only after excluding other causes and confirming exposure when possible; urine toxicology has a short window and should not be overinterpreted [^116ZWivv] [^114bmTiA] [^116gMvSg]. Wait, let me verify the scoring thresholds; many programs initiate pharmacotherapy with repeated elevated scores, often around 8–12 on modified Finnegan, but I should note that inter-rater variability and linkage of diagnosis to treatment thresholds can misclassify infants and inflate or deflate case ascertainment, highlighting the need for standardized clinical definitions beyond scoring alone [^113XVuta] [^116MmCDH] [^1123wCAd]. I should confirm that emerging tools like Eat-Sleep-Console (ESC) and simplified scales are promising; yes, ESC and abbreviated instruments show feasibility and potential to reduce overtreatment, but evidence quality varies and external validation is ongoing [^112TYS5R] [^116F4CrK] [^1156c2yF].

> Before moving to treatment, I need to check observation windows by exposure type because onset varies. AAP guidance advises observing all chronically opioid-exposed infants for at least 72 hours, extending to 4–7 days for buprenorphine or sustained-release opioids and 5–7 days for methadone, to reliably detect delayed withdrawal [^116QgmhR]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with SOGC; yes, Canadian guidance similarly emphasizes careful observation of opioid-exposed neonates, reinforcing the need for protocolized monitoring tied to exposure profile [^113B9Sn7].

> Nonpharmacologic care is foundational, but I should confirm the strength of evidence. AAP recommends nonpharmacologic interventions for all opioid-exposed infants, prioritizing rooming-in, breastfeeding when appropriate, and low-stimulation environments; however, Cochrane concludes that evidence for hard outcomes is low to very low, so we must be cautious not to overstate effect sizes even as we implement these practices broadly [^117HP5Tu] [^112ytGo9]. Let me reconsider breastfeeding guidance; AAP supports breastfeeding for mothers stable on buprenorphine or methadone without recent relapse, while discouraging breastfeeding with active substance use or recent relapse, which balances benefits and risks pragmatically [^117GNVmU] [^116vb66A]. I should also confirm that quality improvement collaboratives show shorter LOS with standardized nonpharmacologic protocols; yes, multicenter QI efforts demonstrate modest reductions in treatment duration and LOS when protocols are adopted [^117D9QKZ].

> For pharmacologic therapy, I should verify first-line recommendations and comparative effectiveness. AAP recommends opioids as first-line for severe NOWS, with buprenorphine favored to shorten treatment and stay based on randomized trials and network meta-analyses; methadone is reasonable, while morphine — though widely used — is generally less efficient than buprenorphine or methadone in reducing treatment duration [^116xWLVZ] [^1179P9nz] [^1142rMte]. Wait, I should double-check head-to-head data; methadone outperformed morphine for LOS and treatment duration in a multicenter RCT, and buprenorphine consistently shows the shortest treatment duration versus morphine in pooled analyses, supporting a hierarchy favoring buprenorphine or methadone over morphine when feasible [^117JVWi4] [^1142rMte]. I need to ensure I note adjuncts; clonidine and phenobarbital can be used as adjuncts when symptoms persist or as second-line strategies, but evidence quality varies and selection should follow local protocols and infant response [^112xAspV] [^112LcdHh].

> But wait, what about maternal dosing and infant severity — does higher methadone dose worsen NAS? Observational data suggest higher methadone doses correlate with more severe NAS and longer treatment, yet meta-analytic and prospective studies using standardized scoring show no clear dose-response, implying confounding by indication and care practices; thus, I should avoid overattributing causality and focus on optimizing nonpharmacologic care and protocolized weaning [^112S8AtE] [^114WBJMH]. Hold on, I should verify buprenorphine dose effects; most studies do not show a dose–severity relationship for buprenorphine, and breastfeeding appears protective against needing pharmacotherapy, which is clinically actionable [^116QmfB7].

> I will now examine emerging models of care, especially Eat-Sleep-Console, and I need to check the trial design. The ACT NOW stepped-wedge cluster RCT is evaluating ESC implementation and has shown promising reductions in pharmacologic treatment and length of stay in preliminary analyses, but I should confirm that definitive outcome data are still maturing; yes, peer commentary highlights early signals while emphasizing the need for robust, replicated results before declaring superiority [^112TYS5R]. Let me verify that ESC aligns with AAP's dyadic, function-based care principles; it does, but standardization and training remain critical to avoid variability in implementation [^117HP5Tu] [^112Smo5o].

> Next, I should review discharge readiness and follow-up, and I need to ensure I capture the AAP checklist. Discharge should occur after 24–48 hours without significant withdrawal signs, with parent education, 48-hour pediatric follow-up, early intervention referral, infectious disease testing as indicated, a written Plan of Safe Care, and linkage to community resources including lactation support and behavioral health when appropriate [^116zDzXw] [^117LvcGW] [^114Gxdcu]. Hold on, I should verify that rooming-in and dyad care are emphasized; yes, AAP prioritizes keeping mother–infant dyads intact and avoiding NICU admission solely for opioid exposure, which supports earlier discharge when clinically safe [^1168tALw] [^112Smo5o].

> Long-term outcomes are uncertain, so I need to be cautious. High-quality data on neurodevelopmental sequelae are limited; some cohorts show no clear growth differences in infancy, but potential impacts on neurobehavioral development remain an active research area and justify developmental surveillance and early intervention referrals [^114df7gE] [^114oXVLX]. Let me double-check that guidelines endorse early intervention referral; yes, AAP includes early intervention and developmental-behavioral follow-up in the discharge bundle, reflecting precaution despite incomplete evidence [^116zDzXw].

> I should now address controversies and system-level issues, and I need to ensure I don't conflate surveillance with stigmatization. Mandatory reporting and surveillance vary by state and can improve timeliness of case ascertainment, but inconsistent case definitions and reliance on administrative codes create noise; standardized clinical definitions and hybrid surveillance approaches improve comparability and equity, though implementation is resource intensive [^114NJRLT] [^1158TWFi] [^113Twutb]. Hold on, I should verify the role of toxicology; newborn toxicology has limited diagnostic utility for guiding immediate care and can worsen stigma and disengagement, so serial, nonjudgmental maternal screening with supportive linkage is preferred upstream [^113PmGWx] [^116gMvSg].

> Finally, I need to summarize key research gaps and make sure I'm aligned with consensus statements. Evidence remains limited for diagnostic gold standards, optimal nonpharmacologic bundles, comparative effectiveness across opioid agents, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes; AAP and multidisciplinary workshops call for larger, multisite trials and harmonized definitions to close these gaps [^114df7gE] [^1119gw66] [^1123wCAd]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that buprenorphine is unequivocally superior for all outcomes; while buprenorphine shortens treatment and LOS versus morphine, head-to-head superiority over methadone is less definitive and may vary by context, so I should frame buprenorphine as preferred when available and feasible, with methadone as a reasonable alternative rather than asserting categorical superiority [^1142rMte] [^117JVWi4].

> In practical terms, I should confirm that a stepwise, dyadic approach is recommended: screen prenatally and at delivery, observe according to exposure type, use standardized scoring or function-based assessment, implement rooming-in and breastfeeding support, escalate to buprenorphine or methadone for severe cases with protocolized weaning, and ensure robust discharge planning with early follow-up and developmental supports, all while minimizing NICU admission solely for exposure and addressing social determinants of health [^116ZWivv] [^117HP5Tu] [^116xWLVZ] [^116zDzXw] [^1168tALw] [^114Gxdcu]. Hold on, I should verify alignment with national guidance; yes, this synthesis reflects AAP 2020, CDC public health framing, and contemporary reviews calling for standardized, family-centered care and stronger evidence to guide practice [^114bmTiA] [^115AJfFS] [^114df7gE].

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a **withdrawal syndrome** in newborns exposed to opioids or other substances in utero, presenting with CNS irritability, autonomic instability, and GI dysfunction [^114FeP3n]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by maternal history and toxicology, and severity is tracked with standardized scoring (e.g. Finnegan) [^116ZWivv] [^113XVuta]. First-line management is **non-pharmacologic care** (rooming-in, breastfeeding, swaddling, minimal stimulation) [^117HP5Tu] [^112ytGo9]; pharmacologic therapy (morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine) is added for severe or persistent symptoms [^116xWLVZ] [^1142rMte]. Buprenorphine is **preferred** when available because it shortens treatment and hospital stay with fewer adverse effects [^1179P9nz] [^1142rMte]. Observation is tailored to exposure type (3–7 days), and discharge requires 24–48 hours of stability plus a Plan of Safe Care [^116QgmhR] [^116zDzXw]. Long-term neurodevelopmental risks mandate coordinated follow-up and early intervention [^116zDzXw].

---

## Pathophysiology

NAS results from **abrupt cessation** of chronic in utero opioid exposure, causing rebound hyperactivity of the CNS and autonomic systems [^114FeP3n]. Severity is influenced by maternal dose, duration, and co-exposures (benzodiazepines, SSRIs, nicotine) [^111cKbVf] [^112S8AtE], as well as infant factors such as prematurity, sex, and genetics [^114FeP3n] [^117DNdrv].

---

## Clinical presentation

NAS presents with multisystem signs, typically within 24–72 hours; onset and severity vary with the opioid and co-exposures [^114FeP3n] [^112Vu9T6].

| **System** | **Clinical signs** |
|-|-|
| CNS | Irritability, tremors, seizures, hyperactive reflexes, sleep disturbance [^112pRQpZ] |
| Autonomic | Sweating, yawning, mottling, fever, nasal congestion, sneezing [^112pRQpZ] |
| GI | Poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, poor weight gain [^112pRQpZ] [^112bF6N7] |

---

## Diagnosis and assessment

- **Diagnosis**: Clinical, based on maternal history, infant exam, and exclusion of other causes (infection, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance) [^114bmTiA] [^116NZN9U].
- **Assessment tools**: Standardized scoring systems (Finnegan, MOTHER, ESC) quantify severity and guide therapy [^116ZWivv] [^116F4CrK].
- **Toxicology**: Umbilical cord or meconium testing confirms exposure; urine has a short window and limited utility [^116gMvSg] [^113rYpzu].

---

## Risk factors

- **Maternal factors**: Methadone or buprenorphine dose, duration, and co-exposures (benzodiazepines, SSRIs, nicotine) [^111cKbVf] [^112S8AtE].
- **Infant factors**: Prematurity, male sex, genetic polymorphisms (e.g. OPRM1, COMT) [^114CcqQ1] [^117DNdrv].
- **Environmental factors**: Limited prenatal care, socioeconomic adversity, poly-substance use [^114FeP3n].

---

## Management

### Non-pharmacologic care

Non-pharmacologic care is **first-line** for all exposed infants and includes rooming-in with the mother to support bonding and breastfeeding; swaddling and gentle handling; and a low-stimulation environment with dim lighting and minimal noise [^117HP5Tu] [^112ytGo9]. These measures reduce pharmacologic treatment needs and shorten hospital stays [^114df7gE].

---

### Pharmacologic treatment

Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for **severe symptoms** or when non-pharmacologic measures fail [^112bF6N7]. Buprenorphine is **preferred** because it shortens treatment and hospital stay with fewer adverse effects [^1179P9nz] [^1142rMte]; methadone is an alternative, and morphine remains widely used [^116xWLVZ] [^1142rMte]. Adjuncts such as clonidine or phenobarbital are used for refractory cases or poly-substance exposure [^112LcdHh] [^112xAspV].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Most infants recover with supportive care, but NAS is associated with increased risks of **neurodevelopmental impairment**, growth restriction, and behavioral problems [^1134C5ce]. Long-term follow-up and early intervention are essential [^116zDzXw].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **comprehensive prenatal care**, universal screening for substance use, and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with methadone or buprenorphine [^1141KJgB] [^1128sfTF]. Buprenorphine is associated with lower NAS severity than methadone [^112egyux]. Coordinated care and a Plan of Safe Care reduce recurrence and improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Current research and controversies

- **Genetics**: OPRM1, COMT, and ABCB1 polymorphisms may predict severity and guide therapy [^notfound].
- **ESC model**: Emphasizes function-based care and may reduce pharmacologic treatment, but requires validation [^112TYS5R].
- **Standardization**: Efforts focus on harmonizing definitions, scoring, and treatment protocols [^1123wCAd].

---

Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a **treatable withdrawal syndrome** requiring coordinated non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic care, with buprenorphine emerging as the preferred pharmacotherapy. Long-term neurodevelopmental risks necessitate structured follow-up, and prevention hinges on MAT and integrated perinatal care [^1142rMte].

Importance

Neonatal abstinence syndrome, which occurs as a result of in utero opioid exposure, affects between 6.0 and 20 newborns per 1000 live US births. There is substantial variability in how neonatal abstinence syndrome is diagnosed and managed.

Objective

To summarize key studies examining the diagnosis and management (both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) of neonatal abstinence syndrome published during the past 10 years.

Evidence Review

PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched for articles published between July 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017. Abstracts were screened and included in the review if they pertained to neonatal abstinence syndrome diagnosis or management and were judged by the authors to be clinical trials, cohort studies, or case series.

Findings

A total of 53 articles were included in the review, including 9 randomized clinical trials, 35 cohort studies, 1 cross-sectional study, and 8 case series-representing a total of 11 905 unique opioid-exposed mother-infant dyads. Thirteen studies were identified that evaluated established or novel neonatal abstinence syndrome assessment methods, such as brief neonatal abstinence syndrome assessment scales or novel objective physiologic measures to predict withdrawal. None of the new techniques that measure infant physiologic parameters are routinely used in clinical practice. The most substantial number of studies of neonatal abstinence syndrome management pertain to nonpharmacologic care-specifically, interventions that promote breastfeeding or encourage parents to room-in with their newborns. Although these nonpharmacologic interventions appear to decrease the need for pharmacologic treatment and result in shorter hospitalizations, the interventions are heterogeneous and there are no high-quality clinical trials to support them. Regarding pharmacologic interventions, only 5 randomized clinical trials with prespecified sample size calculations (4 infant, 1 maternal treatment) have been published. Each of these trials was small (from26 to 131 participants) and tested different therapies, limiting the extent to which results can be aggregated. There is insufficient evidence to support an association between any diagnostic or treatment approach and differential neurodevelopmental outcomes among infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence pertaining to the optimal diagnosis and treatment strategies for neonatal abstinence syndrome is based on small or low-quality studies that focus on intermediate outcomes, such as need for pharmacologic treatment or length of hospital stay. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate health and neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with objective diagnostic approaches as well as pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment modalities.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^114bmTiA]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for neonatal abstinence syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, AAP 2020 guidelines recommend to establish the diagnosis of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome only if no other potential causes of neonatal symptoms have been identified after a full evaluation and no clear in-utero exposure has been identified through maternal history, screening, or testing.

### The role of genetics in neonatal abstinence syndrome [^117DNdrv]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) after in-utero exposure to opioids remains a significant public health concern. NAS is a highly variable condition in which presentation and severity cannot be explained by clinical factors alone. Research in human subjects has identified both genetic and epigenetic associations with prenatal opioid exposure and NAS severity, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, DNA methylation differences, and gene expression modifications. Animal studies have also identified key gene pathways that are likely important contributors to NAS phenotype. The clinical significance of identified genetic associations with NAS are unclear and warrant further study to see how they could impact NAS management.

Conclusion

Addressing the current gap in knowledge and providing a standard clinical definition for NAS would lay the foundation for informing public health policy; improve the accuracy and reproducibility of NAS surveillance, administrative claims, clinical records and scientific reports; and can enhance needs assessment and care for mother–infant dyads affected by opioid exposure in the short and long term.

Third, it was interesting that not all selected studies included maternal–infant opioid exposure as an essential component of the NAS definition. As noted above, NAS is most commonly conceptualized as withdrawal from opioids in exposed infants, but many studies may define NAS as withdrawal from a variety of exposures, not exclusively opioids. Other substance exposures beyond opioid use can affect NAS expression, including the demonstration of withdrawal signs/symptoms and their severity and/or pharmacotherapy decisions for the infant. In any case, the lack of inclusion of opioid exposure as an essential component in the diagnosis of NAS appears problematic given the prominent role of in utero opioid exposure — though often in the context of other exposures — in the development of NAS. Most noteworthy, this key knowledge gap highlights the critical need for addressing the definition of NAS at a point fundamentally upstream of the use of a scoring tool or administrative coding — namely, at the bedside at a clinical diagnostic level. It reinforces the importance of a standardized clinical definition for NAS as an essential step in advancing our discussions. This is crucial not only for clinical trials of new and existing therapeutics but also for improving downstream needs assessment and care for the appropriately identified mother–infant dyad.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^117XSjox]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

While our approach carries the limitations of a non-systematic review, it offers a conceptual summary of the limited number of available randomized control and cohort trials and the criteria they used to investigate various key outcomes for the mother–infant dyad. At least three limitations can be noted. Our emphasis on study designs with comparison groups may have excluded more descriptive literature that could also offer insight on how NAS has been historically defined. Likewise, some of the studies selected for this literature review demonstrated low population size, correlational design, and may be subject to underlying biases. Additionally, though the keyword search was informed by evidence-based guidelines and an environmental scan, it may have missed articles not captured by our focused search strategy and potentially retrievable by different search methods.

As the foundational step of an overarching RAM focusing on the clinical definition of NAS, the findings from this RAM literature review of comparative clinical studies will inform broader discussions on challenges with existing methods used to define NAS and important inconsistencies and gaps that need to be addressed. A key next step to closing fundamental knowledge gaps will be to develop standard clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NAS that are both practical and broadly applicable to clinical practice. The core consideration for criteria would be grounded in the infant's clinical signs of withdrawal independent of the need for pharmacologic treatment. A diagnosis of NAS in an infant who does not meet criteria for medication to alleviate symptoms may allow the application of targeted non-pharmacologic therapies to address NAS-related difficulties. Other important elements would include integration of (1) opioid and other substance exposures consistent with signs of neonatal withdrawal, (2) available maternal data, in a manner that does not contribute to further stigmatization of mothers with history of opioid/substance use, and (3) maternal–infant toxicology, when available, to document the exposure(s).

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome [^114FeP3n]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome refers to the signs and symptoms attributed to the cessation of prenatal exposure (via placental transfer) to various substances. This Primer focuses on neonatal abstinence syndrome caused by opioid use during pregnancy - neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). As the global prevalence of opioid use has alarmingly increased, so has the incidence of NOWS. NOWS can manifest with varying severity or not at all, for unknown reasons, but is likely to be associated with multiple factors, both maternal (for example, smoking and additional substance exposures) and neonatal (gestational age, sex and genetics). Care for the infant with NOWS begins with addressing the issues experienced by pregnant women with opioid use disorder. Co-occurring mental illness, economic hardship, intimate partner violence, infectious diseases and limited access to care are common in these women and can result in poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. Although there is no consensus regarding optimal NOWS management, non-pharmacological interventions (such as breastfeeding and rooming-in of the mother and the baby) have become a priority, as they can ameliorate symptoms without the need for further opioid exposure. Untreated NOWS can be associated with morbidity in early infancy, and the long-term consequences of fetal opioid exposure are only beginning to be understood.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^1123wCAd]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Without evidence-based criteria or consensus guidelines on how to clinically define NAS, guidance that standardizes the clinical diagnosis is urgently needed. As part of an overarching effort to establish a standard clinical definition of NAS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has partnered with national maternal–child specialists to systemically examine this issue through an appropriateness study using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM). Of the evidence-based approaches available for assessing clinical validity and appropriateness, RAM is unique in offering the opportunity to leverage broad expert input to address key knowledge gaps in the literature. The first step of the RAM process is a critical literature review, which is the focus of this article.

The key objective of this RAM literature review was to identify criteria described in clinical studies to define NAS. In the absence of standard clinical criteria, an understanding of key criteria and/or methods that have been used to define NAS and identification of relevant gaps or inconsistencies may inform critical discussions on how to approach the development of standardized clinical criteria. This is essential for both clinical care and clinical trials involving infants affected by NAS. While the lack of standard definitions for NAS has been described previously in various degrees of scope and depth, to date there nonetheless remains a paucity of standardized clinical criteria. The results of this RAM literature review will ultimately be used to develop guidance by HHS in collaboration with experts nationwide in maternal and child health, on standardizing the clinical diagnosis of NAS/NOWS (neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome) for use by the broader clinical and research communities.

### Pharmacological treatments for neonatal abstinence syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1142rMte]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome is rising rapidly, and optimal pharmacotherapy may meaningfully reduce length of treatment.

Objective

To compare pharmacological therapies for neonatal abstinence syndrome.

Data Sources

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of Medline (1946-June 2018), Embase (1974-June 2018), Cochrane CENTRAL (1966-June 2018), Web of Science (1900-June 2018), and ClinicalTrials.gov (June 2018).

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for neonatal abstinence syndrome alone or in combination with adjuvant treatments. Abstract, title, and full-text screening were conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.) according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)-Network Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and data were pooled with fixed-effect models as a result of the low number of trials that were included in the analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the length of treatment. The length of stay, need for adjuvant therapy, and adverse events were considered as secondary outcomes.

Results

Eighteen trials (N = 1072) were eligible for inclusion. The treatments that were included in the length of treatment analysis were buprenorphine, clonidine, diluted tincture of opium and clonidine, diluted tincture of opium, morphine, methadone, and phenobarbital. Sublingual buprenorphine was considered the optimal treatment for a reduction in the length of treatment (days: mean difference vs morphine, -12.75 [95% CI, -17.97 to -7.58]; median rank, 1 [3–1]) and length of stay (days: mean difference vs morphine, -11.43 [95% CI, -16.95 to -5.82]; median rank, 1 [3–1]) but not the need for adjuvant treatment (odds ratio vs morphine, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.46–3.44]; median rank, 3 [5–1]). The results were robust to bias but sensitive to imprecision.

Conclusions and Relevance

The current evidence suggests that buprenorphine is the optimal treatment for neonatal abstinence treatment, but limitations are considerable and wide-scale adoption requires a large multisite trial. Morphine, which is considered standard of care in most hospitals, was the lowest-ranked opioid for length of treatment and length of stay.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^116ZWivv]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal abstinence syndrome, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, AAP 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a standardized assessment with a commonly used tool (such as the modified Finnegan score) to measure the presence and severity of withdrawal symptoms in all infants at risk for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, as well as to assess the response to treatment.

---

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^116zDzXw]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neonatal abstinence syndrome, more specifically with respect to discharge from hospital, AAP 2020 guidelines recommend to complete a discharge checklist:

- no significant clinical signs of withdrawal for 24–48 hours after treatment

- parent education about neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and routine newborn care, emphasizing safe sleep

- pediatrician or primary care provider follow-up visit within 48 hours of discharge

- early intervention services referral

- consideration of home-nurse visitation and Early Head Start

- HCV and HIV testing referral, including referral to pediatric infectious disease when appropriate

- plan of safe care, coordinating with child welfare

- developmental-behavioral pediatrician referral when appropriate

- consideration of behavioral and/or mental health system referrals to address dyadic relational health.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^116QgmhR]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for neonatal abstinence syndrome, more specifically with respect to observation, AAP 2020 guidelines recommend to observe all infants with chronic opioid exposure for at least 72 hours to monitor for the development of withdrawal syndrome. Consider monitoring infants with opioid exposure for the following periods:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome [^113rYpzu]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a result of the sudden discontinuation of fetal exposure to substances that were used or abused by the mother during pregnancy. Withdrawal from licit or illicit substances is becoming more common among neonates in both developed and developing countries. NAS continues to be an important clinical entity throughout much of the world. NAS leads to a constellation of signs and symptoms involving multiple systems. The pathophysiology of NAS is not completely understood. Urine or meconium confirmation may assist the diagnosis and management of NAS. The Finnegan scoring system is commonly used to assess the severity of NAS; scoring can be helpful for initiating, monitoring, and terminating treatment in neonates. Nonpharmacological care is the initial treatment option, and pharmacological treatment is required if an improvement is not observed after nonpharmacological measures or if the infant develops severe withdrawal. Morphine is the most commonly used drug in the treatment of NAS secondary to opioids. An algorithmic approach to the management of infants with NAS is suggested. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in NAS, unless the mother is taking street drugs, is involved in polydrug abuse, or is infected with HIV. Future studies are required to assess the long-term effects of NAS on children after prenatal exposure.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome [^1175qbyX]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neonates exposed prenatally to opioids will often develop a collection of withdrawal signs known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The incidence of NAS has substantially increased in recent years placing an increasing burden on the healthcare system. Traditional approaches to assessment and management have relied on symptom-based scoring tools and utilization of slowly decreasing doses of medication, though newer models of care focused on non-pharmacologic interventions and rooming-in have demonstrated promise in reducing length of hospital stay and medication usage. Data on long-term outcomes for both traditional and newer approaches to care of infants with NAS is limited and an important area of future research. This review will examine the history, incidence and pathophysiology of NAS. We will also review diagnostic screening approaches, scoring tools, differing management approaches and conclude with recommendations for continued work to improve the care of infants with NAS.

### Pharmacologic management of the opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome [^114ouRec]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Opioid use in pregnant women has increased over the last decade. Following birth, infants with in utero exposure demonstrate signs and symptoms of withdrawal known as the neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Infants express a spectrum of disease, with most requiring the administration of pharmacologic therapy to ensure proper growth and development. Treatment often involves prolonged hospitalization. There is a general lack of high-quality clinical trial data to guide optimal therapy, and significant heterogeneity in treatment approaches. Emerging trends in the treatment of infants with NAS include the use of sublingual buprenorphine, transition to outpatient therapy, and pharmacogenetic risk stratification.

### Finding the right treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome: is this the right time? [^111q4NJe]. Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a constellation of withdrawal symptoms in infants born to mothers with chronic opioid use during pregnancy. A proportion of infants will need pharmacotherapy in addition to non-pharmacological interventions. In this article, we reviewed a clinical trial comparing the use of sublingual buprenorphine to oral morphine (the most widely used pharmacotherapy for NAS) in term infants. The primary end point was the duration of treatment, and secondary end points were the length of hospital stay, the proportion of infants who needed supplemental phenobarbital, and safety.

### Methadone dose and neonatal abstinence syndrome-systematic review and meta-analysis [^114WBJMH]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine if there is a relationship between maternal methadone dose in pregnancy and the diagnosis or medical treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and PsychINFO were searched for studies reporting on methadone use in pregnancy and NAS (1966–2009). The relative risk (RR) of NAS was compared for methadone doses above versus below a range of cut-off points. Summary RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random effects meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of limiting meta-analyses to prospective studies or studies using an objective scoring system to diagnose NAS.

Results

A total of 67 studies met inclusion criteria for the systematic review; 29 were included in the meta-analysis. Any differences in the incidence of NAS in infants of women on higher compared with lower doses were statistically non-significant in analyses restricted to prospective studies or to those using an objective scoring system to diagnose NAS.

Conclusions

Severity of the neonatal abstinence syndrome does not appear to differ according to whether mothers are on high- or low-dose methadone maintenance therapy.

### Infant and maternal characteristics in neonatal abstinence syndrome – selected hospitals in Florida, 2010–2011 [^115arRPD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) have prolonged hospital stays, experience serious medical complications, and are very costly to treat.

What is added by this report?

During a 2-year period (2010–2011), a total of 242 confirmed NAS cases were identified in three Florida hospitals. Nearly all infants with NAS (99.6%) were exposed to opioids during pregnancy and experienced serious medical complications, with 97.1% being admitted to an intensive care unit, where the mean length of stay was 26.1 days.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Interventions are needed to 1) increase the number and use of community resources available to drug-abusing and drug- dependent women of reproductive age, 2) improve drug addiction counseling and rehabilitation referral and documentation policies, and 3) link women to these resources before or earlier in pregnancy. Encouraging breastfeeding of infants with NAS, when mothers are in supervised drug treatment programs and when not otherwise contraindicated, might also be considered.

Other analyses from this investigation will evaluate the use of Florida's linked administrative data for NAS surveillance. The findings of this report enhance current clinical and public health knowledge on infants with NAS. When not otherwise contraindicated, encouraging mothers in supervised drug treatment programs to breastfeed, increasing the number and use of community resources available to women of reproductive age for substance abuse treatment and smoking cessation, improving drug addiction counseling and rehabilitation referral and documentation policies, and linking women to these resources before or earlier in pregnancy are all options that should be considered when addressing NAS prevention and management measures.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^117QcQjs]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Full-text review

Collectively, 55 categorized abstracts were identified as adhering to inclusion criteria for this literature review. They underwent full-text review independently by two reviewers assessing two key characteristics: (1) method(s) that distinguished infants with a clinical diagnosis of NAS to those without and (2) opioid exposure for mother and infant. Independent review led to complete agreement with respect to key characteristics identified in each study. As a final measure of consistency, a confirmatory review of the full set of 888 abstracts was carried out as an iterative scan for abstracts eligible for inclusion; 2 additional abstracts were advanced for full-text review. An evidence table was constructed by abstracting pertinent information from the articles as a summary of findings from the full-text review. Overall, 57 articles (published from 1986 to 2019) adhered to the inclusion criteria for this literature review and were assessed for methodology used to define NAS (Fig. 2).

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^1174uYNa]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Specific consideration was given as to whether individual trials included opioid exposure as a crucial component of the study's inclusion criteria for defining NAS (Fig. 3). While 74% (42/57) of studies identified by this review included opioid exposure as an integral part of their participant eligibility and/or inclusion criteria for mothers, infants, and/or the mother–infant dyad, 26% (15/57) did not. This was unexpected as opioid exposure is traditionally considered an essential element of the definition of NAS.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome: historical perspective, current focus, future directions [^1126PuGm]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurs following prenatal opioid exposure. It is characterized by signs and symptoms indicating central nervous system hyperirritability and autonomic nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system dysfunction.

Objective

This article: (1) briefly reviews NAS history, including initial identification, assessment, and treatment efforts; (2) summarizes the current status of and current issues surrounding recent NAS assessment and treatment, and (3) details future directions in NAS conceptualization, measurement, and treatment.

Results

Mortality rate estimates in neonates treated for NAS exceeded 33%, and surpassed 90% for un-treated infants during the late-1800s until the mid-1900s. The focus of both assessment and treatment over the past 50years is predominantly due to two forces. First, methadone pharmacotherapy for "heroin addiction" led to women in methadone maintenance programs who were, or became pregnant. The second was defining NAS and developing a measure of neonatal withdrawal, the Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (NASS). Various NAS treatment protocols were based on the NASS as well as other NAS measures.

Conclusions

Future research must focus on psychometrically sound screening and assessment measures of neonatal opioid withdrawal for premature, term and older infants, measuring and treating possible withdrawal from non-opioids, particularly benzodiazepines, integrated non-pharmacological treatment of NAS, weight-based versus symptom-based treatment of NAS, and second-line treatment for NAS.

### Opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome: an overview [^1138u3yw]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) refers to signs of withdrawal observed in infants experiencing intrauterine opioid exposures. Early identification of at-risk infants allows for the prompt initiation of nonpharmacologic supportive care. When withdrawal symptoms are severe despite these interventions, pharmacologic therapy including opioid weaning is initiated. Consistency with standardized nonpharmacologic approaches as well as stringent weaning protocols are important in minimizing the length of stay and length of pharmacologic treatment for these vulnerable patients.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome: presentation and treatment considerations [^111BMppC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The increase in opioid use among the general population is reflected in pregnant women and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) statistics. This increase has produced an unprecedented focus on NAS from both the political-judicial sphere and the medical community. Under the banner of fetal protection, judges and prosecutors have implemented punitive approaches against women who use prescribed and nonprescribed opioids during pregnancy, including arrest, civil commitment, detention, prosecution, and loss of custody or termination of parental rights. Within the medical community, questions have been raised regarding protocols to detect prenatal drug exposure at delivery, NAS treatment protocols, the need for quality-improvement strategies to standardize care and reduce length of stay for mother and infant, and the benefits of engaging the mother in the care of her infant. It is not uncommon for the expression of strong discordant views on these issues both between and among these political-judicial and medical constituencies. Closely examining the issues often reveal a lack of understanding of substance use disorders, their treatment, and the occurrence and treatment of NAS. This study provides an in-depth examination of NAS, including variations in presentation and factors that impact the efficacy of treatment, and also identifying questions that remain unanswered. Finally, 4 key areas on which future research should focus to guide both medical care and public policy are discussed.

### Opioid use in pregnancy, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and childhood outcomes: executive summary of a joint workshop by the eunice Kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, centers for disease control and prevention, and the March of dimes foundation [^1119gw66]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In April 2016, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development invited experts to a workshop to address numerous knowledge gaps and to review the evidence for the screening and management of opioid use in pregnancy and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The rising prevalence of opioid use in pregnancy has led to a concomitant dramatic fivefold increase in neonatal abstinence syndrome over the past decade. Experts from diverse disciplines addressed research gaps in the following areas: 1) optimal screening for opioid use in pregnancy; 2) complications of pregnancy associated with opioid use; 3) appropriate treatments for pregnant women with opioid use disorders; 4) the best approaches for detecting, treating, and managing newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome; and 5) the long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on children. Workshop participants identified key scientific opportunities to advance the understanding of opioid use disorders in pregnancy and to improve outcomes for affected women, their children, and their families. This article provides a summary of the workshop presentations and discussions.

### Pre-natal and post-natal screening and testing in neonatal abstinence syndrome [^113PmGWx]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The way we enact screening for substance use during pregnancy within our healthcare systems can work by decreasing stigma, promoting engagement, and supporting people with reaching the end of their pregnancy in a manner where the newborn can be well supported. The way we enact biochemical specimen toxicology testing for substance use during pregnancy and in newborns contributes to increased stigma, disengagement from care, and potential continuation of uncontrolled substance use up until delivery such that the newborn may not be able to be well supported in the family environment. These effects are inequitably distributed, leading to worse outcomes for families of color and families living in poverty. Serial screening with a validated questionnaire starting at the first prenatal visit and continuing through the delivery hospitalization should occur and be followed up with service connections and substance use disorder diagnosis and treatment. Newborn toxicology testing as a diagnostic tool for risk of withdrawal or the etiology of potential withdrawal symptoms represents a failure in the effectiveness of compassionate communication by healthcare providers with the birthing person. Given the current level of evidence of clinical utility and the inequitable consequences specific to these tests, they are rarely needed.

### Update on the pharmacologic management of neonatal abstinence syndrome [^112xAspV]. Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Although a statement on Neonatal Drug Withdrawal was published in 1998 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, pharmacologic management of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) remains a challenge. Published clinical trials are limited, restricting treatment decision making to practitioner's experience and preference rather than evidence-based medicine. To optimize withdrawal symptom prevention, drug selection is often based on the offending agent (opioids versus polysubstance exposure), clinical presentation, mechanism of action (agonist versus partial agonist/antagonist, receptor effects), pharmacokinetic parameters and available drug formulations. This review addresses risk factors and pathophysiology of NAS, summarizes parameters of common drugs used for the management of NAS, and reviews published literature of standard therapies as well as newer agents. Based on the current literature, paregoric is no longer recommended and oral morphine solutions remain the mainstay of therapy for opiate withdrawal. Other potential therapies include methadone, buprenorphine, phenobarbital and clonidine with the latter two agents as adjunctive therapies.

### Evaluation of state-mandated reporting of neonatal abstinence syndrome-six States, 2013–2017 [^114NJRLT]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Mandated NAS case reporting might improve states' ability to calculate more timely estimates of the incidence of NAS in their jurisdictions, identify opportunities for prevention, and facilitate linkages to care for infants and mothers. With more accurate and timely estimates of disease incidence, health systems and health care providers might be better prepared to ensure that adequate resources exist to address the immediate and potential long-term needs of children born with NAS and mothers. A standardized case definition for NAS and consistent reporting approaches will improve the ability to make meaningful comparisons between states and target prevention efforts to areas of greatest need.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^1176ch2E]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The RAM literature review has been used in numerous research studies, including to support national guidance on treating pregnant and parenting women with opioid use disorder. Similarly, we set out to examine available literature in order to develop a synthesis of scientific evidence specific to this research question, distinct from statistical methods employed in meta-analyses. This RAM literature review was carried out between September 2019 and June 2020. A Federal Steering Committee (FSC) and Expert Panel (EP) were assembled to conduct this review. The FSC consisted of maternal–child health and policy experts from the following federal agencies: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health. The EP consisted of clinical and research specialists in maternal–child health from obstetrics and gynecology, addiction medicine, general and hospital pediatrics, developmental pediatrics, primary care, and neonatology.

### Role of clonidine in neonatal abstinence syndrome: a systematic review [^112LcdHh]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a systematic review of the current role of clonidine in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search inclusive of the dates 1946 to November 2015 was performed using the search terms clonidine and abstinence syndromes, neonatal. Excerpta Medica was searched from 1980 to November 2015 using the search terms clonidine and newborn. Additionally, Web of Science was searched using the terms clonidine and neon* inclusive of 1945 to November 2015.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

We utilized the PRISMA guidelines to select English language, human primary literature, review articles, and supporting data assessing the efficacy of clonidine in the treatment of NAS.

Data Synthesis

Three clinical trials and 5 observational studies demonstrated evidence of clonidine's effectiveness in NAS. Clonidine's therapeutic use as monotherapy and in combination with other agents was shown to reduce the time needed for pharmacotherapy treatment. Adverse reactions associated with clonidine in neonates, when reported, are mild.

Conclusion

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends opioids as first-line agents in the treatment of NAS when pharmacological treatment is indicated. Limited data suggest that clonidine, in combination with other agents or as monotherapy, may be as effective, with minimal adverse effects and reduced treatment time. Prospective clinical trials are necessary to clarify the ultimate role of clonidine in NAS and establish long-term safety.

### Male sex associated with increased risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome [^114CcqQ1]. Hospital Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a postnatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Factors associated with development of the syndrome are poorly understood; however, infant sex may influence the risk of NAS. Our objective was to determine if infant sex was associated with the development or severity of the syndrome in a large population-based cohort.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used vital statistics and prescription, outpatient, and inpatient administrative data for mothers and infants enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program between 2009 and 2011. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between male sex and diagnosis of NAS, accounting for potential demographic and clinical confounders. NAS severity, as evidenced by hospital length of stay, was modeled by using negative binomial regression.

Results

Of 102695 infants, 927 infants were diagnosed with NAS (484 male subjects and 443 female subjects). Adjustments were made for the following: maternal age, race, and education; maternal hepatitis C infection, anxiety, or depression; in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cigarettes; infant birth weight, small for gestational age, and year; and the interaction between opioid type and opioid amount. Male infants were more likely than female infants to be diagnosed with NAS (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18 [95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.33]) and NAS requiring treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.47]). However, there was no sex-based difference in severity for those diagnosed with NAS.

Conclusions

Treatment of NAS should be tailored to an infant's individual risk for the syndrome. Clinicians should be mindful that male sex is an important risk factor in the diagnosis of NAS.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^111mbZUT]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) results from discontinuation of in utero exposures to opioids/substances. The rising incidence of NAS has prompted an increased need for accurate research and public health data. To examine how NAS has been defined in clinical studies of opioid-exposed mothers and infants, a review process was developed based on the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, yielding 888 abstracts. Per inclusion criteria, 57 abstracts underwent full-text review. To define NAS, studies cited using modified versions of the Finnegan NAS scoring tool (n = 21; 37%), ICD-9/10 coding (n = 17; 30%), original Finnegan tool (n = 16; 28%), Eat Sleep Console (n = 3; 5%), and Lipsitz (n = 3; 5%) tools, (3 cited 2+ tools). Most studies utilized subjective NAS scoring/assessment algorithms and neonatal coding as key elements defining NAS. While most cited opioid exposure as integral to their inclusion criteria, 26% did not. These approaches highlight the need for a more refined and standardized definition of NAS.

### Comparison of safety and efficacy of methadone vs morphine for treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^117JVWi4]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although opioids are used to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), the best pharmacologic treatment has not been established.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of methadone and morphine in NAS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this randomized, double-blind, intention-to-treat trial, term infants from 8 US newborn units whose mothers received buprenorphine, methadone, or opioids for pain control during pregnancy were eligible. A total of 117 infants were randomized to receive methadone or morphine from February 9, 2014, to March 6, 2017. Mothers who declined randomization could consent to data collection and standard institutional treatment.

Interventions

Infants were assessed with the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System every 4 hours and treated with methadone or placebo every 4 hours or morphine every 4 hours. Infants with persistently elevated Finnegan scores received dose increases. Infants who exceeded a predetermined opioid dose received phenobarbital. Dose reductions occurred every 12 to 48 hours when signs of NAS were controlled with therapy, stopping at 20% of the original dose.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was length of hospital stay (LOS). The secondary end points were LOS attributable to NAS and length of drug treatment (LOT).

Results

A total of 183 mothers consented to have their infants in the study; 117 infants required treatment. Because 1 parent withdrew consent, data were analyzed on 116 infants (mean [SD] gestational age, 39.1 [1.1] weeks; mean [SD] birth weight, 3157 [486] g; 58 [50%] male). Demographic variables and risk factors were similar except for more prenatal cigarette exposure in infants who received methadone. Adjusting for study site and maternal opioid type, methadone was associated with decreased mean number of days for LOS by 14% (relative number of days, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74–1.00; p = 0.046), corresponding to a difference of 2.9 days; 14% reduction in LOS attributable to NAS (relative number of days, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.96; p = 0.01), corresponding to a difference of 2.7 days; and 16% reduction in LOT (relative number of days, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.97; p = 0.02), corresponding to a difference of 2.3 days. Methadone was also associated with reduced median LOS (16 vs 20 days, P = 0.005), LOS attributable to NAS (16 vs 19 days, P = 0.005), and LOT (11.5 vs 15 days, P = 0.009). Study infants had better short-term outcomes than 170 nonrandomized infants treated with morphine per standard institutional protocols.

Conclusions and Relevance

With use of weight- and sign-based treatment for NAS, short-term outcomes were better in infants receiving methadone compared with morphine. Assessment of longer-term outcomes is ongoing.

### Non-pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns [^112ytGo9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of substance use, both prescribed and non-prescribed, is increasing in many areas of the world. Substance use by women of childbearing age contributes to increasing rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a newer term describing the subset of NAS related to opioid exposure. Non-pharmacological care is the first-line treatment for substance withdrawal in newborns. Despite the widespread use of non-pharmacological care to mitigate symptoms of NAS, there is not an established definition of, and standard for, non-pharmacological care practices in this population. Evaluation of safety and efficacy of non-pharmacological practices could provide clear guidance for clinical practice.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment of infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal on the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment for symptom management. Comparison 1: in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal, does non-pharmacological treatment reduce the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment? Comparison 2: in infants receiving pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, does concurrent non-pharmacological treatment reduce duration of pharmacological treatment, maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication, and length of hospitalization?

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2019, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE; and CINAHL on 11 October 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster trials.

Selection Criteria

We included trials comparing single or bundled non-pharmacological interventions to no non-pharmacological treatment or different single or bundled non-pharmacological interventions. We assessed non-pharmacological interventions independently and in combination based on sufficient similarity in population, intervention, and comparison groups studied. We categorized non-pharmacological interventions as: modifying environmental stimulation, feeding practices, and support of the mother-infant dyad. We presented non-randomized studies identified in the search process narratively.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization and pharmacological treatment with one or more doses of opioid or sedative medication. Primary outcomes in infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization, length of pharmacological treatment with opioid or sedative medication, and maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication.

Main Results

We identified six RCTs (353 infants) in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated between 1975 and 2018. We identified no RCTs in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low to low. We also identified and excluded 34 non-randomized studies published between 2005 and 2018, including 29 in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated and five in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. We identified seven preregistered interventional clinical trials that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. Of the six RCTs, four studies assessed modifying environmental stimulation in the form of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning, non-oscillating waterbed, or a low-stimulation nursery; one study assessed feeding practices (comparing 24 kcal/oz to 20 kcal/oz formula); and one study assessed support of the maternal-infant dyad (tailored breastfeeding support). There was no evidence of a difference in length of hospitalization in the one study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation (mean difference [MD) -1 day, 95% confidence interval [CI) -2.82 to 0.82; 30 infants; very low-certainty evidence) and the one study of support of the maternal-infant dyad (MD -8.9 days, 95% CI -19.84 to 2.04; 14 infants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies of feeding practices evaluated the length of hospitalization. There was no evidence of a difference in use of pharmacological treatment in three studies of modifying environmental stimulation (typical risk ratio [RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 92 infants; low-certainty evidence), one study of feeding practices (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.33; 49 infants; very low-certainty evidence), and one study of support of the maternal-infant dyad (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low-certainty evidence). Reported secondary outcomes included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, days to regain birth weight, and weight nadir. One study of support of the maternal-infant dyad reported NICU admission (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low-certainty evidence). One study of feeding practices reported days to regain birth weight (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI 2.76 to 0.56; 46 infants; very low-certainty evidence). One study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation reported weight nadir (MD -0.28, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.59; 194 infants; very low-certainty evidence) and one study of feeding practices reported weight nadir (MD -0.8, 95% CI -2.24 to 0.64; 46 infants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether non-pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns affects important clinical outcomes including length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment based on the six included studies. The outcomes identified for this review were of very low- to low-certainty evidence. Combined analysis was limited by heterogeneity in study design and intervention definitions as well as the number of studies. Many prespecified outcomes were not reported. Although caregivers are encouraged by experts to optimize non-pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns prior to initiating pharmacological care, we do not have sufficient evidence to inform specific clinical practices. Larger well-designed studies are needed to determine the effect of non-pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns.

### Can methadone concentrations predict the severity of withdrawal in infants at risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome? [^115t41QH]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the usefulness of cord and serum methadone concentrations at 2 days of age in predicting the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in infants whose mothers received methadone during pregnancy.

Methods

After informed consent, infants were enrolled if they were delivered at 35 weeks gestation or greater. Relevant information was collected from maternal notes. A sample of cord blood was taken at delivery, with a follow up sample at 48 hours of age. The samples were analysed in batches, and the results were unavailable to the attending clinical staff. Infants were treated for NAS on clinical grounds according to a standardised scoring system.

Results

Twenty five of 36 eligible infants over the 21 month period of the study were enrolled. Of these, 12 required treatment for NAS. Maternal methadone dose did not predict the need for treatment. However, infants who required treatment had significantly lower methadone concentrations in cord blood than the group who did not receive treatment (31 v 88 ng/ml respectively; p = 0.029). Paired blood samples for methadone concentrations were available for 17 infants. All but one of the 12 infants who required treatment had undetectable concentrations of methadone in the postnatal sample, whereas the median postnatal methadone concentration in untreated infants was 23 ng/ml (p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Methadone concentrations taken from cord blood may identify infants at greater risk of neonatal withdrawal and therefore requiring treatment.

### Buprenorphine in neonatal abstinence syndrome [^1123myZP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Infants exposed in utero to opioids will demonstrate a withdrawal syndrome known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Buprenorphine is a long-acting opioid with therapeutic use in medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependency in adults and adolescents. Emerging data from clinical trials and treatment cohorts demonstrate the efficacy and safety of sublingual buprenorphine for those infants with NAS who require pharmacologic treatment. Pharmacometric modeling will assist in defining the exposure-response relationships and facilitate dose optimization.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^116dAE1Y]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Search design

Utilizing the results of the environmental scan to inform and tailor subsequent review of the literature, the scope of the search strategy was subsequently narrowed to specifically identify abstracts containing criteria used in the definition or description of NAS. In December 2019, a search was run in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL. Specific search terms included (1) NAS; (2) NOWS; (3) urine, umbilical cord, and/or meconium and NAS or NOWS; and (4) criteria, criterion, definition, define, or diagnosis of NAS or NOWS. This combination of search terms included literature published worldwide in English without date limitations and candidate abstracts highly specific to the primary research question.

The role of non-opioid other or polysubstance exposure (e.g. nicotine, other licit and illicit psychotropic drugs) in the pathogenesis of NAS was also considered, but current evidence was unclear as to specific causal associations so these agents were not added to the keyword search. However, retrieved abstracts were not excluded if found to address the primary research question while including other substance exposure in the study design. In other words, abstracts not directly assessing opioid exposure or assessing non-opioid or other substance exposures were not excluded. Rather, these terms were not distinctly specified in the keyword search. Additionally, given variability/availability in toxicology testing practices across the country, this specific terminology was not added to the keyword search.

### Buprenorphine for the treatment of the neonatal abstinence syndrome [^1179P9nz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current pharmacologic treatment of the neonatal abstinence syndrome with morphine is associated with a lengthy duration of therapy and hospitalization. Buprenorphine may be more effective than morphine for this indication.

Methods

In this single-site, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial, we randomly assigned 63 term infants (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) who had been exposed to opioids in utero and who had signs of the neonatal abstinence syndrome to receive either sublingual buprenorphine or oral morphine. Infants with symptoms that were not controlled with the maximum dose of opioid were treated with adjunctive phenobarbital. The primary end point was the duration of treatment for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal. Secondary clinical end points were the length of hospital stay, the percentage of infants who required supplemental treatment with phenobarbital, and safety.

Results

The median duration of treatment was significantly shorter with buprenorphine than with morphine (15 days vs. 28 days), as was the median length of hospital stay (21 days vs. 33 days) (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Adjunctive phenobarbital was administered in 5 of 33 infants (15%) in the buprenorphine group and in 7 of 30 infants (23%) in the morphine group (P = 0.36). Rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among infants with the neonatal abstinence syndrome, treatment with sublingual buprenorphine resulted in a shorter duration of treatment and shorter length of hospital stay than treatment with oral morphine, with similar rates of adverse events.

### Exposure to prescription opioid analgesics in utero and risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome: population based cohort study [^111cKbVf]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Findings from this study indicate that long term use of prescription opioids compared with short term use and late use compared with early use are associated with increased risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome independent of additional risk factors. Additional risk factors such as history of opioid misuse or dependence, alcohol or other drug misuse, exposure to other psychotropic medications late in pregnancy, and smoking contribute to greater risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome among infants exposed in utero to prescription opioids. Clinicians should carefully consider the presence of one or more of these risk factors in pregnant women and try to minimize the long term use of prescription opioids when clinically viable. Short term use of prescription opioids during pregnancy in the absence of additional risk factors is associated with a very low absolute risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome: pharmacologic strategies for the mother and infant [^115tXLGv]. Seminars in Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Opioid use in pregnancy has increased dramatically over the past decade. Since prenatal opioid use is associated with numerous obstetrical and neonatal complications, this now has become a major public health problem. In particular, in utero opioid exposure can result in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) which is a serious condition characterized by central nervous system hyperirritability and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The present review seeks to define current practices regarding the approach to the pregnant mother and neonate with prenatal opiate exposure. Although the cornerstone of prenatal management of opioid dependence is opioid maintenance therapy, the ideal agent has yet to be definitively established. Pharmacologic management of NAS is also highly variable and may include an opioid, barbiturate, and/or α-agonist. Genetic factors appear to be associated with the incidence and severity of NAS. Establishing pharmacogenetic risk factors for the development of NAS has the potential for creating opportunities for "personalized genomic medicine" and novel, individualized therapeutic interventions.

### A quality improvement project to reduce length of stay for neonatal abstinence syndrome [^1133p9kP]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a self-limiting condition, is associated with clinical symptoms that may require pharmacological intervention. Optimal treatment of NAS remains undetermined, but the hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients with NAS is partially dependent upon a standard treatment protocol used. Prolonged LOS for patients with NAS can lead to adverse patient harm, impaired maternal-infant attachment, and significant health care costs. Therefore, we conducted a quality improvement study to reduce the LOS for infants with NAS.

Methods

In 2009, a multidisciplinary NAS Taskforce was created to implement a standardized treatment protocol, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the current medical and nursing management, and improve communication among staff. Infants with NAS that required pharmacological intervention were followed throughout their hospitalization. Readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge was tracked as a balancing measure.

Results

Ninety-two infants were eligible for the project including 23 infants from a baseline period (January 2007-August 2009). Reliable monitoring of symptoms and the administration of a standardized morphine protocol effectively reduced LOS from 36 days to 18 days by June 2012. This improvement was sustained through December 2012. No patients were readmitted for NAS treatment.

Conclusions

The most effective interventions that impacted LOS for infants with NAS were the development of a staff NAS education program and the implementation of a standard treatment protocol. The formation of the NAS Taskforce was also essential because it facilitated communication and the dissemination of vital treatment information among all clinical staff.

### Exposure to prescription opioid analgesics in utero and risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome: population based cohort study [^117Dmdqh]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

This study is the first one to our knowledge that evaluates a dose-response relation between use of prescription opioids and the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome. We observed that the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome increased with higher doses of opioids during pregnancy for long term users, but reached a plateau at higher cumulative doses. This observation is consistent with results from a large meta-analysis, which indicated that at higher doses of methadone maintenance therapy there was no further dose-dependent increase in the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome. While we excluded women with known opioid misuse or dependence from this analysis owing to the unavailability of reliable data from illicit sources on opioid exposure, our results suggest that prior findings of limited effectiveness of a dose reduction of methadone, after a certain point of cumulative exposure, in reducing the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome may extend to prescription non-maintenance opioids.

Clinical implications

The current study provides some important clinical implications. Our observation of greater risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome in babies born to long term users of prescription opioids suggests that clinicians should carefully weigh benefits and risks of long term opioid use to the developing fetus. Since long term use through the third trimester appears to impart greater risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome, minimizing the use of prescription opioids towards the end of pregnancy, when clinically reasonable, may be a strategy to reduce this risk. The use of prescription opioids in concomitance with other risk factors such as non-opioid psychotropic agents and smoking should also be carefully considered and balanced against the presence of clinical conditions that may necessitate opioid use for pain control. On the other hand, the benefits from the short term use of prescription opioids in treating acute pain in the absence of additional risk factors during pregnancy may outweigh the potential risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome, since short term use of prescription opioids during pregnancy appears to result in a relatively low risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome. Prior research indicates that untreated pain in pregnancy is common and may lead to limited productivity and difficulties in activities of daily living. While evaluating the risk-benefit balance of prescription opioid treatment in pregnancy, it should also be noted that neonatal abstinence syndrome is a condition that is identifiable and treatable with pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.

### The neonatal withdrawal inventory: a simplified score of newborn withdrawal [^113XVuta]. Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (1998). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Score (NAS)" for neonatal abstinence syndrome and opioid use disorder.

The Modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Score (NAS) is a clinical calculator used in the neonatal population, specifically newborns who have been exposed to addictive illegal or prescription drugs in utero. This scoring system is used to assess the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a group of problems a baby experiences when withdrawing from exposure to narcotics.

The Modified Finnegan NAS includes a comprehensive list of 21 symptoms that are common in babies with NAS, such as tremors, convulsions, excessive crying, and poor feeding. Each symptom is scored based on its severity, and the total score is used to guide treatment decisions.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to help healthcare providers identify babies who need medical treatment for NAS, monitor the effectiveness of treatment, and determine when treatment can be stopped.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Modified Finnegan NAS. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is not designed to diagnose other conditions that may cause similar symptoms in newborns, such as sepsis or hypoglycemia. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and clinical assessments.

The Modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Score (NAS) assists healthcare professionals in evaluating neonatal withdrawal symptoms by assigning numerical values to a wide array of observable symptoms. This scoring system supports clinicians in assessing the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and deciding on the necessity and timing of pharmacotherapy.

Each symptom is rated based on observable criteria, and these ratings are converted into scores. This sum is used to interpret the severity of the infant's symptoms. Below is an overview of how each symptom is assessed and scored:

- **Cry**

- **Normal**: 0
- **Excessive high-pitched cry < 5 minutes**: 2
- **Continuous high-pitched cry > 5 minutes**: 3

- **Sleep after feeding**

- **Sleeps > 3 hours**: 0
- **Sleeps < 3 hours**: 1
- **Sleeps < 2 hours**: 2
- **Sleeps < 1 hour**: 3

- **Moro reflex**

- **Normal**: 0
- **Hyperactive**: 2
- **Markedly hyperactive**: 3

- **Tremors**

- **None**: 0
- **Mild when disturbed**: 1
- **Moderate-to-severe when disturbed**: 2
- **Mild when undisturbed**: 3
- **Moderate-to-severe when undisturbed**: 4

- **Increased muscle tone**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Excoriations (e.g., chin, knees)**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Myoclonic jerks**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 3

- **Generalized convulsions**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 5

- **Sweating**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Hyperthermia**

- **None**: 0
- 37.2–38.3°C (99.0–100.9°F): 1
- > 38.3°C (> 100.9°F): 2

- **Frequent yawning**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Mottling**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Nasal stuffiness**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Sneezing (> 3–4 times)**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Nasal flaring**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 2

- **Respiratory rate**

- **Normal**: 0
- **> 60 breaths/min without retractions**: 1
- **> 60 breaths/min with retractions**: 2

- **Excessive sucking**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Poor feeding**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 2

- **Regurgitation**

- **No**: 0
- **≥ 2 times during/after feeding**: 2

- **Projectile vomiting**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 3

- **Stools**

- **Normal**: 0
- **Loose curds/seedy**: 2
- **Watery (water ring on diaper)**: 3

After evaluating and scoring each symptom, the total NAS score is calculated by summing all individual scores. The interpretation of this total score may guide whether pharmacotherapy should be initiated:

- Scores between 0 and 7 usually do not require immediate intervention.
- Scores of 8 or higher suggest consideration for pharmacotherapy if recurrent scores mark the threshold (three consecutive scores of 8–11).
- Scores of 12 or higher indicate the need for pharmacotherapy if two consecutive assessments are at this level or higher.

### Development of an abbreviated symptom score for the neonatal abstinence syndrome [^11696JFh]. Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought a shortened MOTHER neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and Finnegan score that would retain comparable performance characteristics of the full instrument.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort.

Results

In total, 124,170 MOTHER NAS scores between August 2007 and May 2016 from 775 infants (≥ 36 weeks) were examined. Classification and regression tree model identified the most important subsets of the scored variables. A 9-element shortened scale yielded > 90% sensitivity and specificity to predict clinical endpoints based on the full 19-element MOTHER NAS score. Conversion of the data sets to the Finnegan score, and applying the same procedure resulted in a nine-element score with similar performance characteristics.

Conclusion

Shortened scoring instruments were identified with the high-predictive power for clinical endpoints based on the 19-element full MOTHER NAS score. There was no substantial variation in performance for age, supporting the current practice of utilizing a single scoring tool regardless of postnatal age.

### Opioid use in pregnant women and the increase in neonatal abstinence syndrome: what is the cost? [^111TkxoK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the length of stay for observation and treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), as well as the hospital costs associated with the medical care of affected newborns.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. Data were collected for newborns diagnosed with NAS, including their hospital length of stay and the associated hospital charges, from December 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011.

Results

One hundred-sixty eligible newborns were included in the study. During the 3-year study period, hospital charges related to the diagnosis and treatment of NAS increased from $1.1 million per year to $1.8 million per year. Compared with the cost of caring for newborns without the risk of NAS, an additional $4.1 million was spent in the medical care of these newborns.

Conclusions

The costs associated with treating newborns with NAS are exponentially higher than the costs associated with newborns not affected with NAS. The societal costs associated with treatment of newborns with NAS, as well as infant symptomatology experienced with NAS, can be reduced by encouraging physicians to be proactive in screening for drug use, urging women who use chronic opioids to actively engage in family planning and contraception, and encouraging pregnant women who use opioids to seek substance treatment.

### Association of a simplified finnegan neonatal abstinence scoring tool with the need for pharmacologic treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome [^1156c2yF]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Observer-rated scales, such as the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool (FNAST), are used to quantify the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and guide pharmacologic therapy. The FNAST, a comprehensive 21-item assessment tool, was developed for research and subsequently integrated into clinical practice; a simpler tool, designed to account for clinically meaningful outcomes, is urgently needed to standardize assessment.

Objectives

To identify FNAST items independently associated with the decision to use pharmacologic therapy and to simplify the FNAST while minimizing loss of information for the treatment decision.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multisite cohort study included 424 neonates with opioid exposure who had a gestational age of at least 36 weeks with follow-up from birth to hospital discharge in the derivation cohort and 109 neonates with opioid exposure from the Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research Study in the validation cohort. Neonates in the derivation cohort were included in a medical record review at the Universities of Louisville and Kentucky or in a randomized clinical trial and observational study conducted at Tufts University (2014–2018); the Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research was conducted from 2005 to 2008. Data analysis was conducted from May 2017 to August 2019.

Exposures

Prenatal opioid exposure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All FNAST items were dichotomized as present or not present, and logistic regression was used to identify binary items independently associated with pharmacologic treatment. The final model was validated with an independent cohort of neonates with opioid exposure.

Results

Among 424 neonates (gestational age, ≥ 36 weeks; 217 [51%] female infants), convulsions were not observed, and high-pitched cry and hyperactive Moro reflex had extremely different frequencies across cohorts. Therefore, these 3 FNAST items were removed from further analysis. The 2 tremor items were combined, and 8 of the remaining 17 items were independently associated with pharmacologic treatment, with an area under the curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82–0.89) compared with 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.94) for the 21-item FNAST. External validation of the 8 items resulted in an area under the curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79–0.93). Thresholds of 4 and 5 on the simplified scale yielded the closest agreement with FNAST thresholds of 8 and 12 (weighted κ = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.48–0.61).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that 8 signs of NAS may be sufficient to assess whether a neonate meets criteria for pharmacologic therapy. A focus on these signs could simplify the FNAST tool and may enhance its clinical utility.

### High-dose methadone in pregnant women and its effect on duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome [^112nHkbR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine high-dose methadone in pregnant women and its effect on the duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome.

Study Design

This was a retrospective chart review of 68 neonates and their mothers who received methadone therapy during pregnancy. The last dosage of maternal methadone just before delivery and the length of treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome were examined with an analysis of variance model.

Results

When the data were analyzed for methadone dosages as a continuous variable, each 1-mg increase in the last maternal methadone dosage before delivery was associated with an additional 0.18 days of infant treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome (P < .001; 95% CI, 0.112–0.255). In other words, every increase of 5.5 mg of methadone in the mother was associated statistically with 1 additional day of neonatal abstinence syndrome treatment for the infant. Gestational age at delivery and birthweight were not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Higher doses of maternal methadone were associated with an increase in diagnosis and longer duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome.

### Is maternal methadone dose associated with the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome? [^112S8AtE]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to assess the correlation between maternal methadone dose and severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in infants that required pharmacological treatment for NAS.

Study Design

This is a retrospective analysis of 574 infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation exposed to methadone in utero, born between August 2006 and May 2018, and who required pharmacological therapy for NAS. Indicators of NAS severity (duration of morphine treatment, maximum morphine dose, use of phenobarbital, and length of hospitalization) were compared between infants exposed to high (≥ 200mg), intermediate (100–199mg), and low doses (< 100mg) of methadone. Logistic and linear regression models were used to adjust for the covariates.

Results

Median (interquartile range) duration of medical treatment with morphine was higher in infants exposed to higher doses of methadone (low dose 23 [14–37] days, intermediate dose 31 [18–45] days, and high dose 35 [20–48] days, p < 0.001). Higher methadone doses were also predictive of longer duration of hospitalization, higher maximum morphine dose, and increased likelihood of treatment with phenobarbital. The association between maternal methadone dose and the severity of NAS persisted in multivariable regression models.

Conclusion

Infants exposed to higher methadone doses displayed more severe NAS, as indicated by longer durations of treatment, higher maximum morphine dose, longer duration of hospitalization, and increased likelihood of phenobarbital use.

Key Points

· Methadone maintenance therapy is used during pregnancy to control maternal withdrawal symptoms. · Relationship between maternal methadone dose and severity of NAS is not adequately investigated. · Increased doses of methadone during pregnancy correlate with increased severity of NAS.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^116MmCDH]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This expert literature review illustrates specific methodologies most frequently cited to define NAS in clinical studies of mothers, infants, and mother–infant dyads. Our findings raise a number of concerns about inconsistencies in the way NAS has been defined. A majority of studies cite a modified version of the Finnegan NAS scoring system or the use of administrative coding data as the preferred method to define NAS. However, both approaches present significant challenges.

First, with the use of scoring tools, the diagnosis is frequently dependent on the infant's score and linked to the infant's need for pharmacologic therapy for NAS. Diagnosis is therefore limited to infants meeting threshold scoring for therapeutic intervention. However, for opioid- or polysubstance-exposed infants not meeting minimum scoring criteria for the initiation of pharmacotherapy for NAS, the clinical diagnosis may vary depending on the preferences of providers and/or facilities, with some using the diagnosis of NAS to describe the clinical features seen in these infants and some not. Importantly, scoring assessments may also be influenced by inter-rater variability and are inherently subjective. Agreement on 90% of the scored elements is acceptable between raters using the original Finnegan NAS scoring system and achievement of this benchmark requires and relies on proper provider training and education. Without it, incorrect use of the scoring tool may result in errors in treatment and likewise could be similarly problematic for the linked question of NAS diagnosis.

Second, the use of medical claims data may reflect inter-coder differences in the assignment of diagnosis and billing codes for NAS. This method may also be subjective and not necessarily directly associated with the infant's clinical presentation. Though administrative data has been independently validated in identifying a clinical diagnosis of NAS with high positive predictive value, it often serves as a source of data for NAS surveillance and is prone to upstream variabilities in clinical diagnosis. In addition, a recent review examining NAS clinical and surveillance definitions at the state level revealed that only 3 of the 44 states participating in NAS-related data activities had both a specified clinical and surveillance definition in place. A subset of the remaining states had one or the other but not both. Since this report, there have been opportunities for states to transition to implementation of the CSTE surveillance definition, but the need for a specified clinical definition remains.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome after methadone or buprenorphine exposure [^112egyux]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Methadone, a full mu-opioid agonist, is the recommended treatment for opioid dependence during pregnancy. However, prenatal exposure to methadone is associated with a neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) characterized by central nervous system hyperirritability and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which often requires medication and extended hospitalization. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, is an alternative treatment for opioid dependence but has not been extensively studied in pregnancy.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, double-dummy, flexible-dosing, randomized, controlled study in which buprenorphine and methadone were compared for use in the comprehensive care of 175 pregnant women with opioid dependency at eight international sites. Primary outcomes were the number of neonates requiring treatment for NAS, the peak NAS score, the total amount of morphine needed to treat NAS, the length of the hospital stay for neonates, and neonatal head circumference.

Results

Treatment was discontinued by 16 of the 89 women in the methadone group (18%) and 28 of the 86 women in the buprenorphine group (33%). A comparison of the 131 neonates whose mothers were followed to the end of pregnancy according to treatment group (with 58 exposed to buprenorphine and 73 exposed to methadone) showed that the former group required significantly less morphine (mean dose, 1.1 mg vs. 10.4 mg; P < 0.0091), had a significantly shorter hospital stay (10.0 days vs. 17.5 days, P < 0.0091), and had a significantly shorter duration of treatment for the neonatal abstinence syndrome (4.1 days vs. 9.9 days, P < 0.003125) (P values calculated in accordance with prespecified thresholds for significance). There were no significant differences between groups in other primary or secondary outcomes or in the rates of maternal or neonatal adverse events.

Conclusions

These results are consistent with the use of buprenorphine as an acceptable treatment for opioid dependence in pregnant women. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00271219.).

### Does maternal buprenorphine dose affect severity or incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome? [^116QmfB7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure the incidence, onset, duration, and severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in infants born to mothers receiving buprenorphine and to assess the association between buprenorphine dose and NAS outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed charts of all mother-infant pairs maintained on buprenorphine who delivered in our hospital from January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2016.

Results

In 89 infants, NAS incidence requiring morphine was 43.8%. Means for morphine-treated infants included: 55.2hours to morphine start, 15.9 days on morphine, and 20 days hospital stay. NAS requiring morphine treatment occurred in 48.5% and 41.4% of infants of mothers receiving ≤ 8mg/d buprenorphine versus > 8mg/d, respectively (P = 0.39). We found no significant associations of maternal buprenorphine dose with peak NAS score, NAS severity requiring morphine, time to morphine start, peak morphine dose, or days on morphine. Among the other factors examined, only exclusive breastfeeding was significantly associated with neonatal outcomes, specifically lower odds of morphine treatment (odds ratio 0.24, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

These findings suggest higher buprenorphine doses can be prescribed to pregnant women receiving medication therapy for addiction without increasing NAS severity. Our finding of reduced risk of NAS requiring morphine treatment also suggests breastfeeding is both safe and beneficial for these infants and should be encouraged.

### Opioid treatment for opioid withdrawal in newborn infants [^1134C5ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opioid withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss, seizures and neurodevelopmental problems.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opioid for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opioids in newborn infants.

Search Methods

We ran an updated search on 17 September 2020 in CENTRAL via Cochrane Register of Studies Web and MEDLINE via Ovid. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and the reference lists of retrieved articles for eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi- and cluster-RCTs which enrolled infants born to mothers with opioid dependence and who were experiencing NAS requiring treatment with an opioid.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and independently extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 16 trials (1110 infants) with NAS secondary to maternal opioid use in pregnancy. Seven studies at low risk of bias were included in sensitivity analysis. Opioid versus no treatment / usual care: a single trial (80 infants) of morphine and supportive care versus supportive care alone reported no difference in treatment failure (risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 4.07; very low certainty evidence). No infant had a seizure. The trial did not report mortality, neurodevelopmental disability and adverse events. Morphine increased days hospitalisation (mean difference (MD) 15.00, 95% CI 8.86 to 21.14; very low certainty evidence) and treatment (MD 12.50, 95% CI 7.52 to 17.48; very low certainty evidence), but decreased days to regain birthweight (MD -2.80, 95% CI -5.33 to -0.27) and duration (minutes) of supportive care each day (MD -197.20, 95% CI -274.15 to -120.25). Morphine versus methadone: there was no difference in treatment failure (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.67; 2 studies, 147 infants; low certainty evidence). Seizures, neonatal or infant mortality and neurodevelopmental disability were not reported. A single study reported no difference in days hospitalisation (MD 1.40, 95% CI -3.08 to 5.88; 116 infants; low certainty evidence), whereas data from two studies found an increase in days treatment (MD 2.71, 95% CI 0.22 to 5.21; 147 infants; low certainty) for infants treated with morphine. A single study reported no difference in breastfeeding, adverse events, or out of home placement. Morphine versus sublingual buprenorphine: there was no difference in treatment failure (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.74; 3 studies, 113 infants; very low certainty evidence). Neonatal or infant mortality and neurodevelopmental disability were not reported. There was moderate certainty evidence of an increase in days hospitalisation (MD 11.45, 95% CI 5.89 to 17.01; 3 studies, 113 infants), and days treatment (MD 12.79, 95% CI 7.57 to 18.00; 3 studies, 112 infants) for infants treated with morphine. A single adverse event (seizure) was reported in infants exposed to buprenorphine. Morphine versus diluted tincture of opium (DTO): a single study (33 infants) reported no difference in days hospitalisation, days treatment or weight gain (low certainty evidence). Opioid versus clonidine: a single study (31 infants) reported no infant with treatment failure in either group. This study did not report seizures, neonatal or infant mortality and neurodevelopmental disability. There was low certainty evidence for no difference in days hospitalisation or days treatment. This study did not report adverse events. Opioid versus diazepam: there was a reduction in treatment failure from use of an opioid (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80; 2 studies, 86 infants; low certainty evidence). Seizures, neonatal or infant mortality and neurodevelopmental disability were not reported. A single study of 34 infants comparing methadone versus diazepam reported no difference in days hospitalisation or days treatment (very low certainty evidence). Adverse events were not reported. Opioid versus phenobarbital: there was a reduction in treatment failure from use of an opioid (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.74; 6 studies, 458 infants; moderate certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis found a reduction in treatment failure in trials titrating morphine to ≧ 0.5 mg/kg/day (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.45; 3 studies, 230 infants), whereas a single study using morphine < 0.5 mg/kg/day reported no difference compared to use of phenobarbital (subgroup difference P = 0.05). Neonatal or infant mortality and neurodevelopmental disability were not reported. A single study (111 infants) of paregoric versus phenobarbital reported seven infants with seizures in the phenobarbital group, whereas no seizures were reported in two studies (170 infants) comparing morphine to phenobarbital. There was no difference in days hospitalisation or days treatment. A single study (96 infants) reported no adverse events in either group. Opioid versus chlorpromazine: there was a reduction in treatment failure from use of morphine versus chlorpromazine (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62; 1 study, 90 infants; moderate certainty evidence). No seizures were reported in either group. There was low certainty evidence for no difference in days treatment. This trial reported no adverse events in either group. None of the included studies reported time to control of NAS. Data for duration and severity of NAS were limited, and we were unable to use these data in quantitative synthesis.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to supportive care alone, the addition of an opioid may increase duration of hospitalisation and treatment, but may reduce days to regain birthweight and the duration of supportive care each day. Use of an opioid may reduce treatment failure compared to phenobarbital, diazepam or chlorpromazine. Use of an opioid may have little or no effect on duration of hospitalisation or treatment compared to use of phenobarbital, diazepam or chlorpromazine. The type of opioid used may have little or no effect on the treatment failure rate. Use of buprenorphine probably reduces duration of hospitalisation and treatment compared to morphine, but there are no data for time to control NAS with buprenorphine, and insufficient evidence to determine safety. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of clonidine.

### Infant and maternal characteristics in neonatal abstinence syndrome – selected hospitals in Florida, 2010–2011 [^113g6Yrs]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a constellation of physiologic and neurobehavioral signs exhibited by newborns exposed to addictive prescription or illicit drugs taken by a mother during pregnancy. The number of hospital discharges of newborns diagnosed with NAS has increased more than 10-fold (from 0.4 to 4.4 discharges per 1,000 live births) in Florida since 1995, far exceeding the three-fold increase observed nationally. In February 2014, the Florida Department of Health requested the assistance of CDC to 1) assess the accuracy and validity of using Florida's hospital inpatient discharge data, linked to birth and infant death certificates, as a means of NAS surveillance and 2) describe the characteristics of infants with NAS and their mothers. This report focuses only on objective two, describing maternal and infant characteristics in the 242 confirmed NAS cases identified in three Florida hospitals during a 2-year period (2010–2011). Infants with NAS experienced serious medical complications, with 97.1% being admitted to an intensive care unit, and had prolonged hospital stays, with a mean duration of 26.1 days. The findings of this investigation underscore the important public health problem of NAS and add to current knowledge on the characteristics of these mothers and infants. Effective June 2014, NAS is now a mandatory reportable condition in Florida. Interventions are also needed to 1) increase the number and use of community resources available to drug-abusing and drug-dependent women of reproductive age, 2) improve drug addiction counseling and rehabilitation referral and documentation policies, and 3) link women to these resources before or earlier in pregnancy.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^113rNiMN]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Keyword search terms

For design of the initial keyword search, the World Health Organization Guidelines for the Identification and Management of Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders in Pregnancy and the American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Report: Neonatal Drug Withdrawal were referenced. Based on these two guideline documents, the EP generated a broad keyword search with the following terms: NAS and NOWS, clinical signs/symptoms/diagnosis, opioids, specific types of opioids (e.g. buprenorphine, methadone, morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, heroin), infant/newborn, withdrawal, urine/meconium/umbilical cord/hair, and the most common assessment tools, such as: (1) the Finnegan NAS scoring system, (2) modified versions of the Finnegan, (3) the Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) assessment tool, and (4) the Lipsitz Neonatal Drug Withdrawal Scoring System. Of note, during the full-text review phase of this process (see below), no additional assessment tools were identified as in use for defining/diagnosing NAS or NOWS. In September 2019, an environmental scan using these keywords was carried out to gain insight on the breadth of literature in this subject area. Although this preliminary scan yielded a high volume of abstracts (n = 2817; data not shown), there was lower specificity for the primary research question (identifying specific criteria used to define NAS). It is important to note that the keyword "opioids" was utilized to retrieve any occurrence of opioids in combination with the described terms. However, retrieved abstracts were found to demonstrate low topical relevance. Thus this term was then removed in order to develop an appropriately focused keyword search.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^113dYneu]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Categorization of abstracts

The abstract inclusion process yielded a number of different types of comparative studies, presenting the need to sort abstracts for a more structured review by category. Accounting for individual study types, most abstracts sorted into three distinct types of study design and thus were categorized into comparison groups as follows: (1) studies focused on infants with a diagnosis of NAS vs those without NAS (this definition varied by study, typically described as non-opioid exposed or matched healthy infants), (2) studies designed to examine different types of maternal medications and/or exposures, and (3) studies investigating one infant treatment paradigm compared to another. Abstracts were divided into these three structured categories for subsequent full-text review based on the rationale that these different study types/points of focus may preferentially involve one assessment tool over another (see "Results" below for more detail). A subset of 5 abstracts contained studies with comparison groups that did not match to groups 1–3 and were grouped into a fourth "other" category. As an added measure to limit the effects of inter-reviewer variability, categorized abstracts selected by the FSC (n = 67) underwent a second review by the EP to reassess for adherence to inclusion criteria. This iterative review resulted in agreement on all abstracts recommended by the FSC and EP with the exception of three abstracts. A final review conducted through our internal fidelity process determined that the abstracts in question did not fully adhere to inclusion criteria and were removed. Two of the removed abstracts were conference proceedings, one was determined not to have a defined comparison group (one additional abstract was subsequently found to be an oral abstract and removed). Sixty-three abstracts were advanced for full-text review. Further refining this set, group 1 had 3 articles that were removed as secondary analyses from 1 trial (the Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research (MOTHER) trial). While each of these articles had a distinct focus, they originated from the same dataset using the same clinical definition of NAS. Five articles were removed from group 2 that also represented secondary analyses stemming from the MOTHER trial.

### Differences in the profile of neonatal abstinence syndrome signs in methadone-versus buprenorphine-exposed neonates [^112Vu9T6]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the profile of signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in methadone- versus buprenorphine-exposed infants.

Design, Setting and Participants

Secondary analysis of NAS data from a multi-site, double-blind, double-dummy, flexible-dosing, randomized clinical trial. Data from a total of 129 neonates born to opioid-dependent women who had been assigned to receive methadone or buprenorphine treatment during pregnancy were examined.

Measurements

For 10 days after delivery, neonates (methadone = 72, buprenorphine = 57) were assessed regularly using a 19-item modified Finnegan scale. Data from neonates who required pharmacological treatment (methadone = 41, buprenorphine = 27) were included up to the time treatment was initiated. The incidence and mean severity of the total NAS score and each individual sign of NAS were calculated and compared between medication conditions, as was the median time until morphine treatment initiation among treated infants in each condition.

Findings

Two NAS signs (undisturbed tremors and hyperactive Moro reflex) were observed significantly more frequently in methadone-exposed neonates and three (nasal stuffiness, sneezing, loose stools) were observed more frequently in buprenorphine-exposed neonates. Mean severity scores on the total NAS score and five individual signs (disturbed and undisturbed tremors, hyperactive Moro reflex, excessive irritability, failure to thrive) were significantly higher among methadone-exposed neonates, while sneezing was higher among buprenorphine-exposed neonates. Among treated neonates, methadone-exposed infants required treatment significantly earlier than buprenorphine-exposed infants (36 versus 59 hours postnatal, respectively).

Conclusions

The profile of neonatal abstinence syndrome differs in methadone- versus buprenorphine-exposed neonates, with significant differences in incidence, severity and treatment initiation time. Overall, methadone-exposed neonates have a more severe neonatal abstinence syndrome.

### Association of a simplified finnegan neonatal abstinence scoring tool with the need for pharmacologic treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome [^111pA5HW]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

When the FNAST and simplified FNAST scores were categorized according to treatment cutoffs, the agreement was only moderate (weighted κ = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.48–0.61). There are 2 cutoffs for the original FNAST that were predetermined at 8 and 12 points, leaving little room to set the simplified FNAST thresholds to optimize agreement. In practice, the treatment decision is based on frequent assessments, not a single score. Because there is no criterion standard, there is currently no method for determining whether an algorithm based on the original FNAST or the 8-item version would yield better clinical outcomes.

The model did not select some signs because they occurred infrequently or almost always and hence were not useful in predicting pharmacologic treatment for NAS. Not every item that was associated with the outcome in univariate analyses made it into the final logistic regression model. Having a high odds ratio in a univariate analysis does not ensure retention in a multivariable model if an item is associated with other items and/or the confidence interval is wide. Signs that were absent from the final model may still be clinically important, although they do not have to be checked to make a treatment decision.

### A new scoring system for the assessment of neonatal abstinence syndrome [^114X5cmt]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the concordance of a new scoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and NAS scores to the traditional Modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool (M-FNAST) score. The NAS score is based on the physiology of withdrawal, with equal emphasis on behavior, and neurological signs.

Study Design

The NAS scores for a control group of 202 healthy, term neonates were compared with those for 45 term neonates with NAS. The NAS and M-FNAST scores obtained simultaneously in 45 term neonates with NAS were compared using correlation, linear regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to determine the validity, reliability, and specificity of the NAS scores.

Results

The association between the NAS and M-FNAST scores was high (Spearman's correlation, 83%; linear regression, 83%), with an area under the curve of the NAS score of 1.00 (p < 0.01). A cut-off NAS score ≥ 4 identified NAS neonates with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%. The values of intraclass correlation, interrater agreement, and Cronbach's α were 0.63, 0.88, and 0.63, respectively.

Conclusion

The new NAS scoring system is valid, reliable, physiologically based, and correlates closely with the M-FNAST score. The NAS scores may require further validation before its use in clinical practice.

### Association of a simplified finnegan neonatal abstinence scoring tool with the need for pharmacologic treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome [^114UsCjY]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The medical and nonmedical use of opioids in the United States has increased significantly during the last decade. Opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy increased from 1.5 per 1000 live births to 6.5 per 1000 live births between 1999 and 2014. Antenatal exposure to opioids has led to a 5-fold rise in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) between 2004 and 2014, a number that continues to increase. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a withdrawal syndrome that occurs after the interruption of the passive transfer of maternal opioids at the time of birth. The diagnosis of NAS is dependent on the presence of key signs of withdrawal, with severity being highly variable. Every neonate exposed to opioids in utero is somewhere along the continuum of withdrawal. While some neonates have mild signs and normal physiologic functions, others have more severe NAS that requires pharmacologic treatment to avoid major complications. Differences in the expression of NAS is associated with many factors, including the type(s) of opioid exposure, coexposure with other illicit drugs and/or psychotropic medications, genetic and epigenetic variability, the gestational age and sex of the neonate, breastfeeding, and parental engagement.,

Observer-rated scales have been used for more than 40 years to assess the severity of NAS and guide the initiation and adjustment of pharmacologic therapy. Differences between raters in the assessment of NAS have been associated with significant differences in initiation and duration of pharmacologic therapy, length of hospital stay, and health care utilization. The Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool (FNAST) is commonly used for the assessment of neonates with NAS. It is a screening tool that comprises 21 items, with many items having 2 to 4 subcategories and weighting for each category, which varies from 1 to 5. Although differences among raters have been observed with the use of the FNAST, these rater differences can be minimized with a comprehensive educational approach that optimizes and then maintains interobserver reliability. Several tools have been developed to shorten and simplify the FNAST, but existing studies are limited by small cohorts that lack generalizability, study samples that do not differentiate between neonates with and without pharmacologic treatment, and a lack of external validation of the findings.

### Growth during the first year in infants affected by neonatal abstinence syndrome [^114oXVLX]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 2 displays individual growth trajectories of patients with NAS and their matched counterparts, while Fig. 3 shows the estimated percentile curves of weight as a function of time after birth for NAS patients and matched controls. Percentile estimates were generally similar between groups, although the 10th and 90th percentiles were wider for NAS patients. However, no differences were statistically significant between groups for any percentile.

Fig. 2
Individual growth trajectories of weight for patients with neonatal abstinence syndrome (left) and matched comparison patients (right) show similar growth patterns

Fig. 3
Estimated percentile curves for patients with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and their matched comparison patients show similar growth patterns between patients with and without NAS

In a subgroup analysis, Fig. 4 shows the percentile curves of patients with a diagnosis of NAS who received pharmacologic therapy (N = 34) and those who did not (N = 36). Differences between groups were non-significant for each percentile. In a separate subgroup analysis, Fig. 5 shows percentile curves of patients with NAS requiring pharmacologic therapy and matched controls. Differences were again non-significant.

### Improving care for neonatal abstinence syndrome [^117D9QKZ]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Care for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a postnatal drug withdrawal syndrome, remains variable. We designed and implemented a multicenter quality improvement collaborative for infants with NAS. Our objective was to determine if the collaborative was effective in standardizing hospital policies and improving patient outcomes.

Methods

From 2012 to 2014, data were collected through serial cross-sectional audits of participating centers. Hospitals assessed institutional policies and patient-level data for infants with NAS requiring pharmacotherapy, including length of pharmacologic treatment and length of hospital stay (LOS). Models were fit, clustered according to hospital, to evaluate changes in patient outcomes over time.

Results

Among 199 participating centers, the mean number of NAS-focused guidelines increased from 3.7 to 5.1 of a possible 6 (P < .001), with improvements noted in all measured domains. Among infants cared for at participating centers, decreases occurred in median (interquartile range) length of pharmacologic treatment, from 16 days (10 to 27 days) to 15 days (10 to 24 days; p = 0.02), and LOS from 21 days (14 to 33 days) to 19 days (15 to 28 days; p = 0.002). In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of infants discharged on medication for NAS, from 39.7% to 26.5% (P = 0.02). After adjusting for potential confounders, standardized NAS scoring process was associated with shorter LOS (-3.3 days,95% confidence interval, -4.9 to -1.4).

Conclusions

Involvement in a multicenter, multistate quality improvement collaborative focused on infants requiring pharmacologic treatment for NAS was associated with increases in standardizing hospital patient care policies and decreases in health care utilization.

### The effect of methadone dose regimen on neonatal abstinence syndrome [^1122XQbu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of a multiple daily dose methadone regimen in pregnancy on neonatal outcomes.

Methods

Although methadone maintenance has been the standard for the treatment of opioid dependence in pregnancy, there is no consensus on proper dosing. Single daily dosing is the most common strategy. Because of accelerated metabolism of methadone in pregnancy, this regimen may expose mother and fetus to daily episodes of withdrawal and possibly contribute to more severe Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). This study reports on a protocol that increased both methadone dose and dose frequency in response to maternal reports of withdrawal.

Results

Treatment of NAS was needed in 29% of neonates, compared to a published rate of 60% to 80%. The mean methadone dose was 152 mg at delivery, divided into 2 to 6 doses per day. Ninety-two percent of mothers were free of illicit drug use at delivery. There was no relationship between methadone dose and treatment of NAS. Female babies had a treatment rate of 16% versus 38% for male babies. Beyond abstinence symptoms, cohort outcomes in terms of gestational age, birth weight, prematurity, Caesarian sections, and breastfeeding equaled or approximated US population norms.

Conclusions

The protocol was associated with low rates of treatment of NAS and high rates of maternal recovery. High rates of treatment for NAS reported in methadone-exposed neonates might relate in part to iatrogenic factors and be reduced through the use of divided daily doses and protocols that minimize maternal withdrawal.

### Effectiveness of a clinical pathway with methadone treatment protocol for treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome following in utero drug exposure to substances of abuse* [^11359iuv]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of methadone for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome when used according to a preexisting clinical pathway.

Design

This is a 3-year retrospective study conducted at a single institution. In this study, neonates who received methadone for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome according to a predefined clinical treatment pathway were evaluated for treatment success: defined as adherence to the methadone regimen with no residual signs of withdrawal. Data were collected for methadone dosages, Lipsitz scores, length of methadone treatment, total length of hospital stay, and relevant clinical data.

Setting

Level III neonatal ICU.

Patients

Newborn infants with in utero exposure to substances of abuse.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Sixty patients were included. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 37.07 ± 3.05 weeks and 2.77 ± 0.6 kg. All 60 patients exhibited neonatal abstinence syndrome within first 72 hours of life. Fifty-seven of 60 patients (95%) initiated methadone treatment according to protocol. There was deviation from the protocol at 48 and 72 hours of treatment with approximately 59% and 13% of the patients still on methadone at more than the prescribed amount to control neonatal abstinence syndrome. The mean ± SD total methadone exposure was 1.99 ± 1.63 mg/kg, length of treatment 11.66 ± 9.02 days, and total hospital length of stay 22.43 ± 29.3 days, suggesting significant variability in response. No significant correlation was found between birth weight or gestational age and length of treatment.

Conclusion

Clinical pathway for treating neonatal abstinence syndrome was closely followed at the initial diagnosis. The doses of methadone used in the first 24–48 hours of this study were insufficient for adequate symptom control. Despite a formal treatment protocol, there was substantial variability in total methadone exposure, length of treatment, and length of stay, suggesting other contributory factors for the observed variability.

### "Is eat, sleep, console the key to safer and faster discharge for newborns with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome? " [^112TYS5R]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a growing clinical concern characterized by a constellation of withdrawal symptoms in newborns exposed to prenatal opioids. The incidence of NAS has surged in recent decades, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Traditional management focused on partially subjective FNASS/MFSS assessments has led to extensive pharmacologic intervention. The Eat, Sleep, Console method emphasizes functional assessments to support infant neurobehavior and reduce opioid treatment.

The incidence of NAS in the United States has risen nearly fivefold, from 1.2 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 7.3 per 1000 births in 2017 in conjunction with the burgeoning opioid epidemic, leading to more infants requiring medical attention for withdrawal symptoms. The average length of stay for infants treated for NAS based on the use of the FNASS/MFSS is approximately 23 days. The combined effects of prolonged hospitalizations, intensive monitoring, and treatment needs place an estimated annual burden of $1.5 billion on the healthcare system.

Over the past 50 years, the management of NAS has evolved significantly. Initially, the FNASS, developed in the 1970s, guided pharmacologic treatment based on 21 clinical signs of withdrawal. Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended a two-tiered approach emphasizing first-line non-pharmacologic care. Dr. Matthew Grossman at Yale University introduced the ESC method in 2014, which focused on the infant's ability to eat, sleep, and be consoled, rather than the number or severity of withdrawal symptoms which can be subjective. This method has been shown to reduce the need for opioid treatment and shorten hospital stays.

The ACT NOW trial used a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge design, with hospitals randomly assigned times to transition to the Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) approach. By randomizing at the hospital level but analyzing outcomes at the infant level, the trial could assess individual outcomes like time to discharge while accounting for site-level influences. To address clustering within hospitals, where infants might experience similar outcomes due to shared care practices, the analysis included a site-specific random intercept. This adjustment helped capture differences among hospitals, such as resources, staff expertise, and protocols. Fixed effects for intervention and time were also applied, controlling for the staggered ESC rollout and isolating the intervention's effect.

### A state-level study of opioid use disorder treatment access and neonatal abstinence syndrome [^1128sfTF]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a drug withdrawal syndrome experienced by newborns whose mothers have taken opioids or other substances during pregnancy. Opioids that can cause NAS include illicit substances (e.g. heroin) as well as legally prescribed medications (e.g. oxycodone, methadone and buprenorphine). It is estimated that 60–80% of infants exposed to opioids develop NAS. Clinical manifestations of acute NAS include irritability, hypertonicity, jitteriness, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Moderate to severe NAS (27–91% of cases) requires treatment with opioids such as morphine and methadone. The need for additional monitoring and treatment of NAS results in prolonged hospital stays and high medical costs.

Concurrent with the surge in adult opioid use across the United States, the incidence of NAS has also increased dramatically — from 1.5 per 1000 hospital births in 1999 to 14.4 per 1000 in 2014. The incidence of NAS varies more than 30-fold between states; ranging from 0.7 cases per 1000 live births in Hawaii to 33.4 per 1000 in West Virginia. There are two primary long-acting oral opioids that are used for adult opioid use disorder treatment: methadone and buprenorphine. Methadone is typically given in observed clinical settings, whereas buprenorphine is typically taken by patients in their own homes. There is growing use of buprenorphine in pregnant women as infants born to women taking buprenorphine have better outcomes (e.g.: length of stay, birth weight) compared with infants born to women taking methadone. Since the medicines that are used for treating opioid use disorder in pregnant women (e.g. methadone and buprenorphine) can also result in NAS, the relationship between opioid use disorder treatment access and NAS is not yet well understood. Furthermore, it has been difficult to compare rates of NAS between infants of mothers using illicit drugs such as heroin and those using prescribed medications for opioid use disorder such as methadone and buprenorphine. Randomized controlled trials on this topic are considered unethical and it is challenging to control for factors that might influence a pregnant woman's enrollment in an opioid use disorder treatment program within observational studies.

### Association of maternal buprenorphine or methadone dose with fetal growth indices and neonatal abstinence syndrome [^113NAmT6]. American Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to compare fetal growth and incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring treatment across pregnant women with opioid use disorders on two types and two dose categories of medication-assisted treatment.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a comprehensive, perinatal program in western North Carolina comparing growth percentiles on third-trimester ultrasound and at birth, and diagnosis of neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring treatment. Singletons were exposed in utero to low- to moderate-dose buprenorphine (≤ 16mg/day; n = 70), high-dose buprenorphine (≥ 17mg/day; n = 36), low- to moderate-dose methadone (≤ 89mg/day; n = 41), or high-dose methadone (≥ 90mg/day; n = 74). Multivariate analysis of variance with posthoc Bonferroni comparisons (p ≤ 0.01) and multinomial logistic regressions (adjusted odds ratio, 99% confidence interval) were conducted.

Results

Differences in neonatal outcomes reached statistical significance for larger head circumference for buprenorphine doses (p = 0.01) and for longer length (p < 0.01) and lower odds of neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring treatment (p < 0.01) with low- to moderate-dose buprenorphine versus high-dose methadone.

Conclusion

Among pregnant women using medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders, low- to moderate-dose buprenorphine (≤ 16mg/day) was associated with the most favorable neonatal outcomes. However, more rigorous control of confounders with a larger sample is necessary to determine if low- to moderate-dose buprenorphine is the better treatment choice.

### Exposure to prescription opioid analgesics in utero and risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome: population based cohort study [^112aE5sc]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this large population based cohort study, we observed a low absolute risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome after in utero exposure to prescription opioids in the absence of additional risk factors. The absolute risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome after in utero exposure to prescription opioids was highest in the presence of history of opioid misuse or dependence, followed by alcohol or other drug misuse, exposure to non-opioid psychotropic medications, and smoking. Long term use of prescription opioids during pregnancy compared with short term use and use in late pregnancy compared with early pregnancy increased risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome independent of additional risk factors.

Comparison with other studies

The current study expands upon our limited understanding of the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome in infants after use of prescription opioids by mothers during pregnancy. To date, this outcome has been evaluated only in one cohort study of 167 pregnant women with long term use of prescription opioids (defined as use for at least 30 days) and that study noted incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 5.6% of the delivered infants. The corresponding number in our study is 2.4% (810 cases/34 111 long term users combined across the five groups). This difference in magnitude may be because of dissimilar prevalence of other risk factors for neonatal abstinence syndrome between the two studies. Additionally, in the previous study, ascertainment of neonatal abstinence syndrome occurred on the basis of clinical parameters by neonatology staff, while in the current study ascertainment was based on ICD-9 codes. Therefore, the difference may also be due to the severity of the cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome; we expect the neonatal abstinence syndrome ICD-9 code to be applied in circumstances in which neonatal abstinence syndrome affects the clinical course of the affected infant, whereas the earlier study may classify very mild cases as neonatal abstinence syndrome based on sensitive clinical parameters.

### A management strategy that reduces NICU admissions and decreases charges from the front line of the neonatal abstinence syndrome epidemic [^114oAwty]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective:

The purpose of this study was to test a specialized needs-based management model for a high volume of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) while controlling costs and reducing neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) bed usage.

Study Design:

Data were analyzed from inborn neonates > 35 weeks' gestational age with the diagnosis of NAS (ICD9-CM 779.5), requiring pharmacologic treatment and discharged from 2010 through 2015. Significance was determined using Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney as well as χ 2 for trend.

Results:

NAS requiring medication treatment increased from 34.1 per 1000 live births in 2010 to 94.3 per 1000 live births in 2015 (P < 0.0001 for trend). Hospital charges were significantly different in the three described locations (P < 0.0001). Median per patient hospital charges for medically treated NAS were $90 601 (interquartile range (IQR) $64 489 to $128 135) for NAS patients managed in the NICU, $68 750 (IQR $44 952 to $92 548) for those managed in an in-hospital dedicated unit and $17 688 (IQR $9933 to $20 033) for those cared for in an outpatient neonatal withdrawal center. NICU admission was avoided in 78% of the population once both alternative locations were fully implemented.

Conclusions:

In this cohort of infants, a 219% increase in the number of infants treated for NAS overwhelmed the capacity of our traditional resources. There was a need to develop new treatment approaches dealing with the NAS crisis and a growing population of prenatally exposed babies. We found that the described model of care significantly reduced charges and stabilized admissions to our NICU despite the marked increase in cases. Without this system, our NICU would be in a critical state of gridlock and diversion; instead, we have efficient management of a large NAS population.

### Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants [^111yQJip]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opiates.

Search Strategy

The previous review was updated with additional searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966-December 2004) and EMBASE (1980-December 2004) supplemented by searches of conference abstracts and citation lists of published articles.

Selection Criteria

Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to opiate or control. Control could include an opiate, sedative or non-pharmacological treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included control of symptoms, seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model.

Main Results

Seven studies enrolling a total of 585 infants met inclusion criteria (Carin 1983; Finnegan 1984; Jackson 2004; Kaltenbach 1986; Kandall 1983; Khoo 1995; Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984; Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies; sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four studies; and imbalances in group characteristics after randomisation in one study. Opiate (morphine) vs supportive care only: One study (Khoo 1995) found no significant effect on treatment failure (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a significant increase in hospital stay (MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and significant reductions in time to regain birthweight (MD -2.8 days, 95% -5.3, -0.3) and duration of supportive care (MD -197.2 minutes/day, 95% CI -274.2, -120.3). Opiate vs phenobarbitone: Meta-analysis of four studies found no significant difference in treatment failure (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51, 1.11). One of these studies (Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used only opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be interpreted with caution. One study (Jackson 2004) reported a significant reduction in duration of treatment and admission to the nursery for infants receiving morphine compared to phenobarbitone. One study (Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate. Opiate vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of opiate. No study reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group.

Authors' Conclusions

Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbitone, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery admission for infants on morphine. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^113Twutb]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Pie charts summarizing abstracted findings collapsed across the three comparison groups.

A Studies were evaluated for administrative vs clinical methodology cited to define NAS, described as: Administrative: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10), vs Clinical: the Finnegan NAS scoring system, modified versions of the Finnegan, Eat Sleep Console (ESC) and Lipsitz. B Breakdown of the total number of studies relying on each of the assessment tools. C Representation of the total number of studies considering opioid exposure of mother and/or infant as part of participant eligibility and/or inclusion criteria.

Most articles included in our review fell into 3 different categories of participant comparison groups: (1) NAS vs control, (2) maternal exposure type, (3) infant treatment type, and a fourth "other" category of articles that did not sort into groups 1–3. For group 1, 71% (10/14) of studies cited use of administrative coding data as a determinant for the NAS definition. This is traditionally seen with insurance claims data and/or other large billing data sources. Studies within this collective group examined clinical, developmental, socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare utilization characteristics between children diagnosed with NAS compared to those who were not. The majority of studies in group 1 (64%; 9/14) did not include opioid exposure for mother or infant as part of their inclusion criteria. For group 2, 100% (18/18) of studies emphasized opioid exposure as part of their inclusion criteria. Studies within this group collectively examined neonatal outcomes in the setting of maternal exposure to opioids and/or maternal medication for opioid use disorder. For group 3, most studies 81% (17/21) cited use of clinical methodologies in defining NAS, including opioid exposure in 76% (16/21). These studies collectively examined neonatal outcomes in the setting of different treatment options for NAS, including supportive non-pharmacologic and pharmacotherapeutic approaches. For group 4, 2 articles examined sex differences in infants diagnosed with NAS, 1 examined allelic differences and NAS outcomes, and 1 study investigated NAS in preterm vs term infants. Three of the 4 (75%) studies in group 4 included opioid exposure in their participant inclusion criteria.

### Treat and manage infants affected by prenatal opioid exposure… [^115AJfFS]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Neonatal abstinence syndrome can occur during a newborn's withdrawal from certain substances they were exposed to before birth.
- Treatment for NAS depends on many factors like type of exposure, infant health, and length of term.
- Families with infants treated for NAS should receive a Plan of Safe Care from the healthcare team. Treatment overview Neonatal abstinence syndrome conditions result from newborns' withdrawal from certain substances that they were exposed to before birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome is a subset of NAS and is specific to opioid withdrawal during the first 28 days of life. The American Academy of Pediatrics' Clinical Report Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome provides guidelines for managing the care of infants with long-term opioid exposure during pregnancy.

Treatment for NAS depends on many factors, including:

- Opioids or other medicines the newborn was exposed to during pregnancy
- Newborn's overall health
- Whether the infant was born full-term When signs of NOWS are first identified, care that involves and supports the mother is very important. The infant may need treatment with medication if there is no improvement or if the infant develops severe withdrawal. Other strategies for managing NAS include:

- Placing the infant in a dark, quiet area to lessen both light and sound
- Swaddling the infant
- Gently rocking the infant or using other positioning or comforting methods
- Providing frequent, small amounts of high-calorie formula or breast milk to help with feeding problems
- Allowing the infant to stay in the same hospital room as the mother.

Managing NAS with medication Some babies, especially those with more severe withdrawal signs, may need medications, such as liquid oral morphine or liquid oral methadone, in addition to the other care strategies listed above that do not include the use of medicines. Medicines can help prevent seizures, improve feeding, stop diarrhea, decrease agitation, and control other severe symptoms. Once the signs of withdrawal seem to be controlled, the dosage of medication is gradually decreased. Babies being treated for NAS with medicines may need to stay longer in the hospital after birth.

### Evaluation of state-mandated reporting of neonatal abstinence… [^1158TWFi]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

1). NAS is a drug withdrawal syndrome that most commonly occurs among infants after in utero exposure to opioids, although other substances have also been associated with NAS. Prenatal opioid exposure has also been associated with poor fetal growth, preterm birth, stillbirth, and possible specific birth defects. Variability was found in the type and number of surveillance data elements reported and in how states used NAS surveillance data. Following implementation, five states with identified laws reported receiving NAS case reports within 30 days of diagnosis. Mandated NAS case reporting allowed SHDs to quantify the incidence of NAS in their states and to inform programs and services. This information might be useful to states considering implementing mandatory NAS surveillance. Georgia's 2017 law also requires any medical provider who has diagnosed an infant with NAS to report the case to the SHD and the SHD to report cases to the state legislature.

Georgia's and Virginia's laws define NAS, whereas the other four states' laws do not. Arizona's law specifies data elements to be collected. State laws vary in the required time frame for case reporting from "at the time of diagnosis" to within 6 months after diagnosis. Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia reported that education of providers and hospital staff members on NAS case reporting requirements is one of the more resource-intensive activities related to NAS case reporting. Arizona reported collecting missing data and training staff members on data entry and record review as challenges that require additional staffing resources.

Other challenges reported by state officials include staff member turnover at hospitals and birthing centers, which could result in gaps in reporting, and the requirement that all facilities that provide care to an infant with NAS have to report the case, which poses the potential for duplicate reporting if an infant is transferred to another facility. Mandated NAS case reporting might improve states' ability to calculate more timely estimates of the incidence of NAS in their jurisdictions, identify opportunities for prevention, and facilitate linkages to care for infants and mothers. With more accurate and timely estimates of disease incidence, health systems and health care providers might be better prepared to ensure that adequate resources exist to address the immediate and potential long-term needs of children born with NAS and mothers.

A standardized case definition for NAS and consistent reporting approaches will improve the ability to make meaningful comparisons between states and target prevention efforts to areas of greatest need. Corresponding author: Jennita Reefhuis, nzr5@cdc. gov; 404–498–3917.

### Assessment of neonatal abstinence syndrome… [^112pRQpZ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Infants with confirmed NAS who were not assigned code P96. 1 typically had less severe signs and symptoms. Accurate NAS surveillance, which is necessary to monitor changes and regional differences in incidence and assist with planning for needed services, includes and is strengthened by a combination of diagnosis code assessment and focused medical record review. However, infants assigned P96. 1 were more likely than were those not assigned P96. 1 to have mothers enrolled in Medicaid, significantly longer lengths of stay, older ages at first NAS score, higher first NAS scores; therefore, information on all infants with toxicologic evidence of exposure might warrant review when conducting NAS surveillance. Therefore, these data suggest that using both diagnosis code assessment and focused medical record review as case-finding methods, though the latter might be labor intensive, would most accurately identify infants with NAS.

Notably, in this investigation, this strategy relied on reviewing medical records of a selected group of infants with diagnosis codes indicative of prenatal substance exposure or a NAS symptom, and not only NAS diagnosis codes. Additional work is needed to identify the optimal subset of codes to identify possible infants with NAS (. § Signs and symptoms include tremors, breathing problems, blotchy skin, diarrhea, crying, fever, fussiness, gagging or retching, hiccups, hyperactive or exaggerated Moro reflex, frequent yawning, overactive reflexes, poor feeding, salivation, seizures, skin abrasions or excoriation, slow weight gain, sneezing, stuffy nose, suckling issues, sweating, vomiting, increased muscle tone, trouble sleeping, and any other symptom attributed to NAS by a clinician.

### Incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome-28 States, 1999–2013… [^11683Va3]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a postnatal drug withdrawal syndrome in newborns caused primarily by in utero exposure to opioids. In the United States, the incidence of NAS increased 383% during 2000–2012, and an estimated 80% of hospital charges for NAS are covered by state Medicaid programs. Altmetric: Citations: Views: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Figure Table Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a postnatal drug withdrawal syndrome that occurs primarily among opioid-exposed infants shortly after birth, often manifested by central nervous system irritability, autonomic overreactivity, and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction to 3. 6 per 1, 000 births. NAS is a postnatal withdrawal syndrome that comprises a constellation of symptoms in newborns, including central nervous system irritability, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and temperature instability. Although other substances have been implicated, NAS is most often attributed to in utero opioid exposure. This exposure can result from maternal prescription opioid use, which has increased nationally in recent years, nonmedical opioid use, or medication-assisted treatment, which is long-term treatment with a longer acting but less euphoric opioid under medical supervision for opioid use disorder.

Data on long-term developmental outcomes related to opioid exposure during pregnancy and NAS are limited. Cases of possible iatrogenic withdrawal, resulting from complications related to prolonged neonatal intensive care stay and not exposure during the antenatal period, were excluded from the numerator.

### Implementation of a statewide surveillance system for neonatal abstinence syndrome-Tennessee, 2013… [^116H8rhr]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

NAS is a withdrawal syndrome experienced by infants shortly after birth. The syndrome most commonly occurs after antenatal exposure to opioids, although other medications have also been implicated. From 2000 to 2009, the incidence rate of NAS in Tennessee increased from 0. 7 to
5. 1 per 1, 000 births, exceeding the national average, which increased from 1. 2 to
3. 4 per 1, 000 births. NAS is associated with numerous morbidities for the infant, including low birth weight, poor feeding, and respiratory problems. Previous population-based analyses of NAS relied on hospital discharge data, which typically become available for analysis only after substantial delay. In Tennessee, the rising incidence of NAS and its associated public health burden created an urgent need for timelier incidence figures to drive policy and prevention efforts.

TDH advised hospitals to report cases in which a diagnosis of NAS was assigned to an infant based on a clinical withdrawal syndrome, with symptoms such as feeding difficulty, sleep disturbance, hyperirritability, or seizures. Hospitals were also asked to report data on history of exposure as well as evidence of exposure to support the diagnosis based on clinical signs. A provisional comparison of the total number of cases reported during the first 6 months through this surveillance system with counts from hospital discharge data during the same period showed that the surveillance system captured 88. 4% of NAS cases identified through administrative claims. In addition to clinical signs of NAS, 98. 3% of the cases also had a positive maternal or neonatal drug screen and/or a history of maternal substance use. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, a passive surveillance system might not capture all cases of NAS.

However, provisional comparison of counts from this surveillance system with hospital discharge data suggests that Tennessee's surveillance system captured a majority of cases in real-time and with the advantage of greater detail compared with administrative claims during its first year of operation. The incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome has increased substantially across the United States over the past decade, concomitant with an increase in maternal opioid use. Infants with antenatal opioid exposure are more likely to suffer other perinatal morbidities. The high rate of NAS also places a burden on public health and social service systems.
