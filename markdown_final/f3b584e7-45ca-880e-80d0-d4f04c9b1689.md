## Question

A 58-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity was diagnosed with primary hypogonadism. He was started on intramuscular testosterone undecanoate 6 months ago. His baseline hematocrit was 46%. At his 6-month follow-up, his hematocrit is found to be 55%. He is otherwise asymptomatic. His total PSA is stable and within normal limits. He does not have a history of polycythemia vera or prostate cancer.

Based on current EAU guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's testosterone therapy?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing testosterone therapy in a 58-year-old man with primary hypogonadism, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, whose hematocrit has risen from 46% at baseline to 55% after 6 months of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this hematocrit rise meets guideline thresholds that mandate action. Then, I should verify the EAU-specific recommendations for hematocrit greater than 54% and the sequence of interventions. Next, I will consider alternative explanations and whether any additional workup is needed. Finally, I will outline the practical steps for stopping therapy, phlebotomy if indicated, and how to reinitiate at a lower dose or switch formulation, ensuring I align with EAU, Endocrine Society, and AUA guidance.

> Let me first confirm the threshold and its significance. A hematocrit of 55% exceeds the commonly cited 54% safety threshold across major guidelines, and this degree of erythrocytosis is a recognized adverse effect of testosterone therapy, particularly with injectables, with meta-analytic data showing substantially increased odds of elevated hematocrit versus placebo, which is why monitoring is mandated at 3–6 months and annually thereafter [^47636e79] [^37f7ea59] [^cd11b9b6].

> Wait, let me verify the EAU-specific directive. The EAU 2025 guideline explicitly recommends discontinuing testosterone therapy and performing phlebotomy when hematocrit is greater than 54%, then reintroducing testosterone at a lower dose once hematocrit normalizes, and considering a switch to topical preparations. This is a direct, actionable instruction that applies here given the hematocrit of 55% [^0318b30a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without a brief check. I should confirm there is no evidence of polycythemia vera or other primary hematologic disease, and I should consider contributors like obstructive sleep apnea or hypoxia, which can amplify testosterone-induced erythrocytosis. The EAA advises evaluating for hypoxia and sleep apnea in men who develop erythrocytosis on testosterone and to discontinue therapy until hematocrit returns to a safe level, which supports a brief, focused assessment while stopping therapy now [^4b2cbde5] [^f22e0c81].

> I need to ensure the practical steps are precise. The most appropriate next step is to discontinue intramuscular testosterone undecanoate immediately and arrange therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce hematocrit to a safe level, typically targeting less than 54% and often closer to the mid-40s before reconsidering therapy. This aligns with EAU guidance and is consistent with Endocrine Society and AUA recommendations to hold testosterone and manage erythrocytosis proactively [^0318b30a] [^47636e79] [^37f7ea59].

> Next, I should review how to reinitiate therapy once hematocrit normalizes. Let me think about dose and formulation. EAU advises restarting at a lower dose and considering a switch to a transdermal preparation, which tends to cause less pronounced hematocrit increases than long-acting injectables. The AUA also notes that injectables carry the greatest risk of treatment-induced erythrocytosis, reinforcing the rationale to switch or reduce dose and interval when this adverse effect occurs [^0318b30a] [^37f7ea59].

> But wait, what if the patient objects to stopping therapy because he feels better symptomatically? I should double-check that the risk-benefit discussion emphasizes that continuing testosterone with hematocrit at 55% exposes him to increased thrombotic risk and that guidelines prioritize safety thresholds. Shared decision-making is important, yet the balance here favors guideline-concordant interruption and risk mitigation given the absence of definitive cardiovascular safety data at elevated hematocrit on testosterone [^47636e79] [^0318b30a].

> Final answer: Discontinue intramuscular testosterone undecanoate immediately and perform therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce hematocrit below 54%, then reassess and, once normalized, reinitiate testosterone at a lower dose or switch to a transdermal formulation, with evaluation for contributing factors such as sleep apnea or hypoxia as indicated [^0318b30a] [^4b2cbde5] [^37f7ea59].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **immediately discontinue testosterone therapy** and perform **therapeutic phlebotomy** to reduce hematocrit below 54% [^0318b30a], as per EAU 2025 guidelines. Once hematocrit normalizes, **reassess the indication for testosterone therapy** and, if still indicated, restart at a lower dose or switch to a transdermal preparation [^0318b30a] with closer monitoring [^4b761ab1]. This approach balances the risks of erythrocytosis with the potential benefits of testosterone therapy in a patient with primary hypogonadism [^47636e79].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated hematocrit

Erythrocytosis is a **common adverse effect** of testosterone therapy, particularly with intramuscular formulations such as testosterone undecanoate [^37f7ea59]. The risk is higher in older men and those with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^47636e79]. Elevated hematocrit increases blood viscosity, which can lead to thrombotic events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and deep vein thrombosis [^notfound].

---

## EAU 2025 guidelines on management of elevated hematocrit

The EAU 2025 guidelines provide clear recommendations for managing **elevated hematocrit** in patients receiving testosterone therapy:

- **Discontinue testosterone therapy**: Immediately stop testosterone therapy if hematocrit exceeds 54% [^0318b30a].

- **Therapeutic phlebotomy**: Perform therapeutic phlebotomy to rapidly reduce hematocrit to safe levels [^0318b30a].

- **Evaluate for underlying causes**: Assess for secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as obstructive sleep apnea, chronic hypoxia, or polycythemia vera [^4b2cbde5].

- **Re-initiate therapy cautiously**: Once hematocrit normalizes, consider re-initiating testosterone therapy at a lower dose or switching to a transdermal preparation, which is associated with a lower risk of erythrocytosis [^0318b30a] [^a1e708ab].

---

## Recommended monitoring protocol

Regular monitoring of hematocrit is essential in patients receiving testosterone therapy. The EAU 2025 guidelines recommend the following **monitoring schedule**:

| **Timepoint** | **Recommended monitoring** |
|-|-|
| Baseline | Hematocrit and testosterone levels |
| 3 months | Hematocrit and testosterone levels |
| 6 months | Hematocrit and testosterone levels |
| 12 months | Hematocrit and testosterone levels |
| Annually thereafter | Hematocrit and testosterone levels |

---

For patients at **higher risk of erythrocytosis** (e.g. obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), more frequent monitoring every 3–6 months is advised [^4b761ab1].

---

## Alternative testosterone formulations and dosing strategies

If testosterone therapy is re-initiated, consider the following **alternatives** to minimize the risk of erythrocytosis:

- **Transdermal preparations**: Gels or patches are associated with a lower risk of erythrocytosis compared to intramuscular injections [^37f7ea59].

- **Lower dosing**: Start at a lower dose and titrate cautiously based on clinical response and hematocrit levels [^0318b30a].

- **Longer intervals between injections**: For injectable formulations, consider extending the interval between doses to reduce peak testosterone levels and subsequent erythrocytosis risk [^d641d002].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Patients should be counseled regarding the **risks of erythrocytosis** associated with testosterone therapy and the importance of regular monitoring. Shared decision-making is essential to balance the benefits of testosterone therapy — improved libido, erectile function, and quality of life — against the potential risks, including erythrocytosis and thrombotic events [^c1aa3c34] [^47636e79].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Immediate action**: Discontinue testosterone therapy and perform therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce hematocrit below 54% [^0318b30a].

- **Evaluation**: Assess for secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as sleep apnea or chronic hypoxia [^4b2cbde5].

- **Re-initiation**: Once hematocrit normalizes, consider re-initiating testosterone therapy at a lower dose or switching to a transdermal preparation with closer monitoring [^0318b30a] [^4b761ab1].

- **Monitoring**: Adhere to regular hematocrit monitoring schedule, with more frequent checks in high-risk patients [^bfbb5b99] [^4b761ab1].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **immediately discontinue testosterone therapy** and perform **therapeutic phlebotomy** to reduce hematocrit below 54% [^0318b30a]. Once hematocrit normalizes, reassess the indication for testosterone therapy and, if still indicated, restart at a lower dose or switch to a transdermal preparation with closer monitoring [^0318b30a] [^4b761ab1]. This approach balances the risks of erythrocytosis with the potential benefits of testosterone therapy in a patient with primary hypogonadism [^47636e79].

### Testosterone treatment to prevent or revert type 2 diabetes in men enrolled in a lifestyle programme (T4DM): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year, phase 3b trial [^30065bc1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Men who are overweight or obese frequently have low serum testosterone concentrations, which are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine whether testosterone treatment prevents progression to or reverses early type 2 diabetes, beyond the effects of a community-based lifestyle programme.

Methods

T4DM was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year, phase 3b trial done at six Australian tertiary care centres. Men aged 50–74 years, with a waist circumference of 95 cm or higher, a serum testosterone concentration of 14.0 nmol/L or lower but without pathological hypogonadism, and impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] 2-h glucose 7.8–11.0 mmol/L) or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (provided OGTT 2-h glucose ≤ 15.0 mmol/L) were enrolled in a lifestyle programme and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an intramuscular injection of testosterone undecanoate (1000 mg) or placebo at baseline, 6 weeks, and then every 3 months for 2 years. Randomisation was done centrally, including stratification by centre, age group, waist circumference, 2-h OGTT glucose, smoking, and first-degree family history of type 2 diabetes. The primary outcomes at 2 years were type 2 diabetes (2-h OGTT glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L) and mean change from baseline in 2-h OGTT glucose, assessed by intention to treat. For safety assessment, we did a masked monitoring of haematocrit and prostate-specific antigen, and analysed prespecified serious adverse events. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12612000287831.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2013, and Feb 27, 2017, of 19022 men who were pre-screened, 1007 (5%) were randomly assigned to the placebo (n = 503) and testosterone (n = 504) groups. At 2 years, 2-h glucose of 11.1 mmol/L or higher on OGTT was reported in 87 (21%) of 413 participants with available data in the placebo group and 55 (12%) of 443 participants in the testosterone group (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80; p = 0.0007). The mean change from baseline 2-h glucose was -0.95 mmol/L (SD 2.78) in the placebo group and -1.70 mmol/L (SD 2.47) in the testosterone group (mean difference -0.75 mmol/L, -1.10 to -0.40; p < 0.0001). The treatment effect was independent of baseline serum testosterone. A safety trigger for haematocrit greater than 54% occurred in six (1%) of 484 participants in the placebo group and 106 (22%) of 491 participants in the testosterone group, and a trigger for an increase of 0.75 μg/mL or more in prostate-specific antigen occurred in 87 (19%) of 468 participants in the placebo group and 109 (23%) of 480 participants in the testosterone group. Prespecified serious adverse events occurred in 37 (7.4%, 95% CI 5.4 to 10.0) of 503 patients in the placebo group and 55 (10.9%, 8.5 to 13.9) of 504 patients in the testosterone group. There were two deaths in each group.

Interpretation

Testosterone treatment for 2 years reduced the proportion of participants with type 2 diabetes beyond the effects of a lifestyle programme. Increases in haematocrit might be treatment limiting. Longer-term durability, safety, and cardiovascular effects of the intervention remain to be further investigated.

### Testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men and effects on anemia… [^cae16616]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Alibhai SMH. Testosterone Replacement in Men With Hypogonadism and Effects on Anemia — Blood, Sex, and Aging. JAMA Netw Open. 2023; 6: e2339969. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.39969 Low testosterone levels are common in middle-aged, and particularly in older, men. 1 The Massachusetts Male Aging Study estimated the prevalence of low testosterone levels to be 25. 3% among men ages 40 to 70 years using blood-based cutoffs alone. Hypogonadism, which incorporates specific symptoms along with a low testosterone level, has a lower prevalence. However, it is still common among men and increases with age. Common symptoms of hypogonadism include reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, reduced muscle mass, poor concentration, and sleep disturbance.
2. Anemia of aging, a mild, normocytic anemia, is also common in older adults, with a prevalence of up to 15%.

3 Although the causes of anemia of aging appear to be multifactorial and have not been fully elucidated, in 10% to 15% of men with anemia of aging there is concomitant low testosterone. Supporting this association, medical and surgical castration, commonly used to treat advanced prostate cancer, are associated with a relatively rapid reduction in hemoglobin of 0. 7 to

1. 6 g/L. 4 Although there are no approved therapies for anemia of aging, testosterone replacement therapy is sometimes used. The 2018 Endocrine Society guidelines suggest TRT be considered in older men with low testosterone and unexplained anemia on an individual basis, after careful discussion of risks and benefits. 2 We know that TRT has multiple other benefits, including improving bone mineral density and sexual function. However, concerns remain around adverse effects of TRT, including major adverse cardiovascular events and prostate cancer risk.

Moreover, the impact of TRT on anemia of aging in men with hypogonadism has not been well characterized. In this issue of JAMA Network Open, Pencina et al5 published results from the TRAVERSE trial examining whether TRT could reduce the prevalence of anemia among middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism and anemia, as well as whether TRT could prevent incident anemia among hypogonadal men without anemia at baseline. The present analysis was a nested study within the larger randomized clinical trial of 5204 men ages 45 to 80 years with mean age 64. 8 years and testosterone below 300 ng/dL followed for up to 4 years. At baseline, 815 men had anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level below 12. 7 g/dL. On average, 10% to 15% more men receiving TRT had correction of anemia at 6 months compared with placebo, although there was some attenuation of benefits over time.

Significantly fewer men receiving TRT without anemia at baseline developed anemia compared with men receiving placebo, although mean differences in hemoglobin were small at approximately 0. 3 g/dL, and the absolute difference in incident anemia between groups was 2% to 3%. Prespecified subgroup analyses in men ages 65 years and older showed similar if not greater benefits in older men compared with younger men. The authors also examined multiple important patient-reported outcomes. Unfortunately, effects of TRT on energy and fatigue were modest, based on the validated Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire, 6 and there was no appreciable effect on self-reported cognition. 5 Formal neuropsychological testing was not performed. This is one of the largest trials of TRT and features a long duration of follow-up. It is a large, well-designed and executed trial, and provides important data on the link between anemia and TRT.

Final Comments About the Initiation of Testosterone Therapy in Men ≥ 50

The decision to treat medical conditions always involves an analysis of the benefits and risks; that analysis is particularly important in the decision to initiate testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years. Although testosterone replacement for men with organic hypogonadism is uncontroversial irrespective of age, men ≥ 50 years old with nonspecific symptoms, reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations, normal serum gonadotropins, and no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease often have improved health and well-being and normalization of serum testosterone concentrations with optimization of weight and comorbidities and stopping or reducing the dosage of medications that affect the HPT axis. In addition, therapies other than testosterone should be considered for symptoms and signs that might be attributed to hypogonadism: PDE5-inhibitors (for erectile dysfunction); treatment of sleep apnea, depression, obesity, and diabetes mellitus with proven effective therapies; and medications that reduce fracture (for osteoporosis). It is reasonable to add testosterone treatment to men ≥ 50 years with persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone (measured fasted in the morning when the man is at baseline health) and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations despite lifestyle measures for 6–12 months to lose weight (if BMI > 25 kg/m 2) and optimization of management of comorbidities. This decision must be individualized and is not algorithmic, and there should be no contraindications to testosterone therapy. Men ≥ 50 years with symptoms of hypogonadism and primary hypogonadism (low serum testosterone and elevated serum gonadotropin concentrations) should generally be offered testosterone replacement therapy. If testosterone therapy is being considered, we highlight the importance of discussing the unknown effects of testosterone therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer with the patient and documenting that discussion. It is also vital to determine the patient's expectations and goals and to provide information to the patient about the most likely benefits of testosterone therapy and the typical course for these benefits. The clinician and patient should identify patient-specific treatment goals with a timeline for assessment of effectiveness and consideration of whether to continue therapy. The therapeutic plan should include monitoring to ensure serum testosterone concentrations are above the lower limit of normal and to minimize and manage adverse effects including erythrocytosis. If a trial of testosterone therapy of sufficient duration does not meet patient-specific treatment goals in men with low serum testosterone and without identifiable pathology of the HPT axis, testosterone treatment should be stopped.

### Testosterone replacement therapy in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and functional hypogonadism-an integrated diabetes and endocrine academy (IDEA) consensus guideline [^f9861841]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Though testosterone replacement therapy in men with organic hypogonadism is established, its role in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and functional hypogonadism is unclear.

Methods

Thirteen experts addressed ten topic-specific questions after an in-depth review of literature, where all relevant issues were critically evaluated.

Results

Ten recommendations concerning diagnosis and management of men with T2DM and functional hypogonadism have been put forward.

Conclusion

Routine measurement of serum testosterone in all, and inappropriate replacement of testosterone in asymptomatic T2DM men with functional hypogonadism and borderline low serum testosterone values, is not recommended.

### Male hypogonadism: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^11507783]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Organic male hypogonadism due to irreversible hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) pathology is easily diagnosed and treated with testosterone-replacement therapy. However, controversy surrounds the global practice of prescribing testosterone to symptomatic men with low testosterone and non-gonadal factors reducing health status, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and ageing (ie, functional hypogonadism), but without identifiable HPT axis pathology. Health optimisation remains the gold-standard management strategy. Nevertheless, in the last decade large clinical trials and an individual patient data meta-analysis of smaller clinical trials confirmed that testosterone therapy induces modest, yet statistically significant, improvements in sexual function without increasing short-term to medium-term cardiovascular or prostate cancer risks in men with functional hypogonadism. Although testosterone improves bone mineral density and insulin sensitivity in these men, trials from the last decade suggest insufficient evidence to determine the safety and effectiveness of use of this hormone for the prevention of fractures or type 2 diabetes. This Review discusses the pathogenesis and diagnosis of male hypogonadism and appraises the evidence underpinning the management of this condition.

What Are the Potential Harms of Testosterone Treatment?

Erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 54%) is the most common adverse effects of testosterone treatment in older men, with a relative risk of 8.14 [95% CI: 1.87, 35.40] in a meta-analysis. However, whether testosterone-induced erythrocytosis is associated with adverse (cardiovascular) outcomes is not known.

An additional common risk of androgen therapy is to suppress the HPT axis and the suppression may persist for many months to years after long-term use. However, short-term use of 6 to 12 months is unlikely to cause dependence or long-term suppression; in this setting, recovery of the HPT axis typically occurs within 1 to 3 months. In addition, most men who are prescribed testosterone for nonspecific symptoms will quit testosterone therapy within 1 year. The risk of persistent withdrawal or hypogonadism symptoms is unlikely to occur after a testosterone therapy trial of 1 year or less, and the patient is likely to stop therapy within 1 year if there is no benefit. However, longer courses of testosterone therapy may lead to more prolonged suppression of the male gonadal axis, potentially increasing the risk of re-prescribing testosterone; a recent follow-up of the T4DM study, concluded that after stopping 2 years of long-acting testosterone undecanoate treatment, full reproductive hormone recovery might take longer than 12 months to complete.

### Monitoring of testosterone replacement therapy to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio [^88a073a3]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

For hypogonadal men treated with testosterone, the goal is to ensure that benefits are optimized, risks are minimized, and any adverse effects are identified early and managed appropriately. This can best be achieved by careful patient selection, excluding men with contraindications and addressing any modifiable risk factors in those at increased risk. A standardized plan should be used for monitoring that includes evaluation of symptoms, side effects, adherence, and measurement of testosterone and hematocrit. Shared decision making should be used to determine whether to screen for prostate cancer and informed by age, baseline cancer risk, and patient preference.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^48828e6e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m 2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

Although T2DM is associated with low testosterone — about one-third have low T and total testosterone concentrations were, on average, 86 ng/dL lower vs controls — a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found no evidence of an improvement in HbA1c.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^51c064c9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

Background

Low circulating testosterone is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in overweight men with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Aims

To determine in a multi-centre, double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial whether testosterone treatment combined with lifestyle intervention (Weight Watchers) relative to lifestyle intervention alone reduces T2DM incidence and improves glucose tolerance at 2years.

Study Population

Overweight or obese men aged 50-74years with a serum testosterone of ≤ 14nmol/L and IGT or newly diagnosed T2DM established by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Setting, Drug and Protocol

Six Australian capital city-based tertiary care centres. Participants were randomized 1:1 and injected with testosterone undecanoate (1000mg/4 mL) or vehicle (4 mL castor oil), at baseline, 6 weeks and 3-monthly thereafter. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: (a) Proportion of participants with 2-hour OGTT ≥ 11.1 mmol/L at 2 years, and (b) a difference at 2 years ≥ 0.6 mmol/L in the mean 2-hour OGTT glucose between treatments.

Secondary Endpoints

Fasting insulin, HbA1c, body composition, maximal handgrip strength; sexual function and lower urinary tract symptoms; serum sex steroids and sex hormone binding globulin; mood and psychosocial function; adherence to lifestyle intervention; and healthcare utilization and costs.

Safety

Overseen by an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee. Haematocrit, lipids and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are assessed 6-monthly and information relating to haematological, urological and cardiovascular adverse events from each clinic visit. SUB-STUDIES: (a) Changes in bone density and micro-architecture, (b) motivation and behaviour, (c) telomere length, (d) extended treatment up to 4 years, and (e) hypothalamo-pituitary testicular axis recovery at treatment end.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f0371a33]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

Prospective RCTs have not shown a direct relationship between TT-induced erythrocytosis and cardiovascular events, and a meta-analysis did not support a causal role for testosterone supplementation in adverse cardiovascular events. Management guidance states that Hct values higher than 54% warrant discontinuation of TT until further assessment; if Hct becomes markedly elevated, phlebotomy should be considered, and patients newly diagnosed with hypertension before or during TT warrant close monitoring.

### 'What should I do with a 60-year old man with a slightly low serum total testosterone concentration and normal levels of serum gonadotrophins'? [^44463a22]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The fundamental question in assessing an older man with a slightly low total testosterone and normal gonadotrophin levels is to determine whether or not he has clinical hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome complex, which comprises both symptoms as well as biochemical testosterone deficiency. As symptoms are nonspecific and there are no clear cut-off values for testosterone levels this invariably leads to a clinical dilemma. International guidelines have been published which provide recommendations to aid the clinician in making a diagnosis. Late-onset hypogonadism, the preferred terminology for age-related hypogonadism, can only be made once other causes have been excluded. Evidence shows that low testosterone levels are associated with several common male conditions including erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis and diabetes. Short-term studies have shown benefits of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, bone metabolism, insulin resistance, sexual function and quality of life. Recommendations give clear advice on safety monitoring, specifically in relation to prostate health. If a diagnosis of hypogonadism is made with borderline testosterone levels then a 3-month trial of TRT can be considered. The diagnosis of hypogonadism associated with borderline testosterone levels and the decision to treat should only be made by an experienced clinician.

Clinical studies of testosterone replacement in men with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and low testosterone concentrations

The major goal of testosterone replacement therapy is to increase serum testosterone concentrations to physiological concentrations with the purpose of resolving symptoms and biological sequelae of hypogonadism. The advent of new modes of testosterone delivery such as transdermal testosterone gels and depot intramuscular testosterone undecanoate injections have made physiological replacement possible. Testosterone replacement in the hypogonadal man with type 2 diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome should aim to have beneficial effects on multiple outcomes including sexual health; general well-being; body composition; and reducing CVD risk factors, including central adiposity, glycemic control, and atherogenic lipid profile.

Evidence from several studies (Table 2) demonstrated that testosterone promotes insulin sensitivity in hypogonadal men with and without type 2 diabetes. Mårin et al. were the first to report that testosterone improved insulin sensitivity assessed by euglycemic clamp studies in obese men while reducing central adiposity. More recently, a randomized double-blind crossover trial demonstrated a significant reduction in insulin resistance in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes. This finding was confirmed in three further studies in men with metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes. Hypogonadism with either of these conditions was the major inclusion criterion. Subjects were not selected for poor diabetic control (Table 2). Even so, three studies reported decreases in HbA 1c levels in the men with diabetes.

### Approach to the patient: low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^b405145c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pathologic hypogonadism occurs when serum testosterone is significantly and persistently reduced by irreversible organic (structural, genetic) disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary testicular axis. Men with pathologic hypogonadism require lifelong testosterone replacement. In contrast, mild or moderate reductions in serum testosterone frequently accompany obesity, and its numerous comorbidities in men are best considered nongonadal illness syndromes, wherein reduction in serum testosterone is usually reversible upon amelioration of the underlying nongonadal illness.

Obesity can result in nonspecific symptoms in conjunction with reduced serum testosterone and serum SHBG. Obesity-related reductions in SHBG, testosterone's principal circulating carrier protein, are primarily responsible for measured reductions in testosterone. However, obesity is not a cause of pathological hypogonadism, and proportionately reduced testosterone and SHBG concentrations accompanied by normal serum LH and FSH concentrations confirm a eugonadal state, best described as the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity.

Herein we demonstrate how clinically significant weight loss substantially reverses obesity-related reductions in serum testosterone and ameliorates nonspecific symptoms resembling, but not due to, androgen deficiency. The important reversible steps include weight reduction and optimizing management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and other obesity-related comorbidities as well as rationalizing concomitant drug regimens. In the absence of pathological hypogonadism, testosterone treatment is less effective than a diet and lifestyle intervention to rectify the reversible conditions responsible for the nonspecific symptoms and associated reduced serum testosterone concentrations observed in men with obesity. As such, testosterone treatment is not indicated, and unwarranted off-label testosterone treatment can lead to adverse effects such as infertility, elevated hematocrit requiring venesection, a prothrombotic state, and testosterone dependence.

Pathologic hypogonadism occurs when serum testosterone is significantly and persistently reduced by irreversible organic (structural, genetic) disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary testicular (HPT) axis. Men with pathologic hypogonadism require life-long testosterone replacement. In contrast, mild or moderate reductions in serum testosterone frequently accompany obesity and its numerous co-morbidities in men and are best considered as non-gonadal illness syndromes, wherein reduction in serum testosterone is usually reversible upon amelioration of the underlying non-gonadal illness. Obesity can result in non-specific symptoms in conjunction with reduced serum testosterone and serum SHBG.

Conversely, testosterone therapy has been associated with serious adverse events in men. A systematic review of 27 RCTs found that testosterone therapy vs. placebo increased the risk of a cardiovascular-related event in mainly older men (pooled odds ratio was 1.54 [95% CI: 1.09, 2.18]). However, a more recent systematic review of RCTs in mostly older men found there was an increased cardiovascular risk associated with oral testosterone therapy (pooled relative risk was 2.20 [95% CI: 1.45,3.55]), but not with intramuscular (pooled relative risk was 0.66 [95% CI: 0.28,1.56) or transdermal (gel or patch) testosterone therapy (pooled relative risk was 1.27 [95% CI: 0.62,2.62]). Further research is needed to establish the safety of specific types of testosterone therapies in specific populations.

Currently, we are undertaking a Phase IIIb multicentre randomized controlled trial (double-blinded and placebo-controlled) to determine whether testosterone therapy (1000 mg testosterone undeconate) combined with lifestyle intervention will reduce the rate of T2D in men with both low testosterone and pre-diabetes or newly diagnosed T2D more than lifestyle intervention alone over two years. Testosterone undecanoate is registered for use in Australia for the treatment of male hypogonadism (Australian Registration Number AUST R 106946). If testosterone undecanoate is shown to be safe and effective pharmacotherapy for preventing T2D in men, then screening for low serum testosterone additional to current T2D risk assessment models (like the AUSDRISK in Australia) would identify a large subgroup of distinct men who might benefit from both targeted pharmacotherapy and lifestyle preventive interventions.

However, screening for low serum testosterone in community-based patients should be applied only to men suggestive of clinical presentations, otherwise additional blood testing would potentially cause a blowout in healthcare costs since serum testosterone level of < 16 nmol/L is highly prevalent in men aged 35 years and over. Furthermore, treatment decisions following confirmed screening positives will need to consider not only the optimal cut-off point for low testosterone, but also on the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive testosterone therapy, which is currently being investigated, as well as treatment availability.

Middle-aged and older men with lower testosterone concentrations are more likely to have or to develop metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Central adiposity is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and diabetes and predisposes to lower testosterone concentrations. Conversely, testosterone treatment reduces fat mass and insulin resistance. In a randomized controlled trial of 1007 men with either impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 2 years of testosterone treatment on a background of lifestyle intervention reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 40%; this demonstrates the potential utility for testosterone pharmacotherapy to prevent diabetes in men.

1 INTRODUCTION

Reduced testosterone concentrations are commonly encountered in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dhindsa et al. 1 first described the syndrome of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in men with T2DM. This syndrome occurs in approximately one‐third of patients with diabetes and is associated with obesity, but not with severity or duration of diabetes, or age. 2 Obesity, without diabetes, was associated with HH in approximately 25% of patients. 3 Patients with HH also exhibited an inflammatory state, beyond that experienced by eugonadal patients with T2DM and had significantly greater insulin resistance than eugonadal patients with T2DM. 4, 5 Testosterone therapy (TTh) reduced insulin resistance in such patients, according to homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR). 6, 7 Men with T2DM and hypogonadism have more fat mass and a 36% lower glucose infusion rate during hyperinsulinaemic‐euglycaemic clamps than eugonadal men, as well as reduced insulin signalling at the cellular level in adipose tissue. 5, 8, 9, 10, 11

Testosterone deficiency (TD), also termed "hypogonadism", contributes to reduced glucose disposal, increased insulin resistance and onset of T2DM. 12, 13, 14 Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with significantly increased risk of incident diabetes. 15, 16 TTh in men with TD and T2DM increases insulin sensitivity and induces greater expression of insulin receptor‐β, insulin receptor substrate‐1, AKT‐2 and GLUT‐4 in adipose tissue, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for the increased insulin sensitivity. 5, 17 We have previously shown that long‐term TTh halted the progression of prediabetes to overt diabetes. 13

The primary objectives of this registry study were, firstly, to examine the effect of TTh on the course of glucose intolerance, with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin secretion as target variables, and, secondly, to assess the impact of TTh on weight control and major cardiovascular risk factors (lipids, blood pressure, inflammation). In the present paper, we report the results of long‐term TTh (11 years) in men with hypogonadism and T2DM and compare the outcomes with data derived from a parallel group of patients who remained untreated (control) during the entire follow‐up period.

### Update: hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in type 2 diabetes and obesity [^5896f156]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Studies over the last few years have clearly established that at least 25% of men with type 2 diabetes have subnormal free testosterone concentrations in association with inappropriately low LH and FSH concentrations. Another 4% have subnormal testosterone concentrations with elevated LH and FSH concentrations. The Endocrine Society, therefore, now recommends the measurement of testosterone in patients with type 2 diabetes on a routine basis. The subnormal testosterone concentrations are not related to glycosylated hemoglobin or duration of diabetes, but are associated with obesity, very high C-reactive protein concentrations, and mild anemia. In addition, subnormal testosterone concentrations in these men are associated with a two to three times elevated risk of cardiovascular events and death in two early studies. Short-term studies of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes have demonstrated an increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in waist circumference. However, the data on the effect of testosterone replacement on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol and C-reactive protein concentrations are inconsistent. As far as sexual function is concerned, testosterone treatment increases libido but does not improve erectile dysfunction and thus, phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be required. Trials of a longer duration are clearly required to definitively establish the benefits and risks of testosterone replacement in patients with type 2 diabetes and low testosterone.

### A perspective on middle-aged and older men with functional hypogonadism: focus on holistic management [^5c56ad0a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Middle-aged and older men (≥ 50 years), especially those who are obese and suffer from comorbidities, not uncommonly present with clinical features consistent with androgen deficiency and modestly reduced testosterone levels. Commonly, such men do not demonstrate anatomical hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis pathology but have functional hypogonadism that is potentially reversible.

Evidence Acquisition

Literature review from 1970 to October 2016.

Evidence Synthesis

Although definitive randomized controlled trials are lacking, evidence suggests that in such men, lifestyle measures to achieve weight loss and optimization of comorbidities, including discontinuation of offending medications, lead to clinical improvement and a modest increase in testosterone. Also, androgen deficiency-like symptoms and end-organ deficits respond to targeted treatments (such as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction) without evidence that hypogonadal men are refractory. Unfortunately, lifestyle interventions remain difficult and may be insufficient even if successful. Testosterone therapy should be considered primarily for men who have significant clinical features of androgen deficiency and unequivocally low testosterone levels. Testosterone should be initiated either concomitantly with a trial of lifestyle measures, or after such a trial fails, after a tailored diagnostic work-up, exclusion of contraindications, and appropriate counseling.

Conclusions

There is modest evidence that functional hypogonadism responds to lifestyle measures and optimization of comorbidities. If achievable, these interventions may have demonstrable health benefits beyond the potential for increasing testosterone levels. Therefore, treatment of underlying causes of functional hypogonadism and of symptoms should be used either as an initial or adjunctive approach to testosterone therapy.

Testosterone therapy — erythrocytosis risk and management: Testosterone (T) administration increases hemoglobin and hematocrit and can cause erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 54%) in some men with hypogonadism, with higher frequency in older men; a commissioned meta-analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of erythrocytosis vs placebo. The hematocrit level at which neuro-occlusive or cardiovascular events increase is not known, and the frequency of neuro-occlusive events in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of T who developed erythrocytosis has been very low. Clinicians should evaluate men who develop erythrocytosis during T‑replacement therapy and withhold T therapy until hematocrit has returned to the normal range and then resume T therapy at a lower dose; using therapeutic phlebotomy to lower hematocrit is also effective in managing T treatment–induced erythrocytosis.

Testosterone undecanoate (intramuscular (IM) long-acting) pharmacokinetics and comparative data are summarized as follows: Testosterone undecanoate is the only currently available long-acting injection therapy available as a 750 mg (3 mL) preparation and must be administered in the office under supervision. With the currently available preparation administered at weeks 0, 4, and every 10 weeks thereafter, peak concentrations were achieved at a mean 7 days after injection (range 4–42 days), and after the third injection median peak and trough T levels were 813 ng/dL and 319 ng/dL, with an overall median value of 476 ng/dL during the 10-week period. No RCTs have compared the current formulation available in the United States to other therapies; one study comparing IM testosterone enanthate (250 mg every 3 weeks) with IM testosterone undecanoate (1,000 mg every 9 weeks) reported trough levels of 239 ng/dL versus 470 ng/dL at the end of the 10-week cycle.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^37f7ea59]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — hemoglobin/hematocrit monitoring and polycythemia risk: Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Prior to commencing therapy, all patients should undergo a baseline measurement of Hb/Hct; if the Hct exceeds 50%, clinicians should consider withholding testosterone therapy until the etiology is explained, and while on therapy, a Hct ≥ 54% warrants intervention. In men with elevated Hct and high on-treatment testosterone levels, dose adjustment should be attempted as first-line management; in men with elevated Hct and low/normal on-treatment testosterone levels, measuring a SHBG level and a free testosterone level using a reliable assay is suggested. If SHBG levels are low/free testosterone levels are high, dose adjustment of the testosterone therapy should be considered, and men with elevated Hct and on-treatment low/normal total and free testosterone levels should be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and possible coordination of phlebotomy. Polycythemia is generally defined as a hematocrit (Hct) > 52%. Elevation of Hb/Hct is the most frequent adverse event related to testosterone therapy, and Hb/Hct generally rise for the first six months and then tend to plateau. Across 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of men with mean baseline testosterone < 300 ng/dL treated for 12 weeks to 1 year, elevated Hct was more common with testosterone (OR = 6.46; CI: 1.86, 22.40). Trials indicate injectable testosterone is associated with the greatest treatment-induced increases in Hb/Hct, and a meta-analysis found mean Hb increases of 1.4 mg/dL (long-acting IM), 1.6 mg/dL (short-acting IM), 0.9 mg/dL (transdermal), and 0.7 mg/dL (topical patches).

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^f746deaa]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome that can be defined as persistently low serum testosterone levels in the setting of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit had increased 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. He had lost another 4.3 kg (and now weighs 93.0 kg) with diet and exercise. He had lost a total of 6.3 kg (∼6% of body weight since his initial evaluation). At 12 months of follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L), and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after discontinuation of testosterone therapy. He enquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

US Endocrine Society (ES) published a clinical practice guideline on testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism, and Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) a position statement on management of male hypogonadism. Both emphasize the importance of diagnosing men who are androgen deficient due to organic (classical or pathological) hypogonadism arising from disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary or testes, who assuredly benefit from testosterone therapy. Both recognize that men with an intact gonadal axis may have low testosterone concentrations, for instance older men or men with obesity or other medical comorbidities. ES guidelines classify such symptomatic men as having organic (advanced age) or functional (obesity, medical comorbidities) hypogonadism, giving an option for testosterone therapy as a shared decision between clinicians and individual patients. ESA did not recommend testosterone therapy in these men. ES offers a reference range for total testosterone established in young men, while ESA cites age-standardized reference ranges. ES recommends using free testosterone as well as total testosterone to identify men with hypogonadism in conditions where sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is altered, or when total testosterone is borderline. ESA recommends confirmatory biochemical testing with total testosterone, recognizing that this may be lower than expected if SHBG concentrations are low. Both emphasize the importance of identifying pre-existing prostate and cardiovascular disease prior to initiating testosterone therapy, with ES providing specific recommendations for PSA measurement, deferring testosterone therapy after major cardiovascular events and indications for pituitary imaging. These contrasting approaches highlight gaps in the evidence base where individualized patient management is required.

International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a serious public health concern, impacting healthcare systems worldwide, and warrants long-term medical intervention. Approximately 78 million Americans are obese and 11 million are excessively obese making them eligible for surgical intervention. Lung et al. and Nyberg et al. suggested that obesity was associated with the loss of disease-free years during middle and later adulthood. Herrick et al. reported that the age-adjusted percentage of adults aged ≥ 20 years trying to lose weight during the past 12 months, by sex, increased from 43.3% to 49.3%. This increase was seen among both men (35.5% to 42.2%) and women (51.2% to 56.3%).

Several pathophysiological mechanisms including metabolic dysregulation and inability to regulate energy intake and expenditure, sedentary lifestyle and disruptions of endocrine function contribute to obesity. Current management strategies for the treatment of obesity include diets, exercise, behavioral lifestyle changes, pharmaco-therapeutic agents, and bariatric surgery. Clearly, there is a critical need for new approaches to management of obesity.

Observational studies of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and severe obesity, who underwent bariatric surgery, reported improvements in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor profile, including metabolic syndrome, a lower risk of ischemic heart disease and mortality, as well as prevention of new onset of diabetes as compared with other approaches, such as lifestyle and diet regimens. Bariatric surgery, however, is not appropriate or available for all obese patients, and is not without risks and complications. Only carefully selected obese patients can be treated with bariatric surgery, and patients need to be followed-up closely and carefully.

Two recent comprehensive reviews suggested that TTh in obese men with TD may be considered as novel approach to treat obesity since it reduces fat mass and increases lean body mass. Recent studies have suggested that long-term TTh in men produces significant weight loss (WL) and decreases WC and BMI.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^559ba659]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

This patient might have had a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after ∼ 6 months. Sense of well-being and sexual function are complex, and both depend upon multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the HPT axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men. The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism after attempts to treat reversible causes are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less. An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by restoration of normal HPT axis function by weight loss. With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit for an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their current regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

### Male late-onset hypogonadism: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^7da67f89]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Some aging men develop a condition of suppressed serum testosterone levels, which is associated with diffuse sexual, physical and psychological symptoms. Several terms are used for this syndrome, but late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is preferred. The diagnosis of LOH is often uncertain because symptoms (occurring in 20–40% of men) and low circulating testosterone (found in 20% of men > 70 years of age) seldom occur together. The strict diagnostic criteria for LOH include reproducibly low serum testosterone levels and sexual symptoms, including erectile dysfunction and reduced frequency of sexual thoughts and morning erections. Using these diagnostic criteria, only 2% of 40-80-year-old men have LOH. Obesity and impaired general health (including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frailty) are more common reasons for low testosterone than advanced age per se. It seems logical, therefore, to begin by treating these conditions before testosterone replacement therapy is initiated. Even then, testosterone should only be used if there are no contraindications, such as unstable cardiac disease, serious prostate symptoms and high hemoglobin level. The long-term benefit of testosterone replacement therapy is uncertain, and the experimental nature of the treatment, and its associated risks, must be fully explained to the patient before treatment begins.

Back to the Case

The patient has continued to have symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency and reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations. He enquired about testosterone therapy to restore his serum testosterone concentration into the normal range. Before testosterone therapy was considered and the potential benefits and risks were discussed, prostate cancer screening was discussed; untreated prostate cancer is a contraindication to testosterone therapy (Table 4). After discussion of the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, he elected to undergo prostate cancer screening; digital rectal exam revealed no prostate abnormality and PSA was 1.5 ng/dL. The potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy were discussed because he had persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly, unequivocally low serum testosterone concentrations after a year of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT axis (including lifestyle changes to lose weight and optimization of treatment of sleep apnea).

Table 4.
Contraindications to testosterone therapy in men

He was counseled about the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy (including the lack of definitive data about the effects on cardiovascular outcomes and prostate cancer) and the absence of high-quality, long-term studies. The patient's main concerns were identified as low libido, reduced energy, and low mood. He was advised that, based on the T-Trials, effects of testosterone treatment on these symptoms should be evident within 3 to 6 months while other benefits (eg, muscle mass and function, bone health) typically take longer. Testosterone formulations (including topical and intramuscular treatment) were discussed. He preferred topical testosterone for a therapeutic trial of 6 months to determine if testosterone therapy would meaningfully improve his symptoms. He agreed that testosterone treatment would be stopped if there was no significant benefit despite normal serum testosterone concentrations during therapy. The discussion about the benefits and risks of testosterone, the goals of therapeutic trial and the plan to discontinue testosterone therapy if these goals were not met were documented in the medical record. Treatment was initiated with a standardized monitoring plan that included follow-up clinic visits to assess for effectiveness and safety at 3 and 6 months with reassessment of the dosage of testosterone based on symptoms and measurement of serum testosterone concentrations and assessment of hematocrit 3 and 6 months after initiation (and increases of dosage) of testosterone.

Cardiovascular disease risk counseling in testosterone deficiency — 13. Clinicians should inform testosterone deficient patients that low testosterone is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Low testosterone has been associated with higher risks of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.33; CI: 1.12, 1.59), cerebrovascular accidents (OR = 1.41; CI: 1.12, 1.59), cardiac event-related death (RR = 1.25; CI: 0.97, 1.60), and all-cause mortality (RR = 1.35; CI: 1.13, 1.62). Compared to men with normal testosterone, testosterone deficient men showed greater odds of hypertension (OR = 1.59; CI: 1.43, 1.77), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.34; CI: 1.21, 1.86), were nearly twice as likely to be obese (OR = 1.94; CI: 1.53, 2.47), and had higher BMI (OR = 1.97; CI: 1.62, 2.31). The presence of ASCVD risk factors is not a contraindication to starting testosterone therapy; however, optimization of modifiable risk factors using lifestyle and medical management strategies is recommended.

Secondary erythrocytosis is one of the most common adverse events associated with testosterone therapy (TT). Upon encountering this, clinicians will often either adjust TT dosing, stop therapy, order a phlebotomy, or recommend a combination of these.

### Testosterone administration in older men [^82bf8bc6]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The only indication for testosterone administration in older men is testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism. Compared with young hypogonadal men, the diagnosis and management of male hypogonadism in older men is more challenging. Both the clinical manifestations of androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels may be caused or modified by comorbid illnesses that occur and medications taken more frequently by older men, resulting in a greater likelihood for overdiagnosis of hypogonadism and subsequent inappropriate use of and inadequate response to testosterone treatment. It is important to use a systematic, holistic approach to the diagnosis and management of older men with hypogonadism.

### Testosterone replacement therapy added to intensive lifestyle intervention in older men with obesity and hypogonadism [^c52a27ad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity and hypogonadism additively contribute to frailty in older men; however, appropriate treatment remains controversial.

Objective

Determine whether testosterone replacement augments the effect of lifestyle therapy on physical function in older men with obesity and hypogonadism.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

VA Medical Center.

Participants

83 older (age ≥ 65 years) men with obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) and persistently low am testosterone (< 10.4 nmol/L) associated with frailty.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to lifestyle therapy (weight management and exercise training) plus either testosterone (LT+Test) or placebo (LT+Pbo) for 6 months.

Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was change in Physical Performance Test (PPT) score. Secondary outcomes included other frailty measures, body composition, hip bone mineral density (BMD), physical functions, hematocrit, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and sex hormones.

Results

PPT score increased similarly in LT+Test and LT+Pbo group (17% vs. 16%; P = 0.58). VO2peak increased more in LT+Test than LT+Pbo (23% vs. 16%; P = 0.03). Despite similar -9% weight loss, lean body mass and thigh muscle volume decreased less in LT+Test than LT+Pbo (-2% vs. -3%; P = 0.01 and -2% vs -4%; P = 0.04). Hip BMD was preserved in LT+Test compared with LT+Pbo (0.5% vs -1.1%; P = 0.003). Strength increased similarly in LT+Test and LT+Pbo (23% vs 22%; P = 0.94). Hematocrit but not PSA increased more in LT+Test than LT+Pbo (5% vs 1%; P < 0.001). Testosterone levels increased more in LT+Test than LT+Pbo (167% vs 27%; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

In older, obese hypogonadal men, adding testosterone for 6 months to lifestyle therapy does not further improve overall physical function. However, our findings suggest that testosterone may attenuate the weight loss-induced reduction in muscle mass and hip BMD and may further improve aerobic capacity.

### Testosterone therapy and bone quality in men with diabetes and hypogonadism… [^a61064c8]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

An existing mutual influence between testosterone and glucose metabolism has been suggested by studies showing that men with low T have impaired glucose tolerance, while a significant number of men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have low T. Thus, it is not surprising that as much as 64% of men with T2D were found to have low T. Hypogonadism and diabetes mellitus each is associated with increased risk for fractures. While hypogonadism is associated with increased bone turnover and bone loss. DM is associated with low bone turnover and normal or high bone mineral density but paradoxically a high risk for fractures. The preliminary data showed that compared to non-diabetic hypogonadal men, men with both conditions have suppressed bone turnover, higher volumetric BMD and smaller bone size.

As the effect of T on the male skeleton is mainly mediated by its conversion to estradiol by the enzyme aromatase, the possibility of further suppression of bone turnover with T therapy in these patients would be a concern. However, the investigators' initial data also showed that T therapy in men with both conditions resulted in increased in markers of bone turnover and bone size compared to the decrease in bone turnover and decrease in bone size in men with hypogonadism only, suggesting activation in bone remodeling and improvement in bone geometry in the former. Furthermore, the investigators also found a trend for increase in bone strength in the limited number of men with both low T and T2D randomized to T compared to placebo. These findings only suggest but do not prove with certainty that T therapy would be beneficial to men with both low T and T2D.

The central hypothesis of this study is that T therapy will result in improvement in bone quality in patients who have both hypogonadism and T2D. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to determine the effect of T therapy on bone strength as assessed by finite element analysis using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography, 2) to determine the effect of T therapy on markers of bone turnover, and 3) an exploratory aim, to evaluate the mechanism for improvement in bone quality from T therapy. The investigators hypothesize that because T stimulates osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation, the ensuing increase in osteoblast number will lead to an enhanced cross-talk between osteoblast and osteoclast resulting in activation of bone remodeling and replacement of old with new bone, hence, improvement in bone quality. In this study the investigators will enroll 166 men with T2D and hypogonadism and randomize them to either testosterone gel 1.

62% or placebo for 12 months. The following main outcomes will be evaluated: aim 1) change in the primary endpoint which is FEA, by HRpQCT, #2) changes in C-telopeptide a marker of bone resorption, and aim #3) changes in circulating osteoblast progenitor. The investigators anticipate an increase in FEA at the tibia and radius suggesting improvement in bone strength, increase CTX and increase in circulating osteoblast progenitors. The investigators further anticipate an increase in other markers of bone turnover and osteoclast precursors in men with hypogonadism and T2D randomized to T compared to placebo. Given the suppressed bone turnover at baseline in men with low T and T2D, the investigators hypothesize that the beneficial effect of T is its effect in activating bone remodeling ultimately resulting in improvement in bone quality.

Testosterone therapy — serum testosterone (T) monitoring and targets across formulations — calls for evaluating the patient 3–12 mo after treatment initiation and then annually, and to monitor T concentrations 3–6 mo after initiation with therapy aiming to raise serum T concentrations into the mid-normal range; for injectable T enanthate or cypionate, measure midway between injections and adjust dose or frequency if mid-interval T is > 600 ng/dL (24.5 nmol/L) or < 350 ng/dL (14.1 nmol/L); for transdermal gels, assess 2–8 h after application after at least 1 wk on treatment; for transdermal patches, assess 3–12 h after application; for buccal T bioadhesive tablet, assess concentrations immediately before or after application of a fresh system; for T pellets, measure at the end of the dosing interval and adjust the number of pellets and/or the dosing interval to maintain serum T in the midnormal range; for oral T undecanoate, monitor 3–5 h after ingestion with a fat-containing meal; for injectable T undecanoate, measure at the end of the dosing interval just prior to the next injection and aim to achieve nadir levels in low-mid range.

### Testosterone deficiency [^81cf4b52]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD) afflicts approximately 30% of men aged 40–79 years, with an increase in prevalence strongly associated with aging and common medical conditions including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. A strong relationship is noted between TD and metabolic syndrome, although the relationship is not certain to be causal. Repletion of testosterone (T) in T-deficient men with these comorbidities may indeed reverse or delay their progression. While T repletion has been largely thought of in a sexual realm, we discuss its potential role in general men's health concerns: metabolic, body composition, and all-cause mortality through the use of a single clinical vignette. This review examines a host of studies, with practical recommendations for diagnosis of TD and T repletion in middle-aged and older men, including an analysis of treatment modalities and areas of concerns and uncertainty.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^6803003f]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Statement 12.17 — We recommend health care professionals monitor hematocrit (or hemoglobin) levels in transgender and gender diverse people treated with testosterone. The testosterone regimens in the systematic review included testosterone esters ranging from the equivalent of 25–250 mg SC/IM weekly, testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg every 12 weeks, or testosterone gel 50 mg applied daily to the skin. The expected rise should be consistent with reference ranges in cisgender males.
