## Question

Could elevated C3 and C4 be associated with fibromyalgia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether elevated C3 and C4 could be associated with fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is direct evidence that C3/C4 are elevated in fibromyalgia cohorts. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility that complement might track with fibromyalgia-related inflammation. Next, I will consider confounding comorbidities that commonly coexist with fibromyalgia and could raise C3/C4. After that, I need to check disease-pattern reasoning, namely when complement tends to be high versus consumed and low. Finally, I will appraise evidence quality and outline the clinical implications for testing and interpretation in practice.

> Let me first confirm whether primary data actually show elevated C3 or C4 in fibromyalgia. Wait, let me verify the most comprehensive synthesis: the systematic review and meta-analysis of blood biomarkers in fibromyalgia identified increases in several inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, CRP, BDNF) but did not report C3 or C4 among discriminatory biomarkers, and it explicitly cautioned that these markers are not disease-specific for FM. I will now examine earlier small studies; the cytokine pilot did not assess complement components, so it cannot support an association of C3/C4 with FM, and a CSF/serum study highlighted IL-8 rather than complement in FM pathophysiology [^11252in8] [^112gE5Yp]. Taken together, I should confirm that within the provided documents there is no direct evidence demonstrating consistent elevation of C3/C4 in FM cohorts compared with controls [^114H3p9t].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could complement biology still make such an association plausible even if it isn't demonstrated directly. I need to check whether C3 and C4 behave as acute-phase reactants and rise with systemic inflammation; complement reviews and clinical guidance confirm that C3 and C4 are integral inflammatory mediators that can increase with acute-phase responses and broader immune activation, albeit nonspecifically [^113ZsWSU] [^111PXer7] [^1163eApC]. Let me reconsider FM pathogenesis: although centrally mediated pain amplification predominates, low-grade peripheral immune activation has been observed, including elevated CRP and proinflammatory cytokines in some studies, which could theoretically nudge complement levels upward as part of a generalized inflammatory milieu rather than FM-specific biology [^114H3p9t] [^111FmLVG].

> But wait, what if elevations in C3/C4 are actually driven by common comorbidities rather than FM itself. I should double-check links between complement and metabolic traits; C3 and C4 correlate with adiposity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, and higher C3 predicts incident diabetes in longitudinal cohorts, making metabolic dysfunction a credible driver of elevated complement proteins. Let me think about FM comorbidity patterns: obesity and metabolic syndrome are frequently co-reported with FM, providing a biologically and epidemiologically plausible route to higher C3/C4 via non-FM mechanisms, and similar complement–metabolic associations are observed in inflammatory rheumatic populations as well [^112iQEVE] [^114KJXxr]. This means I need to ensure that any observed C3/C4 elevations are not simply confounded by body habitus or metabolic risk rather than FM per se [^113UcX2U] [^113wZFpd].

> Hmm, wait a minute — disease-pattern reasoning matters here. In classic immune-complex diseases such as SLE, complement activation typically results in consumption with low C3/C4, not elevations, which is a different signal than an acute-phase rise and helps with differential diagnosis when fatigue and pain overlap with FM-like symptoms [^1173HvmK] [^114Rhusm]. I should confirm this pattern by recalling serum sickness versus serum sickness–like reaction: immune complex disease shows decreased complement, whereas SSLR can have normal to slightly elevated complement as part of an acute-phase response, underscoring that high C3/C4 tends to reflect nonspecific inflammation rather than immune complex consumption states [^1143fSzt]. Initially, I almost inferred that "autoimmunity" might imply high complement, but hold on, I should verify that the hallmark in immune complex–mediated autoimmunity is often low C3/C4 from consumption, not elevation, which corrects that misconception [^1173HvmK] [^114Rhusm].

> Next, I should review evidence quality and limitations. The meta-analysis flagged substantial heterogeneity and still found no FM-specific blood biomarker signature, and importantly, no included studies in the provided set directly evaluated C3/C4 in FM cohorts, which limits any definitive association claim [^114H3p9t]. Let me verify practice guidance: FM diagnosis is clinical, with guidelines recommending limited screening labs and discouraging repeated or expansive testing unless new red flags arise, which argues against using C3/C4 to "rule in" FM or to monitor FM activity [^113RTssR] [^117YGGQD] [^1148MUVn]. I need to ensure we are not overinterpreting nonspecific acute-phase reactants in a condition whose core mechanism is central sensitization rather than systemic autoimmunity or vasculitis [^111FmLVG].

> I will now examine the clinical implications. If a patient with FM has elevated C3/C4, I should first confirm whether there are coexisting drivers of acute-phase signaling such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, infection, or another inflammatory condition, rather than attributing these elevations to FM itself; complement reviews emphasize that C3/C4 elevations are nonspecific and context-dependent, and interpretation should be anchored in the overall clinical picture and other inflammatory markers like CRP [^1163eApC] [^113ZsWSU]. Conversely, if C3/C4 are low, I should verify for immune complex–mediated disease or complement consumption states (for example SLE) given the different diagnostic implications, especially when the phenotype includes systemic features beyond typical FM symptomatology [^1173HvmK] [^114Rhusm]. Let me double-check that current FM guidelines do not endorse complement testing as part of routine FM evaluation, aligning with the view that complement results, if obtained, should redirect attention toward alternative or comorbid diagnoses rather than FM itself [^113RTssR] [^117YGGQD].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I need to ensure the take-home is precise. There is no direct evidence in the provided documents that elevated C3 or C4 are consistently associated with fibromyalgia, while biological plausibility exists for nonspecific complement elevation in the setting of low-grade inflammation and common comorbidities like obesity and metabolic dysfunction, which are themselves linked to higher C3/C4 [^114H3p9t] [^113UcX2U] [^113wZFpd]. Therefore, if elevated, C3/C4 most likely reflect a general inflammatory or metabolic state rather than an FM-specific pathophysiological signature, and they should not be used as diagnostic biomarkers for FM; diagnosis remains clinical with limited screening tests, and complement abnormalities should prompt evaluation for other conditions when clinically indicated [^114H3p9t] [^111FmLVG] [^113RTssR] [^1163eApC].

---

No, elevated C3 and C4 are not characteristic of fibromyalgia [^114H3p9t] and are **not used in its diagnosis or management** [^117YGGQD]. These complement proteins are acute-phase reactants [^1163eApC] that rise with inflammation, infection, or metabolic syndrome [^1163eApC] [^113wZFpd] — not with the central sensitization underlying fibromyalgia [^112dUPwt]. If C3/C4 are elevated in a patient with fibromyalgia, **evaluate for coexisting inflammatory or metabolic conditions** — such as obesity [^113UcX2U], metabolic syndrome [^113wZFpd], or autoimmune disease [^1145Ebpe]. Elevated C3/C4 levels are nonspecific and **should not be interpreted as evidence of fibromyalgia** [^114H3p9t].

---

## Pathophysiology of fibromyalgia

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive symptoms, with central sensitization as the core mechanism [^1148MUVn] [^112dUPwt]. This mechanism involves abnormal pain processing, altered neurotransmitters, and neuroendocrine/autonomic dysregulation [^114oSMjr] [^111FmLVG]. Although low-grade inflammation and immune dysregulation have been proposed, there is **no consistent evidence of systemic inflammation or complement activation** in fibromyalgia.

---

## Complement system and its clinical significance

The complement system is a key innate immune cascade, and C3 and C4 are central components and acute-phase reactants [^1163eApC] that increase with inflammation, infection, and metabolic syndrome [^112S4ReB] [^113UcX2U]. Elevated C3/C4 are **nonspecific markers** of systemic inflammation and not disease-specific [^1163eApC].

---

## Evidence regarding complement levels in fibromyalgia

There is **no consistent evidence** that fibromyalgia is associated with elevated C3 or C4. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 studies found no complement abnormalities in fibromyalgia, and complement markers are not included in diagnostic or management guidelines. The 2012 Canadian guidelines recommend only limited initial labs (CBC, ESR, CRP, CK, TSH) to exclude other conditions — not complement testing [^117YGGQD] [^1148MUVn].

---

## Clinical interpretation of elevated C3 and C4 in fibromyalgia patients

Elevated C3/C4 in a patient with fibromyalgia should **prompt evaluation for coexisting inflammatory or metabolic conditions**, such as [^1163eApC]:

- **Obesity and metabolic syndrome**: Strongly associated with higher C3/C4 [^113wZFpd] and cardiometabolic risk [^113UcX2U].

- **Autoimmune or inflammatory diseases**: RA, SLE, and other autoimmune diseases can elevate complement levels [^1163eApC].

- **Infections**: Acute or chronic infections can raise complement levels [^112S4ReB].

Elevated C3/C4 are nonspecific and **should not be interpreted as evidence of fibromyalgia** [^1163eApC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a clinical diagnosis based on chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive symptoms, and recommend limited labs to exclude other conditions [^113RTssR] [^117YGGQD]. Complement testing is **not recommended** for diagnosis or management of fibromyalgia [^1148MUVn] [^112gGNRz].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical marker** | **Association with fibromyalgia** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| C3 and C4 | No consistent association | - Nonspecific markers of inflammation <br/> - Elevated levels suggest coexisting inflammatory or metabolic conditions |
| ESR/CRP | No specific association; used to exclude inflammatory disease [^1148MUVn] | - Useful to rule out alternative diagnoses <br/> - Typically normal or only mildly elevated in fibromyalgia |

---

Elevated C3 and C4 are **not characteristic of fibromyalgia** and are not used in its diagnosis or management [^117YGGQD]. If elevated, assess for coexisting inflammatory or metabolic disease [^113wZFpd].

### Relationships of complement components C3 and C4 and their genetics to cardiometabolic risk in healthy, non-Hispanic white adolescents [^113UcX2U]. Pediatric Research (2020). Low credibility.

Complement promotes inflammatory and immune responses and may affect cardiometabolic risk. This study was designed to investigate the effect of complement components C3 and C4 on cardiometabolic risk in healthy non-Hispanic white adolescents.

- **Methods**: Body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, waist circumference, and percent body fat were assessed in 75 adolescents. Arterial stiffness was assessed using arterial tomography and endothelial function using reactive hyperemia. Fasting lipids, inflammatory markers, and complement levels were measured, and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. A single C3 polymorphism and C4 gene copy number variations were assessed.

- **Results**: C3 plasma levels increased with measures of obesity. Endothelial function worsened with increased C3 and C4 levels. Triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein increased, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and insulin sensitivity decreased with increasing C3 levels; however, these relationships were lost when body habitus was included in the model. C4 was negatively related to HDL and positively to inflammatory markers. Subjects with at least one C3F allele had increased BMI and fat mass index. HDL was significantly related to C4L, C4S, C4A, and C4B gene copy number variation.

- **Conclusions**: C3 levels increase with increasing body mass, and increased C4 levels and copy number are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk in healthy adolescents.

### Potential role of blood biomarkers in patients with fibromyalgia: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^114H3p9t]. Pain (2022). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex chronic pain condition. Its symptoms are nonspecific, and at the time of writing, no objective test exists to confirm FM diagnosis. Potential objective measures include the circulating levels of blood biomarkers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to review studies assessing blood biomarkers' levels in patients with FM compared with healthy controls.

We systematically searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Fifty-four studies reporting the levels of biomarkers in blood in patients with FM were included. Data were extracted, and the methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors. The methodological quality of nine studies (17%) was low. The results of most studies were not directly comparable given differences in methods and investigated target immune mediators. Thus, data from 40 studies only were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model.

The meta-analysis showed that patients with FM had significantly lower levels of interleukin-1 β and higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon gamma, C-reactive protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared with healthy controls. Nevertheless, this systematic literature review and meta-analysis could not support the notion that these blood biomarkers are specific biomarkers of FM. Our literature review, however, revealed that these same individual biomarkers may have the potential role of identifying underlying pathologies or other conditions that often coexist with FM. Future research is needed to evaluate the potential clinical validity of these findings.

### Multibiomarker disease activity score and C-reactive protein in a cross-sectional observational study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with and without concomitant fibromyalgia [^115ieFhE]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether the multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score distinguished between clinically discernible levels of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity when C-reactive protein (CRP) was low, swollen joint count (SJC) results were analyzed for the 184 patients with CRP ≤ 1.0 mg/dl. SJC was chosen as a comparator because, lacking imaging data, SJC was the most objective non-blood test indicator of synovitis available. The distributions of SJC increased across the low, moderate, and high categories of the MBDA score with a statistically significant correlation (Fig. 2).

Univariate negative binomial regression analyses, using ordinal scores for the MBDA score or CRP, demonstrated that SJC was significantly related to the MBDA score but not to CRP (Table 3). The association between SJC and MBDA scores was similar when determined with adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (regression coefficient = 0.52, P = 0.004) or without it (regression coefficient = 0.45, P = 0.004). Multivariate negative binomial regression using ordinal scores demonstrated that the MBDA score was significantly associated with SJC after controlling for CRP (P = 0.021), but CRP was not associated with SJC after controlling for the MBDA score (P = 0.847). Similar results were obtained with regression analyses using continuous scales for the MBDA score and CRP (Table 3). These results indicate that, among patients with CRP ≤ 1.0 mg/dl, elevated MBDA scores were independently associated with RA disease activity, as measured with SJC, but CRP was not.

### Serum complement C3/C4 ratio, a novel marker for recurrent cardiovascular events [^111HBpnQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome is an inflammatory disease during which the complement cascade is activated. We assessed the complement C3 and C4 concentration ratio (C3/C4 ratio) in serum as a potential measurement to predict cardiovascular attacks. Patients with acute coronary syndrome (n = 148) were followed after an initial attack for subsequent ischemic cardiovascular events (composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or stroke).

During the follow-up period (average 555 days), 44 patients met an endpoint. Blood samples were taken at hospitalization, 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year after hospital admission. Serum complement C3 and C4 concentrations and the C3/C4 ratio were analyzed. Patients with an endpoint had, throughout the follow-up period, a higher C3/C4 ratio than patients without these endpoints (repeated measures analysis of variance, p = 0.007).

When all traditional cardiovascular risk factors and other potential confounding factors were included in a Cox multivariate logistic regression survival analysis, the C3/C4 ratio emerged as a novel risk factor for any new cardiovascular event (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.63, p = 0.007). When the C3/C4 ratio was divided into four quartiles, 24% in quartiles 1 and 2 (lowest) and 48% in quartile 4 (highest) had endpoints during follow-up (odds ratio 3.04, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 7.29, p = 0.01).

In conclusion, an increased serum C3/C4 ratio is a readily available and novel marker for recurrent cardiovascular events in acute coronary syndrome.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^1153spzN]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

The complement system has been recognized as a pivotal part of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It has three well-known physiological activities: host defense against infection, bridging the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, and disposing of waste immune complexes or apoptotic cells. There are approximately 30 serum complement proteins that can be activated by classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. Among these complement members, C3 and C4 are involved in almost all physiological activities and activated pathways, exerting their powerful roles as host defense proteins. Their abnormal expression, particularly complement deficiency and dysfunction, is associated with the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. C4 deficiency has also been reported to be associated with SLE, immune complex glomerulonephritis, and viral infections, regardless of ethnic background.

Both serum C3 and C4 levels are heritable traits, even in individuals without immune diseases like SLE. Recent reports showed that the heritability for serum C3 and C4 is 39.6% and 45.4%, respectively, based on a Bayesian variance components model. Therefore, it is important to identify the genetic loci that influence the serum levels of C3 and C4. In this study, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel loci associated with the serum levels of C3 and C4 in a healthy Chinese male population of 3,495 subjects.

### Efficacy and safety of atacicept in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: Results of a twenty-four-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, phase IIb study [^1142pfhL]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with low levels of serum complement C3 (n = 101) or C4 (n = 56) at baseline, atacicept at either dosage led to a steady increase in serum C3 or C4 levels, respectively, from week 4 until week 24. In the placebo group, the levels remained similar to baseline throughout the treatment period. At week 24, the median percentage increase in serum C3 levels compared with baseline (treatment day 1) was 5.3% with atacicept 75 mg and 22.1% with atacicept 150 mg versus 1.5% with placebo. The median percentage increase in serum C4 level was 64.5% with atacicept 75 mg and 128.6% with atacicept 150 mg. In patients with a low C3 and/or C4 level at baseline (n = 109), a normalized C3 and C4 level at week 24 was achieved in 52.6% and 30.6% taking atacicept 150 mg and 75 mg, respectively, versus 17.1% taking placebo.

- **Figure 4: Changes in serum biomarkers over time**. The median percentage change from baseline over 24 weeks is shown for:
	- A, serum complement C3 levels (C3-low patients)
	- B, serum complement C4 levels (C4-low patients)
	- C, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody levels (anti-dsDNA-positive patients)
	- D, serum IgG levels

In patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline (n = 147), both atacicept dosages reduced anti-dsDNA antibody levels over time. At week 24, the median percentage change versus baseline was –23.6% with atacicept 75 mg and –28.2% with atacicept 150 mg. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels increased by a median of 16.0% with placebo treatment.

### Cytokines play an aetiopathogenetic role in fibromyalgia: a hypothesis and pilot study [^11252in8]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective was to measure soluble factors having a possible role in fibromyalgia (FM) and compare the profiles of patients with recent onset of the syndrome with patients with chronic FM.

- **Methods**: The production of cytokines, cytokine-related molecules, and a CXC chemokine, interleukin (IL)-8, was examined. Fifty-six patients with FM, 23 of whom had symptoms for 2 years, were compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Cytokines and cytokine-related molecules were measured in sera and in supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that were incubated with and without lectins and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

- **Results**: No differences between FM and controls were found by measuring IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-10, serum IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Levels of IL-1R antibody (IL-1Ra) and IL-8 were significantly higher in sera, while IL-1Ra and IL-6 were significantly higher in stimulated and unstimulated FM PBMC compared with controls. Serum IL-6 levels were comparable to those in controls but were elevated in supernatants of in vitro-activated PBMC derived from patients with symptoms for more than 2 years. In the presence of PMA, there were additional increases in IL-1Ra, IL-8, and IL-6 over control values.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with FM, we found increases over time in serum levels and/or PBMC-stimulated activity of soluble factors whose release is stimulated by substance P. Since IL-8 promotes sympathetic pain and IL-6 induces hyperalgesia, fatigue, and depression, it is hypothesized that they may contribute to the pathogenesis of FM.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^1148MUVn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia experience muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems concentrating, and significant functional limitations. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer depend on tender point examination; laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease.

Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders. Management of fibromyalgia should include patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

### Complement in disease: A defence system turning offensive [^113ZsWSU]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Although the complement system is primarily perceived as a host defence system, a more versatile yet potentially more harmful side of this innate immune pathway as an inflammatory mediator also exists. The activities that define the ability of the complement system to control microbial threats and eliminate cellular debris — such as sensing molecular danger patterns, generating immediate effectors, and extensively coordinating with other defence pathways — can quickly turn complement from a defence system to an aggressor that drives immune and inflammatory diseases.

These host-offensive actions become more pronounced with age and are exacerbated by a variety of genetic factors and autoimmune responses. Complement can also be activated inappropriately, for example, in response to biomaterials or transplants. Over the past two decades, a wealth of research has led to an increasingly finely tuned understanding of complement activation, identified tipping points between physiological and pathological behaviour, and revealed avenues for therapeutic intervention.

This review summarizes our view of the key activating, regulatory, and effector mechanisms of the complement system, highlighting important crosstalk connections. Emphasizing kidney disease and transplantation, it discusses the involvement of complement in clinical conditions and promising therapeutic approaches.

### Bruising, hives, and joint pain in a 3-year-old boy [^1143fSzt]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: Which statement is TRUE for both SSLR and serum sickness?

- **A. Arthralgia is a common symptom** – Correct. Arthralgia and edema of the feet and hands are commonly seen in both serum sickness and SSLR. Fever, urticarial-like rash, and pruritus are also typical of both conditions.

- **B. Complement levels are typically decreased** – Incorrect. In SSLR, complement levels are typically normal or slightly elevated as complement can be an acute phase reactant. In contrast, immune complex deposition in serum sickness activates the complement system resulting in complement consumption, commonly demonstrated as low C3 and C4.

- **C. Immune complex formation is present** – Incorrect. Serum sickness is the classic type III immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction which results in extravascular immune complex deposition. In contrast, SSLR lacks the formation of immune complexes and is thought to occur via hypersensitivity to drug metabolites, although the pathogenesis is not entirely understood.

- **D. Most common triggers are antibiotics** – Incorrect. The most common offending agents for SSLR are antibiotics; historically, cefaclor and subsequently penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulfonamides have been reported. In one study of 83 patients, 82.7% of cases were attributed to amoxicillin as seen in this case. Other medications include bupropion, fluoxetine, and thiouracil.

Several other factors might play a role in the pathogenesis of these reactions, necessitating further investigation for comprehensive understanding.

### The evolving landscape for complement therapeutics in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases [^1111cqeR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The complement system is increasingly understood to play major roles in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Because of this situation, there are rapidly expanding commercial efforts to develop novel complement inhibitors and effector pathway-modulating drugs. This review provides insights into the evolving understanding of the complement system components, mechanisms of activation within and across the three pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin), how the pathways are normally controlled and then dysregulated in target tissues, and what diseases are known to be, in large part, complement-dependent through the successful development and approval of complement therapeutics in patients.

Mechanisms of complement activation in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and thrombotic microangiopathies are also illustrated. In addition, the specific therapeutic drugs that are both approved and under development are discussed in the context of both nonrheumatic and rheumatic diseases. Finally, the methods by which the complement system can be assessed in humans through biomarker studies are outlined, with the goal of understanding, in specific patients, how the system is functioning.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^112Xukvp]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Complement C3 and C4 play key roles in the main physiological activities of the complement system, and their deficiencies or overexpression are associated with many clinical infectious or immunity diseases. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for serum levels of C3 and C4. The first stage was conducted in 1,999 healthy Chinese men, and the second stage was performed in an additional 1,496 subjects.

We identified two SNPs, rs3753394 in the CFH gene and rs3745567 in the C3 gene, that are significantly associated with serum C3 levels at a genome-wide significance level (P = 7.33×10⁻¹¹ and P = 1.83×10⁻⁹, respectively). For C4, one large genomic region on chromosome 6p21.3 is significantly associated with serum C4 levels. Two SNPs (rs1052693 and rs11575839) were located in the MHC class I area that includes HLA-A, HLA-C, and HLA-B genes. Two SNPs (rs2075799 and rs2857009) were located 5′ and 3′ of the C4 gene. The other four SNPs, rs2071278, rs3763317, rs9276606, and rs241428, were located in the MHC class II region that includes HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DQB genes. The combined P-values for those eight SNPs ranged from 3.19×10⁻²² to 5.62×10⁻⁹⁷.

HBsAg-positive subjects have significantly lower C3 and C4 protein concentrations compared with HBsAg-negative subjects (P < 0.05). This study is the first GWAS report showing that genetic components influence the levels of complement C3 and C4. These significant findings provide novel insights into their related autoimmune and infectious diseases and molecular mechanisms.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome and complement activation [^112FGG2y]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report describes a case of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) that followed a well-documented episode of acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mononucleosis. All aetiological tests for chronic fatigue were found to be negative or normal, as were immunological tests. After two years of chronic fatigue following the acute illness, measurements of complement split products were performed to test for complement activation. These tests were positive and remained positive for 14 months, after which the patient then recovered from CFS.

### Evidence of central inflammation in fibromyalgia-increased cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-8 levels [^112gE5Yp]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2012). Low credibility.

Activation of glia cells resulting in intrathecal elevation of cytokines and chemokines has been hypothesized in chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia. To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing intrathecal concentrations of pro-inflammatory substances in fibromyalgia. We report elevated cerebrospinal fluid and serum concentrations of interleukin-8, but not interleukin-1beta, in FM patients. This profile is in accordance with FM symptoms being mediated by sympathetic activity rather than dependent on prostaglandin-associated mechanisms and supports the hypothesis of glia cell activation in response to pain mechanisms.

### Pathophysiologic mechanisms of fibromyalgia and its related disorders [^117LpcPB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews findings regarding the pathophysiologic abnormalities that contribute to the enhanced pain responses of individuals with fibromyalgia, as well as the relationships between fibromyalgia and commonly co-occurring disorders. Risk factors for fibromyalgia or enhanced pain responses include genetic and family influences, environmental triggers, and abnormal neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system function. These risk factors are also associated with several disorders that frequently co-occur with fibromyalgia, such as major depressive disorder, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome. Indeed, fibromyalgia and these co-occurring conditions may be part of a group of affective spectrum disorders that share important common, and perhaps heritable, causal factors. Recent research strongly suggests that alterations in central processing of sensory input also contribute to the cardinal symptoms of fibromyalgia, which are persistent widespread pain and enhanced pain sensitivity. Exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors, as well as altered autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine responses, may also contribute to alterations in pain perception or pain inhibition. Understanding the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and co-occurring disorders may help clinicians provide the most appropriate treatment to their patients.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for fibromyalgia, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend establishing the diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM) as early as possible by a primary care physician without requiring confirmation by a specialist. It is advised to communicate this diagnosis to the patient promptly. Repeated investigations should be avoided post-diagnosis unless required due to new-onset symptoms or signs observed during physical examination.

### C5 nephritic factors drive the biological phenotype of C3 glomerulopathies [^116CCANd]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

C3 glomerulopathies, which include dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis, are associated with genetic and acquired dysregulation of the C3 convertase alternative pathway of complement. The potential role of the activation of the C5 convertase has not been studied extensively. Here, we analyzed IgG samples from patients with C3 glomerulopathies to identify circulating autoantibodies that stabilize the C3 alternative pathway (C3 nephritic factors) as well as C5 convertases (C5 nephritic factors), thus preventing decay of these enzyme complexes. Rare variants in alternative pathway genes were found in 28 of 120 tested patients. C3 and C5 nephritic factors were found in 76 of 101 (75%) and 29 of 59 (49%) of the patients, respectively.

We compared the results of the assays for the C3 and C5 nephritic factors' functional activity: 29% were positive for C3 nephritic factors alone, 39% were positive for both C3 and C5 nephritic factors, and 10% were positive for C5 nephritic factors alone. We found that the addition of properdin enhanced stabilization of C3 convertase in the presence of IgG doubly positive for both nephritic factors, while it did not modify the stabilization mediated by IgG solely positive for C3 nephritic factors. Both C3 and C5 nephritic factors correlated with C3 consumption, while only C5 nephritic factors correlated with sC5b9 levels. C5 nephritic factors-positive patients were more likely to have C3 glomerulonephritis than dense deposit disease. Thus, dysregulation of the C5 convertase contributes to C3 glomerulopathies' inter-disease differences.

### Complement dysregulation and Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome [^117FRtBM]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of immune dysregulation and chronic inflammatory diseases in Down syndrome (DS), there are remarkably few studies investigating the role of complement, a key driver of inflammation. Some studies have shown the presence of complement proteins in DS brains; a few have explored levels of individual complement proteins in small numbers of DS plasma samples. We conducted an in-depth analysis of components, regulators, and activation products encompassing the classical, alternative, and terminal pathways of complement in adults with DS versus euploid controls; furthermore, we examined whether dementia or APOE ε4 genotype affected complement protein levels in DS.

The classical pathway, predominantly triggered by immune complexes, was first linked to DS in 1993; circulating C1q-binding immune complexes were present in plasma from 70% of individuals with DS but only 10% of controls. The demonstration of C1q immunoreactivity with Aβ plaques in DS brains implicated complement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in older adults with DS. Studies of plasma proteome changes in children and adolescents with DS, measured using mass spectrometry, identified evidence of complement consumption, including decreased levels of C1q subunit A. In contrast, we found that plasma levels of C1q, the trigger for activation of the classical pathway, were significantly elevated in adults with DS compared to matched controls (mean 191 vs. 110 μg/ml). The reasons for this marked increase are unclear. C1q levels are modulated by inflammatory cytokines, and plasma C1q levels are elevated in chronic infection states.

### Narrative review: The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia [^112dUPwt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia is a common yet poorly understood syndrome characterized by diffuse chronic pain accompanied by other somatic symptoms, including poor sleep, fatigue, and stiffness, in the absence of disease. Fibromyalgia does not have a distinct cause or pathology. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the study of chronic pain has yielded new insights into the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and related chronic pain disorders. Accruing evidence shows that patients with fibromyalgia experience pain differently from the general population because of dysfunctional pain processing in the central nervous system. Aberrant pain processing, which can result in chronic pain and associated symptoms, may be the result of several interplaying mechanisms, including central sensitization, blunting of inhibitory pain pathways, alterations in neurotransmitters, and psychiatric comorbid conditions. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms currently thought to be partly responsible for the chronic diffuse pain typical of fibromyalgia.

### Rheumatic syndromes associated with complement deficiency [^114gHhVg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Deficiency of an early component of the classical complement pathway, such as C1q, C1r/C1s, C4, or C2, regularly produces autoimmunity in humans, especially systemic lupus erythematosus. It has long been suggested that disruption of this pathway would lead to the inappropriate handling of immune complexes. An intriguing hypothesis related to this concept involves a defect in the clearance of one's own cellular debris, namely apoptotic cells. An appealing aspect of this emerging concept is that blebs on apoptotic cells are adorned with antigens to which much of the autoantibody specificity is directed in systemic lupus erythematosus.

Another hypothesis, derived primarily from complement deficiencies, relates to an impairment in the humoral immune response or in the regulation of autoreactive B cells. This review begins by summarizing the recognized autoimmune manifestations of complement deficiency and then describes new data derived from targeted gene deletions of complement proteins.

### Complement and its breakdown products in SLE [^1173HvmK]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The complement system has crucial protective functions in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, when inappropriately activated, it can cause tissue damage. Complement deficiency predisposes individuals to infections and the development of autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Simultaneously, complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, various aspects of this dualism are discussed. An overview of activation pathways and activation products is provided, along with a description of autoimmunity against complement. Additionally, the potential of complement regulation in future therapeutics is explored.

### Complement system activation: Bridging physiology, pathophysiology, and therapy [^112S4ReB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The complement system is a set of over 50 proteins that constitutes an essential part of the innate immune system. Complement system activation involves an organized proteolytic cascade. Overactivation of complement system activation is the main pathogenic mechanism of several diseases and contributes to the manifestations of many other conditions. This review describes the normal complement system and the role of complement dysregulation in critical illnesses, notably sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Complement activation is involved in the immune system's response to pathogens but, when excessive, can contribute to tissue damage, runaway inflammation, and capillary leakage syndrome. Complement overactivation may play a key role in severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Two diseases whose manifestations are mainly caused by complement overactivation, namely, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and myasthenia gravis, are discussed. A diagnostic algorithm for aHUS is provided. Early complement-inhibiting therapy has been proven effective. When renal transplantation is required, complement-inhibiting drugs can be used prophylactically to prevent aHUS recurrence. Similarly, acetylcholine-receptor autoantibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis involves complement system overactivation and responds to complement inhibition. The two main complement inhibitors used routinely at the time of writing are eculizumab and ravulizumab. The main adverse event is Neisseria infection, which is rare and preventable, but can be fatal.

### Peripheral immune markers and antipsychotic non-response in psychosis [^112dtj4c]. Schizophrenia Research (2021). Low credibility.

The role of the complement system, a component of the immune response, in the pathophysiology of treatment-resistant schizophrenia is largely unknown. While serum levels of C3 and C4 are increased in drug-free patients with established schizophrenia, serum levels of C3 are decreased in medicated patients with established schizophrenia, suggesting a possible effect of antipsychotic treatment on these markers. Moreover, abnormal peripheral levels of complement proteins such as C4, C1, C1q, C2, C3, C4, and the terminal complement complex (TCC) have been reported in patients with schizophrenia or first episode psychosis. Research focusing on the association between complement markers and severity of symptoms has reported a positive association between serum levels of C3 and C4 and two items from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) negative symptom scale, referring to active social avoidance and deficient attention, but no associations between complement markers and PANSS positive symptoms. Our recent paper, in a small sample of patients with first episode psychosis, showed increased C4 levels in patients with worse clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up compared with those showing an improvement and overall better treatment response.

Some studies on established schizophrenia have also suggested that abnormal levels of peripheral cytokines may be linked to the severity of negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Increased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-3, and IL-18 have been associated with more severe PANSS negative symptoms.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^113peFfv]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Situation analysis and consultation design**: A draft content outline of potential research topics was formulated by AG. This outline integrated similar topics addressed in other autoimmune conditions and was modeled on previous focus groups on immune trials in chronic pain conditions and multi-stakeholder processes in pain conditions. The outline and a preliminary list of stakeholders were circulated among two stakeholders (D. A. and C.B.) who provided suggestions about the content and the involvement of additional stakeholders. A revised content proposal was sent to the identified stakeholders, and changes were made regarding both content and the invitation of additional stakeholders. The final version was circulated among all stakeholders.

- **Workshop preparation**: An agenda for a two-day workshop was condensed from the document and circulated in advance for stakeholder review. Revisions were implemented where necessary. The finalized agenda included 11 topic areas for discussion. The goal of the workshop was to include the full range of suggested topic areas for discussion without any ranking or exclusion. Each topic area was introduced by a stakeholder with expertise in that field and then deliberated by the working group using a roundtable discussion format.

- **Analysis and identification of research recommendations**: Minutes from the working group meeting were independently taken by three people and subsequently combined.

### Complement activation in a model of chronic fatigue syndrome [^117CUYre]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

There is a need to identify biological markers in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).

- **Objective**: To use an exercise and/or allergen challenge to induce the symptoms of CFS and to identify a biological marker that correlates with these symptoms.
- **Methods**: Patients with CFS (n = 32) and age-matched normal control patients (n = 29) exercised for 20 minutes on a stationary bike at 70% of their predicted maximum workload (Watts). Patients from each group with positive skin test results were also challenged with intranasally administered relevant allergens. Symptoms were recorded for 2 weeks before and 1 week after each challenge, using three different instruments. Blood samples were taken before, and at 0, 1, 6, and 24 hours after challenges. Levels of complement split products, cell-associated cytokines, and eosinophilic cationic protein were measured. Mean preexercise and postexercise symptom scores were evaluated for each group.
- **Results**: Exercise challenge induced significant increases of the complement split product C4a, but not C3a or C5a, at 6 hours after exercise only in the CFS group (P < 0.01), regardless of allergy status. Mean symptom scores were significantly increased after exercise through the use of a daily diary (P < 0.03) and a weekly diary (P < 0.01) for the CFS group only. Mean scores for the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory categories "reduced activity" and "mental fatigue" were significantly increased in the CFS group only (P < 0.04 and P < 0.02, respectively).
- **Conclusions**: Exercise challenge may be a valuable tool in the development of diagnostic criteria and tests.

### Soliris [^114fFGEr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity. This binding inhibits its cleavage to C5a and C5b and prevents the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS. The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown, but it is presumed to involve the reduction of terminal complement complex C5b-9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction. Similarly, the exact mechanism by which eculizumab achieves its therapeutic effect in NMOSD is unknown, but it is thought to involve the inhibition of aquaporin-4-antibody induced terminal complement C5b-9 deposition.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In the placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1), Soliris, when administered as recommended, reduced serum LDH levels from 2200 ± 1034 U/L (mean ± SD) at baseline to 700 ± 388 U/L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 (327 ± 433 U/L) in patients with PNH. In the single-arm clinical study (PNH Study 2), this effect was maintained through week 52 [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In patients with PNH, aHUS, gMG, and NMOSD, free C5 concentrations of < 0.5 mcg/mL correlated with a complete blockade of terminal complement activity.

### Shedding light on the role of complement C4 activation in cancer [^114aHcs7]. Human Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Complement C4 is a key component in the activation of classical and lectin complement pathways, observed in both animal tumor models and cancer patients. While extensively studied in autoimmune disorders, the functions of complement C4 and its activation in cancer have received inadequate consideration. Recent studies have detected C4 activation in animal tumor models and cancer patients, with its fragment C4d found in cancer tissues and lymph nodes. Elevated C4d levels could be a useful biomarker for detecting various cancers.

This review aims to summarize recent developments on the role of complement C4 activation in promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby supporting tumor progression and metastasis; C4d as a biomarker; and its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy. We also conduct a critical evaluation of methods used to measure complement C4 and its activation products, highlighting possible pitfalls and areas for improvement in existing research.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^114HCeWg]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Although not specific to autoantibody (Aab) research, stakeholders considered the design of clinical trials. One consideration was that side effect profiles for any immunological drug trials addressing Aab mechanisms would differ from currently used drugs, and trial designs would need to address this.

There was high consensus that primary endpoints for interventional trials in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) should reflect patients' multi-dimensional experiences, which often include symptoms such as cold sensitivity, pressure sensitivity, emotional distress, and fatigue, rather than solely focusing on the perceived pain intensity. Stakeholders discussed how their consensus is best reconciled with traditional recommendations of using pain intensity as the primary outcome for pain-condition trials. A discussion within the worldwide research community was suggested as important.

It was agreed that FMS interventional trial designs should generally be co-created both with patients and interdisciplinary professionals.

Stakeholders agreed that research into decision-making by people with FMS about their participation in interventional trials would be important. It is essential to employ methods that truly empower patients in their decision-making, particularly in the context of drugs that can have serious adverse effects.

"Placebo-dread" may affect trial recruitment and outcomes in FMS trials, where patients fear that reporting a good improvement of their symptoms may later be interpreted as being "all in their head" if randomized to placebo. This may be particularly important in investigator-led trials.

### Data-independent LC-MS/MS analysis of ME/CFS plasma reveals a dysregulated coagulation system, endothelial dysfunction, downregulation of complement machinery [^115u41jx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Low credibility.

The demographics of the participant groups and the symptom severity score averages of the ME/CFS population are presented in Table 1. A portion of the ME/CFS cohort presents with symptoms and comorbidities intimately associated with ME/CFS, specifically gastrointestinal issues (6/15 participants), orthostatic symptoms (5/15 participants), and fibromyalgia (3/15 participants). Proteomics data from the analysis of control (n = 10) and ME/CFS (n = 15) PPP using Skyline are represented in Table 2, and the total ion chromatogram (TIC) is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 2 represents the quality plots for all proteins/peptides across the three m/z ranges, obtained from MSstatsShiny. Our experiment indicates that 24 proteins are significantly increased in the ME/CFS group compared to the controls, while 21 proteins are significantly downregulated. However, only a select few hold strong statistical significance. These proteins will be presented and discussed, while other identified protein data can be found in Supplementary Material 1. In some cases, a limited number of peptides from a protein are significant, which may reflect regulated peptides or be related to the number of ions entering the mass spectrometer at a given time point. The transitions for proteins detected by a single peptide are contained within Supplementary Material 2.

### Recent insights into C3 glomerulopathy [^1158DFbB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

The complement system comprises over 30 proteins either circulating in plasma and other body fluids or localized to cell membranes. It plays a physiological role in innate immunity and inflammation, leading to the elimination of microbial pathogens, as well as apoptotic host cells and cellular debris. Complement activation occurs via proteolytic cleavage in three pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways (Figure 1).

Whereas the activation of the classical pathway usually requires immunoglobulin, alternative pathway (AP) activation occurs spontaneously at a low level in the circulation due to hydrolysis of the internal thioester bond of the C3 molecule, known as 'C3 tickover'. C3 activation generates fragments C3a and C3b, the latter binding complement factor B (Cfb) to form the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb) that amplifies C3 activation in a positive feedback mechanism. The C3b amplification loop, also known as the amplification loop of the complement pathways, is a powerful means through which millions of C3b molecules are generated following the initial activation of C3.

The binding of additional C3b molecules to the AP C3 convertase generates a C5 convertase that activates C5, yielding fragments C5a and C5b. C5b initiates terminal pathway activation resulting in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9). Fragments C3a and C5a, generated through C3 and C5 proteolysis, respectively, are anaphylatoxins.

- **Figure 1**: Complement activation pathways and C3 amplification.

The AP is inhibited by several regulatory proteins present in the circulation.

### Complement regulators in human disease: Lessons from modern genetics [^116KKM8p]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

First identified in human serum in the late 19th century as a 'complement' to antibodies in mediating bacterial lysis, the complement system emerged more than a billion years ago, probably as the first humoral immune system. The contemporary complement system consists of nearly 60 proteins in three activation pathways — classical, alternative, and lectin — and a terminal cytolytic pathway common to all. Modern molecular biology and genetics have not only led to further elucidation of the structure of complement system components but have also revealed function-altering rare variants and common polymorphisms. These are particularly significant in regulators of the alternative pathway that predispose to human disease by creating 'hyperinflammatory complement phenotypes'.

To treat these 'complementopathies', a monoclonal antibody against the initiator of the membrane attack complex, C5, has received approval for use. Additional therapeutic reagents are on the horizon.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^114DVpFo]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Recent findings of pain-sensitizing autoantibodies (Aab) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) open a new field of research, with questions extending across a wide range of areas. In this focused research priority setting exercise, stakeholders from various professional backgrounds and regions, along with funders, relatives, and patients with FMS, agreed on a set of research recommendations. These proposed research areas might be pursued by interested researchers and funders worldwide.

Stakeholders agreed that confirming Aab's contribution to the cause of FMS would be a transformative finding for this field. It would also represent a revolutionary advance, helping to eliminate the stigma often experienced by patients due to the lack of understanding.

Ensuring that research focuses on improving FMS management and is translatable to a clinical context will be critical in improving the quality of life for this historically under-managed patient cohort.

### Neurogenic neuroinflammation in fibromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome [^115ePvWV]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Although fibromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) have distinct clinical phenotypes, they share many features. Pain, allodynia, and dysaesthesia occur in both conditions and seem to exist on a similar spectrum. Fibromyalgia and CRPS can be triggered by specific traumatic events. However, fibromyalgia is most commonly associated with psychological trauma, whereas CRPS is most often associated with physical trauma, which is frequently deemed routine or minor by patients.

Fibromyalgia and CRPS also appear to share many pathophysiological mechanisms, with central effects being particularly important. Nonetheless, peripheral effects, such as neurogenic neuroinflammation, also significantly contribute to the clinical features of these disorders. This review highlights the varying degrees to which neurogenic neuroinflammation might contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of both fibromyalgia and CRPS. It discusses the evidence suggesting that this mechanism is an important link between the two disorders and could offer novel therapeutic targets.

### Medical records-based genetic studies of the complement system [^116pGYpg]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Genetic variants in complement genes have been associated with a wide range of human disease states, but well-powered genetic association studies of complement activation have not been performed in large multiethnic cohorts.

- **Methods**: We performed medical records-based genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies for plasma C3 and C4 levels among participants of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network.

- **Results**: In a GWAS for C3 levels in 3,949 individuals, we detected two genome-wide significant loci: chr.1q31.3 (CFH locus; rs3753396-A; β = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.25; P = 1.52×10⁻¹¹) and chr.19p13.3 (C3 locus; rs11569470-G; β = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.24; P = 1.29×10⁻⁸). These two loci explained approximately 2% of variance in C3 levels. GWAS for C4 levels involved 3,998 individuals and revealed a genome-wide significant locus at chr.6p21.32 (C4 locus; rs3135353-C; β = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.45; P = 4.58×10⁻³⁵). This locus explained approximately 13% of variance in C4 levels. The multiallelic copy number variant analysis defined two structural genomic C4 variants with a large effect on blood C4 levels: C4-BS (β = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.30; P = 2.98×10⁻²²) and C4-AL-BS (β = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.29; P = 8.11×10⁻²³). Overall, C4 levels were strongly correlated with copy numbers of C4A and C4B genes. In comprehensive phenome-wide association studies involving 102,138 eMERGE participants, we cataloged a full spectrum of autoimmune, cardiometabolic, and kidney diseases genetically related to systemic complement activation.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings underscore the significant impact of genetic variants in the complement system, further elucidating their role in diverse disease processes.

### Multibiomarker disease activity score and C-reactive protein in a cross-sectional observational study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with and without concomitant fibromyalgia [^112yWn2F]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

**Key message**: The multibiomarker disease activity score frequently indicated elevated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity, even when C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were normal. Unlike clinically-based measures, the multibiomarker scores were similar between RA patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and those with RA alone. This suggests that the multibiomarker disease activity score may objectively complement conventional RA disease activity measures when CRP is normal.

### C4 nephritic factors in C3 glomerulopathy: A case series [^115VgEfU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) defines a group of rare complement-mediated kidney diseases with a shared underlying pathophysiology: dysregulation of complement in the fluid phase and glomerular microenvironment. Dysregulation can be driven by autoantibodies to C3 and C5 convertases.

- **Study design**: Case series.

- **Setting & participants**: 168 patients with C3G (dense deposit disease, 68; C3 glomerulonephritis, 100) selected from our C3G biobank.

- **Outcomes**: Patient-purified immunoglobulin Gs were tested for C4 nephritic factors (C4NeFs). These autoantibodies recognize C4b2a, the C3 convertase of the classical pathway of complement.

- **Measurements**: C4NeFs were detected using a modified hemolytic assay.

- **Results**: C4NeFs were identified in 5 patients, 4 of whom had C3 glomerulonephritis. C4NeFs were associated with dysregulation of C3 and C5 convertases, and they appear to stabilize these convertases in a dose-dependent manner. C4NeFs also appear to protect C4b2a from decay mediated by soluble CR1 and C4 binding protein. The stabilizing activity of the autoantibodies was further demonstrated by using heat treatment to inactivate complement. C4NeFs were not detected in 150 patients with another complement-mediated kidney disease, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome; they were also absent in 300 apparently healthy controls.

- **Limitations**: In addition to C4NeFs, 2 patients had positive findings for other autoantibodies: one patient also had autoantibodies to factor H, and the other patient also had autoantibodies to C3bBb (C3NeFs).

### Qfitlia [^1158N4j8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Adjust plunger to your prescribed dose**: Push the plunger rod to push solution back into the vial until you have the prescribed dose in the syringe. Push the plunger rod to 0.2 mL for a 20 mg dose or to 0.1 mL for a 10 mg dose. If the medicine in the syringe is less than your prescribed dose, repeat steps C2, C3, and C4 until you have your correct dose. Remove the needle from the vial, ensuring the needle does not touch anything.

- **Inject Qfitlia**:

- **Pinch a fold of skin and insert the needle**: Gently pinch a fold of skin at the cleaned injection site. Insert the needle into the skin fold at a 45° to 90° angle.
- **Inject Qfitlia**: Relax the skin pinch and slowly push the plunger rod all the way to the bottom of the syringe body to inject all of the Qfitlia solution.
- **Gently pull out the needle and syringe**: Do not recap the used needle to avoid a needle-stick injury, and do not rub the skin after the injection. If you see any blood at the site, lightly dab it with a cotton ball or gauze pad. If your injection site becomes red or sore, call your healthcare provider right away.

### Sensitive and specific assays for C3 nephritic factors clarify mechanisms underlying complement dysregulation [^1115j6wS]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

We confirm the previously noted heterogeneity of C3NeF, describe convertase-stabilizing activity and other activities of selected C3NeF, and provide assays for C5 convertase stabilization. We deliberately abandon historical terms and subgroups used to categorize C3NeF, instead emphasizing that each C3NeF must be treated as a unique entity with properties that dictate its pathological effects.

We show that a simple ELISA for convertase stabilization and/or binding is most reliable for C3NeF detection. We propose a rational approach in which serum samples from patients presenting with relevant history are first screened for AP activation using standard assays (C3, C4, fB, hemolytic activity [CH50; AP50], activation markers such as terminal complement complex where available). Where AP activation is identified (low C3, fB, AH50; elevated terminal complement complex), samples are screened for C3NeF using COS-P, which identifies most C3NeF. Clinically suspicious samples negative in COS-P are screened in COIg, which detects weakly or non-stabilizing C3NeF missed in COS-P. Serum samples negative in COIg are rescreened using purified IgG to detect fH-sensitive C3NeF that can be missed in serum. Where appropriate, positive samples are further screened in specialist centers to identify those conferring resistance to fH regulation or stabilizing C5 convertase.

### Complement activation profiles predict clinical outcomes in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease [^113cfYSH]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Associations between CFs and demographic and clinical characteristics are outlined in eTable 2, which shows the univariable analysis for the association between serum and CSF levels of CFs and clinical features in the whole cohort. Age at sampling was positively associated with serum levels of Ba, C4, C5, and CSF levels of all factors except SC5b9, C3, C4, C5, and the C4a/C4 and C5a/C5 ratios. Male patients exhibited higher CSF levels of all CFs except C3, C4, C5, and the C4a/C4 ratio compared with females. Serum levels of only three CFs (Bb, C3a, and C4) were higher in samples collected at acute onset or relapse compared to remission. Regarding clinical presentation, CSF levels of C3a, C4a, and the C3a/C3 ratio were elevated in the SC topography compared with ON. Serum levels of C3, C4, and C5, as well as CSF levels of all CFs except C3, C5, and the C4a/C4 ratio were associated positively with EDSS at onset, except C4 in CSF. Administration of acute treatment within one month before sampling influenced positively the serum levels of C3 and C4, as well as CSF levels of Ba, Bb, C3a, Factor H, C1q, and the C3/C3a ratio.

- **Serum levels of complement activation products discriminate MOGAD from AQP4-NMOSD and MS**: As shown in Figure 1, serum levels of CFs Ba, Bb, C3a, C4a, C5a, SC5b9, C3, and C4 were significantly increased in MOGAD compared with patients with MS. By contrast, Factor I and the C3a/C3 and C4a/C4 ratios were decreased in MOGAD compared with patients with MS (p < 0.01). Comparisons between patients with MOGAD and AQP4-NMOSD revealed significantly higher serum levels of C3a, C4a, and the C3a/C3 ratio.

### Unravelling the nature of postexertional malaise in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: The role of elastase, complement C4a and interleukin-1beta [^114M52A1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Too vigorous exercise or activity frequently triggers postexertional malaise in people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a primary characteristic evident in up to 95% of people with ME/CFS. The present study aimed at examining whether two different types of exercise result in changes in health status, circulating elastase activity, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and complement C4a levels.

- **Design**: Comparative experimental design.
- **Setting**: University.
- **Subjects**: Twenty-two women with ME/CFS and 22 healthy sedentary controls.
- **Interventions**: Participants were subjected to a submaximal exercise (day 8) and a self-paced, physiologically limited exercise (day 16). Each bout of exercise was preceded and followed by blood sampling, actigraphy, and assessment of their health status.
- **Results**: Both submaximal exercise and self-paced, physiologically limited exercise resulted in postexertional malaise in people with ME/CFS. However, neither exercise bout altered elastase activity, IL-1beta, or complement C4a split product levels in people with ME/CFS or healthy sedentary control subjects (P > 0.05). Postexercise complement C4a level was identified as a clinically important biomarker for postexertional malaise in people with ME/CFS.
- **Conclusions**: Submaximal exercise as well as self-paced, physiologically limited exercise triggers postexertional malaise in people with ME/CFS, but neither type of exercise alters acute circulating levels of IL-1beta, complement C4a split product, or elastase activity. Further study of immune alterations in response to exertion in ME/CFS is warranted.

### Complement in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatic disease [^111PXer7]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

The complement system has vital protective functions as a humoral component of the innate immune system and also through interactions with the adaptive immune system; however, when inappropriately activated or regulated, complement can cause inflammation and organ damage, and such processes are involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions, not least rheumatic diseases. Furthermore, states of complement deficiency can predispose not only to infections but also to autoimmune disorders, including rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. In this review, the mechanisms behind the pathogenic activities of complement in rheumatic diseases are discussed. Potential approaches to therapeutic intervention that focus on regulating complement activities in these disorders are also considered.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^111ZBXSc]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Complement C3 and C4 play key roles in the main physiological activities of the complement system, with their deficiencies or over-expression associated with many clinical infectious or immunity diseases. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for serum levels of C3 and C4. The first stage involved 1,999 healthy Chinese men, and the second stage included an additional 1,496 subjects.

We identified two SNPs, rs3753394 in the CFH gene and rs3745567 in the C3 gene, significantly associated with serum C3 levels at a genome-wide significance level (P = 7.33 × 10⁻¹¹ and P = 1.83 × 10⁻⁹, respectively). For C4, a large genomic region on chromosome 6p21.3 is significantly associated with serum C4 levels. Two SNPs, rs1052693 and rs11575839, were located in the MHC class I area, which includes HLA-A, HLA-C, and HLA-B genes. Two SNPs, rs2075799 and rs2857009, were located 5' and 3' of the C4 gene. The other four SNPs, rs2071278, rs3763317, rs9276606, and rs241428, were located in the MHC class II region, which includes HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DQB genes. The combined P-values for these eight SNPs ranged from 3.19 × 10⁻²² to 5.62 × 10⁻⁹⁷.

HBsAg-positive subjects have significantly lower C3 and C4 protein concentrations compared to HBsAg-negative subjects (P < 0.05). Our study is the first GWAS report demonstrating the influence of genetic components on the levels of complement C3 and C4. Our significant findings provide novel insights into their related autoimmune and infectious diseases, as well as molecular mechanisms.

### Fibromyalgia pain: do we know the source [^114oSMjr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition of unknown origin. Multiple abnormalities have been described, including peripheral tissue and central nervous system changes. The relation of these mechanisms, however, is likely bidirectional. FMS pain clearly depends on peripheral nociceptive input as well as abnormal central pain processing. This review focuses on the role of peripheral nociceptive input for pain in FMS.

- **Recent findings**: There is strong evidence for abnormal central pain processing in FMS. Sensitized spinal cord neurons in the dorsal horn are responsible for augmented pain processing of nociceptive signals from the periphery. In addition, glial activation, possibly by cytokines and excitatory amino acids, may play a role in the initiation and perpetuation of this sensitized state.

- **Summary**: Nociceptive input clearly plays an important role in FMS. Acute or repetitive tissue injury has been associated with FMS pain. Cytokines related to such injuries may be responsible for long-term activation of spinal cord glia and dorsal horn neurons, thus resulting in central sensitization. A better understanding of these important neuro-immune interactions may provide relevant insights into future effective therapies.

### Complement C3 is a risk factor for the development of diabetes: A population-based cohort study [^113wZFpd]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional studies have reported strong correlations between plasma levels of complement C3, insulin, and glucose. This prospective study explored whether elevated levels of C3, C4, and other inflammation-sensitive plasma proteins (ISPs; fibrinogen, orosomucoid, alpha1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin) are associated with the development of diabetes. Plasma proteins were measured in 2,815 nondiabetic healthy men, aged 38–50 years, who were reexamined following a mean follow-up of 6.1 years.

Diabetes development (n = 123) was studied in relation to baseline levels of plasma proteins. After adjusting for age, screening year, and glucose at baseline, the odds ratios (95% CI) for developing diabetes were 1.00, 2.4 (1.1–5.3), 2.9 (1.4–6.0), and 5.6 (2.8–10.9), respectively, for men with C3 in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles (trend: P < 0.00001). Fibrinogen, haptoglobin, C4, and the number of elevated ISPs were also related to future diabetes in this model. Only C3 was significantly associated with diabetes development after further adjustments for potential confounders, including BMI, insulin, and other inflammatory markers. We concluded that the risk of developing diabetes is related to levels of complement C3.

### Complement therapeutics are coming of age in rheumatology [^1145Ebpe]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The complement system was described over 100 years ago, and it is well established that activation of this pathway accompanies the great majority of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Over three decades of work in murine models of human disease have nearly universally demonstrated that complement activation is upstream of tissue injury and the engagement of pro-inflammatory mechanisms, such as the elaboration of cytokines and chemokines, as well as myeloid cell recruitment and activation. With that background, and taking advantage of advances in the development of biologic and small-molecule therapeutics, the creation and clinical evaluation of complement therapeutics is now rapidly expanding.

This article reviews the state of the complement therapeutics field, focusing on their use in diseases cared for, or consulted upon by rheumatologists. Included is an overview of the activation mechanisms and components of the system, in addition to the mechanisms by which the complement system interacts with other immune system constituents. Various therapeutic approaches to modulating the system in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases are reviewed. To understand how best to clinically assess the complement system, methods of its evaluation are described. Finally, next-generation therapeutic and diagnostic advances that can be envisioned for the future are discussed.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^117HdFMU]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Two members of the working group self-selected out to avoid potential perceived bias (one funder and one pharmaceutical industry representative). The cohort was n = 27. Of these, n = 22 responded, giving a response rate of 81.5%. As 81.5% was the highest achievable percentage of agreement for the total cohort, the consensus for each recommendation was categorized based on the percentage agreement of the total cohort: high consensus (> 72%), medium (62%–71%), low (51%–61%), and less than 51% was deemed to have no consensus. Six recommendations achieved high consensus, whereas n = 15 had a medium level of consensus.

- **Research recommendations with high or medium stakeholder agreement fell into the following five thematic groups**:
	- **Facets of FMS (category 1)**: n = 5
	- **Aab research (category 2)**: n = 5
	- **Immunology (category 3)**: n = 4
	- **Small fibre neuropathy (category 4)**: n = 2
	- **Clinical interventions and trial design (categories 4 and 5)**: n = 5

### Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia [^1139Qtkb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. Understanding it as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing explains the perception of pain in response to stimuli that, in healthy individuals, would not be painful. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, because of the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may rapidly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment. If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, they can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.

### Understanding the role of the complement system in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^114KJXxr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The complement system has been associated with the etiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are prevalent among patients with RA. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between a comprehensive evaluation of the complement system and IR, as well as MetS, in patients with RA.

A total of 339 nondiabetic patients with RA were recruited. Functional assays of the 3 complement pathways were assessed. Additionally, serum levels of the following individual components of the complement system were measured: C1q (classical); lectin (lectin); C2, C4, and C4b (classical lectin); factor D and properdin (alternative); C3 and C3a (common); C5, C5a, and C9 (terminal); as well as the factor I and C1 inhibitor regulators. IR and β cell function indices were calculated using the homeostatic model assessment. Criteria for MetS were applied. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between the complement system and IR in patients with RA.

Many elements of the upstream and common complement pathways, but not the functional tests of the 3 routes, correlated positively with higher levels of IR and β cell function. However, after multivariable adjustment for factors associated with IR, these relationships were lost. Conversely, the presence of MetS in patients with RA maintained a relationship with higher levels of C1q, C4, C3, properdin, and factor I after adjusting for confounders.

There is a positive correlation between the complement system and metabolic abnormalities in patients with RA.

### Complement system biomarkers in first episode psychosis [^117JpeBP]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Low credibility.

The complement system is a major effector of innate immunity and an adjuvant of adaptive immunity. It comprises around 30 plasma and cell-surface proteins that interact with one another to induce a series of inflammatory responses involved in defense against infection. The complement is activated via three initiating pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin), all of which converge on a common effector pathway with the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC).

Complement acts through the production of:

- **Opsonins (C3b, iC3b)**: Increasing the ability of macrophages and neutrophils to phagocytose.
- **Anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a)**: Inducing local and systemic inflammatory responses, increasing the permeability of blood vessels, and attracting neutrophils.
- **Direct killing of organisms by formation of the MAC**: Disrupts the phospholipid bilayer of a target cell.

Complement system function is regulated (accelerated or inhibited) by complement regulatory proteins present in fluid-phase or membrane-bound forms.

Dysregulation of the complement system in schizophrenia has been noted in a few small studies. Notably, these studies indicate increased activation of the classical complement pathway and decreased complement hemolytic activity, indicative of consumption. However, data regarding complement changes are inconsistent, with one study reporting increased plasma levels of C3 and C4, while another described decreased levels of these proteins. This lack of consensus, together with a growing evidence base indicating that complement is involved in brain development, highlights the complexity of complement's role in schizophrenia.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^113ZSQr9]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Some confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, and hsCRP, are predictive of the C3 or C4 levels; however, the most significant covariate for C3 is the BMI (P = 2.88 × 10⁻⁷), and age for C4 (P = 5.56 × 10⁻¹¹) in our multivariate linear model, which also included novel SNPs identified in this study. Together, these variables could explain more than 90% of the variance of the C4 level (R² > 0.90). Serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, a potential confounder for the acute phase reactants C3 and C4 protein, was also available in our dataset. Further adjustment for hsCRP revealed similar results (Table S1). Considering the high infection rate of hepatitis B virus in the general Chinese population and its potential influence on complement, we furthermore carried out an interaction analysis of infection-by-genotype. Although both the C3 and C4 levels in the HBsAg-positive group were significantly lower than in the negative group in the combined 3,495 subjects (1.09 ± 0.21 vs 1.18 ± 0.34 for C3 and 0.32 ± 0.09 vs 0.34 ± 0.10 for C4, P < 0.05), the potential cause could be that the synthesis ability of complements was still normal in the liver organ.

In summary, through a two-stage GWAS of 3,495 healthy Chinese male subjects, we identified that CFH and C3 loci were significantly associated with serum levels of C3, and a ∼2 Mb loci on the 6p21.3 region was significantly associated with serum levels of C4.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^117TCReh]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is the most common chronic widespread pain condition in rheumatology. Until recently, no clear pathophysiological mechanism for fibromyalgia had been established, resulting in management challenges. Recent research has indicated that serum immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) may play a role in FMS. We undertook a research prioritization exercise to identify the most pertinent research approaches that may lead to clinically implementable outputs.

- **Methods**: Research priority setting was conducted in five phases: situation analysis, design, expert group consultation, interim recommendations, and consultation and revision. A dialogue model was used, and an international multi-stakeholder expert group was invited. Clinical, patient, industry, funder, and scientific expertise was represented throughout. Recommendation-consensus was determined via a voluntary closed eSurvey. Reporting guidelines for priority setting of health research were employed to support implementation and maximize impact.

- **Results**: Arising from the expert group consultation (n = 29 participants), 39 interim recommendations were defined. A response rate of 81.5% was achieved in the consensus survey. Six recommendations were identified as high priority and 15 as medium-level priority. The recommendations range from aspects of fibromyalgia features that should be considered in future autoantibody research, to specific immunological investigations, suggestions for trial design in FMS, and therapeutic interventions that should be assessed in trials.

### Intravenously applied IgG stimulates complement attenuation in a complement-dependent autoimmune disease at the amplifying C3 convertase level [^112HB7B3]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Intravenously applied normal human immunoglobulin G (IgG) has anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Systemic inflammation can originate from an overreacting amplification loop of the complement system. In blood, C3b2-containing complexes maintain complement amplification much better than the extremely short-lived C3b. Therefore, in patients with the complement-dependent autoimmune disease, dermatomyositis, we studied whether intravenously applied normal human IgG (IVIG) stimulated in vivo inactivation of these complexes.

In the course of IVIG treatment, clinically effective in 6 of 8 patients, the concentration of C3b2-containing complexes dropped to 37% ± 14% (n = 6) of the pretreatment level when 0.5 g IgG/kg body weight was infused. The concentration increased marginally and in parallel to factor Bb thereafter until full-dose IgG was infused. By day 14, following the infusion of 2 g IgG/kg body weight, the concentration of C3b2-containing complexes was 66% ± 19%. The plasma concentration of C3 remained constant in myopathic patients or increased by 15% to 20% in amyopathic patients.

In contrast, IVIG infusion was associated with consumption of up to 40% of plasma C4 at day 1 to 2 after completion of IVIG infusion. Thus, IVIG had an immediate and long-lasting attenuating effect on complement amplification in vivo, despite the fact that it induced classical complement pathway activation.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^1159dFP8]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The research recommendation process was conducted in five phases: situation analysis, design, expert group consultation, interim recommendations, and consultation and revision.

- **Situation analysis**: This phase involved convenors defining the scope.
- **Design phase**: Included stakeholder engagement, protocol development, and defining decision-making criteria.
- **Expert group consultation**: This was a detailed, two-day, face-to-face workshop involving invited multidisciplinary researchers, clinicians, and people living with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The workshop was facilitated by the research charity funders (VA).
- **Interim recommendations**: These arose from the workshop and were prepared and shared with the attending stakeholders who were invited to critically assess the recommendations. These were reviewed in an iterative manner until consensus was reached.
- **Consultation and revision**: After two iterative rounds, an anonymous e-survey was conducted to ascertain levels of stakeholder agreement.

- **Stakeholders/Participants**:

The group consisted of 29 stakeholders (16 male, 13 female), of which 25 also participated in the face-to-face workshop. This included patients (n = 2) and caregivers (n = 1). One of the participating patients had received specific research review training from VA and had experience as a "patient insight partner" for pain-related research. The group provided a broad mix of clinical and scientific skills and experiences.
