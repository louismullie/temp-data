## Question

Dies methadone give patient a feeling they are opiodes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether methadone gives patients a feeling that they are on opioids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about methadone's pharmacology and whether it is an opioid. Then, I should verify its subjective effects, including euphoria and sedation, and how these differ from other opioids. Next, I will consider how dose, tolerance, and clinical context modify the experience. After that, I should review patient-reported perceptions and any experimental data on emotional effects. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note safety and counseling implications.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because I need to ensure I'm not missing a mechanistic distinction. Methadone is a full mu-opioid receptor agonist, which means it activates the same receptors as other opioids and is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance with abuse potential, so yes, it is an opioid and can produce opioid-like effects including analgesia, sedation, and euphoria in susceptible individuals [^409bca42] [^973a4154] [^b0e586d3].

> Wait, let me verify the subjective effects profile, because patients often ask whether it "feels like" other opioids. Methadone can cause euphoria and sedation, but compared with short-acting opioids like heroin or oxycodone, its onset is slower and its duration is much longer, which tends to blunt the intensity of euphoria and makes the experience more stable and less "rushy", though individual responses vary with dose and tolerance [^b0e586d3] [^3d7bf960].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose effects without checking the evidence. At low, initiation doses used for opioid use disorder (often 10–30 mg/day), patients may report little euphoria and primarily experience withdrawal suppression and a sense of "normalcy", whereas at higher, maintenance doses (commonly 60–120 mg/day), some patients report feeling sedated or "heavy", though many still do not describe a pronounced high; this dose-dependent modulation of subjective effects is consistent with clinical observations and guideline dosing principles [^0c158455] [^67b1c43e] [^27091179].

> I should double-check the role of tolerance, because that changes the subjective experience substantially. In opioid-tolerant individuals, methadone's euphoric effects are attenuated, and patients often report feeling "normal" or "comfortable" rather than intoxicated; this is why methadone is effective for maintenance — it suppresses withdrawal and craving without producing marked euphoria at therapeutic doses in tolerant patients [^c9b61527] [^27091179].

> Next, I should review direct patient experience data to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Qualitative interviews with methadone-maintained patients repeatedly describe dose-related feelings of "comfort" and "function", with many expressing a desire to avoid feeling "high" and associating higher doses with sedation rather than euphoria; this aligns with the clinical goal of stabilizing patients without producing intoxication [^27091179].

> But wait, what if we consider experimental data on mood effects rather than just interviews. A controlled study using mood induction found that at peak plasma levels, methadone-maintained patients had blunted emotional reactivity to both positive and negative stimuli compared with controls, suggesting a dampening of both elation and dysphoria rather than a classic euphoric "high", which fits the clinical impression of emotional stabilization on therapeutic doses [^c0e6062d].

> I need to ensure I address the clinical context, because the "feeling" differs between treatment for opioid use disorder versus pain. In OUD treatment, methadone is titrated to suppress withdrawal and craving while minimizing euphoria, and patients are counseled that the goal is stabilization, not intoxication; in pain care, methadone is sometimes dosed more frequently for analgesia, which can increase sedation, but again, careful titration aims for analgesia without euphoria or dangerous accumulation [^c9b61527] [^6ce0b9d2] [^16d7ae31].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Yes, methadone is an opioid, and patients can feel opioid-like effects such as sedation and, at higher doses or in opioid-naive individuals, some euphoria; however, in therapeutic use for OUD, most patients report feeling "normal", comfortable, and functional rather than high, because dosing is individualized to suppress withdrawal and craving while avoiding intoxication, and tolerance further attenuates euphoria [^409bca42] [^27091179] [^0c158455].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical counseling points, because patients often worry about "feeling high". Clinicians should explain that methadone's long, stable action reduces peaks and troughs, which helps avoid the cycle of intoxication and withdrawal; patients should also be warned not to chase a "high" by taking extra doses, as this increases overdose risk due to methadone's complex pharmacokinetics and respiratory depression profile, reinforcing the importance of adherence to prescribed dosing and supervised care [^3d7bf960] [^973a4154] [^39613356].

---

Methadone is a **full opioid agonist** [^409bca42] that activates mu-opioid receptors, so patients can feel opioid-like effects such as mild euphoria, sedation, and warmth, especially at initiation or with dose increases [^b0e586d3]. However, with stable dosing and tolerance, these subjective effects typically fade, and patients report feeling "normal" rather than intoxicated [^27091179]. Clinicians should counsel that methadone can cause sedation and respiratory depression, and they should monitor for misuse or diversion [^973a4154] [^39613356].

---

## Pharmacological properties influencing subjective effects

Methadone's subjective effects reflect its **unique pharmacology**:

- **Full mu-opioid receptor agonism**: Produces analgesia, sedation, and euphoria, though less intense than short-acting opioids [^409bca42] [^b0e586d3].
- **Long half-life**: 8–59 hours, enabling once-daily dosing and stable plasma levels that reduce euphoric peaks and withdrawal troughs [^3d7bf960] [^b0e586d3].
- **NMDA receptor antagonism**: May reduce tolerance and hyperalgesia, altering the qualitative experience compared with other opioids [^430e847b] [^8a09f6b4].

---

## Patient-reported subjective experiences

Patient reports vary with **dose, tolerance, and context**:

- **Initial dosing**: Patients may feel mild euphoria, sedation, or warmth, especially if opioid-naive or after a dose increase [^b0e586d3].
- **Stable maintenance**: Most report feeling "normal", with suppressed withdrawal and craving and minimal intoxication [^27091179].
- **High doses**: Sedation and cognitive clouding can occur, particularly with rapid titration or interacting medications [^3d7bf960] [^39613356].

---

## Comparison with other opioids

Compared with short-acting opioids (e.g. heroin, oxycodone), methadone produces **less intense euphoria** and a more gradual onset, which reduces abuse liability when used as prescribed [^b0e586d3]. Compared with buprenorphine, a partial agonist, methadone's full agonism yields stronger subjective effects and greater physiological dependence, though both are effective for OUD treatment [^409bca42].

---

## Clinical implications and patient counseling

Clinicians should:

- **Educate patients**: Explain that methadone can cause sedation and respiratory depression, especially early in treatment or with dose changes [^6a6dc914].
- **Monitor for misuse**: Watch for signs of diversion, overdose, or dangerous combinations (e.g. benzodiazepines) [^39613356].
- **Individualize dosing**: Titrate slowly to balance therapeutic effects with safety and minimize euphoria [^e4b7101d].

---

## Summary of subjective effects

| **Subjective effect** | **Description** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| Euphoria | Mild, less intense than short-acting opioids | - Occurs mainly at initiation or dose increases <br/> - Diminishes with tolerance |
| Sedation | Common, dose-dependent | - Monitor for impairment <br/> - Adjust dose if excessive |
| Warmth/comfort | Reported by some patients | Reflects opioid receptor activation and withdrawal suppression |
| Feeling "normal" | Typical with stable dosing | Indicates effective maintenance and reduced craving |

---

Methadone can produce **opioid-like subjective effects**, but with stable dosing these effects typically wane, leaving patients feeling "normal" rather than intoxicated. Clinicians should counsel patients, monitor for adverse effects, and titrate dosing to balance efficacy and safety.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^b63e8310]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — methadone dosing and titration for opioid use disorder states that Methadone is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who are able to give informed consent and have no specific contraindication for this treatment. The recommended initial dose of methadone ranges from 10 to 30 mg, with reassessment as clinically indicated (typically in 2 to 4 hours). Use a lower-than-usual initial dose (2.5 to 10 mg) in individuals with no or low opioid tolerance. Following initial withdrawal stabilization, the usual daily dose of methadone ranges from 60 to 120 mg. Methadone titration should be individualized based on careful assessment of the patient's response and generally should not be increased every day, and typically, methadone can be increased by no more than 10 mg approximately every 5 days based on the patient's symptoms of opioid withdrawal or sedation.

### MMTP patients with chronic pain switching to pain management clinics. A problem or an acceptable practice? [^f5e992e1]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Among the many patients served by methadone maintenance treatment programs (MMTPs) is a small population with severe, refractory pain that may be effectively managed using long-term opioid therapy. Pain specialists have begun to treat these patients, and in some cases, methadone has been selected as the opioid analgesic administered for pain management. The use of methadone for pain in patients treated by MMTPs may lead to complex management issues. We present four patients who illustrate different outcomes associated with one challenging scenario, specifically the expressed desire on the part of the patient to withdraw from the MMTP because the opioid has become available for pain. Research is needed to evaluate the phenomenology of pain and addiction in this population and the outcomes associated with varied therapeutic strategies.

2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets for Pain

Do not abruptly discontinue methadone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking methadone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

### Mortality with methadone for noncancer pain… [^65c57f84]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study end point was out-of-hospital mortality, given that opioid-related deaths typically occur outside the hospital. Results. There are major concerns regarding methadone's relative safety. The risk for accidental overdose and lethal respiratory depression may be greater than that for other long-acting opioids. Because the duration of methadone's respiratory depressant effects is longer than that of its analgesic effects, 4, 5 inadvertent intoxication can occur as the dose is increased to provide greater pain relief. Patients currently receiving methadone had an increased risk for sudden unexpected death. For deaths meeting the definition of opioid overdose, patients receiving methadone had more than a 2-fold increased risk. Nearly three-fourths of the study deaths met accepted definitions for either opioid overdose death or sudden cardiac death.

For these deaths, the risk was most pronounced for the opioid overdose deaths, regardless of whether they also met the definition for sudden cardiac death. Indeed, for such deaths, the risk for patients receiving methadone was more than twice that of those receiving morphine SR. In contrast, for deaths meeting only the definition for sudden cardiac death, the small increase in risk for patients receiving methadone was not statistically significant. This finding persisted in analyses with mutually exclusive definitions for opioid overdose and sudden cardiac death and restricted to adjudicated deaths. Patients receiving methadone had an increased risk of death during follow-up for doses as low as 20 mg/d, which is consistent with the complex pharmacologic characteristics of methadone. Because the duration of respiratory depression is greater than that for analgesia, repeated use of low doses to control pain may lead to drug accumulation and inadvertent overdose.

6 The likelihood of drug accumulation may be increased by methadone's highly variable elimination half-life, ranging from 7 to 65 hours. 4, 5. In patients with noncancer pain, the risk of out-of-hospital death in patients receiving methadone was 46% greater than that for those receiving morphine SR. The absolute excess risk was 72 deaths per 10 000 person-years of study opioid use. An increased risk was present for methadone doses as low as 20 mg/d. These findings support recommendations that methadone should not be considered a drug of first choice for noncancer pain.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^e1d61b88]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHAT WE SHOULD DO

We should assess patients for risk of opioid withdrawal and offer and initiate evidence-based treatment, including methadone, in patients who select it. For patients without a formal OUD diagnosis who want to continue methadone after discharge, confirm the diagnosis using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. Start and titrate methadone (Table 1) when patients endorse early opioid withdrawal symptoms after confirming they have opioid tolerance and are not actively sedated. Because methadone is a full opioid agonist and can be initiated before withdrawal develops it is unnecessary to obtain a Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score when starting it. We should also offer adjunctive medications (e.g. clonidine, loperamide, and ondansetron) for withdrawal, though these do not address the underlying pathophysiology of opioid withdrawal and insufficiently mitigate symptoms. Clinicians should recognize that patients using fentanyl or other potent synthetic opioids may have high tolerance and need higher doses of opioid agonists, including methadone, to alleviate withdrawal. When patients decline methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal, their opioid withdrawal symptoms or pain are not controlled on methadone or buprenorphine alone, or they are undergoing low-dose buprenorphine initiation, hospitalists can offer alternative opioid agonists (e.g. oxycodone, hydromorphone) during hospitalization though we cannot prescribe these medications for withdrawal at discharge.

### Meaning and methadone: patient perceptions of methadone dose and a model to promote adherence to maintenance treatment [^27091179]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) effectively reduces illicit opioid use and its negative consequences when patients participate in and adhere to treatment. Patients' participation and adherence may relate to their perceptions about methadone doses and dose adjustments and the meanings that patients associate with treatment. This study assessed patient perceptions about methadone dosing and the meanings associated with methadone treatment to better support patient adherence to and success in MMT.

Methods

We conducted semistructured interviews with 19 patients in an urban MMT program. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed through an iterative process.

Results

Participants' expressed perceptions about methadone doses related to ideas of "comfort" and "function", suggesting a model for determining dose appropriateness and "ideal" methadone dose based on various factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to MMT. Intrinsic factors included those exerting downward pressure on "ideal" methadone dose such as lack of control in treatment, disdain for getting "high", concerns about methadone dependence, and desire to avoid adverse effects; those exerting upward pressure such as concern about withdrawal; and those exerting mixed pressures such as methadone formulations. Extrinsic factors included those exerting downward pressure such as shame about and stigma around MMT; those exerting upward pressure such as medical conditions and medication interactions; and those exerting mixed pressures such as family and peer relationships.

Conclusions

Participants held perceptions about methadone dosing that included considerations beyond typical medical parameters used by physicians and other MMT providers to determine appropriate methadone doses. The model that emerged from our data could help inform MMT providers to support greater patient comfort with methadone doses and dose changes, as well as adherence to and success in MMT.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^0c158455]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone maintenance dosing — opioid use disorder: A relatively low dose of methadone (e.g., < 30 mg per day) can lessen acute withdrawal but is often not effective in suppressing craving. Though a few patients respond to a maintenance dose of 30–60 mg per day, most patients fare better if their initial dose is gradually raised to a maintenance level of 60–120 mg per day. Multiple randomized trials found that patients have better outcomes when treated with standard or higher doses (80–100 mg per day) than lower doses, and doses above 120 mg per day are being used with some patients.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to methadone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to use a daily dose of 60–120 mg of methadone following initial withdrawal stabilization, recognizing that some patients may respond to lower doses and some may need higher doses. Individualize methadone titration based on a careful assessment of the patient's response, recognizing that generally it should not be increased every day. Consider increasing methadone by no more than 10 mg approximately every 5 days based on the patient's symptoms of opioid withdrawal or sedation.

### Managing severe pain and abuse potential: the potential impact of a new abuse-deterrent formulation oxycodone / naltrexone extended-release product [^a5a6d6a2]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Treating pain in active substance abusers

Prescribers increasingly face the conundrum of having to manage pain in past or even active substance abusers. For example, heroin addicts are not rare and their propensity to suffer from painful infections and osteomyelitis along with overdose and other conditions means that they frequently are managed by the health care system. Yet, the literature contains very little with respect to how to manage pain in heroin addicts. There are several key considerations for this population. First, heroin abusers may not be forthcoming about their addiction, particularly if they fear that honesty might result in legal repercussions or that they might be denied medical care and/or pain control. Second, even if heroin abusers are transparent about their drug use, street heroin is frequently cut with fentanyl or other adulterants and purity varies widely – it is practically impossible for heroin addicts to accurately report what drug(s) and how much they are taking. Third, few clinicians feel confident in treating them. Finally, heroin addicts (like opioid-experienced patients) typically have developed tolerance, such that relatively high and/or frequent doses of opioids are needed to control their acute pain.

The notion that opioid addicts do not feel pain is a myth. Opioid addicts in acute pain may be administered opioid analgesics at a dose needed to manage both pain and withdrawal symptoms, but it is important to discuss the pain management plan in advance to manage patient and provider expectations.

Also encountered in clinical practice are patients on medication-assisted therapies to treat opioid abuse, such as methadone maintenance programs or buprenorphine maintenance. They also pose a challenge for clinical pain management. Such patients often have high tolerance to opioids, but their opioids – which may be dosed only every 24 or 48 hours – likely provide little analgesic benefit. In such cases, the medication-assisted therapy should be continued with short-acting opioids prescribed to provide acute pain control.

The idea that a substance abuser with a legitimate pain syndrome should be denied pain control cannot be supported. However, long-term pain control in substance abusers becomes problematic.

### Methadone as first-line opioid for the management of cancer pain [^332238b4]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Methadone initiated at low doses in opioid-naive patients or those receiving low doses of opioids are effective and highly tolerated.

The tendency to develop tolerance seems to be negligible.

Methadone seems to be easier to use as first-line drug than for opioid switching, for which high experience is needed.

### Medication experiences in the treatment of opioid use disorders: insights from reddit [^0298b5a9]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The opioid crisis has taken an unprecedented global toll. Worldwide, in 2020, approximately 61 million people reported past‐year non‐medical opioid use (a twofold increase since 2010). Although it is estimated that opioids account for 35% of substance use disorders (SUD), they account for 77% of drug‐related deaths. In the United States (US), 79 770 overdose deaths involved opioids in 2022, with toxic unregulated drug supplies of synthetic opioids (such as fentanyl) and stimulants driving mortality.

To combat the opioid crisis, evidence‐based treatments with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including methadone, a full opioid agonist, and buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist that can be combined with naloxone (an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdoses) under the brand name Suboxone, have been recommended by the World Health Organization. However, despite the strong and ever‐growing evidence of the effectiveness of MOUD in saving lives, reducing overdose risk and improving quality of life among people with opioid use disorder (POUD), treatment access, uptake and retention have remained low in the United States. It is estimated that only 22% of POUD received MOUD in 2021, and the average duration of MOUD was under 6 months, which is insufficient to reduce mortality at the population level.

Achieving longer retention and supporting medically supervised treatment are paramount for making MOUD treatment safe and effective. Adopting a person‐ and patient‐centered approach is increasingly recognized as a path forward to better treatment outcomes. Understanding and integrating medication experiences into healthcare provision has the potential to address previously under‐appreciated challenges faced by patients, leading to better adherence and retention in treatment.

The field of medication experience is growing, with relevant frameworks describing both medications' physiological and psychological effects. As such, medications' bodily effects, the symbolic meanings attributed to medications and patients' previous experiences, expectations and concerns, current life circumstances, feelings and social pressures influence uptake, adherence and retention. A recent systematic review of qualitative studies investigating MOUD in the United States identified patients' lived experiences as one of the key themes influencing MOUD trajectories. These included logistical barriers and costs, secondary effects of the medication, intentional non‐adherence for diversion or sporadic use and lack of social support, including from healthcare providers because of frequent dissonance between providers' and patients' treatment goals. However, the authors acknowledged that one of the study's limitations was excluding studies using data from social media.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to methadone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to ensure that patients transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine are on low doses of methadone before making the transition. Recognize that patients on low doses of methadone (≤ 30–40 mg/day) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in transitioning medications.

### Discontinuing methadone and buprenorphine: a review and clinical challenges [^95bcc7ff]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This paper offers a review and recommendations for clinicians working with patients interested in discontinuing opioid agonist treatment. As buprenorphine/naloxone has gained widespread acceptance for opioid addiction, many treatment providers and patients have a range of hopes and expectations about its optimal use. A surprising number assume buprenorphine/naloxone is primarily useful as a medication to transition off illicit opioid use, and success is partially defined by discontinuing the medication. Despite accumulating evidence that a majority of patients will need to remain on medication to preserve their gains, clinicians often have to address a patient's fervent desire to taper. Using the concept of "recovery capital", our review addresses (1) the appropriate duration of opioid agonist treatment, (2) risks associated with discontinuing, (3) a checklist that guides the patient through self-assessment of the wisdom of discontinuing opioid agonist treatment, and (4) shared decision making about how to proceed.

5.8 Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see DEPENDENCE (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4); WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.15)].

### Methadone: maximizing safety and efficacy for pain control in patients with cancer [^430e847b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Methadone is a valuable opioid in the management of patients who have cancer with pain. Methadone is a mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid agonist, and an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. These mechanisms of action make methadone an attractive option for complex pain syndromes. It is critically important that providers consider a patient's risk status before beginning methadone. Careful consideration must be given to dosing methadone in both opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients, with vigilant monitoring for therapeutic effectiveness and potential toxicity until the patient achieves steady state.

Abuse Potential

Inform patients that Methadone Hydrochloride contains methadone, a Schedule II controlled substance that is subject to abuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Instruct patients not to share Methadone Hydrochloride with others and to take steps to protect Methadone Hydrochloride from theft or misuse.

Important Administration Instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2)]

Instruct patients how to properly take Methadone Hydrochloride, including the following:

Methadone Hydrochloride is for oral administration only. The preparation must not be injected.
Inform patients that Methadone Hydrochloride should be taken only as directed to reduce the risk of life- threatening adverse reactions (e.g., respiratory depression), and the dose should not be adjusted without consulting a physician or other healthcare professional.
Reassure patients initiating treatment with Methadone Hydrochloride for opioid dependence that the dose of methadone will "hold" for longer periods of time as treatment progresses.
Apprise patients seeking to discontinue treatment with methadone for opioid dependence of the high risk of relapse to illicit drug use associated with discontinuation of Methadone Hydrochloride maintenance treatment.
Advise patients not to discontinue Methadone Hydrochloride without first discussing the need for a tapering regimen with the prescriber.

Serotonin Syndrome

Inform patients that Methadone Hydrochloride could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Drug Interactions (7)].

Methadone — initial dosing and titration specify that the recommended initial dose ranges from 10 to 30 mg, with reassessment as clinically indicated (typically in 2 to 4 hours), and a lower-than-usual initial dose (2.5 to 10 mg) is advised in individuals with no or low opioid tolerance. Following initial withdrawal stabilization, the usual daily dose ranges from 60 to 120 mg, with individualized titration that generally should not be increased every day, and typical increases are no more than 10 mg approximately every 5 days based on symptoms of opioid withdrawal or sedation. The administration of methadone should be monitored because unsupervised administration can lead to misuse and diversion, and OTP regulations require monitored medication administration until the patient's clinical response and behavior demonstrates that prescribing non-monitored doses is appropriate.

### Slow-release oral morphine versus methadone: a crossover comparison of patient outcomes and acceptability as maintenance pharmacotherapies for opioid dependence [^e931c7f5]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate slow-release oral morphine (SROM) as an alternative maintenance pharmacotherapy to methadone for treatment of opioid dependence.

Design

Open-label crossover study.

Setting

Out-patient methadone maintenance programme.

Participants

Eighteen methadone maintenance patients. Intervention Participants were transferred from methadone to SROM (once-daily Kapanol trade mark) for approximately 6 weeks before resuming methadone maintenance.

Measurements

Patient outcomes were assessed (1) during the transition between medications (dose requirements, withdrawal severity) and (2) after at least 4 weeks on a stable dose of each drug (treatment preference, patient ratings of treatment efficacy and acceptability, drug use, health, depression and sleep).

Findings

Transfer from methadone to SROM was associated with relatively mild withdrawal for the first 5 days; the final mean SROM: methadone dose ratio was 4.6: 1. Compared to methadone, SROM was associated with improved social functioning, weight loss, fewer and less troublesome side-effects, greater drug liking, reduced heroin craving, an enhanced sense of feeling 'normal' and similar outcomes for unsanctioned drug use, depression and health. The majority of subjects preferred SROM (78%) over methadone (22%).

Conclusions

These findings provide justification for further evaluation of SROM as a maintenance pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence.

### Methadone hydrochloride (methadone) [^428ed4de]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Use with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, or buprenorphine) should not be administered to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist, such as Methadone Hydrochloride Injection. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of Methadone Hydrochloride Injection and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Anxiety

Methadone, used by tolerant patients at a constant maintenance dosage, is not a tranquilizer. Patients who are maintained on this drug will react to life problems and stresses as do other individuals. Anxiety in a patient on methadone should not be confused with narcotic abstinence and should not prompt treatment by increasing the dosage of methadone. The action of methadone in maintenance treatment is limited to the control of symptoms of opioid dependence or pain. Methadone is ineffective for relief of general anxiety.

Acute Pain

Maintenance patients on a stable dose of methadone who experience physical trauma, postoperative pain or other causes of acute pain cannot be expected to derive analgesia from their stable dose of methadone regimens. Such patients should be given analgesics, including opioids, that would be indicated in other patients experiencing similar nociceptive stimulation. Due to the opioid tolerance induced by methadone, when opioids are required for management of acute pain in methadone patients, somewhat higher and/or more frequent doses will often be required than would be the case for other, non-tolerant patients.

Risk of Relapse in Patients on Methadone Maintenance Treatment of Opioid Addiction

Abrupt opioid discontinuation can lead to development of opioid withdrawal symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS). Presentation of these symptoms has been associated with an increased risk of susceptible patients to relapse to illicit drug use and should be considered when assessing the risks and benefit of methadone use.

### Opioid agonist treatment for patients with dependence on prescription opioids [^e4b73ac9]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are different opioid agonist treatments (eg, methadone vs buprenorphine) associated with differences in efficacy for treating prescription opioid dependence, and is long-term maintenance of opioid agonist treatment associated with differences in efficacy compared with opioid taper or psychological treatments alone?

Bottom Line

For patients who are dependent on prescription opioids, long-term maintenance of opioid agonists is associated with less prescription opioid use and better adherence to medication and psychological therapies for opioid dependence compared with opioid taper or psychological treatments alone. Methadone maintenance was not associated with differences in therapeutic efficacy compared with buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Evidence quality was low to moderate.

### The drug-seeking patient in the emergency room [^ed001d52]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Drug-seeking patients include recreational drug abusers, addicts whose dependence occurred through abuse or the injudicious prescription of narcotics, and pseudoaddicts who have chronic pain that has not been appropriately managed. Opioids produce euphoria in some patients, providing the motivation for abuse, which can be detrimental even with occasional use. Even in the absence of overt euphoria, opioids are highly self-reinforcing and can be problematic in a large number of patients, requiring that acute care physicians exercise caution in whom they are administered. Habitual patient files, narcotic contracts, pain management letters, and patient tracking and management programs can be used for the benefit of both drug seeking-patients and chronic pain patients. For many patients, drug-seekers and chronic pain patients alike, withholding opioids may be an important part of their long-term management. For others, long-acting opioids such as long-acting morphine or methadone are a reasonable option.

Concluding Comment Regarding the Application of the Case Conference to Practice

As a final thought, through the process (irrespective of the transition method), it should be remembered that the patient is going to go through a challenging time as they transition from methadone to buprenorphine, which can allow other suppressed emotions to come to the surface and be a potential time for relapse, and as such the warning signs and dangers of using illicit substances should be clearly discussed and the provision of take home naloxone should be made to further encourage the patient's safety.

Treatment of Pain

Optimal methadone initiation and dose titration strategies for the treatment of pain have not been determined. Published equianalgesic conversion ratios between methadone and other opioids are imprecise, providing at best, only population averages that cannot be applied consistently to all patients. It should be noted that many commonly cited equianalgesia tables only present relative analgesic potencies of single opioid doses in non-tolerant patients, thus greatly underestimating methadone's analgesic potency, and its potential for adverse effects in repeated-dose settings. Regardless of the dose determination strategy employed, methadone is most safely initiated and titrated using small initial doses and gradual dose adjustments.

As with all opioid drugs, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. The following dosing recommendations should only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient. Prescribers should always follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring.

In the selection of an initial dose of Methadone Hydrochloride Injection, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient had been taking previously, if any;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate an equianalgesic starting methadone dose, in particular, whether it is intended for use in acute or chronic methadone dosing;
The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent medications, particularly other CNS and respiratory depressants;
The type, severity and expected duration of the patient's pain;
The acceptable balance between pain control and adverse side effects.

Methadone Hydrochloride Injection may be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or intramuscularly. The absorption of subcutaneous and intramuscular methadone has not been well characterized and appears to be unpredictable. Local tissue reactions may occur.

Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Initiation of Therapy in Opioid Non-Tolerant Patients

When parenteral methadone is used as the first analgesic in patients who are not already being treated with, and tolerant to, opioids, the usual intravenous methadone starting dose is 2.5 mg to 10 mg every 8 to 12 hours, slowly titrated to effect. More frequent administration may be required during methadone initiation in order to maintain adequate analgesia, and extreme caution is necessary to avoid overdosage, taking into account methadone's long elimination half life.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^6a6dc914]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methadone patient counseling — Patients should use other CNS depressants (especially benzodiazepines) with caution and only as directed by a healthcare provider, and should only use methadone in combination with other opioids as prescribed by a healthcare provider. The use of illicit drugs and/or alcohol with methadone may be fatal. Pain relief builds gradually and usually takes 5–7 days to see the full effects of a particular dose. Patients should tell all medical providers that they are taking methadone; adding medications or changing dosing of other medications can affect methadone and should be coordinated with the methadone prescriber. Patients should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination (such as driving or using machinery) until the effects of methadone are realized, typically a week or longer, and should rise slowly from a sitting/supine position, as methadone may cause dizziness. Methadone, like other opioids, can cause significant constipation, and patients should take a prescribed laxative as directed. Patients should report any of the following symptoms immediately and/or seek urgent/emergent care: dizziness or lightheadedness, irregular heartbeat (palpitations), falls or near falls, chest pain/pressure, and shortness of breath. Patients should avoid abrupt discontinuation of methadone without first consulting a healthcare provider.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^2f9e3cb2]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines for Managing Substance Withdrawal in Jails — glossary definitions clarify roles, therapies, and opioid pharmacology: Licensed prescriber refers to a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, physician, or other health care provider licensed to prescribe medications. Methadone treatment provider is an authorized provider of methadone, and opioid treatment programs are certified by SAMHSA to treat patients with opioid use disorder using methadone. Micro-dosing is administration of buprenorphine–naloxone in a small initial dose with incremental increases to both dose and frequency over time. Misuse of prescription drugs means taking a medication in a manner or dose other than prescribed; taking someone else's prescription, even if for a legitimate medical complaint such as pain; or taking a medication to feel euphoria. Monitoring is regular and active surveillance to detect changes in physical or mental status that may indicate health problems, which facilitates appropriate interventions and ensures patient safety. Narcotic treatment program denotes that the Controlled Substances Act and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration regulations refer to opioid treatment programs as narcotic treatment programs, which are registered with the DEA. Older adult means individuals who are 55 years and older. Opioid means any psychoactive chemical resembling morphine in pharmacological effects, including opiates and synthetic/semisynthetic agents. Opioid agonist is a medication that occupies and activates opioid receptors in the body. Opioid antagonist is a medication that occupies opioid receptors in the body but does not activate the receptors, effectively blocking the receptor, preventing the brain from responding to other opioids, and the result is that further use of opioids does not produce analgesia, euphoria, or intoxication. Opioid withdrawal syndrome refers to the wide range of symptoms occurring when individuals who regularly take opioids, either illicit or prescribed, stop or reduce their use. Patient navigator is a person whose role is to help individuals who are transitioning to new circumstances understand system processes and how to effectively navigate systems to obtain services needed and access resources; for purposes of this document, this transition is from jail to the community.

### Methadone treatment for pain States [^f81423c9]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Methadone is a synthetic opioid with potent analgesic effects. Although it is associated commonly with the treatment of opioid addiction, it may be prescribed by licensed family physicians for analgesia. Methadone's unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics make it a valuable option in the management of cancer pain and other chronic pain, including neuropathic pain states. It may be an appropriate replacement for opioids when side effects have limited further dosage escalation. Metabolism of and response to methadone varies with each patient. Transition to methadone and dosage titration should be completed slowly and with frequent monitoring. Conversion should be based on the current daily oral morphine equivalent dosage. After starting methadone therapy or increasing the dosage, systemic toxicity may not become apparent for several days. Some medications alter the absorption or metabolism of methadone, and their concurrent use may require dosing adjustments. Methadone is less expensive than other sustained-release opioid formulations.

### Acute pain management for patients receiving maintenance methadone or buprenorphine therapy [^19b4a99b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

More patients with opioid addiction are receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone and buprenorphine. As a result, physicians will more frequently encounter patients receiving OAT who develop acutely painful conditions, requiring effective treatment strategies. Undertreatment of acute pain is suboptimal medical treatment, and patients receiving long-term OAT are at particular risk. This paper acknowledges the complex interplay among addictive disease, OAT, and acute pain management and describes 4 common misconceptions resulting in suboptimal treatment of acute pain. Clinical recommendations for providing analgesia for patients with acute pain who are receiving OAT are presented. Although challenging, acute pain in patients receiving this type of therapy can effectively be managed.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^eb6ce39b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast, standard protocols for methadone and buprenorphine initiation and dose titration can be easily followed by most hospitalists. If a patient reports ongoing withdrawal symptoms, pain, or cravings with methadone or buprenorphine dose titration, the hospitalist can augment therapy with additional doses of methadone or buprenorphine or with short-acting opioids. We believe this approach is better supported by evidence. It is also more likely to be implemented, since it makes fewer demands on nursing staff compared to oxycodone or hydromorphone monotherapy, where patients are more likely to face peaks and troughs in opioid withdrawal relief. Thus, we believe this approach would be more effective for opioid withdrawal management and could thereby decrease the risk of unprescribed substance use in the hospital, contentious interactions between hospital staff and patients, and self-directed discharges.

Some patients may decline methadone and buprenorphine even for opioid withdrawal. In these circumstances, hospitalists should explore this reluctance and debunk misconceptions. For example, hospitalists should ensure that patients understand that methadone does not precipitate withdrawal and that it does not block the effects of other full-agonist opioids at doses used for opioid withdrawal; methadone can only help relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms and will not make these symptoms worse. For some high-risk patients who continue to decline methadone and buprenorphine for withdrawal, clinicians might need to reach for alternative long-acting opioids, as the Point authors suggest. This will depend on the clinical circumstances. Patients certainly have autonomy to decline treatments or to choose between equally effective medications. However, there are situations where this might not be appropriate — for OUD, as with other conditions, there are clinical circumstances where we would not order less effective treatments based solely on patient preference (e.g. we would not let patient preference alone determine which antibiotics to use for sepsis). With all that said, in our experience, it is exceedingly rare for patients to continue to decline both methadone and buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal once we clarify the distinction between using these medications for opioid withdrawal management in the hospital and using them as long-term maintenance treatment after discharge.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^41449012]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHY HOSPITALISTS SHOULD OFFER METHADONE FOR OPIOID WITHDRAWAL

More than 50 years of data demonstrate that methadone is safe and effective when titrated appropriately. Hospitalists can legally provide methadone for opioid withdrawal per 1306.07 Code of Federal Regulations. This code states that hospitalized patients can be "administered or dispensed opioids for maintenance or detoxification as an adjunct to a condition other than addiction."In other words, hospitalists can start, continue, and titrate methadone and other opioids for opioid withdrawal when patients are hospitalized for a primary condition other than a substance use disorder (e.g. cellulitis, heart failure, high-risk pregnancy).

Methadone is a life-saving medication that reduces overdose and all-cause mortality. It is associated with decreased acute care utilization and, by treating opioid withdrawal, a lower risk of self-discharges. Methadone should be offered for withdrawal management regardless of a patient's desire or ability to continue it after hospitalization. In addition to treating and preventing withdrawal, prescribing methadone during hospitalization offers an opportunity to initiate OUD treatment. Patients started on methadone for OUD are more than twice as likely to present to an OTP after discharge. Even when patients are ambivalent about continuing methadone after discharge, their readiness to engage in outpatient treatment likely increases as they achieve relief of withdrawal. However, only 15% of people with OUD receive OUD treatment during admission.

Without treatment, patients may use unprescribed opioids to manage withdrawal symptoms and self-discharge before completing medical treatment, increasing mortality and risk for rehospitalization. In one study, more than 40% of individuals who used drugs reported unprescribed substance use during hospitalization. Opioid agonists, like methadone, treat opioid withdrawal and may decrease in-hospital substance use while improving trust.

Methadone, in addition to being OUD treatment, offers important advantages to other full-agonist opioids in withdrawal treatment. This includes methadone's analgesic and long-acting properties, which we can leverage by splitting dosing to treat both acute pain and withdrawal. In addition, compared with a partial opioid agonist like buprenorphine, situations when patients may prefer methadone over buprenorphine include: (1) previous buprenorphine-induced precipitated withdrawal; (2) regular fentanyl use, which may increase the risk of precipitated withdrawal with buprenorphine initiation; (3) methadone's full opioid agonism; and (4) acute pain.

Methadone dosing and conversion in opioid-tolerant patients — various methadone dosing strategies have been employed, and older, prospective studies found no evidence to support the superiority of one dosing strategy over another, highlighting the need to carefully individualize the dosing regimen of methadone. For opioid tolerant patients, a number of different equianalgesic dose ratio tables can be used to determine the dose of methadone, and no equianalgesic dose ratio table is considered superior and all have similar limitations. When converting to methadone, lower MEDDs have lower conversion ratios than higher MEDDs, and higher MEDDs may convert to smaller methadone doses than one might expect; for example, 60 mg MEDD would be ~15 mg of methadone/day (a ratio of ~4:1) whereas 180 mg MEDD would be ~22.5 mg/day (a ratio of ~8:1). Methadone dose conversion is not a linear process, and some subject matter experts feel the calculated methadone dose should be further decreased for incomplete cross-tolerance, especially for patients on higher MEDDs. If such resources are not readily available, other long-acting opioids should be considered (e.g., morphine sustained action [SA], or oxycodone SA).

2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy for Pain

Individually titrate methadone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving methadone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.16)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of methadone hydrochloride tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the methadone hydrochloride tablets dosage.

Because of individual variability in the pharmacokinetic profile (i.e., terminal half-life (T1/2) from 8 to 59 hours in different studies [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)], titrate methadone hydrochloride tablets slowly, with dose increases no more frequent than every 3 to 5 days. However, because of this high variability, some patients may require substantially longer periods between dose increases (up to 12 days). Monitor patients closely for the development of potentially life-threatening adverse reactions (e.g. CNS and respiratory depression).

If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5)]. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

### The effect of methadone on emotional reactivity [^c0e6062d]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Opioids have been implicated in emotion regulation. Opioid users report decreased negative emotional response, but there has been no formal study on the effect of opioid administration on emotional reactivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of methadone on emotional reactivity in methadone-maintained patients.

Design

Velten's mood induction procedures were used to induce elative and depressive emotional reactions in the subjects. Each group was administered both induction procedures at 0 hour and 3 hours (corresponding with trough and peak plasma methadone concentrations in methadone subjects).

Setting

A drug treatment clinic with an out-patient methadone maintenance treatment programme.

Participants

Twenty-one subjects currently on methadone maintenance treatment and 21 controls with no history of opioid dependence.

Measurements

Emotional reactivity was measured using mood visual analogue scales.

Findings

At 0 hour, methadone and control subjects showed similar elation (methadone 13.2 ± 3.1 mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], control 14.4 ± 3.7) and depression reactivity (methadone 23.6 ± 5.0, control 25.1 ± 5.0). However, at 3 hours repeated measures showed that methadone subjects had significantly decreased depression reactivity (methadone 18.5 ± 4.6, control 36.7 ± 5.7; P = 0.021) and elation reactivity (methadone 4.4 ± 1.9, control 19.0 ± 2.4) compared to controls.

Conclusions

Opioid addicts on methadone maintenance appear to be less reactive to mood induction at times of peak plasma methadone concentration than non-addict controls; this suggests that methadone blunts both elative and depressive emotional reactivity.

### The experience of chronic severe pain in patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment [^d3c5fcaa]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies indicate that severe chronic pain is common among patients in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), but no qualitative studies have examined such patients' experiences of pain and pain treatment. This study used qualitative methods to explore the experiences of MMT patients with chronic pain. Twelve patients screening positive for chronic severe pain on the Brief Pain Inventory were interviewed for the study. Results suggest that chronic severe pain has major consequences in the lives of methadone maintenance patients and may be linked to illegal drug use, social isolation, and role failure. A variety of barriers limited access to effective treatment. A common complaint with care was providers' lack of concern or inability to "listen". Patients who were satisfied with treatment focuses on the psychosocial dimensions of care. These preliminary results suggest that treatment approaches should emphasize emotional support, negotiation of explanatory models, and an emphasis on the psychosocial sequelae of pain. However, more research is needed to guide the development of effective treatment strategies.

### Methadone as first-line opioid for the management of cancer pain [^2b8f77c9]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, methadone has been reported to be highly effective for opioid switchingin patients poorly responsive to a previous opioid. The pharmacokinetic profile of methadone is complex and in some circumstances, even low doses can result in an unpredictable response or opioid overdose, particularly when switching from an opioid given at high doses.

The use of oral low-dose methadone added to existing opioid therapy to treat cancer pain is a promising option in preliminary reports where its use provided an improvement in pain and was well tolerated. The opioid escalation index significantly decreased after adding methadone in low doses and this trend was also maintained for weeks, without inducing significant opioid-related adverse effects. Indeed, the pharmacological properties of methadone suggest that its use would be more convenient when started at low doses and then escalated slowly. Starting with a small dose and increasing gradually should be expected to be safer, also allowing for methadone to be initiated in outpatients. Some case series have shown that methadone could be used as the first-line opioid therapy. However, all these studies were retrospective and interpretation may be problematic. Recently, a short-term titration study has shown that first-line, low-dose methadone resulted in a rapid decrease in pain intensity, with minimal need for titration and no evidence of accumulation or sedation. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of methadone when used as first-line therapy in patients not receiving opioids or receiving low doses of opioids. The secondary outcome was to assess the need for dose escalation in a relatively long-term period of 2 months.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine or naltrexone notes that patients transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should ideally be on low doses of methadone before making the transition, and patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in transitioning medications. For naltrexone, patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone, with the only exception applying when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Methadone — psychosocial care, relapse management, and transitions state that patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on individual needs, in conjunction with methadone, and that a patient's decision to decline or the absence of psychosocial treatment should not preclude methadone treatment. For patients who previously received methadone, it should be reinstituted immediately if relapse occurs or if an assessment determines that the risk of relapse is high (unless contraindicated), with re‑initiation following the recommendations on initial dose and titration. Transitioning from methadone to another medication may be appropriate if dangerous or intolerable side effects occur or if treatment goals are not met, and patients transitioning to buprenorphine should ideally be on low doses of methadone, with low-dose patients (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerating transition with minimal discomfort while higher-dose patients may experience significant discomfort. Patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before receiving naltrexone. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with methadone.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^47970a84]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Part 5: Buprenorphine

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Induction of buprenorphine should start with a dose of 2–4 mg. Dosages may be increased in increments of 2–4 mg.

Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. Emerging research suggests, however, that many patients need "not" be observed and that home buprenorphine induction may be considered. Home-based induction is recommended only if the patient or prescribing physician is experienced with the use of buprenorphine. This is based on the consensus opinion of the Guideline Committee.

Once it has been established that the initial dose is well tolerated, the buprenorphine dose can be increased fairly rapidly to a dose that provides stable effects for 24 hours and is clinically effective. Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8 mg per day. The US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses. In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

### Efficacy and safety of combining low-dose methadone with ongoing opioid treatment for uncontrolled cancer pain: an open-label single-arm study [^35d12159]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Study treatments

In patients receiving ongoing opioids with oral morphine equivalents less than 120 mg/day, oral methadone was started at a dose of 5 mg/day. In patients with ongoing opioids receiving oral morphine equivalents ≥ 120 mg/day, oral methadone was started at a dose of 10 mg/day. Oral methadone has been introduced as an add-on medication to ongoing opioid therapy. In patients who experienced uncomfortable somnolence before combination therapy, the ongoing opioid therapy dose was reduced by 20 mg of oral morphine equivalents per 5 mg of methadone (methadone was started as a partial opioid switch). The use of low-dose methadone and ongoing opioid therapy is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.
Scheduled intervention: combined use of low-dose methadone with ongoing opioid treatment. In patients receiving ongoing opioids with oral morphine equivalents < 120 mg/day, oral methadone was started at a dose of 5 mg/day. In patients with ongoing opioids receiving oral morphine equivalents ≥ 120 mg/day, oral methadone was started at a dose of 10 mg/day. In patients who experienced uncomfortable somnolence before combination therapy, the ongoing opioid therapy dose was reduced to 20 mg oral morphine equivalents per 5 mg methadone. After day 7, the physician increased the dose of methadone. The patients who reported satisfactory analgesia continued to receive the same dose of methadone. Ongoing opioid and methadone use can be decreased during the study period. Abbreviation: OME, oral morphine equivalent.

On day 8, the patients who reported satisfactory analgesia continued to receive the same dose of methadone. After day 7, the physicians increased the methadone dose. Ongoing opioid or methadone use was reduced in patients with uncomfortable somnolence during the study period. Adjuvant drugs could also be added by the physicians. The study period was 15 days.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^6ce0b9d2]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone and pain management — acute and chronic pain strategies include that temporarily increasing the methadone dose or dosing frequency may be effective, and splitting the daily methadone dose across 3–4 doses per day can maximize analgesia; methadone's withdrawal/craving suppression typically lasts 24–36 hours while its analgesic effects typically last 6–8 hours, so rapid dose increases should be avoided. If pain remains refractory and additional opioid‑based analgesia is required, the addition of a short acting full‑agonist opioid can be considered, and the needed dose is anticipated to be higher than typical doses for opioid‑naïve individuals.

### Pain management strategies for patients on methadone maintenance therapy: a systematic review of the literature [^76138431]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Context

Prescription opioid and heroin abuse has increased substantially in recent years. Enrolment on opioid agonist therapy programmes is consequently increasing as well. As a result of these trends, more patients who present with acute pain secondary to a malignancy are also on chronic methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) for substance abuse. This combination of diagnoses presents a pain management challenge for palliative care providers.

Objectives

This paper aims to gather and review the available medical literature pertaining to the use of opioid analgesia in methadone-maintained patients.

Methods

The authors searched PubMED, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Clinical Key, the Cochrane Library and CINAHL from their inception to May 2015 for relevant articles. All articles that discuss opioid therapy in adult patients on methadone maintenance for opioid addiction with cancer or advanced illness were included. Data were extracted and study quality was rated independently by the authors.

Results

Our searches resulted in 680 hits. Of those, only 7 met inclusion criteria for the study. Most of the studies favoured the use of methadone either in scheduled divided doses every 4-8hours or by continuous intravenous infusion. The overall strength of the evidence was poor, consisting mainly of case series, case reports and 1 single-centre retrospective cohort study lacking a comparison group.

Conclusions

Treating MMT-maintained patients with methadone for analgesia may be preferable to using other opioid analgesics. However, there are many systems barriers that may make this approach challenging and the evidence favouring methadone over other opioid analgesics is weak.

### Managing acute pain in patients taking medication for opioid use disorder: a rapid review [^b01900f9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Managing acute pain in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) on medication (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) can be complicated by patients' higher baseline pain sensitivity and need for higher opioid doses to achieve pain relief. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of acute pain management strategies for patients taking OUD medications and whether strategies vary by OUD medication type or cause of acute pain.

Methods

We systematically searched multiple bibliographic sources until April 2020. One reviewer used prespecified criteria to assess articles for inclusion, extract data, rate study quality, and grade our confidence in the body of evidence, all with second reviewer checking.

Results

We identified 12 observational studies-3 with control groups and 9 without. Two of the studies with control groups suggest that continuing buprenorphine and methadone in OUD patients after surgery may reduce the need for additional opioids and that ineffective pain management in patients taking methadone can result in disengagement in care. A third controlled study found that patients taking OUD medications may need higher doses of additional opioids for pain control, but provided insufficient detail to apply results to clinic practice. The only case study examining naltrexone reported that postoperative pain was managed using tramadol. We have low confidence in these findings as no studies directly addressed our question by comparing pain management strategies and few provided adequate descriptions of the dosage, timing, or rationale for clinical decisions.

Discussion

We lack rigorous evidence on acute pain management in patients taking medication for OUD; however, evidence supports the practice of continuing methadone or buprenorphine for most patients during acute pain episodes. Well-described, prospective studies of adjuvant pain management strategies when OUD medications are continued would add to the existing literature base. Studies on nonopioid treatments are also needed for patients taking naltrexone.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^afa799e3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — psychosocial care and relapse management with methadone specifies that Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed, and patients should be offered evidence-based psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs, in conjunction with methadone in the treatment of opioid use disorder, and that a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay treatment with methadone, with appropriate medication management; motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. For patients who previously received methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder, methadone should be reinstituted immediately if relapse occurs or if an assessment determines that the risk of relapse is high (unless contraindicated), and strategies directed at relapse prevention are an important part of addiction treatment and should be included in any plan of care for a patient receiving opioid use disorder treatment or ongoing monitoring of the status of their disorder. Transitioning from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences dangerous or intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

### Acute suicidal ideations responsive to hydromorphone [^3e76763a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

The patient's dose of opioids was reduced several months previously because of symptoms associated with feeling 'loopy' and poor memory. Because there was no clear aetiology for these symptoms, it was hypothesised absorption and assimilation concerns were contributing to the changes in mentation. Might her digestive issues relate to significant changes in methadone levels as well as other medication levels? Patient's methadone dose was lowered from 60 to 40 mg/day and then to 30 mg/day. Her fentanyl patch had been reduced from 50 to 25 μg/hour. Following these dose reductions, her mental symptoms did improve. The cognitive complaints may have related to the use and dose of opioids, but the differential is significant and includes depression, malnutrition, poor sleep and even low blood sugar. Indeed, after this first episode of suicidal ideations the patient was hospitalised to rule out a stroke. Her symptoms were eventually attributed to hypoglycaemia.

Prescription

Patient agreed to a trial of a rapid increase in her dose of opioids. The patient knew the prescription for oral hydromorphone was intended to help not only with her pain but to improve her affect and hopefully limit her wanting to die. In addition to the neurophysiological principles discussed below, this patient had already experienced significant benefit from opioids for both her pain management and mood regulation.

The patient received, in addition to her other prescribed medications, a small prescription for hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg by mouth three times a day as a trial. Within 24 hours, she was dramatically better and suicidal ideations were gone. She reported feeling even better than before she started to have the suicidal ideations. The hydromorphone was soon thereafter tapered, and patient continued to stabilise and improve on her previous regimen.

Methadone — titration schedule: Because methadone has a long half‑life, dose increases should be conservative during the first 1–3 weeks, with dosing based on patient response; methadone should generally not be increased every day but rather increased no more than 10 mg approximately every 5 days, for example 10 mg increases at intervals of 5 days or 5 mg increases at intervals of 2–3 days as symptoms persist and considering the presence of sedation.

Transitioning between treatment medications — indications and planning include side effects, unmet goals, or patient preference, with careful monitoring during transfers. Transition "may be appropriate in the following cases: 1. patient experiences intolerable medication side effects; 2. patient has not been successful in attaining or maintaining their treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy 3. patient wants to change and is a candidate for the alternative treatment." "Medication transitions should be planned, considered, and monitored." "Particular care should be taken in reducing methadone dosing before transfer to avoid precipitating a relapse," and "If the patient becomes unstable and appears at risk for relapse during the transfer of medications, restarting methadone may be the best option."

### Evaluation of a novel patient-centered methadone restart protocol [^950cf9f4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Current consensus best practice documents, implemented by most OTPs, recommend substantial methadone dose reductions to avoid harm. However, when restarting at half or less of the previous methadone dose, some patients may lose hope of regaining access to previously therapeutic doses, leading them to disengage in care and initiating a downward spiral. The efforts required to obtain illicit opioids to alleviate severe withdrawal symptoms may result in additional missed dosing days, further dose reductions, and treatment discontinuation. Retention in treatment is life-preserving, so this potential iatrogenic destabilization should be avoided when possible. OTP clinicians and directors can weigh methadone safety against the risks of underdosing, patient experience, and return to illicit opioid use. While our novel restart protocol was not associated with clear harms or improvements in retention, additional multisite studies that are powered to evaluate rare events are needed to help OTPs weigh the risks and benefits of implementing higher restart doses.

### Evaluation of a novel patient-centered methadone restart protocol [^c2f330a4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are individualized higher methadone restart doses after a gap in daily dosing associated with safety and effectiveness?

Findings

In this cohort study, a new clinical protocol that individualized methadone restart doses by accounting for maintenance of opioid tolerance after a gap in methadone treatment was associated with significantly higher restart doses without any changes in opioid-related harms or treatment retention.

Meaning

These results suggest that more individualized methadone restart dosing that accounts for maintenance of opioid tolerance may promote higher restart doses that are closer to therapeutic levels without increased patient harm.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^24eeacc4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Criteria 10 and 11 are not considered to be met for those persons taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision. Severity is specified as mild (2–3 criteria), moderate (4–5 criteria), or severe (≥ 6 criteria).

FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder include buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid), methadone (a full agonist opioid), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Experts from OWG stated that partial agonist opioid, full agonist opioid, and opioid antagonist treatment should not be framed as equal options for opioid use disorder, noting that partial and full agonist opioid treatments have stronger evidence for better outcomes, do not require abstinence, have less challenges with initiation, and are much more widely used than opioid antagonist treatment. Clinical evidence reviews found evidence on the effectiveness of interventions (e.g. medications and behavioral treatments) for opioid use disorder related to prescription opioids to be limited. However, moderate-quality evidence indicated buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid) and methadone (a full agonist opioid) to be effective in preventing return to drug use among patients with opioid use disorder involving heroin, although the presence of pain among patients in these studies is generally not described. In addition, a small number of studies have evaluated buprenorphine for patients with prescription opioid dependence (using DSM-IV criteria) and found it to be effective in preventing return to drug use. One study found that among persons with opioid use disorder, previous prescription opioid use predicts stabilization on buprenorphine. Another trial that performed buprenorphine initiation and then randomized patients to buprenorphine taper versus maintenance was terminated early without reporting of planned outcomes because all patients randomized to the taper arm switched to maintenance or experienced a return to drug use; five of six patients in the maintenance arm completed the trial. In another trial identified by the clinical evidence reviews, no difference was found between buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone in likelihood of retention in the study and in pain, function, or self-reported side effects. Buprenorphine and methadone treatment of opioid use disorder has been associated with reduced overdose deaths and reduced all-cause deaths. Naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) also can be used for opioid use disorder, particularly for highly motivated persons. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids if they are used. Naltrexone has not been evaluated in persons with concomitant pain and opioid use disorder, and opioid medications for pain generally cannot be used in patients receiving naltrexone. Naltrexone requires adherence to monthly, long-acting injections. The effectiveness of oral naltrexone can be limited by poor medication adherence, and oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances (e.g. for patients who would be able to comply with observed daily dosing to enhance adherence). Naltrexone also must be started after full withdrawal from opioids, which is a challenge for some patients; however, for patients who have completed or are able to complete withdrawal, naltrexone has comparable effectiveness as buprenorphine in prevention of return to drug use.

### Is levorphanol a better option than methadone? [^789be1e8]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Methadone has been a stalwart pharmacologic option for the management of opioid drug dependence for many years. It substitutes for opioid agonists and possesses certain pharmacokinetic properties that confer characteristics preferable to those of other opioids for this application. Methadone is likewise used as an option for the treatment of pain, particularly chronic pain. It has a spectrum of pharmacodynamic activity, including contributions from non-opioid components, that translates to its specific clinical attributes as an analgesic. Unfortunately, basic science studies and accumulated clinical experience with methadone have revealed some undesirable, and even worrisome, features, including issues of safety. The benefit/risk ratio of methadone might be acceptable if there was no better alternative, but neither its pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties are unique to methadone.

Objective

We review the basic and clinical pharmacology of methadone and suggest that levorphanol should receive attention as a possible alternative.

Conclusion

Unlike methadone, levorphanol is a more potent NMDA antagonist, possesses a higher affinity for DOR and KOR, has a shorter plasma half-life yet longer duration of action, has no CYP450 interactions or QTc prolongation risk, can be a viable option in the elderly, palliative care, and SCI patients, requires little to no need for co-administration of adjuvant analgesics, and has potentially a lower risk of drug-related Emergency Department visits compared to other opioids.

### A double-blind, randomized, parallel group study to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of slow-release oral morphine versus methadone in opioid-dependent in-patients willing to undergo detoxification [^29bc268d]. Addiction (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This is the first prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the feasibility of SROM for detoxification of opioid-dependent patients from maintenance treatment. This study was powered to prove the non-inferiority of SROM to methadone. The concept of this study was based on preliminary clinical experiences with tapered dose reductions of SROM over a period of 2–3 weeks in order to reach abstinence, in accordance with the widely accepted method of managing opioid withdrawal with methadone. Double-blind conditions were deemed necessary to minimize potential bias in patient selection and subjective assessments of efficacy and safety. Therefore, it was decided that a parallel-group study under double-blind conditions would be appropriate. In addition, the proportion of patients from each treatment group reaching a period of 3 drug-free days was defined as a suitably robust primary end-point to test the hypothesis of non-inferiority of SROM to methadone for detoxification. Frequent assessments of signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and craving for opiates were selected as clinically relevant secondary end-points together with self-assessments of wellbeing.

### Methadone maintenance at different dosages for opioid dependence [^8f6970e0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a long term opioid replacement therapy, recognised as effective in the management of opioid dependence. Even if MMT at high dosage is recommended as therapy for reducing illicit opioid use and promoting longer retention in treatment, at present day "the organisation and regulation of the methadone maintenance treatment varies widely".

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of different dosages of MMT for opioid dependence in modifying health and social outcomes and in promoting patients' familial, occupational and relational functioning.

Search Strategy

The following sources were scanned: - MEDLINE (OVID 1966–2001)- EMBASE (1988–2001)- ERIC (1988–2001)- Psychinfo (1947–2001)- Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) (1947–2001)- Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (CDAG) (1947–2001)The CDAG search strategy was applied together with a specific MESH strategy. Further studies were searched through: letters to the authors of selected trials or to experts in order to obtain unpublished data. check of references of relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) and Controlled Prospective Studies (CPS) evaluating methadone maintenance at different dosages in the management of opioid dependence were included in the review. Non-randomised trials were included when proper adjustment for confounding factors was performed at the analysis stage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Extraction of data was performed separately by two reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. RevMan software was used for analysis. Quality assessments of the methodology of studies were carried out using CDAG checklist.

Main Results

22 studies were excluded from the review. 21 studies were included; of them, 11 were RCTs with 2279 people randomised and 10 were CPSs with 3715 people followed-up.

Outcomes

Retention rate - RCTs: High vs low doses at shorter follow-ups: RR = 1.36 [1.13,1.63], and at longer ones: RR = 1.62 [0.95,2.77]. Opioid use (self reported), times/w - RCTs: high vs low doses WMD = -2.00 [-4.77,0.77] high vs middle doses WMD = -1.89[-3.43, -0.35] Opioid abstinence, (urine based) at > 3–4 w - RCTs: high vs low ones: RR = 1.59 [1.16,2.18] high vs middle doses RR = 1.51[0.63,3.61] Cocaine abstinence (urine based) at > 3–4 w - RCTs: high vs low doses RR = 1.81 [1.15,2.85]Overdose mortality - CPSs: high dose vs low dose at 6 years follow up: RR = 0.29 [0.02–5.34] high dose vs middle dose at 6 years follow up: RR = 0.38 [0.02–9.34] middle dose vs low dose at 6 years follow up: RR = 0.57 [0.06–5.06]

Reviewer's Conclusions

Methadone dosages ranging from 60 to 100 mg/day are more effective than lower dosages in retaining patients and in reducing use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. To find the optimal dose is a clinical ability, but clinician must consider these conclusions in treatment strategies.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^cc0303f3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — pain care for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) — For all patients with pain, it is important that the correct diagnosis is made and that pain is addressed, and alternative treatments including non-opioid medications with pain modulating properties, behavioral approaches, physical therapy, and procedural approaches should be considered before prescribing opioid medications for pain. If pharmacological treatment is considered, non-opioid analgesics and non-opioid medications with pain modulating properties should be tried first. For patients with pain who have an active OUD but are not in treatment, methadone or buprenorphine should be considered, and the patient's OUD and pain should be stabilized and managed concurrently. For patients taking methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, temporarily increasing the dose or dosing frequency (split dosing) may be effective for managing pain. For patients taking methadone for OUD with acute pain refractory to other treatments who require additional opioid-based analgesia, adding a short acting full agonist opioid to their regular dose of methadone can be considered to manage moderate to severe acute pain, and the dose of additional full agonist opioid analgesic prescribed is anticipated to be higher than the typical doses necessary to achieve adequate analgesia in opioid-naive individuals. Patients receiving buprenorphine for OUD who have moderate to severe acute pain refractory to other treatments and require additional opioid-based analgesia may benefit from the addition of as-needed doses of buprenorphine.

Implementation Considerations

In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation.
Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day. (Overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day.) (See Recommendation 4.)
Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone, because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage.
An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.
Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days to reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and prevent unintentional initiation of long-term opioid therapy. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently for most patients.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at higher risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation.
In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted.
At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives and goals, determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function, and determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid use disorder.
Clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression, anxiety, or other psychological comorbidities is optimized.
Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, considering their effects on pain and function relative to any adverse effects experienced. If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g. if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g. dosages of ≥ 50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see from Recommendation 5).
Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^90bd40da]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder, arising from the use of pharmaceutical and illicit opioids, is a global public health crisis. – The mainstay of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment includes use of primarily buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) or methadone (a full opioid agonist), in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. When used as directed, buprenorphine, alone or in combination with the opioid antagonist naloxone, and methadone are effective and safe. There are medical, practical, and patient preference reasons a provider may initiate treatment with buprenorphine or methadone. During the course of treatment, however, a medication change may be warranted.

Efficacy and/or safety factors are the main reasons for initiating a change in medication. – Logistics of treatment provision may also warrant a change in medication. For example, in some countries, including the United States, methadone is available only at substance use disorder treatment centers, which can pose a logistical burden and carry social stigma. In some settings, patients have greater access to unsupervised dosing with buprenorphine than with methadone, such that patients may wish to transition to buprenorphine to receive care in a less restrictive setting. The recent introduction of long-acting depot buprenorphine formulations may also drive patient demand to transfer from methadone to buprenorphine.

Various guidelines suggest that transferring from transmucosal buprenorphine to methadone is relatively straightforward. For this reason, this review focuses on the more complicated process of transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist with higher affinity for the mu opioid receptor; hence, it can precipitate withdrawal symptoms when switching from full opioid agonists such as methadone. Various factors can affect the patient experience of precipitated withdrawal and successful transfer from methadone to buprenorphine, including the size of the last methadone dose; the interval between methadone and buprenorphine dosing; the induction regimen of buprenorphine; patient expectations; the use of other substances; or psychiatric comorbidities. Several organizations have published guidelines for transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine, but with variations in some parts of the process (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Published Guidelines for Transfer of Patients From Methadone to Buprenorphine ∗

A 2012 review of studies that transferred patients from methadone to buprenorphine included many studies that used buprenorphine as a brief intermediate treatment in the process of ceasing MOUD entirely, or in laboratory studies in which patients were immediately returned to methadone. The purpose of this paper is to update and review the currently available evidence on transfer strategies used in clinical trials and observational studies of longer-term treatment with buprenorphine or methadone and to consider whether any strategies yield better clinical outcomes than others.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^2800279d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Withdrawal management with opioid agonists — methadone and buprenorphine notes that methadone and buprenorphine are both recommended for management of opioid withdrawal, and withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an OTP or inpatient setting. Opioid withdrawal management, on its own, without ongoing pharmacotherapy, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate to the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If the decision is made to taper, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and methadone tapers generally start with doses in the range of 20–30 mg per day and are completed in 6–10 days.

Pharmacology of methadone versus buprenorphine — mechanistic differences and observed efficacy: Differences in efficacy may arise from pharmacology, as methadone is a full agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and produces higher levels of physiologic dependence, whereas buprenorphine is a partial agonist associated with less physiologic dependence; at sufficient doses, methadone and buprenorphine appear equally effective in reducing mortality and retaining patients in treatment.

### Acute experimental pain responses in methadone-and buprenorphine / naloxone-maintained patients administered additional opioid or gabapentin: a double-blind crossover pilot study [^bf15ba65]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study objective was to identify the analgesic efficacy of three different pharmacological strategies in patients receiving methadone or buprenorphine as opioid agonist treatment (OAT). The three pharmacological approaches, a) increasing maintenance methadone/buprenorphine dose by 30%, b) adding oxycodone, or c) adding a single dose of gabapentin, were compared with a control condition of the participant's usual OAT dose.

Design

A randomized, controlled, double-blinded, double-dummy, within-subject crossover study.

Subjects

Nine participants on stable doses of methadone and eight participants on stable doses of buprenorphine were recruited.

Setting

An outpatient opioid treatment clinic in inner city Sydney, Australia.

Methods

The cold pressor tolerance test was used to examine experimental pain threshold and tolerance. Ratings of subjective drug effects and safety measures (physiological and cognitive) were assessed.

Results

There was no difference in the primary outcome measures of pain thresholds or tolerance between the conditions examined. Interindividual variability was evident. Differences in some subjective measures were identified, including lower pain recall, lower "bad effects", and higher global satisfaction in the additional methadone condition. In the buprenorphine arm, increased drug liking and "bad effects" were detected with oxycodone administration, while increased subjective intoxication was identified with gabapentin.

Conclusions

There was no evidence of an objective improvement in analgesia with any condition compared with control. Further research is required to optimize pain management strategies in this population.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with other substance use disorders, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not withhold or suspend treatment with methadone or buprenorphine in patients using benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics. Recognize that while the combined use of these medications increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated OUD can outweigh these risks. Conduct a risk-benefit analysis and provide greater support, including careful medication management to reduce risks.

### Methadone hydrochloride (methadone) [^3d7bf960]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Methadone differs from many other opioid agonists in several important ways. Methadone's pharmacokinetic properties, coupled with high interpatient variability in its absorption, metabolism, and relative analgesic potency, necessitate a cautious and highly individualized approach to prescribing. Particular vigilance is necessary during treatment initiation, during conversion from one opioid to another, and during dose titration.

While methadone's duration of analgesic action (typically 4 to 8 hours) in the setting of single-dose studies approximates that of morphine, methadone's plasma elimination half-life is substantially longer than that of morphine (typically 8 to 59 hours vs. 1 to 5 hours). Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects. Also, with repeated dosing, methadone may be retained in the liver and then slowly released, prolonging the duration of action despite low plasma concentrations. For these reasons, steady-state plasma concentrations, and full analgesic effects, are usually not attained until 3 to 5 days of dosing. Additionally, incomplete cross-tolerance between μ-opioid agonists makes determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex.

All of these characteristics make methadone dosing complex and can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration. A high degree of "opioid tolerance" does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise. Deaths have been reported during conversion to methadone from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists.

### Methadone as first-line opioid for the management of cancer pain [^8a09f6b4]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 60% of cancer patients will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the disease progresses. The majority of cancer patients with pain will respond to opioid therapy. Opioid analgesics remain of paramount importance for the management of cancer pain, and each of these drugs may have a role in particular conditions, thus increasing the chances of the achievement of good analgesia for most patients.

A large availability of drugs is a fundamental opportunity in treating a condition like cancer pain in individuals. Methadone is a strong opioid drug that displays an important peculiarity: it binds to μ-receptor like other strong opioids, but unlike the others, its continuous administration induces much less N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) overexpression (that is associated with tolerance and hyperalgesia), and acts on the pain modulating descending tracts in the medulla, also affecting reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. As opioid dose escalation may cause hyperalgesia mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway, a peculiar opioid such as methadone may prevent or inhibit the development of tolerance and hyperalgesia through blockade of NMDA receptor, especially at low doses.

### Perspectives of pain specialists, patients, and family members on long-term opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain: a qualitative study [^f09a69e5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Concerns

Most of the specialists reported concerns about the adverse effects of opioids. Drug monitoring and continued follow-ups should be scheduled every 2–3 months. As one specialist stated:

"I am concerned about the possibility of opioid tolerance and misuse. I carefully assess [the patient's] current effective dose, and cut back on their dose if possible."

Some specialists mentioned opioid use disorder. If they suspected this condition, they would offer or convert to methadone if it was not contraindicated. As one specialist said:

"If there is any chance of drug addiction during treatment, I will avoid prescribing opioids at 90 MME per day. A small amount of opioids will be prescribed, and opioid rotation to methadone will be considered."

Opioid prescribing policies

Specialists reported that hospital policies, regulations, or clinical practice guidelines are necessary to promote the implementation of appropriate prescribing of opioids in CNCP patients. Overall, they believed that this would reduce the occurrence of opioid-related harm and prevent iatrogenic addiction. As some specialists said:

"My hospital has a policy about prescribing opioids that helps us to easily manage [opioid prescriptions]. For example, it explicitly restricts prescribing more than 2 months."

"I think that if the hospital has regulations that determine which doctor can prescribe morphine to chronic pain patients, we would be able to control the medication properly, and addiction would decrease."

All specialists stated that the implementation of education to healthcare providers and patients about opioid prescribing could help to reduce opioid use disorder. Moreover, they suggested that appropriate knowledge may promote more judicious opioid prescribing and ensure safer prescribing when indicated. As one specialist said:

"I think that providing education about the advantages and disadvantages of long-term morphine use to patients and treating physicians was necessary. It decreased adverse events and harm."

Some specialists mentioned that the online national electronic medical record, which alerts opioid prescribing, might reduce patients' opioid shopping or drug-seeking behaviors. Moreover, the electronic medical record helps to alert physicians about redundant drug prescribing. As some specialists mentioned:

"I did not know whether patients had received morphine from other hospitals. Sometimes I felt discomfort about prescribing morphine. If I had known about all of the medications that my patient takes, I might have felt more confident to manage [their medications]."

"If I have ordered redundant drugs, the computer software alerts my prescriptions. This made me more confident, and reduced the mistakes made by people."

### Evaluation of a novel patient-centered methadone restart protocol [^f83b2cbd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Methadone is a highly effective medication for opioid use disorder that is associated with a 50% reduction in mortality. Due to federal regulations, methadone may only be administered in licensed opioid treatment programs (OTP), where patients are frequently required to present for daily in-person dosing. In OTPs, methadone restarts, where individuals miss multiple days of dosing and then return to care, are common and typically result in methadone dose reductions due to presumed loss of opioid tolerance. Lower methadone doses may be associated with clinical instability and risk of dropout from care. In determining appropriate restart doses, OTP clinicians must weigh the benefits of maintaining a more therapeutic methadone dose against the risks of overmedication or overdose from interval loss of opioid tolerance. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) consensus documents do not explicitly dictate the dose after missed days.

In the absence of evidence-based guidelines on methadone restart dosing, clinicians rely on consensus best practice documents, which generally recommend substantial dose decreases after as few as 3 missed days of dosing. For example, SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocol 63 states, "Patients who miss more than 4 doses must be reassessed. Their next methadone dose should be decreased substantially and built back up gradually. It may be necessary to restart the dose induction process from Day 1."These recommendations are based on pharmacologic concepts of tolerance, yet most do not distinguish between individuals with loss of tolerance from opioid abstinence vs maintenance of tolerance from interim use of other prescribed or non-prescribed opioids. This approach can lead to substantial underdosing of opioid tolerant individuals, resulting in ongoing illicit opioid use to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and further clinical instability. Furthermore, this uniform approach ignores patient preference, clinician discretion, and shared decision-making based on informed risk-benefit discussions, the importance of which is highlighted in SAMHSA's February 2024 update to 42 CFR Part 8 regulations. The arrival of illicitly manufactured fentanyl in the opioid supply has spurred a re-examination of methadone dose initiation and titration. However, only recently has restart dosing garnered attention, and limited data exist to guide modifications to restart dosing practices.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to choice of agent and dosage, ASPN 2021 guidelines recommend to consider prescribing methadone when other opioids are ineffective, or additional NMDA or serotonin receptor modulation is desired.
Decide on dosing initiation depending on opioid tolerance with low introductory doses in naïve patients.
Offer a conservative approach starting at 75–90% less than the calculated equianalgesic dose using 1:15 to 1:20 conversion factor in opioid-tolerant patients.

### Safe methadone induction and stabilization: report of an expert panel [^b9f86d97]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Methadone is a well-studied, safe, and effective medication when dispensed and consumed properly. However, a number of studies have identified elevated rates of overdose and death in patients being treated with methadone for either addiction or chronic pain. Among patients being treated with methadone in federally certified opioid treatment programs, deaths most often occur during the induction and stabilization phases of treatment. To address this issue, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration invited the American Society of Addiction Medicine to convene an expert panel to develop a consensus statement on methadone induction and stabilization, with recommendations to reduce the risk of patient overdose or death related to methadone maintenance treatment of addiction.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search of English-language publications (1979–2011) was conducted via MEDLINE and EMBASE. Methadone Action Group members evaluated the resulting information and collaborated in formulating the consensus statement presented here, which subsequently was reviewed by more than 100 experts in the field.

Results

Published data indicate that deaths during methadone induction occur because the initial dose is too high, the dose is increased too rapidly, or the prescribed methadone interacts with another drug. Therefore, the Methadone Action Group has developed recommendations to help methadone providers avoid or minimize these risks.

Conclusions

Careful management of methadone induction and stabilization, coupled with patient education and increased clinical vigilance, can save lives in this vulnerable patient population.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^006f8e3f]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

REBUTTAL

All opioid medications should be available to hospitalized patients with opioid withdrawal

Drs. Stern, D'Orazio, and Work

We appreciate the Counterpoint authors' acknowledgment of a potential benefit from use of short-acting opioids to supplement evidence-based opioid withdrawal management. We believe this to be an important point of agreement. If the outcome of this perspective piece is momentum toward acceptance of such an approach, our patients will be better served.

We believe that the Counterpoint authors mischaracterize our argument by focusing on opioid monotherapy as a replacement for methadone or buprenorphine. The crux of our argument is that the full range of legal opioid therapies should be made available to hospitalized patients with opioid withdrawal. These medications should not replace buprenorphine or methadone, which should continue to be considered first-line therapies for management of opioid withdrawal. Rather, opioids such as oxycodone and hydromorphone can serve as short-term supplementary tools, either to mitigate in-hospital discomfort, or to assist with transitions to methadone or buprenorphine.

We disagree with the Counterpoint authors that it is "exceedingly rare" for patients to decline methadone or buprenorphine. In our experience, even in response to extensive discussion, patients are often not prepared to start these medications early in presentations to the hospital.

We advocate for improved access to methadone in hospitals. For largely nonclinical reasons, use of methadone is often restricted in the hospital setting, and hospitalists may be reluctant to start treatment due to concerns about discharge planningor misconceptions about legality and safety. To that point, we agree that urgent efforts to reduce barriers to in-hospital utilization of methadone are needed. We need to advocate for the removal of restrictions on continuation of hospital-initiated methadone in postacute care settings, and we need to develop effective, patient-centered processes for outpatient treatment continuation after periods of hospitalization. But this will take time.

### High BMI is a specific risk factor for drug-related mortality in patients receiving methadone: a case control study [^7e6e6e4e]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

People who use heroin are often underweight. Heroin can suppress appetite, and users often prioritise drug use over a healthy diet. Heroin use can also increase metabolism and energy expenditure and decrease the absorption of nutrients because of gastrointestinal changes. Malnutrition can also lead to a range of health conditions including a weakened immune system, anaemia and compromised bone physiology. When people who use heroin engage with drug and alcohol treatment services in England and Wales, in addition to initiating an opioid agonist therapy (OAT) regime — usually either methadone or buprenorphine — they are also provided with lifestyle advice including the importance of healthy eating to address health problems caused by malnutrition (e.g. Derbyshire Recovery Partnership).

It is well recognised that long‐term methadone use can cause gradual weight gain leading to a higher body mass index (BMI). Indeed, overweight and obesity rates are higher in methadone users than the general population, with estimates that more than three quarters of methadone patients are overweight or obese. The reason for this weight gain is likely multifactorial. First, advice from treatment services for underweight patients to gain weight may be leading to excessive weight gain. Second, people abstaining from drug use may comfort eat as it provides feelings of reward and also acts as a method of distraction. Furthermore, methadone use can increase appetite. Third, the coupling of comfort eating with a preference for sweet foods that opioid use can induce can lead to the overconsumption of sugary foods and drinks. Fourth, methadone use can lower metabolic rate meaning even a moderate increase in caloric intake can lead to weight gain. Finally, financing of food may have previously been deprioritised over the purchase of drugs.

Recently, it was noted by drug and alcohol treatment services in two regions in England — Teesside and Derbyshire — that a number of their OAT patients were overweight or obese, with those who were most overweight appearing to be dying at an increased rate. We, therefore, conducted a retrospective case–control study examining the BMI of people engaged with drug and alcohol treatment services in these areas to understand whether this casual observation was indeed a significant risk factor for increased mortality.

### Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatments versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatment of opioid dependence [^d6a9cca0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Methadone maintenance at proper doses is effective in retaining patients in treatment and suppressing heroin use. Questions remain regarding the efficacy of the psychosocial services that are offered by most maintenance programs.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of any psychosocial plus any agonist maintenance treatment versus any agonist treatment alone in retaining patients in treatment, reducing the use of substances and improving health and social status.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL) issue 3, 2003; MEDLINE 1966–2003; EMBASE 1980–2003; PsycINFO 1985–2003; relevant web sites; scan of reference list of relevant articles. There were no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

RCTs which focus on any psychosocial plus any agonist compared to any agonist maintenance intervention for opiate dependence. People aged less than 18 and pregnant women were excluded. Psychosocial in combination with antagonist maintenance treatment are excluded too.

Data Collection and Analysis

The trials were independently assessed for inclusion and methodological quality by the reviewers. Data were extracted independently and double checked.

Main Results

The searching process resulted in the identification of 77 different studies: 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies considered 8 different psychosocial interventions and 1 pharmacological treatment: Methadone Maintenance (MMT). The results show additional benefit in adding any psychosocial treatment to standard methadone maintenance treatment in relation to the use of heroin during the treatment RR 0.69 (95% CI 0.53–0.91); no statistically significant additional benefit was shown in terms of retention in treatment RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.85–1.02); and results at follow-up RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.76–1.07).

Reviewers' Conclusions

The present evidence suggests that adding any psychosocial support to Standard MMT significantly improves the non-use of heroin during treatment. Retention in treatment and results at follow-up are also improved, although this findings did not achieve statistical significance. Insufficient evidence is available on other possible relevant outcomes such as Psychiatric symptoms/psychological distress, Quality of life. Limitations to this review are imposed by the heterogeneity of the trials both in the interventions and the assessment of outcomes. Results of studies were sometimes in disagreement and because of lack of detailed information no meta analysis could be performed to analyse the results related to the outcomes more often reported as positive results in the single studies. Duration of the studies was also too short to analyse other relevant outcomes such as mortality. In order to study the possible added value of any psychosocial treatment over an already effective treatment such as standard MMT, only big multi-site studies could be considered which define experimental interventions and outcomes in the most standardized way as possible.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^4a61531d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

For patients already taking opioids long term (both established patients and patients transferring from other clinicians), the possibility of opioid dosage reduction might provoke substantial anxiety. In addition, tapering opioids after years of taking them can be especially challenging because of physical and psychological dependence. However, patients should be offered the opportunity to reevaluate their continued use of opioids. Clinicians should review benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with empathy.

Whenever possible, clinicians should collaborate with patients and share decision-making about whether and how to taper opioids. Clinicians should review benefits and risks of opioid therapy with the patient and decide whether tapering is appropriate for the patient. If the existing opioid regimen does not put the patient at imminent risk for overdose or other injury, tapering does not need to occur immediately, and clinicians can take time to reach agreement with patients. For patients who agree to taper opioids to lower dosages, clinicians should collaborate with the patient on a tapering plan. Open discussion between the clinician and patient should take place, whether the goal of the taper is stopping opioids or reducing opioids to a point where benefits outweigh risks; the goal will depend on the patient's circumstances and an individualized assessment of benefits and risks. Tapering is more likely to be successful when patients collaborate in the taper. Clinicians can discuss with patients the patient's perceptions of benefits, risks, and adverse effects of continued opioid therapy; include patient concerns in taper planning; and include patients in making decisions such as which medication will be decreased first (e.g. in patients prescribed more than one opioid) and how quickly tapering will occur.

Providing Advice to Patients Before Tapering

Clinicians should advise patients that overall, after voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, most patients report stable or improved function, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or with decreased pain levels (,–). However, other patients report insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased pain, particularly in the short term. Increased pain might be related to hyperalgesia or opioid withdrawal and can be prolonged in some patients. Patients can be counseled that worsening of pain is a frequent symptom of opioid withdrawal that tends to diminish over time. Clinicians should advise patients about the increased risk for overdose with abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dosage because of loss of opioid tolerance and warn of a risk for overdose if the patient returns to their original dosage. Clinicians should provide opioid overdose education and offer naloxone.

### Opioid use disorder: a qualitative exploratory analysis of potential misunderstandings in patients with chronic non-cancer pain [^756b0b95]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Have You Ever Found That You Ended Up Taking More of the Opioid Than You Intended to, or Carried on Taking It for Longer Than You Intended to?

Four patients gave false positive answers to this question. For example, patient two stated, "Yes, of course. If I had more, more pain, and it was no longer bearable" (Figure 2). This response suggests that the reason for taking more opioids was not a desire for the medication itself, but rather the intensity of the pain. Another patient, who was asked to describe a specific situation in which they took more opioids than the prescribed amount, said,

[…] I had a pain attack, I live here with my brother, and I was so vicious because I had this pain. And then my brother brought me the tablets and said, "Now you take another one". (Interview 11)

Figure 2
Example of misunderstanding of Item one; After the patient agreed, the interviewer asked a follow-up question about a concrete situation.

Do You Have a Persistent Desire to Reduce or Better Control the Amount of Opioid You Take, or Have You Tried to Do so Without Success?

Five patients gave a false positive answer, and two patients gave a false negative answer to this question. With regards to this category, on one hand, the issue seems to be that patients often do not feel personally responsible for reducing their medication or discussing reduction with their physician, but rather feel trapped in the context of their patient-doctor relationship. On the other hand, it sometimes appears that the concept of dependency does not quite fit for pain medication as it does for substance abuse. For example, one patient stated

In any case, I have the desire to do that, but until now we've only had to increase the dose instead of reducing it. (Interview 6)

An example of a false negative answer can be seen in the response of a patient in Figure 3.

### Induction to methadone 80 mg in the first week of treatment of patients who use fentanyl: a case series from an outpatient opioid treatment program [^8e7ea82e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and related analogues continue to drive the overdose crisis in the United States, where over 100,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2022. Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) using opioid agonist therapies like methadone and buprenorphine were developed to address OUD from heroin, and they are mainstay treatment options proven to reduce overdose mortality.

Methadone and buprenorphine remain effective in reducing mortality and morbidity for individuals using fentanyl, but new challenges have emerged and may continue to evolve as other high-potency synthetic opioids become more prevalent in the drug supply. The unique pharmacodynamics of fentanyl often lead dependent individuals to use fentanyl several times per day to stave off withdrawal, resulting in development of a much higher opioid tolerance compared to heroin or prescription opioids. Buprenorphine appears to be more likely to precipitate opioid withdrawal in patients using fentanyl (vs heroin and other short-acting opioids), complicating the induction process and leading to a proliferation of different strategies for helping patients achieve induction. Methadone doses that were effective for patients using heroin seem to be less effective at eliminating fentanyl use, suggesting that higher doses may be required.

Methadone induction guidelines are conservative, focused on minimizing overdose risk from the methadone itself rather than rapidly reaching a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal. One reason for this caution is that studies of individuals conducted before the introduction of fentanyl to illicit drug markets found that risk of overdose is highest in the first 4 weeks after starting methadone. The specific reasons for this are not known, and guideline titration schedules are based on patient response to a dose at steady state, which is reached after 4–5 days given an average half-life of 24 hours. A 2013 expert panel convened by the American Society of Addiction Medicine recommended a maximum initial dose of 30 mg, followed by 5-mg increases no sooner than every 5 days. Other expert panels are marginally more aggressive, recommending an initial dose of 10–30 mg, followed by increases of 5–10 mg no sooner than every 3 to 4 days of daily dosing. Following either approach may still require several weeks, if not months, to reach an effective dose — generally estimated to be between 80 and 120 mg for people using heroin — that reduces nonmedical opioid use by suppressing withdrawal and opioid cravings. Achieving successful induction may become even more challenging in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders, such as methamphetamine use disorder, which has been linked to decreased retention rates. Another possibility for the increased mortality early in treatment with methadone, then, is ongoing nonmedical opioid use.

### Buprenorphine versus methadone maintenance treatment in an ambulant setting: a health-related quality of life assessment [^351ee5e8]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Background

To compare the effects on quality of life (QOL) of oral methadone with sublingual buprenorphine.

Methods

We performed an open-label, non-randomized, two-site (methadone-buprenorphine) study. During 6 months we assessed the quality of life status of 53 opioid-dependent patients admitted to a methadone or buprenorphine maintenance programme using the German version (Berlin Quality of Life Profile) of the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile. Physical symptoms were measured using the Opioid Withdrawal Scale. Five hundred and thirty urine screening tests were carried out randomly to detect additional consumption.

Results

Sixty-seven opioid-dependent subjects (38 on methadone and 29 on buprenorphine) were enrolled in the study, and 53 completed it (30 subjects treated with buprenorphine and 23 subjects with racemic methadone). The subjects were comparable on all baseline measures. At the first follow-up (week 8), the buprenorphine-maintained group showed significantly less additional consumption of opioids (P = 0.013) compared with the methadone group. Patients retained in the buprenorphine or methadone programme (week 24) showed no significant differences in all quality of life scores. At the end of the study period, the buprenorphine-maintained group showed significantly less additional consumption of opioids (P = 0.001) and cocaine (P = 0.018) compared with the methadone group. The outcome measures for withdrawal symptoms after 24 weeks of treatment with buprenorphine showed slight advantages in stomach cramps, fatigue or tiredness, feelings of coldness and heart pounding.

Conclusions

These results suggest that buprenorphine treatment is as effective as methadone regarding effects on quality of life and withdrawal symptoms. Buprenorphine has the potential to reduce the harm caused by drug abuse. Further research is needed to determine if buprenorphine is more effective than methadone in particular subgroups of patients.

### Multimodal acute pain management in the parturient with opioid use disorder: a review [^b0e586d3]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Methadone

Methadone is one of the main medications used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is a dual μ, κ, and σ opioid receptor agonist. It is formulated as a racemic mixture of R-methadone and S-methadone and is typically dosed once daily when treating OUD.R-methadone is more potent and is responsible for most of the analgesic effects of the drug. However, S-methadone has a longer duration of action. Methadone causes analgesia, sedation, and euphoria, and it has a long half-life. This makes it beneficial in the treatment of opioid addiction because it prevents acute withdrawal symptoms while reducing the risk of relapse. Methadone is metabolized in the liver and undergoes renal and fecal excretion with a half-life that ranges from 8 to 59 hours, depending on individual factors such as age, liver function, and other medications being taken such as cytochrome p450 inducers or inhibitors. Common cytochrome p450 inducers include rifampin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. Inhibitors include azithromycin, ritonavir, and amiodarone. It is safe in renal failure with no active byproducts. Methadone can also be used in the management of chronic pain, but as a much lower dose given three times daily. Given that it is a full μ agonist, it can be abused with no ceiling effect. A ceiling effect refers to a phenomenon in which use of a drug reaches a maximum effect, at which greater doses of the drug do not increase effectiveness. Thus, its administration is restricted to supervised, government-approved locations known as methadone clinics. Unfortunately, this restriction becomes a barrier to access in rural areas or for patients with a lack of transportation to such facilities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 60 mg of methadone has been most effective at reducing the death rate related to opioid dependence.

### A quantitative examination of illness models among people with opioid use disorder receiving methadone treatment [^ef51c475]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined illness models among people with addiction. We investigated illness models and their associations with demographics and treatment beliefs among patients receiving methadone treatment for opioid use disorder.

Methods

From January 2019 to February 2020, patients receiving methadone treatment at outpatient opioid treatment programs provided demographics and rated using 1 to 7 Likert-type scales agreement with addiction illness models (brain disease model, chronic medical condition model [CMCM], and no explanation [NEM]) and treatment beliefs. Pairwise comparisons and multivariate regressions were used to examine associations between illness models, demographics, and treatment beliefs. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results

A total of 450 patients participated in the study. Forty percent self-identified as female, 13% as Hispanic, and 78% as White; mean age was 38.5 years. Brain disease model was the most frequently endorsed illness model (46.2%), followed by CMCM (41.7%) and NEM (21.9%). In multivariate analyses, agreement with brain disease model was significantly positively associated with beliefs that methadone treatment would be effective, counseling is important, and methadone is lifesaving, whereas agreement with CMCM was significantly positively associated with beliefs that methadone treatment would be effective, counseling is important, 12-step is the best treatment, taking methadone daily is important, and methadone is lifesaving. In multivariate analyses, agreement with NEM was negatively significantly associated with beliefs that methadone would be effective, counseling is important, taking methadone daily is important, and methadone is lifesaving.

Discussion

Many patients in methadone treatment endorsed medicalized addiction models. Agreement with addiction illness models appear to be related to treatment beliefs.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^720408b6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Transitioning from methadone to naltrexone — complete opioid withdrawal is required and timing plus naloxone challenge are provided. "Patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone have to be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before they can receive naltrexone." "This may take up to 14 days, but can typically be achieved in 7 days." "A naloxone challenge (administration of 0.4–0.8 mg naloxone and observation for precipitated withdrawal) may be useful before initiating treatment with naltrexone to document the absence of physiological dependence and to minimize the risk for precipitated withdrawal."

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Opioids are commonly prescribed for two indications: analgesic indications and agonist treatment in patients with illicit opioid use. As an analgesic, opioids have a place in acute and cancer-related pain. However, continued long-term use for chronic non-cancer pain may induce adverse events, such as elevated pain, mood disorders and reduced quality of life, without clear benefits as an analgesic. In these cases, opioid discontinuation should be initiated as early as possible as nearly 5% of patients develop an opioid use disorder. Patients with chronic non-cancer pain and an opioid use disorder discontinuing their opioids have a relapse rate of 23% after 1 year. In patients on opioid agonist treatment (methadone or buprenorphine), the aim is to reduce opioid-related harm. These patients generally had several previous failed attempts to stop illicit opioid use. Patients with illicit opioid use disorder who use agonist treatment have a relapse rate of 71% within 1 month after discontinuation of agonist treatment. Treatment goals for these patients should be more toward harm reduction with opioid agonist therapy (i.e. methadone or buprenorphine) instead of tapering. Only in a subset of individuals who have a wish to taper or discontinue their agonist treatment, and have improved psychological or social conditions, such as improvement on co-occurring mental disorders or housing situations, tapering or discontinuation can be considered.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Opioid discontinuation in patients with chronic pain reduces pain severity and improves quality of life. Increased pain and craving can occur in some patients in short term, particularly at higher doses. In patients on agonist treatment, discontinuation of agonist treatment has been associated with increased craving levels, and reduced quality of life. Discontinuation of prescription opioids is usually accompanied by DS after more than 3 weeks of use. Typical opioid DS include dysphoria, anxiety, agitation, nausea, muscle ache, rhinorrhea, sweating, diarrhea, yawning, fever, and insomnia. Higher opioid doses and long-term use result in more severe DS, while long-acting opioids (methadone or buprenorphine) cause less severe DS. Among patients with opioid use disorders, acute discontinuation or rapid tapering of opioids may lead to withdrawal that requires medical care. In individuals discontinuing opioids after long-term use for chronic pain, suicidal ideation and self-directed violence may occur. Overdose-related morbidity is more likely in the first month after discontinuation, due to decreased tolerance to original doses following relapse. Opioid discontinuation may result in illicit opioid use, including heroin and illegally manufactured fentanyl.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^0c78f596]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Opioid agonist therapy can be considered a bridge to several potential treatment pathways for hospitalized patients with OUD. For a patient who is initially reluctant to initiate MOUD, an alternate opioid agonist such as oxycodone or hydromorphone can be utilized to effectively manage pain and opioid withdrawal during the initial phase of hospitalization, buying time to revisit interest in MOUD when initial symptoms are better controlled. Regarding transition to buprenorphine, prescription oxycodone has a more predictable half-life than illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and when timed properly, the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal during transitions from oxycodone to buprenorphine can be all but eliminated. For a patient interested in methadone treatment, oxycodone can be utilized to control pain and withdrawal symptoms until methadone can be titrated to effective dosing. What about the patient who is uninterested in MOUD? A patient with OUD and significant opioid dependence should not be required to accept MOUD to receive medical care, and treatment with opioid agonist therapies during a period of hospitalization can be considered a safe bridge to continued opioid use after discharge, protecting a patient's opioid tolerance as a form of harm reduction, and ultimately mitigating the risk of fatal overdose following hospitalization.

### ACMT position statement: allow optimal treatment for healthcare professionals with opioid use disorder [^cec5e801]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). High credibility.

Opioid agonist treatment should be available for patients with OUD — Opioid agonists, specifically methadone and buprenorphine, have been consistently demonstrated to reduce opioid-related harms, while abstinence-based ("drug-free") and rapid-taper detoxification programs have been associated with increased relapse risk and increased risk of overdose death due to loss of tolerance; long-term opioid agonist treatment reduces risks of opioid-related mortality, all-cause mortality, treatment attrition, use of illicit drugs, and attendant health consequences. Healthcare professionals should have access to the best treatments, and a blanket ban on agonist treatment (i.e., methadone or buprenorphine) cannot be justified given the evidence that agonist medication treatment is effective for the treatment of OUD and is compatible with current conceptualizations of recovery.
