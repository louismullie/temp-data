## Question

What are the advandages of vamorolone over traditional corticosteroids in the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the advantages of vamorolone over traditional corticosteroids in the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, specifically regarding efficacy, growth, bone, endocrine, and behavioral outcomes, and is seeking clarification of any misconceptions, with a transparent reasoning process and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core dissociative mechanism that could plausibly separate benefit from harm. Then, I should verify head-to-head efficacy against prednisone and the durability of effect. Next, I will examine growth outcomes and bone biomarkers, followed by endocrine safety, especially adrenal suppression. After that, I need to check behavioral and other safety signals, including Cushingoid features and infections. Finally, I will consider dose-response, regulatory context, and synthesize a balanced, clinically actionable conclusion, while flagging areas of uncertainty that warrant caution and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic premise, because the claimed advantage hinges on it. Vamorolone lacks the 11β-hydroxyl/carbonyl moiety on the C ring, which alters glucocorticoid receptor interactions and reduces transactivation while preserving transrepression, and it is not a substrate for 11β-HSD1/2, which in animal models mediates corticosteroid-associated bone morbidities; it also antagonizes the mineralocorticoid receptor rather than activating it, which may mitigate fluid retention and other mineralocorticoid effects [^112yhhdc] [^117TZF7j] [^113XRdC5] [^111xpC4e] [^113pMMxf]. Hold on, I should verify that these mechanistic features correlate with clinical effects; indeed, across randomized and open-label studies, vamorolone shows improved linear growth and bone turnover profiles versus prednisone, consistent with this dissociation hypothesis [^116VZWpH] [^112uFQCc].

> Now, efficacy. I will now examine the pivotal randomized trial: vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day improved time-to-stand velocity versus placebo at 24 weeks, with sequential secondary outcomes in 6-minute walk distance and time-to-run/walk 10 meters also met, and the magnitude of motor benefit was similar to prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day across five motor outcomes, supporting noninferior efficacy in this context [^111Kue1c] [^115dB2aJ] [^116s8eAC] [^112QsSDC]. Wait, let me verify durability beyond 24 weeks; in the 48-week randomized study, benefits were maintained, and participants switching from prednisone to vamorolone retained efficacy, with the higher vamorolone dose showing more consistent maintenance than the lower dose, reinforcing 6 mg/kg/day as the more robust regimen [^112QsSDC] [^112uFQCc] [^1147rNVY]. But wait, what if earlier, lower-dose signals conflict with this; the 24-week open-label dose-finding study suggested benefit at 2.0 mg/kg/day versus natural history, but without a blinded control, so I should be cautious and weigh the randomized data more heavily [^111Wv5jf] [^117TQ1rT].

> Growth and bone next. I should double-check height outcomes first. Prednisone was associated with a mean decline in height percentile of about 1.88 percentile points at 24 weeks, whereas vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day showed a mean increase of about 3.86 percentile points, and this advantage persisted across longer-term extensions, indicating preserved linear growth velocity with vamorolone compared with traditional glucocorticoids [^114asjMb] [^116VZWpH] [^115LThS9]. For bone, I need to check biomarkers and fractures. Prednisone suppressed bone turnover markers, whereas vamorolone did not, and in crossover cohorts, switching from prednisone to vamorolone rapidly normalized bone turnover biomarkers; incident vertebral fractures were rare and mild in the pivotal trial, and preliminary analyses suggest lower vertebral fracture risk compared with prednisone, although long-bone fracture data remain limited and require cautious interpretation [^112uFQCc] [^115MRT8B]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the fracture signal is encouraging but not definitive given sample size and duration, so ongoing surveillance is prudent [^115MRT8B].

> Endocrine safety. Adrenal suppression is a key issue. At first glance, I almost said "vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day has 84% suppression vs 100% for prednisone", which sounds like a clear advantage; wait, let me verify the threshold, because the proportion depends on the assay-specific cut point. Using the historical 500 nmol/L ACTH-stimulated cortisol threshold, suppression rates at week 24 were 100% with prednisone, 95.2% with vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day, and 84.2% with vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day; using a revised 400 nmol/L threshold for a monoclonal assay, rates were 92% with prednisone, 90.5% with vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day, and 47.5% with vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day, highlighting that the 2 mg/kg/day dose yields less HPA suppression than prednisone and the 6 mg/kg/day dose [^111EESKu] [^1161Ny8w] [^112NJyXf]. I should confirm that vamorolone-treated boys still need stress-dosing guidance; yes, endocrine analyses emphasize universal education, emergency cards, and hydrocortisone coverage during illness or procedures, with tapering strategies on discontinuation, mirroring best practices for glucocorticoids [^112j8Xkm] [^111SCamN] [^113sXsuB].

> Behavioral and other safety. Let me consider behavior and cushingoid features. In the pivotal trial, there were fewer behavioral adverse events with vamorolone compared with prednisone, and the single severe behavioral event occurred in the prednisone arm; Cushingoid features were observed with both agents, but their incidence appeared lower and more manageable with vamorolone in some analyses, and the overall adverse event burden was similar to prednisone without excess serious events attributable to vamorolone [^116tSmWT] [^112uFQCc]. I should confirm infectious risks; upper respiratory infections were common but not clearly increased versus prednisone, consistent with similar immunosuppressive liability in this setting [^112runef].

> Dose-response and durability. Hold on, I should verify whether 6 mg/kg/day is clearly superior to 2 mg/kg/day for maintaining motor outcomes. Across the 48-week randomized analysis, 6 mg/kg/day better maintained improvements in most motor outcomes versus 2 mg/kg/day, and crossover participants to 6 mg/kg/day showed robust catch-up and retention of efficacy, whereas crossover to 2 mg/kg/day had more variable responses; taken together, 6 mg/kg/day appears to be the preferred therapeutic dose for durable benefit, with 2 mg/kg/day as a lower-efficacy option when tolerability or endocrine considerations dictate [^112uFQCc] [^1147rNVY] [^112j8Xkm].

> Regulatory status and practical considerations. I need to ensure the indication and pharmacokinetics are clear. Vamorolone is FDA-approved for DMD in patients aged 2 years and older, with food modestly increasing exposure and Tmax delayed by about 1 hour; given the CNS distribution seen in preclinical models, clinicians should monitor for neuropsychiatric effects even though trial signals have been favorable compared with prednisone in terms of behavior [^116Y5bai] [^112T7H2p] [^111AmuDR] [^112tMTAh]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that CNS penetration does not imply a clear increase in adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in humans; current clinical data do not show a marked excess versus prednisone, but vigilance remains reasonable [^116tSmWT].

> Putting this together, the main advantages of vamorolone over traditional corticosteroids in ambulatory boys with DMD are: comparable efficacy to prednisone for key motor outcomes with sustained benefit at 6 mg/kg/day, substantially better preservation of linear growth without stunting, improved bone turnover biomarkers with a suggestive reduction in vertebral fractures that requires confirmation, lower behavioral adverse event burden in randomized comparisons, and a more favorable mineralocorticoid profile with less fluid retention. Adrenal suppression still occurs, dose-dependently, but is less pronounced at 2 mg/kg/day and requires the same stress-dosing and taper protocols as traditional glucocorticoids [^111Kue1c] [^112uFQCc] [^116VZWpH] [^115MRT8B] [^111EESKu] [^112j8Xkm]. Hold on, I should verify the overall clinical trade-off; the pivotal trial's authors concluded vamorolone may be a safer alternative to prednisone for long-term DMD therapy, which aligns with the totality of randomized and extension data to date, while acknowledging that head-to-head long-term fracture and cardiometabolic outcomes remain under evaluation [^111Kue1c] [^1142GxXZ].

Vamorolone offers **comparable efficacy** to prednisone/deflazacort for preserving muscle function in DMD [^112QsSDC] [^116VZWpH], with a **superior safety profile** — notably less growth stunting, better bone health, and fewer metabolic and behavioral side effects [^116VZWpH] [^1147rNVY] [^111eK1o4]. It causes **dose-dependent adrenal suppression** [^112NJyXf] and requires stress-dose coverage [^112j8Xkm], but overall adverse events are lower than with traditional steroids [^116tSmWT]. These advantages position vamorolone as a safer long-term alternative to standard glucocorticoids in DMD.

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Muscle function**: Vamorolone shows comparable efficacy to prednisone/deflazacort in preserving muscle strength and function, including time to stand, 6-minute walk distance, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment scores [^112QsSDC] [^116eLG87] [^114j3spV].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Up to 30 months of treatment maintains muscle function similar to glucocorticoids, with no significant decline in timed function tests or NSAA scores [^116VZWpH] [^114j3spV].

- **Durability**: Efficacy is sustained over 48 weeks, with 6 mg/kg/day maintaining improvements across motor outcomes [^1147rNVY] [^112uFQCc].

---

## Safety profile

- **Growth**: Vamorolone causes significantly less growth stunting than prednisone, with stable height percentiles and improved linear growth velocity [^114asjMb] [^115LThS9] [^116VZWpH].

- **Bone health**: Unlike prednisone, vamorolone does not suppress bone turnover markers and may reduce fracture risk, supported by preclinical data [^1147rNVY] [^113pMMxf] [^115MRT8B].

- **Metabolic effects**: Vamorolone is associated with fewer metabolic side effects, including less insulin resistance and a lower risk of glucose intolerance compared to prednisone [^1177v131] [^111eK1o4].

- **Behavioral effects**: Vamorolone shows fewer behavioral disturbances, such as irritability and aggression, than prednisone [^112uFQCc] [^114T1Nqp].

---

## Adrenal suppression

Vamorolone causes **dose-dependent adrenal suppression** [^112NJyXf], though less severe than prednisone at lower doses, necessitating stress-dose hydrocortisone coverage during illness or surgery [^112j8Xkm]. Despite frequent biochemical suppression, **clinical adrenal crises were not observed** in trials with appropriate stress-dose protocols [^111SCamN] [^113sXsuB].

---

## Overall tolerability

Tolerability is favorable, with **lower rates of adverse events** than prednisone and a lower incidence of serious adverse events, supporting long-term use [^116tSmWT] [^112uFQCc]. Discontinuation rates are low, reflecting good tolerability and adherence in clinical trials [^116tSmWT] [^113PSaAa].

## Summary of advantages

| **Parameter** | **Vamorolone** | **Traditional corticosteroids** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Comparable to prednisone/deflazacort | Comparable |
| Growth suppression | Significantly less | Significant |
| Bone health | Better preserved | Suppressed turnover |
| Metabolic effects | Fewer | More frequent |
| Behavioral effects | Fewer | More frequent |
| Adrenal suppression | Dose-dependent, less at lower doses | Profound |
| Tolerability | Better | Lower |

---

Vamorolone provides **comparable efficacy** with a **superior safety profile** — particularly for growth, bone health, and metabolic and behavioral effects — relative to traditional corticosteroids, making it a promising long-term option for DMD management.

Another side-effect of corticosteroids is alterations in endocrine function including regulation of glucose metabolism. Our studies showed that all 3 corticosteroids resulted in an increase in fasting glucose levels, with no differentiation between the three at the doses tested. We did not look at insulin levels. Preclinical studies evaluating the effect of vamorolone on glucose have not been reported, although Heier et al. saw no increase in insulin in mdx mice with dosing of 30 mg/kg of vamorolone under conditions where 5 mg/kg of prednisolone elicited an increase in insulin levels. Similarly, a clinical study indicated vamorolone is associated with less insulin resistance than is prednisolone/prednisone. No preclinical or clinical studies have reported fasting glucose levels.

Another side-effect of corticosteroids is osteoporosis/osteopenia. In these studies, the three corticosteroids significantly reduced osteocalcin serum levels after 2-weeks of treatment, a biomarker of bone formation. Further, prednisolone/prednisone significantly reduced bone density measured by microCT after 4 months of treatment, with the differences induced by deflazacort and vamorolone not reaching significance. This is consistent with the Phase 2B study comparing vamorolone with prednisolone, in which vamorolone induced less stunting of growth than did prednisolone.

These results are consistent with clinical data assessing vamorolone after 2 weeks of treatment, although not with longer vamorolone clinical use. Consistent with the preclinical studies, findings from a Phase 2A study in subjects with DMD (N = 48) indicated that in humans vamorolone at 6 mg/kg/day reduced serum osteocalcin levels after 14 days of dosing by ~33%. The reduction of osteocalcin levels from baseline with the lower 2 mg/kg/day dose tested was not significant. In a Phase 2b 24-week study in DMD boys found osteocalcin levels were minimally reduced with 6 mg/kg vamorolone treatment (0.17%) and significantly reduced (15%) with 0.75 mg/kg prednisone. Similarly, an open-label, multiple ascending dose study in boys with DMD (N = 48) also found no significant change was observed with the 6.0 mg/kg/day dose. Potentially, vamorolone may have a better bone safety profile than prednisolone/prednisone.

Height percentile declined in prednisone-treated, but not vamorolone-treated, participants (change from baseline [SD]: prednisone −1.88 [8.81] percentile vs vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, +3.86 [6.16] percentile; p = 0.02). There was linear growth delay in the prednisone group but not in the vamorolone groups (vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs prednisone; LSM difference, 4.98; 95% CI, 0.75–9.21; p = 0.02) (Table 2), consistent with 2.5-year open-label data. The vamorolone and prednisone groups showed similar overall gain in body mass index (increase of 0.4–0.5 body mass index z score over the 24-week treatment period), with high intragroup variability (Table 2).

Two participants had 3 prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline. There were 2 treatment-emergent vertebral fractures at week 24; 1 participant in the prednisone group had a total of 4 incident vertebral fractures, and 1 participant in the placebo group had a single incident vertebral fracture. All vertebral fractures observed in this trial were mild (Genant grade 1) and in the thoracic region. There were no incident long-bone fractures reported. For dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, only total body lean mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) for the prednisone group (n = 24) vs the vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, group (n = 18) of 18 comparisons showed significance that survived post hoc adjustment for multiple testing (LSM [SE], vamorolone, 2.61 [1.42] vs prednisone 9.62 [1.29]; unadjusted P < .001; Bonferroni-Holm adjusted P = 0.007) in favor of prednisone.

Primary End Point

All end points were prespecified in the study protocol and SAP (Supplements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). The primary end point of change from baseline to week 24 for TTSTAND velocity for vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo was met (LSM [SE] velocity, 0.05 [0.01] m/s vs −0.01 [0.01] m/s; LSM difference, 0.06 m/s; 95% CI, 0.02–0.10 m/s; p = 0.002) (modified intention-to-treat [mITT] population) (Figure 2, Table 2). The placebo group showed a stable course with a slight decline relative to baseline, whereas the vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, group vs placebo showed improvement by 6 weeks of treatment (LSM [SE] velocity, 0.03 [0.01] m/s vs 0 [0.01] m/s; LSM difference, 0.03 m/s; 95% CI, 0.01–0.06 m/s; p = 0.02), continued improvement to 12 weeks of treatment (LSM [SE] velocity, 0.04 [0.01] m/s vs −0.01 [0.01] m/s; LSM difference, 0.02 m/s; 95% CI, 0.02–0.08 m/s; p = 0.001), and maintained to 24 weeks of treatment. Analyses of the mITT population (n = 117) vs per protocol population (n = 113) led to similar findings.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^117TZF7j]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked, progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by out-of-frame pathogenic variants in the DMD gene. DMD is a rare disease affecting approximately 1 in 5,050 male births. The standard of care is treatment with daily oral corticosteroids (CS; e.g. prednisone, deflazacort), which has been consistently shown to delay loss of ambulation and other motor abilities. However, chronic treatment with CS causes growth stunting, weight gain, mood disturbances, adrenal insufficiency, Cushing syndrome, low bone density, fragility fractures, etc. which can preclude treatment with recommended doses. The efforts of families and physicians to balance the efficacy with safety concerns leads to major variations in clinical practice.

Vamorolone is a first-in-class, dissociative, steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has shown similar efficacy and reduced safety concerns when compared with CS in both double-blind placebo-controlled and open-label trials. Vamorolone lacks a 11β hydroxy-carbonyl group, found in all 30+ CS drugs, which removes a contact site with the target glucocorticoid receptor and modifies structure/activity relationships. As well, vamorolone is not a substrate for 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase regulatory enzymes, which are known to mediate CS-associated bone morbidities in mice. Furthermore, in contrast to all CS, vamorolone is a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^111SCamN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

We defined adrenal suppression as a cortisol peak at both 30 and 60 minutes < 500 nmol/L (18.1 ng/dL) for our first analysis, based on historical thresholds. For our second analysis, we defined adrenal suppression as a cortisol peak at both 30 and 60 minutes < 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL). The threshold for our second analysis was based on recent studies of second-generation cortisol assays that propose a threshold of between 350 and 414 nmol/L (12.7–15 ng/dL) due to greater specificity of the monoclonal assays for serum cortisol; 400 nmol/L was chosen as it was within the higher end of the suggested threshold values, providing a more conservative revised threshold. In addition, the use of a threshold at the higher end of the proposed range was supported by previous pediatric studies suggesting that younger children have higher ACTH-stimulated cortisol peaks than adults.

In the study protocol, all participants received education plus emergency medical cards outlining a management plan for adrenal suppression, which outlined glucocorticoid stress dosing during times of moderate illness, injury, or surgery. The protocol also included daily glucocorticoid replacement after discontinuation of the study medication at week 48 until results of first morning and ACTH stimulation testing were available to determine the status of the HPA axis. Ongoing glucocorticoid replacement for adrenal suppression was directed at the discretion of the managing physician at each local site. Serum albumin and total protein levels were analyzed for all participants.

Conclusions

We found that vamorolone, a novel dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was not associated with a change in TTSTAND velocity from baseline to 30 months among boys with DMD aged 4 to 7 at enrollment. However, vamorolone was associated with similar efficacy and maintenance of muscle function comparable to historical cohorts of patients with DMD treated with GC after treatment for 30 months. Vamorolone appeared to be well-tolerated, with fewer safety concerns that are typically seen with standard-of-care GC treatment for ambulatory patients with DMD. A randomized double-blind vamorolone study (VBP15–004; NCT03439670) is near completion; results from this study will provide class I evidence for vamorolone efficacy and safety.

### Relationship between growth and ambulation loss in Duchenne muscular dystrophy boys on steroids [^111PZPBn]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In GC‐treated individuals, DMD‐associated higher weight is compounded by GC‐treatment‐associated weight gain, which has been attributed to increased appetite and sodium and fluid retention. Some observational studies have identified a significantly lower percentage of body fat or lower weight gain in deflazacort‐treated individuals compared to prednisone/prednisolone, although this finding is not universal. Here, a participant with a yearly weight gain of 0.25SD had a significant 90% increase in risk of loss of ambulation. To contextualize this risk, 27% of our participants were observed to have a weight gain trajectory of more than 0.25SD per year. Notably, increased weight where a participant followed their centile was not associated with an increased risk of loss of ambulation, but any weight gain trajectory was associated with an increased risk of loss of ambulation. Finally, a BMI trend consistent with a yearly gain of 0.25SD was associated with a significant increase in risk of loss of ambulation of 66%. However, absolute growth SD values did not have a significant effect on loss of ambulation risk.

It will be important to understand if there is an underlying reason why excess growth could lead to increased risk of loss of ambulation, or if a differential biological mechanism of the GC is responsible. Here, controlling for the differential effect of GC type and regimen on growth outcomes resulted in little difference in the risk of loss of ambulation between the GC groups. Although our results should be interpreted with caution, as they are not accompanied by investigations of the long‐term molecular, cellular and tissue effects of the two GC types on muscles, they may partly explain the differential effect of deflazacort over prednisolone on loss of ambulation. This is particularly pertinent as there are ongoing investigations into alternative steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs like vamorolone, which has been shown to have significantly lower rates of height stunting in DMD.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^112tMTAh]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disabling X-linked recessive disorder that causes gradual and irreversible loss of muscle, resulting in early death. The corticosteroids prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort are used to treat DMD as the standard of care; however, only deflazacort is FDA approved for DMD. The novel atypical corticosteroid vamorolone is being investigated for treatment of DMD. We compared the pharmaceutical properties as well as the efficacy and safety of the three corticosteroids across multiple doses in the B10-mdx DMD mouse model. Pharmacokinetic studies in the mouse and evaluation of p-glycoprotein (P-gP) efflux in a cellular system demonstrated that vamorolone is not a strong P-gp substrate resulting in measurable central nervous system (CNS) exposure in the mouse. In contrast, deflazacort and prednisolone are strong P-gp substrates. All three corticosteroids showed efficacy, but also side effects at efficacious doses. After dosing mdx mice for two weeks, all three corticosteroids induced changes in gene expression in the liver and the muscle, but prednisolone and vamorolone induced more changes in the brain than did deflazacort. Both prednisolone and vamorolone induced depression-like behavior. All three corticosteroids reduced endogenous corticosterone levels, increased glucose levels, and reduced osteocalcin levels. Using micro-computed tomography, femur bone density was decreased, reaching significance with prednisolone. The results of these studies indicate that efficacious doses of vamorolone, are associated with similar side effects as seen with other corticosteroids. Further, because vamorolone is not a strong P-gp substrate, vamorolone distributes into the CNS increasing the potential CNS side-effects.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. The open-label study design and use of prospectively collected real-world observational control data sets with different GCs (ie, prednisone or deflazacort), dose, and regimen (ie, daily or intermittent as per clinical practice,) require cautious interpretation of the study results. The comparator data sets included patients with DMD who had been on GC for a variable amount of time before the baseline comparator visits. There was also considerable attrition in the data of participants in comparator groups over time (eg, 91.3% of participants in LTE vs 40.0% of participants in DNHS had > 18 months of follow-up data for TTSTAND velocity). Despite strict subset enrollment criteria and adjustment for baseline characteristics, confounding is still possible. We could not look for association between height and motor function among patients treated with vamorolone and GC owing to the nonrandomized study design and small sample size; the risk of adrenal insufficiency will require additional studies.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^111t5RtJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this study are the relatively large number of pediatric clinical trial participants with ACTH stimulation tests pre- and posttreatment on prednisone and vamorolone but also on placebo. As such, this study allowed us to assess the impact of vamorolone on the HPA axis relative to classic glucocorticoid therapy and also provided a serendipitous opportunity to shed light on the nuances related to a revised cortisol threshold in a steroid-naïve pediatric population when using a second-generation assay to evaluate the HPA axis.

Limitations of our study included the small size of the crossover groups and a protocol that allowed for the ascertainment of unstimulated, morning cortisol levels up to 10in the morning, which is within the timing associated with the thresholds provided by the assay's label but is later in the day than 9:00which has been demonstrated in previous studies to have high specificity in the prediction of stimulated cortisol levels; this may have led to lower than anticipated morning cortisol values. That said, the morning cortisol levels were found to be highly correlated with the diagnostic ACTH stimulation test results of the same glucocorticoid-treated participants. Further studies are needed to evaluate the duration of adrenal suppression following withdrawal of vamorolone, which may be different from classic glucocorticoid therapy given the alternative mechanisms of action of this novel drug. Additional studies are also needed to define optimal cortisol thresholds for the evaluation of adrenal insufficiency in children without DMD and in other age groups when using second-generation immunoassays.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^116NCKxR]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Participants were randomized at a 2:2:1:1:1:1 ratio to the following 6 groups: vamorolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d throughout, vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d throughout, prednisone at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/d (period 1) crossover to vamorolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d or to vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d (period 2), and placebo (period 1) crossover to vamorolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d or to vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d (period 2), respectively. Hence, period 1 involved 4 treatment groups. After period 1, there was a 4-week transition period for participants who received either placebo or prednisone in period 1, during which the dose of prednisone (or placebo for prednisone) was tapered to zero. Participants who crossed over received vamorolone for the last 20 weeks (eFigure 1).

The study was designed by integrating the advice received from the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration before starting the study. Details on sample size determination (powered for efficacy compared with placebo after 24 weeks of treatment [period 1]), stratified randomization (age younger than 6 years vs 6 years or older), multiple testing considerations through prespecified sequential testing process, and blinding through double-dummy design have previously been reportedand are in eMethods. Analyses through 48 weeks of treatment were prespecified in a Statistical Analysis Plan (eMethods).

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a 30-month nonrandomized controlled open-label extension trial [^116VZWpH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Vamorolone is a synthetic steroidal drug with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Initial open-label, multiple ascending dose-finding studies of vamorolone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) found significant motor function improvement after 6 months treatment in higher-dose (ie, ≥ 2.0 mg/kg/d) groups.

Objective

To investigate outcomes after 30 months of open-label vamorolone treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted by the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group at 11 US and non-US study sites. Participants were 46 boys ages 4.5 to 7.5 years with DMD who completed the 6-month dose-finding study. Data were analyzed from July 2020 through November 2021.

Interventions

Participants were enrolled in a 24-month, long-term extension (LTE) study with vamorolone dose escalated to 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/d.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in time-to-stand (TTSTAND) velocity from dose-finding baseline to end of LTE study was the primary outcome. Efficacy assessments included timed function tests, 6-minute walk test, and NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA). Participants with DMD treated with glucocorticoids from the Duchenne Natural History Study (DNHS) and NorthStar United Kingdom (NSUK) Network were matched and compared with participants in the LTE study receiving higher doses of vamorolone.

Results

Among 46 boys with DMD who completed the dose-finding study, 41 boys (mean [SD] age, 5.33 [0.96] years) completed the LTE study. Among 21 participants treated with higher-dose (ie, ≥ 2.0 mg/kg/d) vamorolone consistently throughout the 6-month dose-finding and 24-month LTE studies with data available at 30 months, there was a decrease in mean (SD) TTSTAND velocity from baseline to 30 months (0.206 [0.070] rises/s vs 0.189 (0.124) rises/s), which was not a statistically significant change (-0.011 rises/s; CI, -0.068 to 0.046 rises/s). There were no statistically significant differences between participants receiving higher-dose vamorolone and matched participants in the historical control groups receiving glucocorticoid treatment (75 patients in DNHS and 110 patients in NSUK) over a 2-year period in NSAA total score change (0.22 units vs NSUK; 95% CI, -4.48 to 4.04]; p = 0.92), body mass index z score change (0.002 vs DNHS SD/mo; 95% CI, -0.006 to 0.010; p = 0.58), or timed function test change. Vamorolone at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/d was well tolerated, with 5 of 46 participants discontinuing prematurely and for reasons not associated with study drug. Participants in the DNHS treated with glucocorticoids had significant growth delay in comparison with participants treated with vamorolone who had stable height percentiles (0.37 percentile/mo; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.52 percentile/mo) over time.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that vamorolone treatment was not associated with a change in TTSTAND velocity from baseline to 30 months among boys with DMD aged 4 to 7 years at enrollment. Vamorolone was associated with maintenance of muscle strength and function up to 30 months, similar to standard of care glucocorticoid therapy, and improved height velocity compared with growth deceleration associated with glucocorticoid treatment, suggesting that vamorolone may be an attractive candidate for treatment of DMD.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^115ecWZu]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Although deflazacort, prednisolone, and vamorolone have all shown efficacy in both preclinical mouse models of DMD and in clinical trials, no studies have systematically compared all three corticosteroids side by side for efficacy and safety. The objective of the series of studies reported here was to compare the efficacy and safety of the three corticosteroids across multiple doses (Fig. 2). We evaluated a range of biochemical and functional measures in three studies, two studies in B10-mdx mice comparing all 3 corticosteroids and one study in wildtype mice comparing vamorolone and prednisolone. Our results show that while all three corticosteroids reduce pathology in the mdx DMD mouse, at the doses associated with efficacy in the mdx mouse these drugs also exhibit biochemical changes associated with side-effects.

### Update in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy [^114HmtcX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to highlight updates in the standard of care recommendations for DMD, and to describe approaches to and recent advances in genetic therapies for DMD.

Recent Findings

Treatment of DMD patients with the corticosteroids prednisone or deflazacort remains the standard of care, and recent data shows that early treatment (as young as 5 months) with a weekend dosing regimen results in measurable improvement in motor outcomes. A mutation-specific therapy directed at restoring an open reading frame by skipping exon 51 is FDA-approved, and therapies directed at other exons are in trials. Gene replacement therapy shows significant promise in animal models, and trials are underway. Genome editing has received significant attention because of results in animal models, but challenges to implementation in humans remain.

Summary

The mainstay of treatment remains meeting well defined standards of care that have been shown to influence morbidity and mortality. These include use of systemic steroids, early nocturnal ventilatory support, appropriate cardiac care and prophylaxis, and wherever appropriate, scoliosis surgery. Early and accurate molecular diagnosis, along with appropriate and multidisciplinary care, provides the best opportunity for maximum benefit of both current standard and upcoming novel therapies for boys with DMD. Among the most promising of these is AAV-based gene replacement therapy, which is currently in clinical trials.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^114C82eq]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

The novel corticosteroid, vamorolone, is being investigated for the treatment of DMD and is described as an anti-inflammatory steroid with fewer side-effects. Vamorolone has been reported to have favorable anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting NF-κB while being "dissociated" from side effects by not activating GRE-mediated transcripts. Vamorolone lacks a 11β-hydroxyl/carbonyl moiety on the steroidal C-ring resulting in the loss of one of the five known sites of corticosteroid ligand binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. Because of this altered interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor, the vamorolone-glucocorticoid receptor complex shows reduced binding to GREs in cellular assays. Vamorolone therapy was reported to be efficacious with reduced side effects in the mdx mouse model of DMD and in DMD clinical trials. The mdx mouse studies, which assessed doses between 5 and 45 mg/kg, found vamorolone promoted repair of skeletal muscle cells following laser injury through anti-inflammatory signaling and membrane stabilization pathways and had little effect on hormonal regulation, growth, or immunosuppression. The drug was most active at doses ≥ 20 mg/kg. Vamorolone was found to be a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, while prednisolone was shown to be a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist. In contrast, deflazacort had no effect on mineralocorticoid receptor signaling.

In a Phase 2A clinical trial, boys, aged 4.5 to 7.5 years with DMD were treated for 2 weeks at 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg vamorolone followed by a 2-week washout period. Following the washout period, subjects could join a 24-week extension dose finding study followed by a long-term 24-month extension study. After 30 months of treatment of the combined dose finding and long-term extension studies, subjects treated with the higher dose vamorolone showed no statistically significant difference between the vamorolone treated patients and matched natural history control group receiving corticosteroid therapy in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score, timed-function tests, or body mass index. Vamorolone up to 6.0 mg/kg/day was well tolerated. Subjects in the natural history control group showed significant growth delay compared with participants receiving vamorolone. This was confirmed in Ph2B/3 trial comparing vamorolone and prednisolone. In that study, vamorolone showed equal or better efficacy and less stunting of growth than did prednisolone.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of vamorolone in human milk or the effects on milk production.

AGAMREE is indicated for use for the treatment of DMD, which is a disease of young male patients. However, systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of AGAMREE for the treatment of DMD have been established in patients 2 years of age and older. Use of AGAMREE in pediatric patients is supported by a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study in 121 males 4 to less than 7 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Use of AGAMREE in patients 2 years to less than 4 years of age and 7 to less than 18 years of age is supported by findings of efficacy and safety in patients 4 to less than 7 years of age with DMD, and by pharmacokinetic and safety data from patients 2 to 4 years of age and 7 to less than 18 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

Oral administration of vamorolone (0, 15, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day) to juvenile mice from postnatal days 21 to 81 resulted in no adverse effects on neurobehavioral function, sexual maturation, or reproductive function. Atrophy of the adrenal cortex, degeneration/necrosis of the liver, and decreased lymphocytes in lymphatic tissues were observed at all doses. A no-effect dose for general toxicity was not identified. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the lowest dose tested (15 mg/kg/day) were lower than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (300 mg/day).

8.5 Geriatric Use

DMD is largely a disease of children and young adults; therefore, there is no geriatric experience with AGAMREE.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^1144zis1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

The primary study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and prednisone-controlled trial of vamorolone in 121 (safety population period 1; n = 118) steroid-naïve, ambulatory boys, age 4 to < 7 years of age with genetically confirmed DMD (NCT03439670). The full study protocol and statistical analysis have been published previously. Treatment period 1 (hereafter referred to as period 1) involved a 24-week comparison that included 4 treatment arms (vamorolone 2 m/kg/day, vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, and placebo), with primary efficacy and safety outcomes conducted between June 29, 2018, and February 24, 2021, as previously reported. While maintaining the blind, treatment period 2 (hereafter referred to as period 2) followed a tapered washout for the prednisone and placebo groups (ie, from 24 to 28 weeks). This 4-week washout period was then followed by 20 weeks of allocation to vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day or vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day plus continuation of the period 1 vamorolone groups. The clinical trial results from period 2 have been recently published.

Participants

Within the multicenter trial, boys with genetically confirmed DMD who were 4 to younger than 7 years of age were enrolled. Boys were excluded if they had any previous or current systemic oral glucocorticoid exposure; boys with a history of topical or inhaled glucocorticoid use within the past 4 weeks were excluded unless anticipated to be treated on a stable dose throughout the duration of the study follow-up. Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria have been published elsewhere. The trial was approved by the competent ethics committee at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.

### Current concepts in the orthopaedic management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^113mRrdA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Scoliosis is common in patients with DMD. During ambulatory stages, corticosteroid treatment may prolong time to LoA. Treatment with deflazacort had better outcomes with respect to slowing curve progression and muscle strength when compared with prednisone, but adverse effects should be closely monitored. Scoliosis tends to develop during nonambulatory, wheelchair-bound, phases, with flexible curves progressing to rigid curves. At this stage, management is primarily surgical with spinal fusion, which can provide a survival benefit to patients. Factors like timing of surgery, level of fusion, and type of bone graft can be considered on an individual basis. Still, there are limited data on the management of scoliosis in patients with DMD. This article outlines the current paradigm of treatment based on the current evidence.

### Approach to the pediatric patient with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^115MRT8B]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Although gene and genetic therapies are now approved in some countries for the treatment of DMD, none of the advanced treatments are robust enough to recommend the removal of GC therapy from the therapeutic regimen. This means that GC therapy is here to stay for the foreseeable future in DMD, placing an onus on the pediatric osteology community to work with DMD partners to improve the aggressive pGIO that currently is present in this condition.

Researchers have investigated whether intermittent prednisone (10 days on, 10 days off) are bone- and growth-plate protective in boys with DMD. The short answer is yes (fewer prevalent vertebral fractures), but at a cost to muscle strength relative to daily prednisone. Vamorolone, a novel dissociative steroidal drug, has been developed in an effort to "separate the good from the bad". In a recent randomized, placebo- and prednisone-controlled clinical trial (NCT03439670) in ambulatory boys with DMD, vamorolone showed comparable efficacy for muscle function relative to daily prednisone, plus improved linear height velocity and bone turnover markers. Preliminary, post hoc analyses also suggest vertebral fracture rates may be lower; the impact on long bone fractures related to prednisone remains unknown. However, vamorolone also caused dose-dependent adrenal suppression, a critical message to convey given the life-threatening nature of this co-morbidity.

### Novel approaches to corticosteroid treatment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112NhU8P]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Although prednisone has never been formally approved for use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by regulatory agencies, its efficacy has been confirmed in trials dating from the 1980s. There is a strong need for optimization of both specific type of glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone, vs deflazacort or others) and the dosing regimen. Ideally an optimized regimen would maximize efficacy while minimizing side-effect profiles. A new trial, FOR-DMD, aims to address this gap in knowledge. In parallel, there has been progress in the area of "dissociative steroids", drugs that are able to better separate efficacy and side effects, providing a broader therapeutic window.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone vs placebo and prednisone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^112yhhdc]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder affecting 1 in 3600 to 9300 male newborns. Treatment with oral corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort) delays loss of ambulation, but long-term corticosteroid treatment causes weight gain, stunting of growth, osteoporosis, mood disturbances, adrenal insufficiency, and other safety concerns leading to poor adherence to practice guidelines.

Vamorolone is a first-in-class dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that binds to the same target receptors as the corticosteroid class (glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor), but shows a distinct chemical structure and differences in mechanism of action. Vamorolone shows less positive gene transcriptional activity (transactivation) than corticosteroids but retains inhibition of nuclear factor κB proinflammatory pathways (transrepression). Vamorolone uniquely lacks a 11β-hydroxyl/carbonyl moiety on the steroidal C ring, changing structure and activity relationships with the receptors. Further, vamorolone cannot be acted on by modulatory 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes known to be necessary for mediating corticosteroid-associated bone morbidities in mice. Lastly, vamorolone is a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, whereas most corticosteroids are agonists.

First-in-patient, open-label, dose-ranging studies of vamorolone in DMD (n = 48) suggested improvements in motor outcomes similar to corticosteroids, without stunting of growth over a 2.5-year treatment period, compared with external corticosteroid-treated comparators. In the study reported here, we present results of a pivotal 24-week double-blind, placebo- and prednisone- controlled clinical efficacy and safety trial of vamorolone in boys 4 to younger than 7 years of age with DMD who were not previously treated with corticosteroids.

Abstract

Context

Vamorolone, a novel "dissociative" steroid, demonstrated similar efficacy in muscle function relative to prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day but improved linear growth and bone turnover markers in a randomized trial of pediatric Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Objectives

To determine the frequency of adrenal suppression (AS) induced by vamorolone and prednisone in pediatric DMD and to assess cortisol thresholds using a monoclonal antibody immunoassay.

Methods

Post hoc analysis of cortisol levels was performed on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and prednisone-controlled 24-week trial of vamorolone with a 24-week crossover extension. Morning and ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels were measured using the Elecsys II immunoassay, with AS defined as a stimulated cortisol of < 500 nmol/L ("historical threshold") and < 400 nmol/L ("revised threshold").

Results

Mean age at enrolment was 5.41 ± 0.86 years (n = 118). At week 24, the proportion of participants with AS using the historical and revised cortisol thresholds, respectively, were as follows: prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day = 100% (25/25) and 92.0% (23/25); vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day = 95.2% (20/21) and 90.5% (19/21); vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day = 84.2% (16/19) and 47.5% (9/19); and placebo = 20.0% (4/20) and 0% (0/20). Morning and peak ACTH-stimulated cortisol were strongly correlated in steroid-treated boys (Spearman correlation week 48 = 0.83).

Conclusion

AS after vamorolone and prednisone was frequent and vamorolone-associated AS appeared dose-dependent. A lower stimulated cortisol threshold may be appropriate when using a monoclonal assay. We recommend hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid stress dosing in patients receiving vamorolone.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of AGAMREE for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled, multinational 24-week study (Study 1; NCT03439670). The study randomized 121 male patients with DMD to one of the following treatment groups: AGAMREE 6 mg/kg/day (n = 30), AGAMREE 2 mg/kg/day (n = 30), prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day (n = 31), or placebo (n = 30) for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, patients on prednisone and placebo received either AGAMREE 6 mg/kg/day (n = 29) or AGAMREE 2 mg/kg/day (n = 29) for an additional 20 weeks. The study included patients 4 to less than 7 years of age at time of enrollment in the study who were corticosteroid naïve and ambulatory, with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD. At baseline, patients had a mean age of 5.4 years, 83% were Caucasian, 10% were Asian, and 96% were not Hispanic or Latino.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in Time to Stand Test (TTSTAND) velocity for AGAMREE 6 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. TTSTAND velocity is a measure of muscle function that measures the time required for the patient to stand to an erect position from a supine position (floor). The key secondary endpoints consisted of change from baseline to Week 24 in TTSTAND velocity (AGAMREE 2 mg/kg/day vs placebo), 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) distance (AGAMREE 6 mg/kg/day vs placebo and 2 mg/kg/day vs placebo) and Time to Run/Walk 10 meters (TTRW) velocity (AGAMREE 6 mg/kg/day vs placebo and 2 mg/kg/day vs placebo). The 6MWT measures the distance that a patient can walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes and TTRW measures the time that it takes a patient to run or walk 10 meters. The fixed sequential testing process was applied to the key secondary endpoints in the order listed above.

### Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function [^117TQ1rT]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Analysis of efficacy

Baseline characteristics for the 4 ascending-dose groups and the external CINRG DNHS comparator (steroid naive and prednisone treated) are shown in table 1. All comparisons to external comparators were limited to patients age 4 to < 7 years (same inclusion criteria as the vamorolone trial). Two patients withdrew from the vamorolone study for reasons unrelated to vamorolone treatment (1 taking 0.25 mg/kg/d, 1 taking 6.0 mg/kg/d).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics

The primary efficacy endpoint was TTSTAND velocity (rises per second) change from VBP15–002 baseline to VBP15–003 week 24 for the vamorolone group compared to the untreated DNHS control group. Mean changes from baseline to weeks 12 and 24 showed dose- and time-related increases, with greater increases observed for the 2.0– and 6.0–mg/kg/d groups and greater increases at week 24 compared to week 12 (figure 1, table 2, and supplemental table 3 available from Dryad). The mean difference in change from baseline to week 24 was significant for comparison of the 2.0–mg/kg/d group to the untreated DNHS cohort (p = 0.04). The mean difference in change from baseline to week 24 was also significant for the comparison of the 2.0– and 6.0–mg/kg/d groups to the 0.25–mg/kg/d group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively).

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^111YG4vv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to a binary threshold-based analysis at week 24, we carried out comparisons using the measured numerical values using MMRM across the duration of the study. Stimulated peak cortisol values in the placebo group were higher than in all the active treatment groups at 24 weeks [all comparisons P < .0001; Fig. 3, Table 2, Supplement 5]. There was a nonsignificant difference in stimulated peak cortisol values with prednisone values trending lower compared with the vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day group (P = 0.063; LSM difference = 77.4 nmol/L, 95% CI = −4.2 to 159 nmol/L). Stimulated peak cortisol values were lower in the vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day group compared with the vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day group (P < .0001; LSM difference = 191 nmol/L, 95% CI = 109 to 273 nmol/L) and with the prednisone group (P = 0.003; LSM difference = 113 nmol/L, 95% CI = 38.8 to 188 nmol/L).

At 48 weeks, there was no further significant decrease in cortisol peaks compared to 24 weeks for the vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day (P = 0.30) and vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day (P = 0.26) groups. There was no significant difference in peak cortisol values for participants who switched from prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day to vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day (P = 0.218) or for participants switching from prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day (P = 0.099). As expected, based on period 1 results, the placebo to vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day and 6 mg/kg/day groups both demonstrated a significant decrease in cortisol peak at week 48 [P < .0001; Fig. 2 and Supplement 5].

Corticosteroids in DMD — use patterns, potential benefits, and recommendations are outlined. The statement notes that "Oral corticosteroids have been found to increase muscle mass and retard muscle deterioration in patients with DMD", and that in most studies therapy "was initiated between 5 and 15 years of age, and at an average of approximately 8 years of age". It adds that "Deflazacort, an oxazoline derivative of prednisone, has been shown to have similar benefits to prednisone, with possibly fewer side effects", and that "Boys who received deflazacort maintain ambulation longer and have significant sparing of pulmonary function". Recommendations emphasize that "Future research is required to confirm and further define the potential pulmonary benefits of oral steroids", and that "Decisions to start oral steroid therapy to help preserve lung function should be made in collaboration with the neuromuscular specialist and other members of the multidisciplinary care team and the family".

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a 30-month nonrandomized controlled open-label extension trial [^111eK1o4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The results of this nonrandomized clinical trial extend the findings of previous reports on open-label vamorolone treatment among boys with DMD to a total treatment duration of 30 months. We found that vamorolone treatment was not associated with a change in TTSTAND velocity from baseline to 30 months among boys with DMD aged 4 to 7 years at enrollment. However, based on clinical and laboratory results, long-term vamorolone treatment at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/d appeared to be safe and well-tolerated. While there was an overall decline after initial improvement in TTSTAND velocity observed among boys treated with vamorolone over 2 years, vamorolone showed similar treatment efficacy as GC in DMD, and the decline was slower compared with that of untreated patients. Moreover, participants receiving higher doses (ie, ≥ 2 mg/kg/d) of vamorolone had persistent improvement in motor function as measured by TTCLIMB, TTRW, NSAA, and 6MWT distance over a 30-month treatment period.

Vamorolone treatment was associated with fewer adverse outcomes compared with GC therapy. Continuous treatment with vamorolone for up to 30 months was not associated with linear growth deceleration, whereas growth delay is a well-recognized adverse outcome associated with traditional GC, which can be distressing to boys with DMD as they mature through adolescence. We observed that boys treated with vamorolone had minimal bone age delay relative to chronological age. In this setting of improved growth velocity with vamorolone, the slight bone age delay is anticipated to be favorable for these patients to attain increased adult height associated with greater residual growth potential. Although some participants receiving high-dose vamorolone had dose reduction to address undesired weight gain, the change in mean BMI z score was not significantly different between participants receiving vamorolone compared with participants in DNHS receiving GC. To date, pharmacodynamic biomarker data suggest that vamorolone is not associated with short-term detrimental bone outcomes. Additionally, vamorolone does not have the same association with insulin resistance as classic GC therapy; however, long-term vamorolone treatment may be associated with adrenal suppression.

### Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function [^112gGKmk]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The potent anti-inflammatory efficacy of an adrenal steroid, 17-hydroxy-11-dehydrocorticosterone, was first reported in 14 patients with arthritis in 1949, and the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was quickly awarded. Glucocorticoid treatment is effective for many inflammatory disorders; however, long-term treatment is associated with significant adverse effects. These are particularly problematic in the very young and the elderly.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disorder caused by dystrophin deficiency in muscle. Glucocorticoids are the standard of care for DMD, delaying loss of ambulation caused by this condition for 2 to 4 years, Activation of the proinflammatory nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, the target of glucocorticoids, is seen soon after birth in muscle of patients with DMD.

Vamorolone is a novel drug that appears to optimize traditional steroidal anti-inflammatory activities: transactivation (gene transcription via GRE-mediated binding of ligand/receptor dimers) is lost; transrepression (NF-κB inhibition anti-inflammatory activity) is retained; physiochemical membrane stabilization properties are improved; and mineralocorticoid receptor activity is changed from agonist to antagonist. Studies of vamorolone in animal models of chronic inflammatory states, including DMD mouse models, have shown retention of anti-inflammatory efficacy and loss of adverse effects compared to prednisolone. The retention of anti-inflammatory efficacy and loss of side effects in preclinical models are consistent with vamorolone blocking NF-κB–associated proinflammatory signals as a ligand/receptor monomeric state instead of the traditional molecular models of ligand/receptor dimeric complexes. A phase 1 study of vamorolone in healthy adult menand a 2-week treatment, 2-week washout, 4-week phase 2a study in patients with DMDshowed an improved profile of typical glucocorticoid-like safety concerns as measured by serum biomarkers after 2 weeks of treatment. Vamorolone showed pharmacokinetics and metabolism similar to those of corticosteroids and is similarly administered with daily oral dosing. The 48 patients with DMD enrolled in the 4 week phase 2a study (VBP15–002) were then enrolled in a 24-week extension study (VBP15–003) to test for drug efficacy, and the latter study is reported here.

### The role of corticosteroids in muscular dystrophy: a critical appraisal [^116fqUPd]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

Over the years various steroid trials have been conducted in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In children who are still able to walk as well as in those who are wheelchair-bound, corticosteroids have been found to stabilize muscle strength for a period of time. Controlled clinical observations have shown that some boys remain ambulatory for years longer than reported in natural history data. The two main steroids used are prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort. They are probably equally effective in stabilizing muscle strength but may have different side-effect profiles; for instance, deflazacort causes less weight gain. The exact mechanism by which steroids slow the dystrophic process is under investigation. DMD children treated long term also seem to develop other complications of the condition less frequently. For instance, they develop respiratory insufficiency later and have fewer cardiac symptoms. The therapeutic value of corticosteroids is limited, but these drugs represent the best treatment option currently available.

### Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function [^114TaUe4]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

A limitation of this trial is the open-label, nonrandomized, non–placebo-controlled design considered Class IV evidence. However, it is unlikely that a placebo effect resulted in the findings reported here for the following reasons. First, the study design included a 24-fold dose range of vamorolone, and all drug responsive data were found to fit dose-response curves for efficacy and safety. Second, this first-in-patient study estimated a sample size needed to detect a difference from steroid-naive patients from a natural history study, and a prednisone trialin the same narrow age range; therefore, the study was powered for detection of both efficacy and safety outcomes with 48 patients (12 per dose group). Third, the vamorolone trial was conducted by the CINRG academic clinical trial network, which also conducted the comparator natural history and prednisone studies using similar outcome measures and training protocols for clinical evaluators. Fourth, the results for the low-dose vamorolone groups (0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/d) were similar to results of the untreated natural history comparator group. Finally, we used multiple serum biomarkers in multiple contexts of use as objective outcome measures for both safety (bone turnover, insulin resistance, and adrenal suppression) and efficacy (exploratory pharmacodynamics). All showed clear dose responses within this dose-ranging study.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^111c4WPJ]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids provide benefit in patients with DMD by reducing inflammation. Most cytokines are regulated by NF-κB, but some other factors are regulated by GRE sites. The three corticosteroids all reduced proinflammatory cytokines produced by cultured primary bone-derived mouse macrophages (i.e. IFN-γ, IL-10, Il-1β, and IL-12) via the NF-κB-dependent pathway, but all three corticosteroids also induced protein regulated by directly binding GREs (i.e. STAT expression).

Corticosteroids impact leukocyte trafficking, causing increases in the levels of neutrophils and decreases in the levels of lymphocytes. Corticosteroids regulate leukocyte migration via changes in adhesion molecules and cytokines, which likely reflects inhibition of NF-κB. Consistent with this known action of these drugs, all three corticosteroids induced an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes.

All three corticosteroids showed efficacy as demonstrated by reductions in CK and cytokines. In a test of muscle strength, improvement with deflazacortrelative to vehicle reached statistical significance. In addition, differences in fibrosis in mice dosed with deflazacort and prednisolone relative to vehicle reached statistical significance.

No clinical studies have been done comparing these 3 corticosteroids side-by-side. Post-hoc evaluation of DMD trials has suggested that long-term treatment with deflazacort is more effective than prednisolone/prednisone. However, the recent trial, FOR DMD, compared deflazacort and prednisone and found no significant differences between prednisolone and deflazacort in young DMD patients who were 4 to 7 years of age. The FOR-DMD study was designed to evaluate the initial treatment effects in these young boys and not the later efficacy of these corticosteroids.

In conclusion, the findings described here indicate that prednisone/prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone have similar safety profiles in the B10-mdx DMD mouse model and are consistent with the known safety and molecular effects of corticosteroids in the clinic. Possibly, the differences between these corticosteroids can be exploited to best treat specific diseases or patients. However, given the limitations in comparing these compounds in preclinical studies, additional work would be needed to better translate these findings to the clinic.

### A randomized efficacy and safety trial of oxandrolone in the treatment of Duchenne dystrophy [^115B698B]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A pilot study suggested that oxandrolone, an anabolic steroid, improved strength in boys with Duchenne dystrophy (DD) and indicated the need for a more definitive study.

Methods

A 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oxandrolone in boys with an established diagnosis of DD, using the change from baseline to 6 months in the average muscle strength score (MMT) as the primary efficacy measure.

Results

The mean change from baseline for the oxandrolone group was +0.035 and that for the placebo group was -0.140. Although the oxandrolone group did not get worse and the placebo patients showed some deterioration in strength, the difference was not significant (p = 0.13). The average of the four quantitative muscle tests (QMT) showed a significant improvement in the oxandrolone-treated boys as compared with placebo. No adverse reactions attributable to oxandrolone were recorded.

Conclusions

Although oxandrolone did not produce a significant change in the average manual muscle strength score as compared with placebo, the mean change in QMT was significant. Because oxandrolone is safe, accelerates linear growth, and may have some beneficial effect in slowing the progress of weakness, it may be useful before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a 30-month nonrandomized controlled open-label extension trial [^114vEq7n]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

This nonrandomized clinical study and all studies contributing patients were approved by ethics committees or institutional review boards as required by the participating international academic clinical recruitment sites. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians, and assent was obtained from children recruited into each described trial. This report follows the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations With Nonrandomized Designs reporting guideline for nonrandomized studies.

The Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) conducted 3 consecutive multicenter open-label vamorolone clinical trials. Participants were recruited from 11 participating centers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Sweden, Israel, and Australia (Figure 1). The 2-week multiple-ascending-dose studyenrolled 48 boys (ages 4 to < 7 years) with DMD who were GC-naive from June 2016 to October 2017. All participants completed the initial study and were enrolled in a 24-week dose-finding trial; 2 participants subsequently withdrew for reasons unrelated to the study drug. The remaining 46 participants (ages 4.5–7.5 years) who completed the 6-month dose-finding study were eligible to enroll in a 24-month long-term extension (LTE) study, which started in February 2017 and was completed in April 2020.

Results

Among 46 boys with DMD who completed the dose-finding study, 41 participants (89.1%; baseline mean [SD] age, 5.33 [0.96] years) completed the 2-year LTE treatment period; 5 participants withdrew for reasons unrelated to the study drug (Figure 1). At the LTE month 24 visit, 11 participants, 3 participants, and 27 participants were being treated at 2.0 mg/kg/d, 4.0 mg/kg/d, and 6.0 mg/kg/d, respectively (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Analysis of treatment efficacy focused on 23 participants receiving higher-dose vamorolone who were initially assigned and maintained on 2.0 mg/kg/d or more for up to 30 months during the dose-finding study (6 months) and LTE study (24 months). Demographic and clinical characteristics of participants in the LTE study receiving higher doses are summarized in Table 1. The mean (SD) baseline age was 5.83 (0.88) years in the higher-dose LTE group. In the higher-dose LTE group, 3 participants (13.0%) withdrew before the LTE month 24 study visit. The subsets of participants receiving higher doses who completed all planned outcomes are summarized in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^117DMDZz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to our main objective of determining the impact of vamorolone and prednisone on the HPA axis up to 48 weeks in the controlled DMD study, our results provide important insights into morning cortisol and ACTH stimulation testing in children. The diagnostic cortisol threshold of < 500 nmol/L (18.1 µg/dL) or higher has been used historically for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. More recently, there has been a significant shift in cortisol testing methodology, with polyclonal antibodies that were used in the first-generation assays being replaced with monoclonal antibodies that have less cross-reactivity with other steroids in the second-generation assays; this includes the new Roche Elecsys Cortisol II immunoassay that was used in the present study.

Even prior to the studies evaluating revision of the cortisol threshold using monoclonal assays, there were limited data supporting a specific cortisol threshold in pediatrics. Studies using first-generation assays suggested that younger children may have slightly higher cortisol peaks on ACTH stimulation testing compared to adolescents and adults, though in clinical practice and within guidelines, a cortisol threshold between 440 and 600 nmol/L has been cited for use in both children and adolescents. There are a paucity of studies evaluating the differences in cortisol values on first- and second-generation assays specifically within the pediatric population, and to date, there is no clear guideline on which threshold to use in children when implementing monoclonal assays.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^115wbYKU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Morning and peak stimulated cortisol values had little association at baseline (Spearman correlation = 0.20) but were correlated among prednisone- and vamorolone-treated participants at week 24 (Spearman correlation = 0.87) and vamorolone-treated participants at week 48 (Spearman correlation = 0.83). Spearman correlations between 30- and 60-minute cortisol concentrations were stronger among the steroid-treated participants (week 24 Spearman correlation 0.98, week 48 Spearman correlation 0.99) compared to steroid-naïve participants (baseline Spearman correlation 0.87). The following linear model was created with 30-minute cortisol values to predict the 60-minute serum cortisol response using data at the 48-week visit (vamorolone-treated boys with DMD ∼ 5 to 8 years of age): y = −4.06664 + 1.16240x [intercept standard error = 3.9652, slope standard error = 0.0146]. This model had an R² = 0.9886; this corresponds to an extremely strong model fit (an R² of 1 corresponds to a perfect linear fit, with the regression line passing through each datapoint). Modeling with data at the 24-week visit yielded a similar (in terms of coefficients) equation.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a 30-month nonrandomized controlled open-label extension trial [^113XRdC5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Vamorolone is a first-in-class steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that differs from conventional GCs in lacking an 11β hydroxy-carbonyl group. This difference removes a contact site with the target glucocorticoid receptor and significantly alters structure and activity associations. Additionally, unlike GC, vamorolone is not a substrate for 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase regulatory enzymes and is a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor.

A Phase IIa 2-week (VBP15–002, NCT02760264) multiple ascending dose studyof vamorolone (developmental code name, VBP) among boys with DMD who were GC naive and aged 4 years to less than 7 years was completed in 2017. Based on clinical safety and pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis, vamorolone showed dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity. Findings from a Phase IIa 24-week (VBP15–003, NCT02760277) open-label dose-finding studysuggested efficacy of vamorolone treatment at 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d based on motor outcomes. Interim analysis at 18 months of the vamorolone open-label extension study (VBP15-LTE, NCT03038399)found ongoing improvement in motor function and a favorable safety profile. Here, we report on the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vamorolone among boys with DMD who completed the 6-month dose-finding and 24-month long-term extension trials, with a total of up to 30 months of vamorolone treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^111j47bc]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The objectives of period 2 were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous 48 weeks of vamorolone treatment (2 vs 6 mg/kg/d) and to assess vamorolone efficacy and safety in crossover participants (placebo [period 1] to vamorolone [period 2]; prednisone [period 1] to vamorolone [period 2]) (Figure 1).

Clinical and laboratory safety endpoints were assessed during screening, baseline, day 1, and week 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 28, 30, 34, 40, and 48 visits. Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were predefined based on the safety profile known for CS including gastrointestinal symptoms, immune suppression, Cushingoid features, behavior problems, weight gain, skin/hair changes, hypertension, insulin resistance, adrenal suppression and insufficiency, and fractures. Height and body mass index (BMI) z scores were also evaluated as safety endpoints. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers including morning cortisol, osteocalcin, procollagen 1 intact N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), and type 1 collagen cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX1) were collected on day 1 and weeks 12, 24, 28, 40, and 48. Bone health assessments included a DXA scan at screening, week 24, and week 48. DXA and spine x-ray assessments were performed but will be compared with an external control cohort (FOR-DMD) and reported separately. The full schedule of assessments is in the Protocol. The trial was cleared by the ethics committee at each participating institution and conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^112uFQCc]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this 48-week, placebo-controlled and prednisone-controlled randomized crossover study of vamorolone, the efficacy of vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d reported after 24 weeks of treatment vs placebowas maintained over 48 weeks of treatment for all 5 motor outcomes (TTSTANDV, 6MWD, TTRWV, NSAA, and TTCLIMBV). Treatment with the lower dose of vamorolone, 2 mg/kg/d, for 48 weeks showed some loss of the improvements seen at week 24 assessment toward baseline function for TTSTANDV and 6MWD, but stabilization of improved function relative to baseline for TTRWV, NSAA, and TTCLIMBV. For participants crossing over from prednisone (period 1) to vamorolone (period 2), efficacy was retained for those crossing over to high-dose vamorolone (6 mg/kg/d), but those crossing over to lower-dose vamorolone (2 mg/kg/d) showed more variable retention of efficacy. A delayed-start analysis of early starters vs delayed starters (initially on placebo) showed that the initial disease-modifying effect of vamorolone with early initiation was maintained over the follow-up period (although not always statistically significant). This global assessment of efficacy supports the efficacy profile of vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d, inclusive of continuous improvements in 6MWD and TTCLIMBV to the final week 48 assessment.

Vamorolone treatment was generally well tolerated at both dose levels throughout 48 weeks of treatment with a dose-dependent profile of adverse events. For participants who continued the same dose of vamorolone throughout the study, the safety profile was consistent after 24 weeks and 48 weeks of treatment. No stunting of growth was seen with either vamorolone dose, consistent with data previously presented from long-term open-label studies. In our crossover design, there was a reversal of the prednisone-related growth retardation in period 1, with significant improvement in linear growth following crossover from prednisone to either dose of vamorolone. Similarly, crossing over to vamorolone from prednisone led to rapid reversal of the prednisone-induced decline in serum bone turnover markers. Fewer behavioral problems were also observed. The dose-dependent adrenal suppression observed with vamorolone in the initial 24-week treatment stabilized and did not worsen during the second period to 48-week treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^1147rNVY]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Vamorolone is a dissociative agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor that has shown similar efficacy and reduced safety concerns in comparison with prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks and to study crossover participants (prednisone to vamorolone; placebo to vamorolone).

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and prednisone-controlled clinical trial of 2 doses of vamorolone was conducted in participants with DMD, in the ages from 4 years to younger than 7 years at baseline. The interventions were 2 mg/kg/d of vamorolone and 6 mg/kg/d of vamorolone for 48 weeks (period 1: 24 weeks + period 2: 24 weeks) and 0.75 mg/kg/d of prednisone and placebo for the first 24 weeks (before crossover). Efficacy was evaluated through gross motor outcomes and safety through adverse events, growth velocity, body mass index (BMI), and bone turnover biomarkers. This analysis focused on period 2.

Results

A total of 121 participants with DMD were randomized. Vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d showed maintenance of improvement for all motor outcomes to week 48 (e.g., for primary outcome, time to stand from supine [TTSTAND] velocity, week 24 least squares mean [LSM] [SE] 0.052 [0.0130] rises/s vs week 48 LSM [SE] 0.0446 [0.0138]). After 48 weeks, vamorolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d showed similar improvements as 6 mg/kg/d for North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) (vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d-vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d LSM [SE] 0.49 [1.14]; 95% CI -1.80 to 2.78, p = 0.67), but less improvement for other motor outcomes. The placebo to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d group showed rapid improvements after 20 weeks of treatment approaching benefit seen with 48-week 6 mg/kg/d of vamorolone treatment for TTSTAND, time to run/walk 10 m, and NSAA. There was significant improvement in linear growth after crossover in the prednisone to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d group, and rapid reversal of prednisone-induced decline in bone turnover biomarkers in both crossover groups. There was an increase in BMI after 24 weeks of treatment that then stabilized for both vamorolone groups.

Discussion

Improvements of motor outcomes seen with 6 mg/kg/d of vamorolone at 24 weeks of treatment were maintained to 48 weeks of treatment. Vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d showed better maintenance of effect compared with vamorolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d for most (3/5) motor outcomes. Bone morbidities of prednisone (stunting of growth and declines in serum bone biomarkers) were reversed when treatment transitioned to vamorolone.

Trial Registration Information

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03439670.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that for boys with DMD, the efficacy of vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d was maintained over 48 weeks.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone vs placebo and prednisone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^112VH8gu]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial, vamorolone was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of boys with DMD over a 24-week treatment period. Vamorolone is a dissociative steroid that separates efficacy (improvement of motor outcomes in DMD) from some safety concerns seen with the corticosteroid class (growth deceleration, bone biomarkers abnormalities). The proven efficacy over a broad dose range (2–6 mg/kg per day) may enable physicians to adjust dose based on clinical observations and patient preferences.

### Observational study of changes to glucocorticosteroid prescribing patterns in Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the UK over the last decade [^116eLG87]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic GC use is associated with several side-effects, including stunted growth, excess weight gain, behavioural difficulties, osteoporosis and endocrine complications such as delayed puberty, increased blood pressure and glucose intolerance. Natural history studies have shown differential side-effects by GC type. Compared with prednisolone, deflazacort-treated participants experienced higher frequencies of growth delay, cushingoid appearance and cataracts. Prednisolone is associated with greater weight gain than deflazacort, and daily prednisolone regime has been shown to have the greatest effect on increasing BMI.

The side-effects of traditional GC have driven research into the new generation steroids and has led to the development of the steroid analogue vamorolone for use in DMD. Vamorolone has been shown to have similar motor function efficacy over 3 years to prednisolone and deflazacort. Vamorolone-treated patients display a differential side-effect profile, with observed linear growth and lack of decline in bone turnover markers compared with those on daily prednisolone.

Aims

This paper aims to describe how the prescribing patterns of GC for DMD have changed in the UK's NorthStar cohort over the last decade with regards to type, regime, dose prescribed and age of initiation. This will provide an update on the last large-scale description of prescribing trends in the NorthStar network which was published 11 years ago. We also describe patterns of participants who switch GC type or regime, and the prevalence of selected GC side-effects in the NorthStar cohort.

Secondary End Points

The first-rank secondary end point was change from baseline to week 24 for TTSTAND velocity for vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo, was met (LSM [SE] velocity, 0.03 [0.01] m/s vs −0.01 [0.01] m/s; LSM difference, 0.05 m/s; 95% CI, 0.01–0.08 m/s; p = 0.02) (Figure 2, Table 2). Vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, showed a larger latency to peak rise compared with vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day. The subsequent 2 secondary end points were also met, change from baseline to week 24 for 6MWT for vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo (second-rank secondary end point in Table 2, Figure 2) (LSM [SE] distance, 28.3 [9.6] m vs −13.3 [10.0] m; LSM difference, 41.6 m; 95% CI, 14.2–68.9 m; p = 0.003), and vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo (third-rank secondary end point in Table 2, Figure 2) (LSM [SE] distance, 23.9 [9.7] m vs −13.3 [10.0] m; LSM difference, 37.1 m; 95% CI, 9.6–64.7 m; p = 0.009) (Figure 2, Table 2). The next secondary end point, change from baseline to week 24 for TTRW velocity, was met for vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo (fourth-rank secondary end point in Table 2, Figure 2) (LSM [SE] velocity, 0.26 [0.05] m/s vs 0.01 [0.06] m/s; LSM difference, 0.24 m/s; 95% CI, 0.09–0.39 m/s; p = 0.002). The fifth secondary end point was not met for TTRW velocity vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo (fifth secondary end point in Table 2, Figure 2), ending hierarchical testing.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^113ByF1D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Vamorolone, a novel "dissociative" steroid, demonstrated similar efficacy in muscle function relative to prednisone 0.75mg/kg/day but improved linear growth and bone turnover markers in a randomized trial of pediatric Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Objectives

To determine the frequency of adrenal suppression (AS) induced by vamorolone and prednisone in pediatric DMD and to assess cortisol thresholds using a monoclonal antibody immunoassay.

Methods

Post hoc analysis of cortisol levels was performed on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and prednisone-controlled 24-week trial of vamorolone with a 24-week crossover extension. Morning and ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels were measured using the Elecsys II immunoassay, with AS defined as a stimulated cortisol of < 500nmol/L ("historical threshold") and < 400nmol/L ("revised threshold").

Results

Mean age at enrolment was 5.41 ± 0.86 years (n = 118). At week 24, the proportion of participants with AS using the historical and revised cortisol thresholds, respectively, were as follows: prednisone 0.75mg/kg/day = 100% (25/25) and 92.0% (23/25); vamorolone 6mg/kg/day = 95.2% (20/21) and 90.5% (19/21); vamorolone 2mg/kg/day = 84.2% (16/19) and 47.5% (9/19); and placebo = 20.0% (4/20) and 0% (0/20). Morning and peak ACTH-stimulated cortisol were strongly correlated in steroid-treated boys (Spearman correlation week 48 = 0.83).

Conclusion

AS after vamorolone and prednisone was frequent and vamorolone-associated AS appeared dose-dependent. A lower stimulated cortisol threshold may be appropriate when using a monoclonal assay. We recommend hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid stress dosing in patients receiving vamorolone.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^115LThS9]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety: Height and BMI

Treatment with vamorolone for 48 weeks showed normal growth trajectories in participants, with no significant dose-dependent differences (LSM [CI] for vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d vs vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d comparison 0.123 [−0.038 to 0.285], p = 0.131) (Figure 4; Table 2). In the prednisone to vamorolone crossover participants, prednisone showed slowing of growth velocities in period 1 (Figure 4), and crossover to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d showed reversal of growth trajectories (height z score) through catch-up growth (period 1 LSM −0.1001; period 2 LSM 0.1276; LSM [CI] 0.228 [0.0157 to 0.44]; p = 0.036). Comparing prednisone crossover to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d dose with those on vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d dose throughout the 48-week treatment period shows good catch-up growth, although lower height at week 48 assessment for those initially treated with prednisone (LS mean [CI] 0.067 [−0.149 to 0.284]; p = 0.53).

### Finding the optimum regimen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (FOR-DMD) [^111qKXYz]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Finding the Optimum Regimen for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy experience progressive muscle weakness as they grow up. Corticosteroids are currently the only medicine that has been shown to increase muscle strength in boys with DMD. Benefits include an increase in the length of time that boys could continue to walk, reduction in the development of curvature of the spine, a longer time of adequate breathing, and possible protection against the development of heart problems. Doctors have tried different ways of prescribing corticosteroids in order to decrease undesirable side effects of the drug. No controlled, long-term study has ever looked at the effects of different corticosteroids to see which one improves strength the most and which one causes the fewest side effects, over a period of time.

Different doctors in different countries prescribe the drugs in different ways, and some do not prescribe corticosteroids at all. The FOR DMD study will enroll boys with DMD ages 4–7. The study will look at three ways of taking the following corticosteroids by the mouth to determine which increases muscle strength the most, and which causes the fewest side effects:

- Prednisone 0. 75mg/kg/day
- Prednisone 0. 75mg/kg/day switching between 10 days on and 10 days off treatment

### Corticosteroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a reappraisal [^114FjPWB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and most severe form of childhood muscular dystrophies, resulting in early loss of ambulation between the ages of 7 and 13 years and death in the teens and twenties. Despite the phenomenal advances made in the understanding of the molecular genetics of the disease, no definitive cure has been found. Of all of the therapeutic drugs studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, only prednisone seems to have the potential for providing interim functional improvement for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy while they wait for a cure with gene or cell therapy. There is still no consensus regarding recommending corticosteroids as standard therapy for boys. This is an evidence-based review of all of the studies of corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort, and oxandrolone) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From this review, it is clear that until a definitive treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is available, the use of deflazacort and prednisone with judicious dietary control and close clinical monitoring for side effects seems the best intervention for interim preservation of function in such a common devastating disorder of young growing boys.

### Effect of different corticosteroid dosing regimens on clinical outcomes in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^114VSqZW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Corticosteroids improve strength and function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, there is uncertainty regarding the optimum regimen and dosage.

Objective

To compare efficacy and adverse effects of the 3 most frequently prescribed corticosteroid regimens in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial including 196 boys aged 4 to 7 years with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who had not previously been treated with corticosteroids; enrollment occurred between January 30, 2013, and September 17, 2016, at 32 clinic sites in 5 countries. The boys were assessed for 3 years (last participant visit on October 16, 2019).

Interventions

Participants were randomized to daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg) (n = 65), daily deflazacort (0.90 mg/kg) (n = 65), or intermittent prednisone (0.75 mg/kg for 10 days on and then 10 days off) (n = 66).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The global primary outcome comprised 3 end points: rise from the floor velocity (in rise/seconds), forced vital capacity (in liters), and participant or parent global satisfaction with treatment measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM; score range, 0 to 100), each averaged across all study visits after baseline. Pairwise group comparisons used a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of .017.

Results

Among the 196 boys randomized (mean age, 5.8 years [SD, 1.0 years]), 164 (84%) completed the trial. Both daily prednisone and daily deflazacort were more effective than intermittent prednisone for the primary outcome (P < .001 for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone using a global test; p = 0.017 for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone using a global test) and the daily regimens did not differ significantly (P = 0.38 for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort using a global test). The between-group differences were principally attributable to rise from the floor velocity (0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.08 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone [P = 0.003]; 0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.09 rise/s] for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone [P = 0.017]; and -0.004 rise/s [98.3% CI, -0.03 to 0.02 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort [P = 0.75]). The pairwise comparisons for forced vital capacity and TSQM global satisfaction subscale score were not statistically significant. The most common adverse events were abnormal behavior (22 [34%] in the daily prednisone group, 25 [38%] in the daily deflazacort group, and 24 [36%] in the intermittent prednisone group), upper respiratory tract infection (24 [37%], 19 [29%], and 24 [36%], respectively), and vomiting (19 [29%], 17 [26%], and 15 [23%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, treatment with daily prednisone or daily deflazacort, compared with intermittent prednisone alternating 10 days on and 10 days off, resulted in significant improvement over 3 years in a composite outcome comprising measures of motor function, pulmonary function, and satisfaction with treatment; there was no significant difference between the 2 daily corticosteroid regimens. The findings support the use of a daily corticosteroid regimen over the intermittent prednisone regimen tested in this study as initial treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone vs placebo and prednisone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^111Kue1c]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Corticosteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely prescribed but long-term use shows adverse effects that detract from patient quality of life.

Objective

To determine if vamorolone, a structurally unique dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is able to retain efficacy while reducing safety concerns with use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo- and prednisone-controlled 24-week clinical trial, conducted from June 29, 2018, to February 24, 2021, with 24 weeks of follow-up. This was a multicenter study (33 referral centers in 11 countries) and included boys 4 to younger than 7 years of age with genetically confirmed DMD not previously treated with corticosteroids.

Interventions

The study included 4 groups: placebo; prednisone, 0.75 mg/kg per day; vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day; and vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Study outcomes monitored (1) efficacy, which included motor outcomes (primary: time to stand from supine velocity in the vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, group vs placebo; secondary: time to stand from supine velocity [vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day], 6-minute walk distance, time to run/walk 10 m [vamorolone, 2 and 6 mg/kg per day]; exploratory: NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment, time to climb 4 stairs) and (2) safety, which included growth, bone biomarkers, and a corticotropin (ACTH)-challenge test.

Results

Among the 133 boys with DMD enrolled in the study (mean [SD] age, 5.4 [0.9] years), 121 were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and 114 completed the 24-week treatment period. The trial met the primary end point for change from baseline to week 24 time to stand velocity for vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day (least-squares mean [SE] velocity, 0.05 [0.01] m/s vs placebo -0.01 [0.01] m/s; 95% CI, 0.02–0.10; p = 0.002) and the first 4 sequential secondary end points: time to stand velocity, vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; 6-minute walk test, vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; 6-minute walk test, vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; and time to run/walk 10 m velocity, vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo. Height percentile declined in prednisone-treated (not vamorolone-treated) participants (change from baseline [SD]: prednisone, -1.88 [8.81] percentile vs vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, +3.86 [6.16] percentile; p = 0.02). Bone turnover markers declined with prednisone but not with vamorolone. Boys with DMD at baseline showed low ACTH-stimulated cortisol and high incidence of adrenal insufficiency. All 3 treatment groups led to increased adrenal insufficiency.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this pivotal randomized clinical trial, vamorolone was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of boys with DMD over a 24-week treatment period. Vamorolone may be a safer alternative than prednisone in this disease, in which long-term corticosteroid use is the standard of care.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone vs placebo and prednisone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^115zKivv]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

SAS, release 9.4 (SAS Institute), for Windows was used for analyses with both SAS and R statistical software, version 4.1.2 (R Foundation), used for figures. In accordance with the SAP, all measurements were analyzed based on the type of distribution, and descriptive statistics were presented by treatment group and assessment time point, as appropriate. No formal interim statistical analyses were done, apart from the interim data reviews and presentations created for the data safety monitoring board. Analyses were summarized for the 4 treatment groups: vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day; vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day; prednisone, 0.75 mg/kg per day; and placebo. For functional outcome efficacy analyses, a fixed sequential testing approach was used, where each test in the prespecified sequence was conducted using a 2-sided α level of.05.

Efficacy outcomes were tested via a restricted maximum likelihood–based MMRM. This model included fixed effects for treatment, week, baseline outcome, age group (per randomization stratification), and the treatment-by-week interaction. Study week was included in the model as a categorical variable along with the treatment-by-week interaction. Within this model, comparisons of outcomes (using least-squares mean [LSM] contrasts) were made at 24 weeks for the vamorolone vs the placebo groups as prespecified (both primary and secondary outcomes). Comparisons of relative drug effect using percentage change from baseline was done as a post hoc analysis with the same MMRM setup. All P values were 2 sided, and P < .05 was considered significant.

Efficacy of Higher-Dose Vamorolone Compared With GC Treatment in Historical Control Groups

The mean (SD) baseline age was 6.08 (0.81) years among 75 participants in the DNHS control group and 6.00 (0.77) years among 110 participants in the NorthStar UK Network control group. An increased proportion of participants in the higher-dose LTE group had more than 18 months of follow-up after the initial 6 months of steroid exposure compared with participants in the DNHS control group (21 participants [91.3%] vs 30 participants [40.0%]). As noted previously, 75 participants from DNHS and 23 participants from the LTE study receiving higher doses were criteria-matched and subjected to CEM, yielding a smaller subset of matched comparator group (including 29 participants from DNHS and 20 participants from the LTE study). However, participants from DNHS who were CEM-matched had limited follow-up data, and the baseline characteristics of these participants with approximately 2 years of long-term follow-up (which would inform longitudinal analysis) were dissimilar to those from participants in the LTE study who were CEM-matched, resulting in unsuccessful CEM for longitudinal comparison (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Hence, we conducted a prespecified sensitivity analysis among 75 participants from DNHS and 23 participants from LTE; we present these comparisons in Table 1 and Table 2.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^116TuujU]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disabling neuromuscular X-linked recessive disorder that affects about 1:3500–1:5000 boys worldwide. DMD arises from a mutation in the dystrophin gene that results in a deficiency of functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The loss of functional dystrophin results in inflammation and progressive replacement of muscle fibers with fat and connective tissue, causing gradual and irreversible loss of muscle function.

Patients with DMD typically lose the ability to walk by their early teens, require ventilation support in their late teens, and, eventually, die due to heart and/or respiratory failure with a median survival time of 30 years. Moreover, approximately one third of these patients present with behavioral and cognitive impairments including intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders.

The corticosteroids prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort are the current standard of care for treating DMD and prolong reduction in muscle strength and the time before loss of ambulation and mortality in DMD patients. While both prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort are used to treat patients with DMD, only deflazacort is FDA approved for this purpose. Evidence from randomized clinical trials indicated that corticosteroids improve muscle function in DMD, delaying the time to loss of ambulation relative to no treatment with corticosteroids. In subsequent studies, corticosteroid use in non-ambulatory patients with DMD was associated with delayed progression of pulmonary, cardiac, and upper limb loss of function when compared with those who did not receive corticosteroids. Deflazacort is administered as a prodrug that forms the active metabolite 21-des deflazacort in plasma. Prednisone is also a prodrug, forming the active metabolite prednisolone in the plasma.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^112QsSDC]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vamorolone has had preclinical and clinical findings reported including dose-ranging findings and comparisons with long-term CS-treated boys (2.5 years treatment from steroid-naïve baseline) from natural history cohorts. The pivotal clinical trial for vamorolone in DMD is VBP15–004 (: NCT03439670). This trial randomized 121 participants with DMD, in the age group from 4 years to younger than 7 years, who had not been treated with CS at baseline. The trial had 2 sequential 24-week periods. Period 1 had 4 groups (placebo, prednisone, vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d, and vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d). In period 2, the placebo and prednisone groups randomly crossed over to vamorolone treatment (either 2 or 6 mg/kg/d). The blind was maintained for the full 48 weeks of treatment period. The vamorolone-treated groups in period 1 were maintained on the same dose of vamorolone in period 2 (Figure 1, eFigure 1).

Figure 1
Study Participant Flowchart

TTSTAND = time to stand from supine.

We previously reported the period 1 data (placebo-controlled portion), where the trial met the primary outcome (vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d vs placebo; time to rise from floor velocity) and met the initial 4 secondary outcomes. Daily vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg showed similar efficacy to daily prednisone at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/d for all 5 motor outcomes studied. Vamorolone also showed a superior safety profile compared with prednisone, with improved linear growth, absence of reduction in serum bone turnover markers, and a lower incidence of mood disturbance.

Herein we report the findings from the complete 48-week study (period 1 and period 2), including comparison of 48 weeks of treatment with vamorolone at a dose of 2 vs 6 mg/kg/d, and findings in crossover participants (placebo to vamorolone and prednisone to vamorolone). The primary research questions being addressed in the study were the durability of efficacy of vamorolone treatment and whether safety concerns seen with prednisone were reversed on crossover to vamorolone treatment.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^113sXsuB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence suggests that prolonged glucocorticoid exposure can put some individuals at risk of persistent adrenal suppression after cessation of steroid treatment, lasting up to 2 years in some, though with significant interpatient variability. In the current study, we showed that 24 weeks of daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) resulted in profound adrenal suppression followed by significant improvement in morning cortisol for most of the participants after a 4-week washout period [Fig. 2 and Supplement 4]; however, ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels were not performed to evaluate for recovery of the stress response by this more accurate method. Vamorolone-treated participants did not undergo a washout period, so we were also unable to determine the pattern of cortisol recovery from vamorolone-induced adrenal suppression.

In this trial, we did not find episodes of adrenal crisis among the boys with DMD. It remains theoretically possible that our rigorous approach to the risk of adrenal suppression, including stress dosing education and provision of hydrocortisone coverage, may have prevented overt adrenal insufficiency. As a standard of care, it is imperative that all patients and families are aware of the adrenal suppression risk when either classic glucocorticoids (prednisone or deflazacort) or vamorolone therapy are initiated and that empiric "steroid stress dosing" is given during times of moderate to severe illness, surgery, or injury. A specific protocol for treatment and prevention of adrenal crises associated with chronic prednisone and deflazacort treatment in DMD has been published (The PJ Nicholoff Steroid Protocol for Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy and Adrenal Suppression); plans are underway for this protocol to be updated to include guidelines for adrenal suppression management in patients with DMD on vamorolone.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^112pJ5FB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In a recent randomized, placebo- and prednisone-controlled clinical trial in boys with DMD (NCT03439670), vamorolone showed comparable efficacy in improving muscle function relative to prednisone, without a negative effect on linear growth velocity and bone turnover markers. Both prednisone and vamorolone treatment groups showed a high incidence of adrenal suppression using the standard threshold of < 500 nmol/L (proportion of participants on vamorolone 6 mg/kg with adrenal suppression = 95% [20/21]; vamorolone 2 mg/kg = 86% [18/21]; prednisone 0.75 mg/kg = 100% [26/26]), although the placebo group also showed an unexpected incidence of adrenal suppression (20% [4/20]). The loss of growth stunting with vamorolone compared with traditional corticosteroids was also seen in 2.5-year long-term extension studies.

Importantly, both morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol concentrations were measured in the clinical trial setting using a centralized, newer monoclonal cortisol assay (Supplementary Material). While recent literature suggests the need for a redefined lower cortisol threshold for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency when using a monoclonal cortisol assay compared to the historical polyclonal assays, a pediatric threshold has not yet been defined. We now report a detailed, post hoc analysis of the adrenal function data from this trial, including both the analyses using a lower threshold for ACTH-stimulated cortisol (< 400 nmol/L) (see Methods for rationale of threshold) and correlation of morning cortisol with ACTH-stimulated cortisol measures. Specifically, our data allowed us to compare the effect of 2 doses of vamorolone (2 and 6 mg/kg/day) and prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) administered daily in young boys with DMD on the HPA axis using both the classic ACTH-stimulated cortisol threshold of 500 nmol/L (18.1 ng/dL) and a lower, revised threshold of 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL). Additional post hoc analyses included assessment of the timing of peak cortisol on standard-dose ACTH stimulation testing (30 vs 60 minutes) and examination of first-morning cortisol thresholds for prediction of cortisol levels on ACTH stimulation testing.

### Corticosteroids for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112Z3EXA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood. Untreated, this incurable disease, which has an X-linked recessive inheritance, is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability, leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is a major aim of treatment. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that corticosteroids significantly improve muscle strength and function in boys with DMD in the short term (six months), and strength at two years (two-year data on function are very limited). Corticosteroids, now part of care recommendations for DMD, are largely in routine use, although questions remain over their ability to prolong walking, when to start treatment, longer-term balance of benefits versus harms, and choice of corticosteroid or regimen. We have extended the scope of this updated review to include comparisons of different corticosteroids and dosing regimens.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking ability, muscle strength, functional ability, and quality of life in DMD; to address the question of whether benefit is maintained over the longer term (more than two years); to assess adverse events; and to compare efficacy and adverse effects of different corticosteroid preparations and regimens.

Search Methods

On 16 February 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts. We checked references in identified trials, handsearched journal abstracts, and searched trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We considered RCTs or quasi-RCTs of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, and deflazacort) given for a minimum of three months to patients with a definite DMD diagnosis. We considered comparisons of different corticosteroids, regimens, and corticosteroids versus placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies (667 participants) and two new ongoing studies for inclusion. Six RCTs were newly included at this update and important non-randomised cohort studies have also been published. Some important studies remain unpublished and not all published studies provide complete outcome data.

Primary Outcome Measure

one two-year deflazacort RCT (n = 28) used prolongation of ambulation as an outcome measure but data were not adequate for drawing conclusions.

Secondary Outcome Measures

meta-analyses showed that corticosteroids (0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone or prednisolone) improved muscle strength and function versus placebo over six months (moderate quality evidence from up to four RCTs). Evidence from single trials showed 0.75 mg/kg/day superior to 0.3 mg/kg/day on most strength and function measures, with little evidence of further benefit at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), timed walk, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade, and forced vital capacity. One new RCT (n = 66), reported better strength, function and quality of life with daily 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone at 12 months. One RCT (n = 28) showed that deflazacort stabilised muscle strength versus placebo at two years, but timed function test results were too imprecise for conclusions to be drawn. One double-blind RCT (n = 64), largely at low risk of bias, compared daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) with weekend-only prednisone (5 mg/kg/weekend day), finding no overall difference in muscle strength and function over 12 months (moderate to low quality evidence). Two small RCTs (n = 52) compared daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day with daily deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, but study methods limited our ability to compare muscle strength or function.

Adverse Effects

excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hair growth were all previously shown to be more common with corticosteroids than placebo; we assessed the quality of evidence (for behavioural changes and weight gain) as moderate. Hair growth and cushingoid features were more frequent at 0.75 mg/kg/day than 0.3 mg/kg/day prednisone. Comparing daily versus weekend-only prednisone, both groups gained weight with no clear difference in body mass index (BMI) or in behavioural changes (low quality evidence for both outcomes, one study); the weekend-only group had a greater linear increase in height. Very low quality evidence suggested less weight gain with deflazacort than with prednisone at 12 months, and no difference in behavioural abnormalities. Data are insufficient to assess the risk of fractures or cataracts for any comparison. Non-randomised studies support RCT evidence in showing improved functional benefit from corticosteroids. These studies suggest sustained benefit for up to 66 months. Adverse effects were common, although generally manageable. According to a large comparative longitudinal study of daily or intermittent (10 days on, 10 days off) corticosteroid for a mean period of four years, a daily regimen prolongs ambulation and improves functional scores over the age of seven, but with a greater frequency of side effects than an intermittent regimen.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence from RCTs indicates that corticosteroid therapy in DMD improves muscle strength and function in the short term (twelve months), and strength up to two years. On the basis of the evidence available for strength and function outcomes, our confidence in the effect estimate for the efficacy of a 0.75 mg/kg/day dose of prednisone or above is fairly secure. There is no evidence other than from non-randomised trials to establish the effect of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common with corticosteroids than placebo, but not clinically severe. A weekend-only prednisone regimen is as effective as daily prednisone in the short term (12 months), according to low to moderate quality evidence from a single trial, with no clear difference in BMI (low quality evidence). Very low quality evidence indicates that deflazacort causes less weight gain than prednisone after a year's treatment. We cannot evaluate long-term benefits and hazards of corticosteroid treatment or intermittent regimens from published RCTs. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits, but also identify clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment, and a possible divergence of efficacy in daily and weekend-only regimens in the longer term. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research and clinical practice.

### Vamorolone: a novel metabolism resistant steroid that suppresses joint destruction in chronic polyarthritis with reduced systemic side effects [^113pMMxf]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Many studies have indicated that 11β-HSD1 is upregulation within off-target tissues such as muscle and bone in chronic inflammatory diseases and with advancing age, where they drive adverse musculoskeletal side effects of therapeutic glucocorticoids. This is pertinent the resistance to metabolism by may contribute to its reduced profile of musculoskeletal side effects in this study. At therapeutic doses, steroids such as prednisolone potently suppress markers of anabolic bone formation (such as P1NP, osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase) within bone, driving a progressive glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Not only did vamorolone avoid this deleterious side effect of traditional glucocorticoids in bone, preserving Bglap expression and serum P1NP levels, it also protected against inflammatory trabecular bone loss adjacent to arthritic joints in a similar manner to that of prednisolone. Consequently, it appears that the actions of vamorolone may be dissociated in a fashion that favours the protective anti-resorptive actions without driving a wider suppression of anabolic bone formation in this setting. Further measures of systemic bone metabolism in long bones and spine, using measures such as micro-CT, and static and dynamic histomorphometry are now required to comprehensively characterize this phenotype. Recent data from human studies, where vamorolone is administered to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, support the relevance of these bone metabolism observations.

Study Design

Throughout the studies, vamorolone was provided as a 4% flavored oral suspension taken daily at breakfast with a 240-mL glass of whole milk (approximately 8 g of fat) or equivalent high-fat food portion. Study participants were initially assigned to receive vamorolone at 1 of 4 dose levels (ie, 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, or 6.0 mg/kg/d) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1) and remained at the same dose level in the 2-week multiple ascending dose and 24-week dose-finding trials. The last visit of the 24-week dose-finding trial coincided with the baseline visit of the 24-month LTE trial. Multiple dose escalations to the highest dose (ie, 6.0 mg/kg/d) were permitted in the LTE protocol (Supplement 2); de-escalations were also allowed in case of intolerability, at the discretion of investigators. Given the variable timing of dose escalations, prespecified analyses of drug-associated efficacy focused on 23 participants who were initially assigned and maintained on a 2.0 mg/kg/d or greater dose of vamorolone (ie, 2 mg/kg/d and 6 mg/kg/d dose groups, hereafter higher-dose groups) for up to 30 months.

Additionally, participants from the CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study (DNHS) treated with GC were selected to serve as a historical control group for timed function tests and anthropometric measurements. The DNHS (NCT00468832) included 440 participants with DMD, with data collected from December 2005 to November 2016. Participants in DNHS were first eligible for inclusion in the control group after they had experienced 6 months of continuous GC exposure, with similar ages (ie, 4.5–7.5 years) as participants in the LTE study who had 6 months of vamorolone exposure at baseline after completing the dose-finding trial. For statistical matching between participants receiving higher-dose vamorolone and those in the DNHS, prespecified criteria (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1) were defined for coarsened exact matching (CEM).

Additionally, body mass index z score change (0.002 SD/mo; 95% CI, −0.006 to 0.010; p = 0.58) was not significantly different between the higher-dose vamorolone group vs the DNHS group. The NPMLE estimate of time to reach a TTSTAND milestone of 10 seconds or more for 108 participants in NSUK who had not experienced this event by baseline (median age, 9.55 years; 95% CI, 8.87 to ∞ years) was similar to that for participants in DNHS and participants in the LTE study receiving higher doses. Additionally, a relative risk analysis of NSAA scores showed no significant difference in the risk of losing a motor function (ie, change from a function score of a 1 or 2 at baseline to a 0 at the end of follow-up) between participants in NSUK and participants in the LTE study receiving higher doses (139 of 1734 functions lost [8.0%] vs 26 of 335 functions lost [7.8%]; relative risk, 1.033 [95% CI, 0.691 to 1.544]).

### Vamorolone (Agamree) [^111AmuDR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Vamorolone is a corticosteroid that acts through the glucocorticoid receptor to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The precise mechanism by which vamorolone exerts its effect in patients with DMD is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Vamorolone produced a dose-dependent decrease in morning cortisol levels in the clinical studies. Treatment with corticosteroids is associated with a suppression of endogenous cortisol concentrations and an impairment of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. A dose-dependent increase in leukocyte counts and lymphocyte counts was observed in clinical studies with vamorolone.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Vamorolone does not cause a mean increase in the QTc interval > 20 milliseconds (ms) at 1.6 times the approved recommended dose.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The major route of elimination is by metabolism with subsequent excretion of metabolites into urine. The pharmacokinetics (PK) are linear and vamorolone exposure increases proportionally with either single (0.1 to 20 mg/kg) or multiple (0.25 to 20 mg/kg) doses. Vamorolone does not accumulate with repeated administration after once daily dosing.

Absorption

After oral administration with food, the median Tmaxis about 2 hours (range 0.5 to 5 hours).

Effect of Food

Co-administration of vamorolone (2 mg/kg) with a high-fat/high-calorie meal reduced Cmaxby 18%, increased AUC by 13%, and delayed Tmaxby one hour. Co-administration of vamorolone (2 mg/kg) with a low-fat/low-calorie meal reduced Cmaxby 4%, increased AUC by 14%, and delayed Tmaxby one hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution of vamorolone for a DMD patient with a body weight of 20 kg taking AGAMREE with a meal is 162 L based on the population PK analysis. Protein binding is 88.1% in vitro. The blood to plasma ratio is approximately 0.87.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone vs placebo and prednisone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^116tSmWT]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Safety End Points

The number of participants reporting at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between groups (placebo group, 79.3% [23 of 29]; prednisone group, 83.9% [26 of 31]; vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day group, 83.3% [25 of 30]; vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day group, 89.3% [25 of 28]) (eTable 3 in Supplement 8). The total count of TEAEs was lowest in the placebo group (n = 77), highest in the prednisone group (n = 121), and intermediate in the 2 vamorolone groups (2 mg/kg per day, n = 97; 6.0 mg/kg per day, n = 91). A single participant receiving prednisone, 0.75 mg/kg per day, withdrew from the study owing to an AE (personality change, Common Terminology Criteria for AEs [CTCAE] grade 2) that was viewed by the investigator (I.H.) as possibly related to the drug and abated after cessation of the drug. There was a single TEAE in the study considered by the investigator to be severe (aggression, CTCAE grade 3) experienced by a participant receiving prednisone, 0.75 mg/kg per day; the participant remained in the study. One participant in the vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, group experienced a serious AE of viral gastroenteritis, viewed as not related to the study drug.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^114WL6DN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression ("adrenal suppression") is an underrecognized, iatrogenic side effect of therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids have been the mainstay of therapy for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), putting them at risk of morbidity and mortality from adrenal suppression. Adrenal suppression may be asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms but, if unrecognized or improperly managed, can lead to adrenal crisis and death during times of physiological stress. In boys with DMD, nonspecific signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue and weakness, are particularly difficult to recognize because they are also characteristic of the underlying condition. Given the potential life-threatening nature of adrenal crisis from adrenal suppression, an in-depth understanding of the risk and characteristics of adrenal suppression related to prednisone and vamorolone in DMD is required to inform the implementation of these therapies in clinical practice.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^114SuiEH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are an effective therapy for many inflammatory and immunologic conditions and are part of the standards of care for DMD. However, their long-term use is associated with significant side effects including, but not limited to, poor linear growth, excess weight gain, delayed puberty, bone fragility due to osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and adrenal suppression. Therefore, attempts have been made to create analogues that dissociate the beneficial activity from some of the adverse effects.

Vamorolone is a novel anti-inflammatory steroid that lacks a hydroxyl group at the C11 position of the steroid skeleton. This modification prevents a hydrogen bond with the Asn564 residue in the glucocorticoid receptor. Consequently, compared to prednisone or deflazacort, the vamorolone glucocorticoid receptor complex has less affinity for coactivator proteins and is therefore a much weaker activator of gene transcription, which mediates some of the glucocorticoid-related side effects. However, the transrepression activity (which mediates most of the anti-inflammatory activity), is conserved; this renders vamorolone a dissociative (or biased) ligand for the glucocorticoid receptor. In addition, the lack of a hydroxyl group on C11 prevents a hydrogen bond forming with the N770 residue of the mineralocorticoid receptor. In preclinical experiments, vamorolone behaved as a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, in contrast to prednisone and deflazacort. Lastly, vamorolone is not a substrate for 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases I and II due to the lack of the C11 hydroxyl group; this is important, because 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases I and II have been shown to mediate some of the adverse effects of prednisone.

Unstimulated Morning Cortisol Values

Unstimulated morning cortisol levels were similar at baseline in all groups (Table 1). Mean first-morning cortisol values remained stable over 24 weeks in the placebo arm (Fig. 2). All other treatment groups showed significant reductions in morning cortisol levels from baseline at both 12-week and 24-week MMRM assessments [vs placebo: all comparisons P < .0001; Fig. 2; Supplement 5 (Table)]. At week 24, the vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day group showed less of a decrease in first morning cortisol when compared with prednisone [P = 0.002; LSM = 52.8 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 19.7 to 86 nmol/L], whereas the vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day group demonstrated a greater decrease in first-morning cortisol when compared with prednisone (P = 0.026; LSM = −35.4 nmol/L, 95% CI = −66.4 to −4.4 nmol/L).

Figure 2.
Change in morning and ACTH peak stimulated cortisol levels over 48 weeks of treatment. (A) The merged treatment groups for period 1 are provided over the first 24 weeks, along with the tapered washout for the prednisone group and period 2 for the vamorolone 0- to 48-week groups. The P -value in green is for the change from week 24 to week 28 in the prednisone group after starting tapering. The P -value in light blue represents the change from week 24 to week 48 in the vamorolone 2 group; similarly, in dark blue, the P -value is for change from week 24 to week 48 in the vamorolone 6 group. (B) Change in peak cortisol after ACTH stimulation was plotted for each of the 6 randomized treatment groups. The crossover groups start as dashed (period 1 assignment) before crossover to vamorolone dose groups (solid).

At week 28, 4 weeks after the start of tapering, the prednisone group demonstrated rapid improvement in morning cortisol [P < .0001; LSM difference week 28 vs 24 = 121 nmol/L, 95% CI = 77.4 to 164 nmol/L; Fig. 2; Supplement 5 (Table)]. The morning cortisol levels at week 48 were not significantly different from the 24-week levels in both vamorolone groups (Fig. 2).

Serum total protein and albumin levels were within normal limits for all participants.

### Joint modelling of growth and motor function centiles in corticosteroids treated boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^111dmWrw]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The findings of this study, alongside previous works understanding growth and function in DMD, can support conversations with patients and their carers about the relative benefit of CS types and regimes, and the associated side effects. This is particularly pertinent given the recent approval of Vamorolone, a new generation of CS with differential side effect profiles. Although shorter height is correlated with slower motor function decline, it is also linked to low self‐esteem and social difficulties in DMD. Consequently, individualised management of growth side effects remains a priority in CS‐treated boys with DMD and any benefit due to short stature must be weighed against quality‐of‐life considerations.

### Update on the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^111Dx7Ek]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is familiar to paediatricians as the most common childhood muscular dystrophy and leads to severe disability and early death in the late teenage years if untreated. Improvements in general care, glucocorticoid corticosteroid treatment, non-invasive ventilatory support, and cardiomyopathy and scoliosis management have significantly changed the course of DMD in treated individuals, so that survival into adulthood is now a realistic possibility for most patients. This has important implications for the medical and social sectors involved in the transition to adult medical services and the provision of suitable employment and social care. Multidisciplinary team working for optimal management of DMD-specific multisystem complications is essential, and collaboration in disease specific national clinical networks is recommended. Several curative therapeutic strategies including cell and gene therapy are being pursued but are still at an experimental stage.

### Emerging therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^114uKKHs]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disease caused by the absence of functional dystrophin in the muscle cells. Major advances have led to the development of gene therapies, tools that induce exon skipping, and other therapeutic approaches, including treatments targeting molecular pathways downstream of the absence of functional dystrophin. However, glucocorticoids remain the only treatment unequivocally shown to slow disease progression, despite the adverse effects associated with their long-term use. Besides glucocorticoids, which are standard care, five compounds have received regulatory approval in some but not all jurisdictions, with further efficacy results being awaited. Several compounds with promising results in early-phase clinical trials have not met their efficacy endpoints in late-phase trials, but the clinical development of many other compounds is ongoing. The current landscape is complicated by the number of compounds in various stages of development, their various mechanisms of action, and their genotype-specific applicability. The difficulties of clinical development that arise from both the rarity and variability of Duchenne muscular dystrophy might be overcome in the future by use of sensitive biomarkers, natural history data, and ameliorated trial designs.

### Change in natural history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with long-term corticosteroid treatment: implications for management [^113dBDAP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2005, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society published a practice parameter, based primarily on studies that involved 6 to 18 months of treatment, indicating that prednisone has a beneficial effect on muscle strength and function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and recommended that corticosteroids be offered (prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d and deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/d) as treatment. Recent reports emphasize that longer term treatment with corticosteroids (greater than 3 years) produces important sustained benefits in neuromuscular function without causing major side effects. This review highlights these reports and indicates that long-term corticosteroid therapy (1) prolongs ambulation by 2 to 5 years, (2) reduces the need for spinal stabilization surgery, (3) improves cardiopulmonary function, (4) delays the need for noninvasive nasal ventilation, and (5) increases survival and the quality of life of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Educational, vocational, and other social counseling is now a vital part of management for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^112j8Xkm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the differences in mechanisms of action between vamorolone and classic glucocorticoids (including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism) and the lack of experience with vamorolone at doses higher than 6 mg/kg/day, we recommend steroid stress dosing using hydrocortisone in patients receiving vamorolone as per standard preventative or symptomatic adrenal suppression management, as set out in the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines. Since vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day clearly showed less glucocorticoid-like activity (assessed as adrenal suppression) than the standard dose of prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day), it is further recommended that patients who transition from any therapeutic dose of classic glucocorticoids to vamorolone are prescribed vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day rather than 2 mg/kg/day, in order to avoid symptomatic adrenal insufficiency during the switching period. The vamorolone dose can then be progressively tapered according to clinical indication, with monitoring for signs and/or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency in the event of downward dose titration. If the decision to discontinue vamorolone is made, the vamorolone dose must also be progressively tapered, with monitoring for signs and/or symptoms of steroid withdrawal or adrenal insufficiency during this process.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone vs placebo and prednisone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy… [^1142GxXZ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

This study found that vamorolone, a dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory, was able to reduce bone morbidities while retaining efficacy. Importance Corticosteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely prescribed but long-term use shows adverse effects that detract from patient quality of life. Objective To determine if vamorolone, a structurally unique dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is able to retain efficacy while reducing safety concerns with use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Conclusions and Relevance In this pivotal randomized clinical trial, vamorolone was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of boys with DMD over a 24-week treatment period. Vamorolone may be a safer alternative than prednisone in this disease, in which long-term corticosteroid use is the standard of care. Vamorolone uniquely lacks a 11β-hydroxyl/carbonyl moiety on the steroidal C ring, changing structure and activity relationships with the receptors.

5 Further, vamorolone cannot be acted on by modulatory 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes known to be necessary for mediating corticosteroid-associated bone morbidities in mice. 6 Lastly, vamorolone is a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, whereas most corticosteroids are agonists.
7. First-in-patient, open-label, dose-ranging studies of vamorolone in DMD suggested improvements in motor outcomes similar to corticosteroids, without stunting of growth over a
2. 5-year treatment period, compared with external corticosteroid-treated comparators. 8–11 In the study reported here, we present results of a pivotal 24-week double-blind, placebo- and prednisone- controlled clinical efficacy and safety trial of vamorolone in boys 4 to younger than 7 years of age with DMD who were not previously treated with corticosteroids.

In this randomized clinical trial, vamorolone was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of boys with DMD over a 24-week treatment period. Vamorolone is a dissociative steroid that separates efficacy from some safety concerns seen with the corticosteroid class. The proven efficacy over a broad dose range may enable physicians to adjust dose based on clinical observations and patient preferences.

### Glucocorticoid corticosteroids for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112aMnwS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood. This incurable disease is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is one of the major aims of treatment.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess whether glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize or improve muscle strength and walking in boys with DMD.

Search Strategy

This is an update of the Cochrane systematic review first published in 2004 (Manzur 2004). We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (August 2006) using the term 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy'. We also searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2007), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2006), CINAHL and LILACS (January 1982 to August 2006). We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts in this disease to help identify other trials, checked the references in the identified trials and hand searched the abstracts of relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised trials.

Types Of Participants

all patients with a definite diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Types of interventions: glucocorticoids such as prednisone, prednisolone, deflazacort or others, with a minimum treatment period of three months.

Primary Outcome Measure

prolongation of walking (independent walking without long leg calipers).

Secondary Outcome Measures

strength outcome measures, manual muscle strength testing using Medical Research Council strength scores, functional outcome measures and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified six randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria for our review, and one of these (Beenakker 2005) is a new addition to this update, as it was published subsequent to our first review (Manzur 2004). Two review authors independently selected the trials for the review and assessed methodological quality. Data extraction and inputting were double-checked.

Primary Outcome Measure

data from one small study used prolongation of walking as an outcome measure and did not show significant benefit.

Secondary Outcome Measures

The meta-analysis of the results from four randomised controlled trials with altogether 249 participants showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids improved muscle strength and function over six months. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), nine metres walking time, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade and forced vital capacity. One randomised controlled trial with altogether 28 participants showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize muscle strength and function for up to two years. The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day, given in a daily dose regime. Not enough data were available to compare efficacy of prednisone with deflazacort. Adverse effects: Excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance and excessive hair growth were all more common with glucocorticoid corticosteroids than placebo. Long-term adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy could not be evaluated because of the short-term duration of the randomised studies. Non-randomised studies: A number of non-randomised studies with important efficacy and adverse effects data are tabulated and discussed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from randomised controlled studies that glucocorticoid corticosteroid therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy improves muscle strength and function in the short-term (six months to two years). The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day, given daily. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common but not clinically severe. Long-term benefits and hazards of glucocorticoid treatment cannot be evaluated from the currently published randomised studies. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits but also identify clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research studies and clinical practice.

### Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function [^111Bnsti]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study vamorolone, a first-in-class steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Methods

An open-label, multiple-ascending-dose study of vamorolone was conducted in 48 boys with DMD (age 4– < 7 years, steroid-naive). Dose levels were 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an oral suspension formulation (12 boys per dose level; one-third to 10 times the glucocorticoid dose in DMD). The primary goal was to define optimal doses of vamorolone. The primary outcome for clinical efficacy was time to stand from supine velocity.

Results

Oral administration of vamorolone at all doses tested was safe and well tolerated over the 24-week treatment period. The 2.0–mg/kg/d dose group met the primary efficacy outcome of improved muscle function (time to stand; 24 weeks of vamorolone treatment vs natural history controls), without evidence of most adverse effects of glucocorticoids. A biomarker of bone formation, osteocalcin, increased in vamorolone-treated boys, suggesting possible loss of bone morbidities seen with glucocorticoids. Biomarker outcomes for adrenal suppression and insulin resistance were also lower in vamorolone-treated patients with DMD relative to published studies of glucocorticoid therapy.

Conclusions

Daily vamorolone treatment suggested efficacy at doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an exploratory 24-week open-label study.

Classification of evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that for boys with DMD, vamorolone demonstrated possible efficacy compared to a natural history cohort of glucocorticoid-naive patients and appeared to be tolerated.

### Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function [^117Pk51N]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

A total of 12 patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study: 1 patient (8.3%), 2 patients (16.7%), 4 patients (33.3%), and 5 patients (41.7%) in the 0.25–, 0.75–, 2.0–, and 6.0–mg/kg/d groups, respectively. None of the TEAEs was serious or severe (CTCAE grade ≥ 3). No deaths were reported during the study.

One patient in the 0.75–mg/kg/d group and 2 patients in the 6.0–mg/kg/d group experienced a total of 4 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study. One patient in the 0.75–mg/kg/d group experienced a moderate (CTCAE grade 2) treatment-emergent SAE of pneumonia; in the 6.0–mg/kg/d group, 1 patient experienced a severe (CTCAE grade 3) treatment-emergent SAE of dehydration, and a second patient experienced severe (CTCAE grade 3) treatment-emergent SAEs of testicular torsion and hypoxia. No SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug; all resolved during essentially uninterrupted study participation.

No patient in any dose level group experienced a TEAE leading to study drug or study discontinuation.

### Membrane stabilization by modified steroid offers a potential therapy for muscular dystrophy due to dysferlin deficit [^113vpciz]. Molecular Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

There are two drugs that are currently in clinical trials for DMD that have membrane stabilization as a mechanism of action — vamorolone (ClinicalTrials.gov: and), and polaxamer (ClinicalTrials.gov:). In our study, we have focused on vamorolone due to the multiple mechanisms of action, over and above membrane stability, that may benefit LGMD2B patients, namely NF-κB inhibitory activity (anti-inflammatory), loss of many side effects seen with corticosteroid anti-inflammatories, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist activity. As such, vamorolone has improved safety relative to corticosteroids and is in phase 2 clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We hypothesized that the potential of vamorolone to stabilize and improve repair of injured myofiber sarcolemma while inhibiting inflammation and avoiding the side effects of chronic glucocorticoid use might allow this drug to simultaneously address multiple muscle pathologies associated with dysferlin deficiency. Here, we have examined the potential of vamorolone by directly monitoring its role in stabilizing dysferlinopathic muscle cell membrane and evaluating the utility of this drug to treat LGMD2B by using a dysferlin-deficient mouse model.

4 Respiratory Aspects of New DMD Therapies

Professor Mercuri's lecture focused on advancements and challenges in treating DMD. The overview initially focused on dystrophin restoration using DNA/RNA strategies, including Adeno‐associated viral vectors (AAVs) gene therapy and antisense oligonucleotides. Gene Therapy focuses on delivering shortened versions of the dystrophin gene via AAVs. Exon skipping was also discussed, that is, the possibility to skip additional exons to convert out‐of‐frame mutations into in‐frame mutations that can produce some functional dystrophin. An overview of the different approaches and related trial results were critically discussed.

The results of first‐generation of Oligonucleotides (ASOs) and early results from studies of the new generation of these drugs were also discussed. Data were also presented on Ataluren, which aims to restore functional dystrohin production by targeting premature stop codons. Despite positive long‐term data, the renewal of the drug in Europe is under threat.

The review also included approaches based on drugs with nongenetic mechanisms of action, like Vamorolone, a new glucocorticoid which offers similar efficacy to traditional steroids but fewer adverse effects, like diminished bone health and delayed puberty; and Givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor which showed statistically significant slowing of disease progression by reducing inflammation and fibrosis.

Lastly, Professor Mercuri highlighted some lessons learned from previous trials, such as the need for longer study durations; and the need to combine short‐term placebo‐controlled studies with long‐term observational studies, to assess key outcome measures like loss of ambulation, hand‐to‐mouth function, and ventilation requirements.

Next, Drs. Birnkrant and Katz examined potential problems in the regulatory pathway by which new DMD drugs are approved, with a focus on the outcome measures used to assess drug effectiveness. In DMD, patient survival is determined by cardiorespiratory function, and the most impactful clinical complications are cardiorespiratory in nature. They occur in older individuals, who are in the late nonambulatory stage of the disease. Thus, to be considered truly effective, a new DMD drug should show that it improves cardiorespiratory function. Instead, new DMD drugs can be approved through the Accelerated Regulatory pathway based on small improvements in timed tests and muscle strength scales and on surrogate outcome measures, like tissue levels of nonbiologic dystrophin, without considering cardiorespiratory data. Moreover, these studies usually involve a young, ambulatory population, who essentially never experiences the cardiorespiratory complications that occur in the late nonambulatory stage of DMD.

Non-randomised studies: a number of non-randomised studies with important efficacy and adverse effects data are tabulated and discussed.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is evidence from randomised controlled studies that glucocorticoid corticosteroid therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy improves muscle strength and function in the short-term (six months to two years). The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common but not clinically severe. Long-term benefits and hazards of glucocorticoid treatment cannot be evaluated from the currently published randomised studies. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits but also indicate clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research studies and clinical practice.

ACTH Stimulation Test Results

At the screening (pretreatment) visit, 9/111 (8.1%) of participants had a cortisol peak at either 30 or 60 minutes of < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 ng/dL), but 0% (0/112) had a cortisol peak < 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL) (Table 1), with peak cortisol ranging from 444 to 919 nmol/L (16.1–33.3 ng/dL). At week 24, the percent (and number) of abnormal peak cortisol values in each group using thresholds of < 500 nmol/L (18.1 ng/dL) and < 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL), respectively, were 20.0% (4/20), 0% (0/20) of the placebo group; 100% (25/25), 92.0% (23/25) of the prednisone group; 84.2% (16/19), 47.4% (9/19) of the vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day group; and 95.2% (20/21), 90.5% (19/21) of the vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day group (Table 2 and Fig. 3).

Discussion

Therapeutic steroids such as prednisone are effective at controlling inflammation in diseases such as RA but their use is limited by an array of severe off-target side effects. Vamorolone is a novel dissociated steroid that has shown efficacy in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, without eliciting classic glucocorticoid-related side effects. Its double bond between C9 and C11 prevents vamorolone from inducing classical homodimer glucocorticoid rsponse element (GRE)-mediated transactivation, but retains actions mediated by the ligand bound glucocorticoid receptor (GR) monomer. This change impacts on the moiety involved in metabolism by the 11β-HSD1 enzyme. This enzyme is integral in mediating many positive and deleterious features of therapeutic glucocorticoids in vivo, amplifying their levels in tissues such as adipose, muscle and bone. We used the well-characterized murine TNFtg model of chronic polyarthritis with global transgenic deletion of 11β-HSD1 to explore whether the resistance of vamorolone to this enzyme contributed to its improved profile of side effects.

Common AEs for Vamorolone Dose Groups

The most common AEs reported during 48 weeks of vamorolone treatment were upper respiratory tract infections (vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d 35.7% [n = 10]; vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d 14.3% [n = 4]), vomiting (vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d 21.4% [n = 6]; vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d 21.4% [n = 6]), Cushingoid features (vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d 14.3% [n = 4]; vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d 32.1% [n = 9]), cough (vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d 17.9% [n = 5]; vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d 10.7% [n = 3]), pyrexia (vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d 25.0% [n = 7]; vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d 10.7% [n = 3]), and diarrhea (vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d 10.7% [n = 3]; vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d 17.5% [n = 5]).

Drug-Related AEs

The percentage of participants with at least 1 drug-related AE decreased in both vamorolone groups in period 2 relative to period 1. The percentage of participants with at least 1 drug-related AE continued to be lower in the vamorolone 2 mg/kg group compared with that in the 6 mg/kg group in period 2 (17.9% vs 39.3%, respectively). There was no increase in rates of adverse events per patient per year from period 1 to period 2 for the 2 vamorolone groups (number of AEs per patient per year being 3.6 AEs per year and 2.4 AEs per year [period 1 vs 2, 2 mg/kg/d], 4.0 AEs per year and 3.0 AEs per year [period 1 vs 2, 6 mg/kg/d]).

Oxoreductase activity favours activation of prednisolone from the inactive precursor prednisone, with the conversion of the ketone at C11 to a hydroxyl group (dotted circle). Vamorolone possess a double bond between C9 and C11 (denoted at the *), removing the classical site for 11β-HSD1 metabolism. 11β-HSD1: 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1

Vamorolone is a dissociated steroidal anti-inflammatory drug effective in the treatment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that possesses a significantly reduced profile of undesirable side effects relative to traditional glucocorticoids. Vamorolone has also shown significant promise in the suppression of disease activity in an array of disease models, including allergic asthma, IBD and CIA. Vamorolone shares structural homology with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone, but possesses a double bond between C9 and C11, preventing the formation of a functional hydroxyl, or ketone group at C11 (Fig. 1). This change conveys the dissociated properties of vamorolone at the glucocorticoid receptor and removes the traditional targets required for metabolism and amplification by 11β-HSD1. We have shown that this enzyme mediates many of the deleterious off-target actions of oral glucocorticoids. Whether the improved side effects profile reported for vamorolone reflects evasion of local metabolism and amplification by 11β-HSD1 at off target sites such as the adipose, muscle and bone have yet to be examined. To determine this, we utilized in vitro enzyme models to monitor 11β-HSD1 metabolism of vamorolone, before using animals with global transgenic deletion 11β-HSD1 to assess its contribution to the actions of vamorolone in the TNFtg model of polyarthritis.

### Membrane stabilization by modified steroid offers a potential therapy for muscular dystrophy due to dysferlin deficit [^116QD9hC]. Molecular Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lack of dysferlin protein causes muscular dystrophies known as dysferlinopathy, which includes limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy. These diseases present sub-acutely during adolescence and lead to wasting and weakening of shoulder, pelvic girdle, and limb muscles. Mutations leading to the loss of dysferlin protein results in poor repair of muscle fibers, chronic muscle inflammation, and a progressive degeneration of muscle.

Currently, there is no therapy available for dysferlinopathy. Efforts to use gene therapy and drugs that target myofiber damage, calcium overload, muscle inflammation, and degeneration have resulted in mixed success thus far. Inflammation — a hallmark of dysferlinopathy — has been targeted using glucocorticoids (GCs) — the mainstay for treating inflammatory muscle diseases. However, glucocorticoids are not effective in dysferlinopathic patientsand also have significant safety concerns. Indeed, glucocorticoids have been reported to increase (not decrease) muscle weakness in the LGMD2B patients. Reducing corticosteroid drug dose and frequency in mouse models of dysferlinopathy reduces some side effects, but this approach has not yet been reported in human LGMD2B patients.

Vamorolone (VBP15) is a dissociative steroid that aims to retain or improve the therapeutic benefit of traditional corticosteroids, while reducing side effects. Vamorolone has a delta 9–11 modification in the steroid backbone that retains transrepression activities of glucocorticoids (inhibition of innate immunity via activator protein 1 [AP1], and nuclear factor κB [NF-κB], while reducing or eliminating many side effects [transcriptional transactivation of genes due to binding the glucocorticoid response element [GRE]). Vamorolone has shown efficacy similar to prednisolone, with improved safety profiles, in mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Drugs with steroidal chemistries integrate into and change physicochemical properties of the cell membrane. Some delta 9–11 modified glucocorticoids (21-aminosteroids; lazaroids) have been shown to stabilize membranes and reduce membrane lipid peroxidation, leading to neuroprotection during traumatic brain injury. Similarly, a recently developed delta 9–11-modified glucocorticoid, vamorolone (VBP15), has also been shown to facilitate repair of injured muscle cell membranes.

### Adrenal suppression from vamorolone and prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from the phase 2b clinical trial [^114ZPHBS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Vamorolone causes adrenal suppression, and all patients being treated with vamorolone should be managed for the risk of adrenal insufficiency with medical alert cards, adrenal insufficiency education, and hydrocortisone stress dosing guidelines in times of physiological stress. We also compared the effect on data interpretation using the traditional < 500 nmol/L cut-off vs a revised < 400 nmol/L cut-off for peak standard-dose ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels and demonstrate the importance of establishing a revised cortisol threshold to be used with monoclonal antibody cortisol testing in children; more studies are needed in this regard. Finally, while the peak cortisol response occurred after 60 minutes in most of the participants in our study, we affirm that testing levels at both 30 and 60 minutes in response to standard-dose ACTH is the most effective strategy for capturing the peak stimulated cortisol value.

A second consideration related to ACTH stimulation was the timing of cortisol sampling. Current guidelines and clinical resources suggest testing cortisol at 30- and/or 60-minute time intervals with standard-dose ACTH stimulation testing. We measured cortisol at both 30 and 60 minutes and considered a test to be abnormal if the maximum peak cortisol was below the threshold. Most, but not all, of the ACTH stimulation tests in our study demonstrated maximum peak cortisol levels at 60 minutes. Furthermore, analysis of outcomes demonstrated that several participants would have been classified as having adrenal suppression if cortisol was only measured at 30 minutes. This aligns with previous studies that have demonstrated that peak cortisol typically occurs at 60 minutes and highlights the importance of considering the timing of cortisol sampling when determining a cortisol threshold, a message that was also highlighted in a recent article by Husni et al. To avoid the risk of false positives, testing at both 30 and 60 minutes is proposed. However, for boys treated with vamorolone, we demonstrated that the 30-minute cortisol value was a good predictor of 60-minute cortisol levels, and while we believe that testing at both 30 and 60-minutes is the preferred practice, we have provided an equation (specific to age range herein and vamorolone treatment) that may allow centers that test only at 30 minutes to extrapolate the 60 minutes values in standard dose testing in boys with DMD.

### Comparison of pharmaceutical properties and biological activities of prednisolone, deflazacort, and vamorolone in DMD disease models [^117J6cFt]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

One known side-effect of corticosteroids is suppression of endogenous corticosteroid production. Our results regarding endogenous corticosteroid suppression align with the published data. We demonstrated that all three corticosteroids reduce endogenous corticosteroid production in vivo. While it has been hypothesized that vamorolone does not reduce endogenous corticosteroid production, published data have shown that both prednisolone/prednisone and vamorolone showed concentrations-dependent inhibition of ACTH secretion in a cultured pituitary cell line. Although vamorolone showed less reduction in ACTH secretion compared with prednisolone/prednisone, it is unclear how this difference in vitro correlates quantitatively to endogenous corticosteroid production in vivo. Further, inhibition of endogenous corticosteroids was corroborated in a Phase 2a study where treatment with vamorolone at 6 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks resulted in adrenal suppression. Similarly, in a randomized double-blind 24-week study in boys with DMD (N = 133) vamorolone (dosed 2 mg//kg/day or 6 mg/kg/day) and prednisolone/prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced morning cortisol levels at both 12- and 24-weeks from baseline, with the 2 mg/kg/day showing significantly less reduction in adrenal suppression than prednisone (P < 0.001). Vamorolone administered at 6 mg/kg/day showed significantly greater adrenal suppression than prednisolone/prednisone (P = 0.03) in a trial including DMD boys aged 4–7, but was also equal or more efficacious in preventing DMD-associated loss of muscle function.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized controlled trial [^114T1Nqp]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

We had previously reported that vamorolone and prednisone groups showed similar overall gain in BMI (increase of 0.4–0.5 BMI z score over the initial 24-week treatment period), with high intragroup variability. For the vamorolone-treated participants continuing to the 48-week treatment, the increases in period 1 were seen to stabilize in period 2, with no further substantial increase in BMI z score. It seems that weight gain with chronic vamorolone treatment is variable from patient to patient and that gains occur in the initial 24-week treatment and then stabilize. Note that there is considerable gain in height during the 48-week vamorolone treatment, and with increased strength likely increased muscle mass (although not measured), and this may complicate the interpretation of BMI z score data. We hypothesize that genetic variations (polymorphisms) unrelated to the DMD gene may lead to individual response to weight gain with vamorolone or CS, as has been reported with chronic CS treatment of Addison disease.

Our crossover design did not enable comparison of safety outcomes of prednisone vs vamorolone after 48 weeks of treatment. The VBP15–004 study design was purposefully harmonized with the FOR-DMD study of alternative CS regimens in DMD, and comparisons of efficacy and safety outcomes over a 48-week treatment period between these 2 double-blind trials are a focus of future research.

While TTSTANDV had complete data due to use of remote recorded assessments, other outcomes had data missing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was powered for analysis of the primary endpoint at 24 weeks, and had low sample sizes in the 6 treatment groups, and was underpowered for some analyses at 48 weeks. Last, some of the exploratory results should be treated with caution due to the number of comparisons/exploratory nature of the comparisons with no multiple comparison correction implemented.

In this randomized trial, vamorolone was shown to be safe and effective as treatment in boys with DMD in the age from 4 years to younger than 7 years over a 48-week treatment period. Switching from prednisone to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d dose allowed boys to resume normal growth and experience fewer behavioral problems and fewer adverse effects typically associated with CS use, while maintaining efficacy of motor outcomes.

### Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function [^111Wv5jf]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study vamorolone, a first-in-class steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Methods

An open-label, multiple-ascending-dose study of vamorolone was conducted in 48 boys with DMD (age 4- < 7 years, steroid-naive). Dose levels were 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an oral suspension formulation (12 boys per dose level; one-third to 10 times the glucocorticoid dose in DMD). The primary goal was to define optimal doses of vamorolone. The primary outcome for clinical efficacy was time to stand from supine velocity.

Results

Oral administration of vamorolone at all doses tested was safe and well tolerated over the 24-week treatment period. The 2.0-mg/kg/d dose group met the primary efficacy outcome of improved muscle function (time to stand; 24 weeks of vamorolone treatment vs natural history controls), without evidence of most adverse effects of glucocorticoids. A biomarker of bone formation, osteocalcin, increased in vamorolone-treated boys, suggesting possible loss of bone morbidities seen with glucocorticoids. Biomarker outcomes for adrenal suppression and insulin resistance were also lower in vamorolone-treated patients with DMD relative to published studies of glucocorticoid therapy.

Conclusions

Daily vamorolone treatment suggested efficacy at doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an exploratory 24-week open-label study.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that for boys with DMD, vamorolone demonstrated possible efficacy compared to a natural history cohort of glucocorticoid-naive patients and appeared to be tolerated.

### Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function [^116EmsGj]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Of the 48 patients enrolled in this trial, 43 continue treatment through a 2-year long-term extension study with permitted dose escalation (VBP15-LTE) such that all increased to either the 2.0– or 6.0–mg/kg/d dose. Therefore, patients have ≈12 months of additional high-dose drug exposure (2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d) at the time of writing. Such longer-term studies may enable better assessments of glucocorticoid morbidities such as long bone and vertebral fractures, stunting of growth, and delayed puberty.

A double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vamorolone is currently underway (VBP15–004; NCT03439670). This trial is testing 2 doses of vamorolone (2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d) vs placebo and prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/d) and is enrolling 120 patients (30 per arm) with the same inclusion criteria as the exploratory dose-ranging study described in this report. This ongoing study is designed to provide a higher level of evidence for the efficacy and comparative safety of vamorolone in DMD.

A novel dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, vamorolone, showed evidence of efficacy and reduction of safety concerns typically seen with traditional glucocorticoids in a 48-patient, open-label, exploratory, multiple-ascending-dose study in young patients with DMD.

Testing Outcomes in Glucocorticoid-naïve Boys With DMD — Comparison of Cortisol Thresholds

Data from stimulated cortisol samples in glucocorticoid-naïve boys with DMD, including both baseline visit values from boys in all treatment groups and 24-week data for boys in the placebo group, were analyzed to evaluate cortisol thresholds. These data included 131 ACTH stimulation tests. None of the glucocorticoid-naïve boys had a stimulated cortisol peak < 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL), but 13 (9.9%) ACTH stimulation tests in the glucocorticoid-naïve boys had a cortisol peak < 500 nmol/L (18.1 ng/dL). The lowest peak stimulated cortisol value among the tests in glucocorticoid naïve boys was 444 nmol/L (16.1 ng/dL).

Associations With Cortisol Values

There was little association (Spearman correlations range: −0.2–0.21) between possible prognostic variables (age, 6-minute walk distance, North Star Ambulatory Assessment score, body mass index z-score) and cortisol measurements (morning and ACTH stimulated peak values) at the baseline, week 24, and week 48 visits.

ACTH Stimulation Testing — Timing of Peak Cortisol

There was a total of 262 ACTH stimulation tests performed during the study with samples drawn at both 30 and 60 minutes (baseline = 104 tests; week 24 = 83 tests; week 48 = 75 tests). One outlier was identified; this was a 30-minute stimulated cortisol value that was decreased substantially from the unstimulated cortisol value taken at 0 minutes and with a large rebound at 60 minutes; this may have been a measurement error (due to sample handling or recording issues) and was removed from all analyses. Peak cortisol values overwhelmingly occurred at 60 minutes in 252/261 (96.6%) of the paired 30-minute and 60-minute measurements.

It is noteworthy that if only a 30-minute timepoint ACTH stimulation test measurement had been taken, many participants would have been characterized as having adrenal suppression. Using the 500 nmol/L (18.1 ng/dL) and 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL) thresholds, 27/115 (23.5%) and 24/151 (15.9%) observations were below the threshold at 30 minutes but above the threshold at 60 minutes, respectively. See Supplement 2, 3, and 4 (Tables) for 30- and 60-minute stimulated cortisol values.

At 24 weeks, there were fewer participants classified as having adrenal suppression in the vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day group when compared to the prednisone group using both the 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL) (P = 0.002) and 500 nmol/L (18.1 ng/dL) (P = 0.073) thresholds and when compared to the vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day group using the 400 nmol/L (14.5 ng/dL) (P = 0.005) and 500 nmol/L (18.1 ng/dL) (P = 0.33) thresholds. There was no difference in the number of participants classified as having adrenal suppression in the prednisone vs vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day group using either cortisol threshold (P = 0.46 and P = 1 for the 500 nmol/L and 400 nmol/L, respectively).
