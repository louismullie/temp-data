## Question

carbidopa levidopa timing with protein

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to time carbidopa-levodopa with respect to protein intake, including when to separate doses from meals, when protein redistribution helps, and how to individualize this by disease stage and formulation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic mechanism of levodopa absorption and competition with amino acids. Then, I should verify the magnitude of food effects and the clinical consequences. Next, I will review guideline-based timing recommendations and the evidence for protein redistribution diets. After that, I need to consider disease stage, formulation differences, and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious algorithm and highlight what to monitor and when to escalate care, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against labels and pivotal studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions: levodopa is absorbed in the proximal small intestine via saturable transporters shared with large neutral amino acids, and the same LAT1 transporter system mediates brain uptake, so dietary protein can competitively reduce both intestinal absorption and CNS delivery, which explains postprandial "off" phenomena in fluctuators [^e144fa35] [^2fc662ff] [^e9255500].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of the effect. Taking levodopa with meals can reduce peak plasma concentrations by about 30% on average, and high-protein or high-fat meals can delay absorption and blunt Cmax, which can translate into delayed or attenuated clinical response in patients with motor fluctuations, though the clinical impact varies with disease stage and GI function [^02ef9dee] [^5d44ac91] [^b009fa51].

> I should confirm the core timing principle. Multiple authoritative sources converge on the same recommendation: take levodopa on an empty stomach, either 30 minutes before meals or 1–2 hours after meals, to minimize amino acid competition and maximize bioavailability. This is standard counseling in labels and contemporary reviews, and is echoed in guidelines for later-stage PD where protein effects are more clinically meaningful [^d617a06a] [^02ef9dee] [^0fda7fca].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about restricting total protein. I need to check the evidence for protein redistribution diets. Rather than lowering total protein below the RDA, redistributing protein to the evening while keeping total intake around 0.8–1.0 g/kg/day can reduce daytime large neutral amino acid levels and improve levodopa responsiveness, with studies showing 32–79% improvements in motor outcomes and meaningful reductions in off-time; guidelines endorse PRD for patients with fluctuations while advising against chronic low-protein diets that risk malnutrition [^0d5fc405] [^e85b2b7e] [^0b1e6778].

> Let me consider disease stage carefully. In early PD, taking levodopa with food is often acceptable to mitigate nausea and may not meaningfully impair efficacy, but in later disease with wearing-off or unpredictable "offs", protein timing becomes more critical. Guidelines explicitly advise counseling that meals can impair absorption in later stages, and this is where PRD and stricter separation from protein are most justified [^28143ab1] [^4f8f06a8] [^0b1e6778].

> I should double-check formulation nuances. Immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa is most sensitive to protein timing, whereas extended-release formulations like IPX066/Rytary and IPX203 have different PK profiles and may be less vulnerable to short-term food effects, though high-protein meals can still delay absorption. In advanced disease, non-oral options such as LCIG or subcutaneous levodopa-carbidopa bypass GI protein competition entirely and can stabilize response when oral therapy fails despite optimal timing [^5d44ac91] [^3f2b958d] [^d5f7b71d] [^5af45003].

> But wait, what if GI dysfunction is the real driver. Delayed gastric emptying, constipation, SIBO, and H. pylori can independently impair levodopa absorption and mimic protein effects; optimizing GI function and, when appropriate, using non-oral delivery can mitigate these barriers and reduce the need for overly restrictive protein strategies [^9cd38345] [^98b986d4] [^6c4e34cb].

> I need to ensure safety and nutrition are not overlooked. Chronic low-protein diets below 0.8 g/kg/day risk sarcopenia and weight loss, which are common in PD and associated with worse outcomes; if PRD is used, monitor weight, BMI, and dietary adequacy, and consider dietitian involvement to preserve lean mass while achieving therapeutic goals [^552e4fcf] [^d617a06a].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and sanity-check each element. For patients without significant fluctuations, taking levodopa 30 minutes before or 1–2 hours after meals is reasonable, with food used to reduce nausea if needed. For patients with wearing-off or unpredictable offs, implement PRD with normal total protein shifted to the evening and separate daytime doses from protein by at least 30–60 minutes when feasible. If fluctuations persist despite optimized timing and PRD, evaluate for GI dysfunction and consider non-oral levodopa delivery. Throughout, reassess motor response, nutrition, and quality of life to individualize the plan [^d617a06a] [^0b1e6778] [^9cd38345].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "never take with protein", but I should correct that. Early PD often tolerates coadministration, and even in later disease, a small carbohydrate snack can be used with levodopa to reduce nausea without substantial amino acid competition; the key is to avoid large protein loads at the time of dosing and to tailor timing to the clinical response rather than a rigid rule [^7b551d0b] [^d617a06a].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities. Track on/off times, dyskinesias, weight, and dietary adherence; watch for unintended weight loss on PRD; and be prepared to adjust levodopa dose if protein interventions improve bioavailability, to avoid excessive dopaminergic stimulation and dyskinesias. If response remains suboptimal, escalate to non-oral therapies or address GI contributors rather than further restricting protein below nutritional safety thresholds [^d617a06a] [^552e4fcf] [^9cd38345].

Take carbidopa-levodopa **30 minutes before or 1–2 hours after meals** [^d617a06a] to minimize protein competition and maximize absorption [^02ef9dee]. If nausea occurs, take it with a **small, low-protein snack** (e.g. crackers or toast) [^d617a06a] [^e0ef23ba]. In patients with motor fluctuations, consider a **protein redistribution diet** (most protein at dinner) [^0b1e6778] [^0d5fc405] while maintaining total protein intake ≥ 0.8 g/kg/day [^d617a06a] [^552e4fcf]. Avoid high-protein meals near dosing, and monitor for weight loss or malnutrition if restricting protein [^552e4fcf].

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between levodopa and dietary protein

Levodopa is absorbed in the proximal small intestine via a **saturable, competitive transport system** shared with large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) (e.g. phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine) [^e144fa35] [^e9255500]. High-protein meals increase LNAA concentrations, which can competitively inhibit levodopa absorption, reducing bioavailability and causing motor fluctuations ("on-off" phenomena) [^02ef9dee] [^2fc662ff]. This competition also occurs at the blood–brain barrier, further limiting CNS levodopa delivery [^2fc662ff].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting timing recommendations

Clinical studies show that taking levodopa with protein-rich meals can **reduce peak plasma concentrations by ~30%** and delay absorption, worsening motor fluctuations [^02ef9dee]. Separating levodopa from protein intake improves absorption and clinical response, especially in patients with motor fluctuations [^e85b2b7e].

---

## General timing recommendations

Standard recommendation: take carbidopa-levodopa **30 minutes before or 1–2 hours after meals** to minimize protein interference and maximize absorption [^d617a06a] [^02ef9dee]. If nausea occurs, take it with a **small, low-protein snack** (e.g. crackers, toast, applesauce) to reduce GI upset without significant protein competition [^d617a06a] [^e0ef23ba].

---

## Special considerations for patients with motor fluctuations

Patients with motor fluctuations may benefit from **protein redistribution diets** (PRD), shifting most protein to the evening meal while keeping total protein intake ≥ 0.8 g/kg/day to avoid malnutrition [^0b1e6778] [^d617a06a]. PRD can improve levodopa response and reduce "off" time, but should be supervised by a dietitian to prevent deficiencies [^e85b2b7e] [^552e4fcf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Canadian Neurological Sciences Federation (CNSF) recommend:

- **Early PD**: taking levodopa with meals is usually not problematic, though separation may improve absorption [^28143ab1] [^4f8f06a8].
- **Advanced PD**: counsel patients that protein intake can impair levodopa absorption; consider PRD and timing strategies [^28143ab1] [^0b1e6778].
- **General advice**: maintain adequate protein intake (~0.8 g/kg/day) and avoid excessive restriction to prevent malnutrition [^d617a06a] [^552e4fcf].

---

## Practical strategies for implementation

- **Patient education**: explain the protein interaction and provide written instructions on timing and low-protein snack options [^d617a06a].
- **Dietitian involvement**: tailor PRD plans, ensure nutritional adequacy, and monitor for weight loss or deficiencies [^d617a06a] [^552e4fcf].
- **Medication adjustment**: if timing changes improve absorption, consider dose adjustments to avoid dyskinesias [^d617a06a] [^1e3c1204].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of protein restriction

Benefits include improved levodopa absorption, reduced motor fluctuations, and better symptom control, particularly with PRD [^e85b2b7e] [^0d5fc405]. Risks include **nutritional deficiencies**, weight loss, and malnutrition if protein is overly restricted; monitor closely and adjust as needed [^552e4fcf] [^d617a06a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| General use | Take 30 minutes before or 1–2 hours after meals [^d617a06a] [^02ef9dee] |
| Nausea management | Take with small, low-protein snack (crackers, toast) [^d617a06a] [^e0ef23ba] |
| Motor fluctuations | Consider protein redistribution diet (most protein at dinner) [^0b1e6778] [^0d5fc405] |
| Protein intake | Maintain ≥ 0.8 g/kg/day to avoid malnutrition [^d617a06a] [^552e4fcf] |

---

Optimal carbidopa-levodopa timing relative to protein intake is **30 minutes before or 1–2 hours after meals** to minimize protein competition and maximize absorption [^d617a06a] [^02ef9dee]. In patients with motor fluctuations, consider a protein redistribution diet with continued monitoring for nutritional risks [^0b1e6778] [^552e4fcf].

Box 1 Considerations for managing diet, medications and gastrointestinal issues in PwP

Dietary Assessment
Take levodopa on an empty stomach 30 min before or 2 h after a meal.
Assess possible food-drug interactions, by recording at least a 1-day dietary recall that includes amount/type of foods and drinks consumed, timing of meals, medications, and motor fluctuations.
If motor fluctuations present, consider appropriateness of PRD with protein intake at least 0.8 g/kg/body weight. Monitor body weight and dyskinesias.
Avoid use of low-protein diets (< 0.8 g/kg/day) to prevent loss of lean body mass.
Administer levodopa with a small carbohydrate snack (i.e. crackers, toast, applesauce, etc.) to reduce nausea after administration.
High fiber diet and adequate hydration for constipation management to improve levodopa bioavailability.
Low-fat diet for gastroparesis management to improve levodopa bioavailability.
Consider dietitian referral for diet assessment and education for PwP.

Medication Dosing and Timing
Educate PwP/care partners on indication, dose, frequency, administration times, what to do if missed dose, food and drug interactions, and potential adverse effects.
Consider other formulations of levodopa delivery such as half tablets, extended-release orally disintegrating, transdermal or enterally administered to improve levodopa bioavailability.
To prevent nausea, carbidopa may reduce side effects if available. A minimum daily dose of 75 mg is required to prevent peripheral conversion. Domperidone or trimethobenzamide can also be considered.
Monitor and adjust levodopa dosage when implementing interventions that improve bioavailability to reduce dyskinesias.
Consider pharmacist referral for medication therapy management and education.

Gastrointestinal Function
Conditions such as gastroparesis, SIBO and/or constipation may impair levodopa absorption.
Change in diet habits due to poor oral health (masticatory difficulties), anosmia, ageusia, and dysphagia may challenge dietary interventions and increase risk for weight loss.
Stool softeners, bulk-producing and osmotic laxatives and suppositories should be used as needed for constipation management to improve levodopa bioavailabilty.
Consider speech language pathologist and/or gastroenterology referral(s).

Introduction

Often utilized early and throughout the course of Parkinson's disease (PD), orally administered levodopa (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) is a precursor for dopamine and considered to be the standard pharmacologic treatment for management of PD symptoms. While levodopa has been investigated in human studies as early as the 1960s, optimization of delivery and absorption remain critical issues – particularly in people living with PD (PwP) who experience suboptimal improvements in motor symptoms and advanced disease. Levodopa (unlike peripheral dopamine) is transported via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, enters systemic circulation and is eventually transported across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) where it is later converted to dopamine for utilization. To improve absorption and prevent early (peripheral) conversion to dopamine, levodopa is usually co-administered with carbidopa or benserazide. Furthermore, levodopa is catabolized by the enzyme catecholamine- O -methyltransferase (COMT) to form 3- O -methyldopa (3-OMD) which may inhibit levodopa metabolism to form dopamine. An increase in plasma levodopa levels has been documented with matched motor response in PwP, and remains a useful tool for studying levodopa pharmacokinetics. Other factors that have been associated with levodopa bioavailability include age, sex, race, and low body mass index (BMI), which highlights the importance of dose customization –.

Dietetic approaches for levodopa and protein interactions

Levodopa is often recommended to be taken on an empty stomach 20–30 min before or 1–2 h after meals to improve bioavailability(Box 1). The rationale for this timing is due to the increased likelihood for delayed transit time and competition with large neutral amino acids when taken with meals, as this may result in a significant decrease in peak plasma concentrations of 30% on average. Because similar mechanisms for levodopa transport also occur at the BBB, this competition may also contribute to post-prandial motor fluctuations. In PD, large cross-sectional studies have reported average protein intake is around 1.2 g/kg/day (1.5-fold higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowances [RDA])and correlated with a higher daily levodopa dose. For PwP who experience significant motor fluctuations, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) have included LPD and PRD as potential complementary therapeutic diets for PD management in their guidelines –.

Intestinal levodopa and dietary protein absorption

In the peripheral tissues (e.g. GI tract and systemic circulation), there is increased metabolism of levodopa to dopamine by the vitamin B6-dependent enzyme, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). To prevent early conversion to dopamine in the peripheral tissues by AADC, AADC inhibitors (e.g. carbidopa or benserazide) are co-administered with levodopa to improve bioavailability, thus decreasing the cumulative therapeutic dose and subsequent degree of peripheral side effects. When administered, levodopa is considered to be a large neutral amino acid and structurally similar to other aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and its absorption primarily occurs in the proximal intestine.

The rate of gastric transit and sex differences can pose significant challenges to levodopa delivery. GI dysfunction is a common non-motor symptom in PD and highly prevalent in up to 80% of PwP. Constipation and gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying) are among the more common GI symptoms in PwP. While fasting levodopa time to peak absorption (t max) is rapid ranging from 15 to 60 min, delayed gastric emptying and constipation can significantly increase the t max and decrease the maximum peak concentration (C max) of the drug. This reduction in C max is possibly due to increased pre-systemic decarboxylation of levodopa by AADC, reducing bioavailability and absorption. While PwP are predominately male, pharmacokinetic studies have shown that women have a higher area under the curve (AUC) and C max even after adjusting for body weight. It is posited from these studies that differences may be due to variations in hormones (i.e. estrogen status), body weight/BMI and composition, and COMT activity. Subsequently, dyskinesias are more prevalent in women likely due to higher levodopa bioavailability –.

### Label: CARBIDOPA tablet… [^08616dd4]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

When carbidopa tablet is to be given to carbidopa-naive patients who are being treated with levodopa, the two drugs should be given at the same time, starting with no more than 20 to 25% of the previous daily dosage of levodopa when given without carbidopa tablets. At least twelve hours should elapse between the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa. See the WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections before initiating therapy. Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Carbidopa has not been demonstrated to have any overt pharmacodynamic actions in the recommended doses. It does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier readily and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system at doses of carbidopa that are recommended for maximum effective inhibition of peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa.

Since its decarboxylase-inhibiting activity is limited primarily to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain. However, since levodopa and carbidopa compete with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa and carbidopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet. Pharmacokinetics Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid. In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of separate tablets of carbidopa and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion to the excretion of dopamine when compared to the two drugs administered at separate times.

When carbidopa is to be given to carbidopa-naive patients who are being treated with levodopa alone, the two drugs should be given at the same time. At least twelve hours should elapse between the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa in combination. Start with no more than one-fifth to one-fourth of the previous daily dosage of levodopa when given without carbidopa. See the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section before initiating therapy.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Rytary) [^5d44ac91]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect of Food

In healthy adults, oral administration of RYTARY after a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced Cmaxapproximately 21% and increased AUCinfapproximately 13% for levodopa compared to administration in the fasted state. There may be a delay by 2 hours in the absorption of levodopa when RYTARY is taken with a high-fat, high-calorie meal. In addition, absorption of levodopa may be decreased by a high protein meal.

Specific Populations

Elderly

In pharmacokinetics studies following a single-dose of RYTARY, the peak concentrations of carbidopa and levodopa are generally similar between younger (45 to 60 years) and older (60 to 75 years) subjects.

Gender

In pharmacokinetics studies following a single-dose of RYTARY:

Carbidopa

At comparable doses females are reported to have higher carbidopa peak concentrations and systemic exposure (approximately 33%) compared to males. Median time to peak concentration and terminal half-life are comparable between males and females.

Levodopa

At comparable doses females are reported to have higher levodopa peak concentrations (approximately 23% to 33%) and systemic exposure (approximately 33% to 37%) compared to males. Median time to peak concentration and terminal half-life are comparable between males and females.

Low protein diets (LPD)

There is no standard definition adopted for LPD but is generally accepted as limiting protein consumption below the RDA for adults (< 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day). With the exception of 2 studies, the use of LPD has not been thoroughly investigated. Both trials were single arm, controlled feeding studies consisting of multi-phase interventions including low protein (10 g/day or 0.5 g/kg body weight), normal protein (1.0 g/kg body weight) or high protein (2.0 g/kg body weight). In the study by Gillespie et al. the multi-phase interventions were implemented with either levodopa alone or levodopa combined with an unspecified peripheral inhibitor. Timing of levodopa with meals was not reported. The authors noted body weight did not significantly differ during the interventions (data unreported). Participants (n = 8) reported discomfort consuming 10 g/day and 2.0 g/kg body weight while other diet phases including 0.5 g/kg/day were acceptable. Authors concluded the LPD tended to "potentiate and stabilize the therapeutic effect of levodopa" but no motor disability scales or scores were reported. In general, prolonged protein intake of 10 g/day is not recommended due to inability to satisfy whole body protein turnover and increase risk of deficiency.

Mena et al. whom further reported on protein intakes of 10 g/day and 0.5 g/kg body weight in 7 participants. When compared to the run-in phase (1.0 g/kg body weight), both protein intakes of 10 g/day and 0.5 g/kg/body weight resulted in reduction of New York University Scale scores of approximately 8 and 3 points, respectively. Of the participants followed for 2 months (n = 4) to 1 year (n = 3), consuming protein intakes of 0.5 g/kg/body weight resulted in 70% of participants reported satisfaction with diet and 30% reporting no improvement. Limitations of these studies also include small sample sizes, missing data, lack of randomization and variability in response amongst participants. Conflicting consensus exists between the AAN and ESPEN guidelines with ESPEN not supporting use of LPD in the absence of high-quality trials –.

### Carbidopa levodopa (Dhivy) [^e0ef23ba]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting dosage of DHIVY is one 25 mg /100 mg tablet taken orally three times a day. (2.1)
Dosage may be increased by up to one whole tablet every day or every other day, as needed, until a maximum dosage of eight whole tablets of DHIVY a day is reached. (2.1)
Swallow DHIVY with or without food. (2.3)

2.1 Initial Dosage and Maintenance of Therapy

The recommended starting dosage of DHIVY is one 25 mg / 100 mg tablet taken orally three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per day. Dosage may be increased by up to one whole tablet every day or every other day, as needed to a maximum daily dosage of eight whole tablets.

Dosing with DHIVY should be individualized and adjusted according to clinical response and tolerability. The tablet is functionally scored to facilitate dose adjustment. At least 70 mg to 100 mg of carbidopa per day should be provided. Experience with total daily dosages of carbidopa greater than 200 mg is limited.

Monitor patients closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements may occur with DHIVY, which may require dosage reduction. Blepharospasm may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients.

Maintain patients on the lowest dosage required to achieve symptomatic control and to minimize adverse reactions, such as dyskinesia and nausea.

2.2 Discontinuation of DHIVY

Avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction of DHIVY. The daily dosage of DHIVY should be tapered at the time of treatment discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

If general anesthesia is required, DHIVY may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medication by mouth. If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and the usual daily dosage may be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication.

2.3 Administration Information

Swallow DHIVY with or without food. The patient should be advised that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying, thus delaying the absorption of levodopa.

If the patient has difficulty swallowing the tablet due to its size, the tablet can be broken at the score lines.

### Carbidopa levodopa (Dhivy) [^b009fa51]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following single oral administration of a DHIVY tablet, DHIVY was shown to be bioequivalent to an immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg tablet under fasting conditions for both carbidopa and levodopa.

Absorption

Following oral dosing of DHIVY under fasted conditions, the maximum concentration occurred at 3 hours for carbidopa and 1 hour for levodopa. The exposure of DHIVY after dose fractionation is proportional.

Effect of Food

In healthy adults, oral administration of DHIVY after a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced levodopa Cmaxby approximately 25% while the AUC remained unchanged. The peak concentration of both carbidopa/levodopa were observed approximately 30 minutes later when DHIVY is taken with a high-fat, high-calorie meal.

Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Distribution

Carbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma proteins. Levodopa is approximately 10% to 30% bound to plasma proteins.

Elimination

Following oral dosing of DHIVY under fasted conditions, the half-life was reported at approximately 3.5 hours for carbidopa and 2 hours for levodopa.

Additional considerations to improve levodopa response

There are additional factors at play which affect the levodopa response of PwP that should be addressed in addition to dietary protein interactions (Box 1). These include understanding the importance of medication adherence and timing for PwP and their care partners. Similarly, an understanding of the impact of other nutrition-related and GI factors on symptom fluctuations should be addressed (Fig. 2). Consulting a gastroenterologist or various allied health professionals including pharmacists, dietitians, and speech/swallow pathologists may be considered.

Fig. 2
Factors that influence pharmacokinetics and response of levodopa.

IR Immediate-release, CR Continuous-release, ER Extended-release, SIBO Small intestine bacterial overgrowth, H.pylori Helicobacter pylori, BMI Body mass index.

Medication management and education

In addition to addressing dietary protein interactions with levodopa, optimization of medication therapy through effective medication education of PwP and their care partners, consistent medication adherence, and proper administration of medications may mitigate symptom fluctuations and improve quality of life in PwP. Helping with aids for compliance and working with a pharmacist with instructions tailored to cognitive and cultural context is key. When motor response to orally administered levodopa is suboptimal, alternative formulations (immediate vs. continuous vs. extended) and routes of administration (enteral vs. transdermal vs. inhaled) may be considered. These alternatives may compete differently with dietary proteins at both the intestine and BBB. The amount of amino acid competition that occurs at the BBB with subcutaneous or inhaled levodopa has not been well established. The lack of competition with protein at the intestine and BBB may be a theoretical advantage for the choice of dopamine agonists in various formulations ranging from oral to patch to infusion (i.e. apomorphine pumps) over levodopa preparations and needs to be further investigated.

Gastrointestinal dysfunction

Beyond the current guidelines of taking levodopa on an empty stomach, PwP may still choose to take the drug with food to avoid GI side effects such as nausea and lightheadedness. Some report difficulties with timing medication away from meals especially when levodopa dose frequency exceeds 3–4 times per day. Exogenous factors that may influence gastric rate and levodopa bioavailability include pH-lowering medications (e.g. antacids and protein pump inhibitors)and gut microbial interactions such as Helicobacter pylori infections and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Host-microbiome interactions are a growing area of research, including the responsiveness and delivery of levodopa medications in the GI tract. Certain species of gut bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus brevis) express tyrosine decarboxylase which can convert levodopa to dopamine peripherally and may contribute to heterogenous responses and side effects of levodopa administration. Interestingly, investigations of genetically-engineered probiotic bacteria is an emerging area of research for improving levodopa delivery. Nutrition interventions that aim to improve GI dysfunction such as constipation (high fiber diet and adequate fluids) and/or gastroparesis (low fat diet) may improve levodopa bioavailability. Other GI symptoms such as anosmia, ageusia and dysphagia in PwP can complicate implementation of dietary interventions due to decreased appetite and reduced food and fluid intake.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Crexont) [^88711f88]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect of Food

Carbidopa

In healthy adults, oral administration of CREXONT after a high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased both Cmaxand AUC by approximately 64% for carbidopa compared to administration in the fasted state. The peak plasma concentrations of carbidopa were observed approximately one hour later when CREXONT is taken with a high-fat high-calorie meal.

Levodopa

In healthy adults, oral administration of CREXONT after a high-fat, high-calorie meal increased Cmaxapproximately 19% and AUC0-∞approximately 18% for levodopa compared to administration in the fasted state [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The peak plasma concentrations of levodopa were observed approximately two hours later when CREXONT is taken with a high-fat, high-calorie meal. In addition, absorption of levodopa may be decreased by a high protein meal.

Distribution

Approximately 36% of carbidopa binds to plasma proteins. Approximately 10% to 30% of levodopa binds to plasma proteins.

Metabolism and Elimination

Carbidopa

The terminal phase elimination half-life of carbidopa is approximately 2 hours.

Carbidopa is metabolized to two main metabolites: α-methyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and α-methyl-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylpropionic acid. These two metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine unchanged or as a glucuronide. Unchanged carbidopa accounts for 30% of the total urinary excretion.

Information for Patients

It is important that carbidopa with levodopa be taken at regular intervals according to the schedule outlined by the health care provider. Caution patients not to change the prescribed dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other carbidopa-levodopa preparations without first consulting a physician.

Advise patients that sometimes a 'wearing-off' effect may occur at the end of the dosing interval. Tell patients to notify the prescriber if such response poses a problem to lifestyle.

Patients should be advised that occasionally dark color (red, brown, or black) may appear in saliva, urine, or sweat after ingestion of carbidopa and levodopa. Although the color appears to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored.

The patient should be advised that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multivitamin tablets) may also reduce the amount of levodopa available in the body. The above factors may reduce the clinical effectiveness of the carbidopa and levodopa therapy.

Alert patients to the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including levodopa. Advise patients to exercise caution while driving or operating machinery and that if they have experience somnolence and/or sudden sleep onset, they must refrain from these activities. (See WARNINGS, Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence General .)

There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, including carbidopa and levodopa. Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping carbidopa and levodopa if a patient develops such urges while taking carbidopa with carbidopa-levodopa (See PRECAUTIONS, Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors).

### To restrict or not to restrict? Practical considerations for optimizing dietary protein interactions on levodopa absorption in Parkinson's disease [^8f04bc57]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and response to chronic levodopa treatment, coupled with dietary protein interactions remain a challenge for management of PD symptoms. PRD (and not LPD) may be an effective treatment approach for managing dietary protein interactions. Daily protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/body weight is adequate and routine assessment of motor symptoms and nutritional status could reduce complications of PRD. However, limitations exist within available evidence including absence of control groups, short trial durations and heterogenous study designs. Given these limitations, high-quality randomized, controlled trials are still warranted for PRD. Factors that should be considered in future research include disease stage and progression, dietary habits, body weight, duration of motor fluctuations, as well as the interactions of sex, race and genetic influences, co-medications & comorbidities. Medication management (including education) and GI dysfunction should also be addressed to improve levodopa pharmacokinetics, if warranted. This paper highlights the need to investigate and better understand the many underlying nutritional and pharmacokinetic factors before increasing levodopa dosing for PwP who experience motor fluctuations. Based on the current review, there are many gaps in knowledge that warrant timely attention until conclusive recommendations on dietary protein and PRD can be made for PwP.

### Patients' experience with and perspectives on long-term use of continuous subcutaneous infusion of foslevodopa / foscarbidopa in Parkinson's disease [^5f9ecb26]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopaminergic neurons degenerate in the substantia nigra pars compacta, among other regions, impairing the brain's control of body movement. In addition to motor symptoms such as tremor and bradykinesia, PD features nonmotor symptoms, such as depression and sleep disturbances. The disease is progressive, with symptom severity worsening, resulting in increased patient burden and loss of independence; caregiver burden; and economic burden.

The gold standard treatment for PD is levodopa-carbidopa (LD/CD), which is highly effective in the early stages of PD. However, as the disease advances, dopaminergic neurons lose their buffering capacity and challenges such as gastroparesis, dysphagia, and dietary protein absorption complicate treatment with oral medication. Over time, oral LD/CD is associated with irregular, pulsatile dopamine stimulation; most PwP eventually develop motor complications, with "On" periods of symptom improvement after a levodopa dose and "Off" periods where symptoms reemerge. Commonly, PwP need more frequent (ie, every few hours) and higher doses of levodopa and must carefully time protein consumption around their pill-taking schedule, which can negatively impact medication adherence and constrain patients' day-to-day lives. People with Parkinson's (PwP) may avoid leaving the home because of the unpredictability of their PD symptoms or fear of stigma.

### Pharmacokinetics of inhaled levodopa administered with oral carbidopa in the fed state in patients with Parkinson's disease [^d85d6af6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Levodopa (LD) is the most effective oral pharmacotherapy for the management of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. However, LD use is complicated by a progressive shortening of the duration of efficacy of a dose, resulting in episodes of inadequate responsiveness, or OFF periods. OFF periods may also occur unpredictably, partly due to the pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of oral LD, resulting from gastrointestinal dysfunction and from the effects of food on absorption. CVT-301 is a levodopa inhalation powder for the treatment of OFF period symptoms in patients on oral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor/LD. PK and safety profiles of single dose CVT-301, administered with oral carbidopa (CD) and oral CD/LD, were examined in patients with Parkinson's disease in the fed state.

Methods

Eligible patients were aged 30–85 years, with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and a body mass index of 18–32 kg/m², and were receiving treatment with a stable regimen that included oral CD/LD (25/100 mg) (total LD, ≤ 800 mg/d). A high-fat/protein meal was eaten 4–5 h after the administration of the morning oral CD/LD dose. Blood samples for predose PK analysis were obtained after the meal, followed by a single inhaled dose of CVT-301 84 mg (+25 mg of oral CD) or oral CD/LD (25/100 mg) or vice versa in 2 dosing periods in a crossover design. Blood was sampled at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 h postdose. Tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events.

Findings

Twenty-three patients were enrolled (65.2% male; 87.0% white; mean age, 69.3 years; mean body mass index, 26.9 kg/m 2; mean Parkinson's disease duration, 8.2 years; mean baseline LD dosage, 460.9 mg/d; 73.9% at Hoehn and Yahr stage < 2.5). PK analyses were based on LD concentrations without baseline adjustment. Median T max values with CVT-301 and oral CD/LD were 15 and 120 min (P < 0.001). C max with CVT-301 was lower than with oral CD/LD (590.3 vs 844.3 ng/mL). C 10min and C 30min values with CVT-301 were approximately twice those with CD/LD (522.9 and 531.5 ng/mL vs 247.3 and 300.9 ng/mL, respectively). %CV for C 5min to C max with CVT-301 was lower than that with oral CD/LD. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was cough (CVT-301, 7 patients [30.4%]; oral CD/LD, 1 patient [4.5%]).

Implications

PK properties showed that CVT-301 was more rapidly absorbed, with higher plasma LD concentrations in the first 45 min, and demonstrated lower interpatient variability, than was oral CD/LD in the fed condition. The study findings suggest that CVT-301 can be used without regard to food intake. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03887884.

Levodopa and amino acid competition at the blood-brain barrier

The bioavailability of levodopa within systemic circulation prior to crossing the BBB is considered one of the main determinants of levodopa pharmacokinetics. Circulating amino acids (both endogenous and exogenous) can be transported across the BBB by a variety of amino acid transport systems. Similar to intestinal absorption, levodopa has been shown to cross the BBB via the sodium-dependent antiporter, LAT1-4F2hc (SLC7A5-SLC3A2) expressed on endothelial cells, (Fig. 1). Once levodopa crosses the BBB via LAT1, AADC functions to convert levodopa to dopamine, ultimately activating the dopaminergic systems within the brain. The transport rate of LAT1 has been shown to be influenced by the presence of intracellular amino acids as well as presence of thyroid hormone and other drugs such as gabapentin. LAT1 does differ from other LAT transporters in the peripheral tissues (i.e. LAT2) as it displays even greater affinity for amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan and leucine. These amino acids are found commonly in protein-containing foods and supplements which may drive further competition for levodopa absorption when administered with meals.

The effect of plasma amino acid concentration (with or without meals) and inhibition of levodopa at the BBB has been described in 4 studies using both animal models and clinical studies in PwP. Using MPTP-induced parkinsonian monkeys, Alexander et al. investigated the effect of levodopa and LNAA influx comparing striatal extracellular fluid (ECF) as a ratio to plasma levodopa. As expected, co-infusion of LNAA and an oral high protein meal (given prior to infusion) inhibited uptake of levodopa by 54–75% and 17–56%, respectively. Differences were not seen between control and MPTP-induced monkeys suggesting the transport rate may not always be disease-specific. Two studies have measured levodopa and amino acid competition using positron emission tomography (PET) and demonstrated co-administration of amino acids led to a reduction of levodopa uptake compared to fasting in humans and plasma LNAA concentrations were negatively correlated (r² = 0.51) with BBB influx rates in monkeys. It should be noted that timing of dietary protein interventions in all studies was either via co-infusion or before levodopa administration. Because half-life of levodopa in both plasma and striatal ECF were noted to be approximately 30 min, future studies should aim to investigate carry over effects of dietary protein interactions when levodopa is administrated in a fasted state.

Protein redistribution diets (PRD)

PRD diets have been more extensively investigated in the literature than LPD. Similar to LPD, there is no consensus for recommended amounts of protein in PRD, but redistribution is defined as limiting protein intake at breakfast and lunch with no quantitative restrictions of protein content at dinner. Early work by Pincus et al. described one of the first PRD protocols which aimed to characterize the effect of a low protein phase (7 g) during the daytime (8:00 am–4:00 pm) on levodopa pharmacokinetics when compared to a high protein phase (160 g) in 15 participants. Food intake in the evening was not specifically reported. During the daytime, plasma LNAA were significantly lower in the low protein phase as well as increased sensitivity to levodopa and improvements in disability scores were observed.

Further, PRD diets on levodopa response in PwP have been documented in 10 studies. Seven studies,– implemented interventions with total protein intake between 30 and 80 g/day. Only 3 studies, implemented interventions with protein intake based on body weight between 0.8 and 1.0 g/kg/day. Redistribution in all studies was typically defined as protein intake between 0 and 10 g during the day (including breakfast and lunch) and the remaining amount of protein consumed at dinner. Control diets were absent in 6 studies – and outcomes were compared to participants baseline values. The remaining studies, with control diet phases included either normal and/or high protein diets with even distribution between meals. Duration of interventions was typically short (< 1 month) with one study investigating feasibility of PRD after 2 years.

Administration of levodopa for Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained the most effective therapy for symptom management despite being in use for over 50 years. Advancing disease and age, changing tolerability and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction may result in change in dietary habits and body weight, as well as unpredictable motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Dietary proteins which convert into amino acids after digestion are implicated as major factors that inhibit levodopa absorption. For people living with PD (PwP) who experience motor fluctuations, low protein diets (LPD) and protein redistribution diets (PRD) may be effective and are often recommended as a non-pharmacologic approach for improving levodopa bioavailability. However, there is a lack of consensus on a standard definition of these diets and appropriate treatment algorithms for usage. This may be due to the paucity of high-level evidence of LPD and PRD in PwP and whether all or specific subgroups of patients would benefit from these strategies. Managing diet and protein intake with proper education and monitoring may reduce complications associated with these diets such as dyskinesias and unintentional weight loss. Additionally, alterations to medications and GI function may alter levodopa pharmacokinetics. In this narrative review we focus on 1) mechanisms of dietary protein and levodopa absorption in the intestine and blood brain barrier, 2) dietetic approaches to manage protein and levodopa interactions and 3) practical issues for treating PwP as well as future directions to be considered.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (carbidopa-levodopa) [^1b3a87b2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal nervous system affecting the mobility and control of the skeletal muscular system. Its characteristic features include resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinetic movements. Symptomatic treatments, such as levodopa therapies, may permit the patient better mobility.

Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease apparently because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Pharmacodynamics

When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect, and these may often be accompanied by nausea and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues.

Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet.

Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system.

The incidence of levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting is less with carbidopa and levodopa than with levodopa. In many patients, this reduction in nausea and vomiting will permit more rapid dosage titration.

Since its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain.

Long term adherence of PRD assessed by Karstaedt et al. appears feasible with 30 out of 43 participants (70%) reporting compliance to diet recommendations after 1–2 years. Adverse effects of PRD were increased prevalence of dyskinesia (requiring reduction of levodopa dosage), and weight loss, which may or may not be desired. Therefore, implementation of PRD should be closely monitored with careful consideration of levodopa dosage, body weight, BMI and total energy and protein intake to reduce unwanted side effects. While benefits were reported for PRD in all studies, data should be interpreted with caution as only 2 out of 10 studies were randomized controlled trials. Generalizability to the larger population of PwP is unknown at this time due to heterogeneous study designs and small sample sizes (n < 20). Therefore, benefits of this diet should be confirmed in larger, randomized controlled studies.

Body weight monitoring and protein intake

Unintentional weight loss and loss of lean body mass should be a consideration for long-term utilization of LPD and PRD in PwP. Low body weight and weight loss have been associated with higher levodopa dose per kilogram of body weight (increasing risks for dyskinesias) and faster decline in motor function, respectively. Discontinuation of PRD due to weight loss was described in 2 studies. However, Barichella et al. reported a PRD is safe when estimated energy requirements are met (−1.8% within 6 months), suggesting monitoring nutritional status may minimize unintentional weight loss of PRD. Malnutrition may be present in up to 24% of PwPand correlated with markers of PD severityand quality of life. PwP are at risk of weight loss and malnutrition due increased symptom-associated hypermetabolism (i.e. tremors, dyskinesias) and decreased caloric intake (i.e. hyposmia, cognitive impairment, GI dysfunction, slowness).

Nitrogen balance studies can assess whole-body catabolism vs. anabolism status using the ratio of estimated nitrogen intake and 24 h urinary nitrogen loss, but this has not been adequately investigated in PwP. One small pilot study reported an average protein intake of 1.1 g/kg/day resulted in net nitrogen loss in PwP compared to healthy controls, indicating increased risk for muscle tissue breakdown. This is consistent with previous guidelines that suggest older adults may require protein intake as high as 1.5 g/kg/day to achieve nitrogen balance and promote adequate muscle protein synthesis. However, these guidelines may not always be appropriate for PwP when considering medication pharmacokinetics and expert consensus is needed to determine appropriate protein intake in this population. Factors (i.e. age, sex, race, levodopa responsiveness, body weight and risk of dyskinesias) should be taken into consideration when determining appropriateness of diet modification. PRD would be ideally initiated when motor fluctuations first occur, prior to increasing levodopa dosages to reduce dyskinesia risks.

Melanoma

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.

For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using carbidopa and levodopa tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).

Information for Patients

The patient should be informed that carbidopa and levodopa tablets is an immediate-release formulation of carbidopa and levodopa that is designed to begin release of ingredients within 30 minutes. It is important that carbidopa and levodopa tablets be taken at regular intervals according to the schedule outlined by the physician. The patient should be cautioned not to change the prescribed dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other carbidopa and levodopa preparations, without first consulting the physician.

Adverse effects of chronic levodopa usage and disease progression include dyskinesias and increased motor fluctuations which can be defined as unpredictable changes from optimal motor control ("ON" period) to decreased motor control in which symptoms reappear ("OFF" periods). Levodopa-induced dyskinesias may appear as early as within the first 6 years from PD diagnosis. These dyskinesias and motor fluctuations can also be accompanied by a host of issues including hypermetabolism, fatigue, dysphagia, low appetite and BMI, and decreased quality of life. Disease progression may also contribute to the need for increased amounts and frequency of levodopa doses due to an elevated "threshold" for therapeutic response after chronic usage and a decrease in the amount of functional dopaminergic neurons. Chronic levodopa absorption is hindered by complex interactions between drug kinetics (including patient-specific parameters), PD pathophysiology (disease progression and GI dysfunction) and food intake (e.g. dietary protein) which can prove challenging for management. Dietary approaches such as low protein (LPD) and protein redistribution diets (PRD) have been proposed over the years to improve levodopa response. Efficacy of LPD and PRD diets have been systematically reviewed within the last decade, but questions remain regarding appropriate treatment algorithms and customization of care to identify those PwP who would benefit the most from these diets. The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss 1) current literature on levodopa and dietary protein pharmacokinetics and interactions, 2) efficacy of LPD and PRD and 3) challenges and limitations for managing these interactions.

Lower and/or improvements in motor symptoms (as measured by clinical scales or amount of "ON/OFF" time) in PwP following a PRD ranged from 32 to 79% depending on the scale used. Barichella et al. reported significant differences between PRD and balanced protein diets on postprandial ON and OFF periods (mean difference approximately 30 and 107 min, respectively). Lowers disability scores with PRD were also reported in 3 studies. Plasma concentrations of levodopa and LNAA after a PRD were also reported. Higher concentrations of LNAA were significant in the high protein vs PRD groups. However, there is conflicting evidence whether PRD improves plasma levodopa concentrations as studies reported either no difference between groups, or higher concentrations with high protein diets. In a separated study by Simon et al. levodopa pharmacokinetics were compared between a low protein breakfast (mean intake of 7.6 g) with a high protein lunch (mean intake of 38.7 g). No differences in t max or C max were observed between groups and significantly higher AUC for the high protein lunch was noted. Post hoc analyses by the authors revealed this effect may be mediated by levodopa dosage and carry over effects of the low protein breakfast as the high protein lunch was correlated with higher trough concentrations. Therefore, it is hypothesized the benefit of PRD may be a result of improved competition at the BBB vs peripherally and should be confirmed in future studies.

Further, a limited number of studies have attempted to identify characteristics of PwP who may benefit the most from modifications in protein intake (diet responders). Usual protein intake prior to implementation of LPD or PRD may influence responsiveness to the intervention (higher vs. lower baseline protein intake) and should be considered. Some studies have reported the most robust benefits of modifying protein intake in PwP who have experienced either shorter duration of motor fluctuations or treatment. Motor fluctuations are associated with younger age of onset, sex and advanced stages of disease (Hoehn & Yahr [H&Y] stage ≥ 3) –. Interestingly, an in silico GI computational model of levodopa pharmacokinetics demonstrated H&Y stage 3 and 4 may benefit the most from modifications in protein intake (LPD or PRD). LPD did not show any benefit for the predicted AUC, while PRD was predicted to increase AUC compared to fasted and LPD.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Duopa) [^d5f7d71d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Carbidopa

When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. Carbidopa inhibits the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa, making more levodopa available for delivery to the brain.

Levodopa

Levodopa is the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa treats the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Because its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available to the brain. The addition of carbidopa to levodopa reduces the peripheral effects (e.g., nausea and vomiting) due to decarboxylation of levodopa; however, carbidopa does not decrease the adverse reactions due to the central effects of levodopa.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of carbidopa and levodopa with 16-hour intrajejunal infusion of DUOPA was evaluated in 18 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who had been on DUOPA therapy for 30 days or longer. Patients remained on their individualized DUOPA doses.

The plasma concentrations versus time profile for levodopa with DUOPA 16-hour intrajejunal infusion is presented in Figure 1.

Absorption and Bioavailability

Following initiation of the 16-hour intrajejunal infusion of DUOPA, peak plasma levels of levodopa is reached at 2.5 hours. The absorption of levodopa may be decreased in patients on a high-protein diet because levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall. The gastric emptying rate does not influence the absorption of DUOPA since it is administered by continuous intestinal infusion. In a cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, DUOPA had comparable bioavailability to the oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (25/100 mg) tablets (over-encapsulated tablets). The estimated bioavailability for levodopa from DUOPA relative to oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets was 97% (95% confidence interval; 95% to 98%).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets has been studied in healthy subjects (age 45 years to 75 years). Overall, following administration of corresponding doses of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone as carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets or as carbidopa and levodopa product plus Comtan (entacapone) tablets, the mean plasma concentrations of levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone are comparable.

Absorption and Distribution

Both levodopa and entacapone are rapidly absorbed and eliminated, and their distribution volume is moderately small. Carbidopa is absorbed and eliminated slightly more slowly compared with levodopa and entacapone. There are substantial inter- and intra-individual variations in the absorption of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone, particularly concerning its Cmax.

The food-effect on the carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablet has not been evaluated. Because levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients after eating a high protein meal. Meals rich in large neutral amino acids may delay and reduce the absorption of levodopa [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Mechanism of Action

Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal nervous system affecting the mobility and control of the skeletal muscular system. Its characteristic features include resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinetic movements. Symptomatic treatments, such as levodopa therapies, may permit the patient better mobility.

Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease apparently because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Pharmacodynamics

When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect, and these may often be accompanied by nausea and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues.

Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet.

Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system.

Since its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain.

Patients treated with levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease may develop motor fluctuations characterized by end-of-dose failure, peak dose dyskinesia, and akinesia. The advanced form of motor fluctuations ('on-off' phenomenon) is characterized by unpredictable swings from mobility to immobility. Although the causes of the motor fluctuations are not completely understood, in some patients they may be attenuated by treatment regimens that produce steady plasma levels of levodopa.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Whether given with carbidopa-levodopa or with levodopa, the optimal daily dosage of carbidopa must be determined by careful titration. Most patients respond to a 1:10 proportion of carbidopa and levodopa, provided the daily dosage of carbidopa is 70 mg or more a day. The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa should not exceed 200 mg, since clinical experience with larger dosages is limited. If the patient is taking carbidopa-levodopa, the amount of carbidopa in carbidopa-levodopa should be considered when calculating the total amount of carbidopa to be administered each day.

Patients Receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa Who Require Additional Carbidopa

Some patients taking carbidopa-levodopa may not have adequate reduction in nausea and vomiting when the dosage of carbidopa is less than 70 mg a day, and the dosage of levodopa is less than 700 mg a day. When these patients are taking carbidopa-levodopa, 25 mg of carbidopa may be given with the first dose of carbidopa-levodopa each day. Additional doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg may be given during the day with each dose of carbidopa-levodopa. Carbidopa may be given with any dose of carbidopa-levodopa as required for optimum therapeutic response. The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa, given as carbidopa and as carbidopa-levodopa, should not exceed 200 mg.

Patients Requiring Individual Titration of Carbidopa and Levodopa Dosage

Although carbidopa-levodopa is the most frequently used of carbidopa and levodopa administration, there may be an occasional patient who requires individually titrated doses of these two drugs. In these patients, carbidopa should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg three or four times a day. The two drugs should be given at the same time, starting with no more than one-fifth (20%) to one-fourth (25%) of the previous or recommended daily dosage of levodopa when given without carbidopa. In patients already receiving levodopa therapy, at least twelve hours should elapse between the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa. A convenient way to initiate therapy in these patients is in the morning following a night when the patient has not takenlevodopa for at least twelve hours. Health care providers who prescribe separate doses of carbidopa and levodopa should be thoroughly familiar with the directions for use of each drug.

The patient should be informed that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying, thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multivitamin tablets) may also reduce the amount of levodopa available to the body. The above factors may reduce the clinical effectiveness of the levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa therapy.

Patients must be advised that the whole or half tablet should be swallowed without chewing or crushing.

Patients should be alerted to the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including levodopa. Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machinery and that if they have experienced somnolence and/or sudden sleep onset, they must refrain from these activities (see WARNINGS: Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence).

There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, including carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges or other urges while being treated with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Patients should inform their physician if they experience new or increased gambling urges, increased sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release.

Transport of levodopa and free amino acids across the intestine, blood, and brain.

Dietary proteins are broken down to free amino acids (yellow circles and squares) may compete with levodopa absorption. a When taken with meals, levodopa is competitively inhibited by neutral and cationic amino acids for uptake by b 0,+ AT-rBAT (SLC7A9-SLC3A1) decreasing transport across enterocytes by LAT2-4F2hc (SLC7A8-SLC3A2). After entering systemic circulation, transport across endothelial cells of the BBB by LAT1-4F2hc (SLC7A5-SLC3A2) may be reduced due to amino acid competition. b When taken on an empty stomach, levodopa is transported by b 0,+AT-rBAT (SLC7A9-SLC3A1) and exits the basolateral side primarily by TAT1 (SLC16A10) and LAT2-4F2hc (SLC7A8-SLC3A2). Levodopa enters systemic circulation and transported across the BBB by LAT1-4F2hc (SLC7A5-SLC3A2) where it is metabolized into dopamine or 3-OMD. c Early peripheral metabolism of levodopa is prevented by co-administration of AADC and/or COMT inhibitors. L-DOPA, levodopa; AADC, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase; COMT, catecholamine- O -methyltransferase; 3-OMD, 3- O -methyldopa; SLC, solute carrier family; BBB, blood brain barrier.

The effects of meals and dietary protein on levodopa absorption has been described as early as 1973 in PwP who experience motor fluctuations. The results of these studies further prompted investigations of protein-restricted diets in PwP (described later) in order to possibly limit competition of amino acid transport systems. Protein intake in both people with- and without PD has failed to show reduced t max and C max in previous studies, which suggests that intestinal absorption of levodopa may be more affected by GI dysfunction (discussed in later sections) and fluctuations in plasma LNAA levels for transport across the BBB.

It is important that LODOSYN with levodopa be taken at regular intervals according to the schedule outlined by the health care provider. Caution patients not to change the prescribed dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other carbidopa-levodopa preparations without first consulting a physician.

Advise patients that sometimes a "wearing-off" effect may occur at the end of the dosing interval. Tell patients to notify the prescriber if such response poses a problem to lifestyle. Patients should be advised that occasionally dark color (red, brown, or black) may appear in saliva, urine, or sweat after ingestion of LODOSYN and levodopa. Although the color appears to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored.

Although monitoring over a prolonged time period, certain studies only compared before and after medication intake within set timings, for example Moradi et al. monitored over 14-Days but only used data from 30, 45, 60, and 75 min before and after medication intake.

To assess medication effect, 12 studies administered suprathreshold doses of participant's normal medication dose. This included administering 120%, 125%, 150%, and between 150 and 50%of the normal dose. In one study, if participants did not switch between medication states, an extra medication dose was taken, or levodopa was withdrawn, and in another study all participants were given 250/25 mg of levodopa/carbidopa. Additionally, to assess medication effect, Rosqvist et al. gave all participants 200 mg tablet of Madopark Quick, dissolved in water. Another study administered a suprathreshold dose (150%) to induce dyskinesia.

### Pharmacokinetics of levodopa [^e9255500]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the clinically relevant determinants of levodopa peripheral pharmacokinetics and main observed changes in the levodopa concentration-effect relationship with Parkinson's disease (PD) progression. Available clinically practical strategies to optimise levodopa pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are briefly discussed. Levodopa shows particular pharmacokinetics including an extensive presystemic metabolism, overcome by the combined use of extracerebral inhibitors of the enzyme L: -amino acid decarboxylase and rapid absorption in the proximal small bowel by a saturable facilitated transport system shared with other large neutral amino acids. Drug transport from plasma to the brain is mediated by the same carriers operating in the intestinal mucosa. The main strategies to assure reproducibility of both intestinal absorption and delivery to the brain, and the clinical effect include standardization of levodopa dosing with respect to meal times and a controlled dietary protein intake. Levodopa plasma half-life is very short, resulting in marked plasma drug concentration fluctuations which are matched, as the disease progresses, to swings in the therapeutic response ("wearing-off" phenomena). "Wearing-off" phenomena can also be associated, at the more advanced disease stages, with a "negative", both parkinsonism-exacerbating and dyskinetic effect of levodopa at low, subtherapeutic plasma concentrations. Dyskinesias may also be related to high-levodopa, excessive plasma concentrations. Recognition of the different levodopa toxic response patterns can be difficult on a clinical basis alone and simultaneous monitoring of the levodopa concentration-effect relationship may prove useful to disclose the underlying mechanism and in planning the correct management. Clinically practical strategies to optimise levodopa pharmacokinetics, and possibly its therapeutic response, include liquid drug solutions, controlled release formulations and the use of inhibitors of levodopa metabolism. Unfortunately, these attempts have proved so far only partly successful, due to the complex alterations in cerebral levodopa kinetics which accompany the progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in PD patients.

### Are high doses of carbidopa a concern? A randomized, clinical trial in Parkinson's disease [^6340c8bb]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Recommended doses of carbidopa are 75–200 mg/day. Higher doses could inhibit brain aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase and reduce clinical effects. We compared 4-week outpatient treatments with carbidopa (75 and 450 mg/day) administered with L-dopa on the subjects' normal schedule. After each treatment phase, subjects had two 2-hour L-dopa infusions. The first infusion examined the effects of carbidopa doses administered the preceding 4 weeks, and the second infusion determined the acute effects of the two dosages of carbidopa. The antiparkinsonian effects and L-dopa and carbidopa plasma concentrations were monitored during the infusions. Twelve subjects completed the study. Carbidopa concentrations were eight times higher after the high-carbidopa phase. Area under the curve (AUC) for clinical ratings did not differ for the four L-dopa infusions, although AUC for plasma L-dopa was modestly increased with 450 mg of carbidopa. Nine subjects reported that the high-carbidopa outpatient phase was associated with greater response to L-dopa. Doses of 450 mg/day of carbidopa did not reduce the responses to L-dopa infusion, extending the safe range of carbidopa to 450 mg/day.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal nervous system affecting the mobility and control of the skeletal muscular system. Its characteristic features include resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinetic movements. Symptomatic treatments, such as levodopa therapies, may permit the patient better mobility.

Mechanism of Action

Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease apparently because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Pharmacodynamics

When levodopa is administered orally it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect and these may often be accompanied by nausea and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues.

The incidence of levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting is less when LODOSYN is used with levodopa than when levodopa is used without LODOSYN. In many patients this reduction in nausea and vomiting will permit more rapid dosage titration.

Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Carbidopa has not been demonstrated to have any overt pharmacodynamic actions in the recommended doses. It does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier readily and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system at doses of carbidopa that are recommended for maximum effective inhibition of peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa.

Since its decarboxylase-inhibiting activity is limited primarily to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain. However, since levodopa and carbidopa compete with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa and carbidopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets contain carbidopa and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio as either the 50–200 tablet or the 25–100 tablet. The daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets must be determined by careful titration. Patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period, particularly with regard to appearance or worsening of involuntary movements, dyskinesias or nausea. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should not be chewed or crushed.

Standard drugs for Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are being administered, although their dosage may have to be adjusted.

Since carbidopa prevents the reversal of levodopa effects caused by pyridoxine, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets can be given to patients receiving supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

Patients Currently Treated with Conventional Carbidopa-Levodopa Preparations

Studies show that peripheral dopa-decarboxylase is saturated by the bioavailable carbidopa at doses of 70 mg a day and greater. Because the bioavailabilities of carbidopa and levodopa in carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release tablets and carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are different, appropriate adjustments should be made, as shown in Table 2.

Dosage with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should be substituted at an amount that provides approximately 10% more levodopa per day, although this may need to be increased to a dosage that provides up to 30% more levodopa per day depending on clinical response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Titration with Carbidopa and Levodopa Extended-Release Tablets). The interval between doses of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should be 4–8 hours during the waking day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics).

A guideline for initiation of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets is shown in Table 3.

Patients Currently Treated with Levodopa Without a Decarboxylase Inhibitor

Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets is started. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should be substituted at a dosage that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage. In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial dose is usually 1 tablet of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets b.i.d.

Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet.

Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system.

The incidence of levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting is less with SINEMET than with levodopa. In many patients, this reduction in nausea and vomiting will permit more rapid dosage titration.

Since its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain.

The incidence of levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting is less when carbidopa is used with levodopa than when levodopa is used without carbidopa. In many patients, this reduction in nausea and vomiting will permit more rapid dosage titration. Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Carbidopa has not been demonstrated to have any overt pharmacodynamic actions in the recommended doses. It does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier readily and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system at doses of carbidopa that are recommended for maximum effective inhibition of peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa. Since its decarboxylase-inhibiting activity is limited primarily to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain.

However, since levodopa and carbidopa compete with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa and carbidopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet. Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid. In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of separate tablets of carbidopa and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion to the excretion of dopamine when compared to the two drugs administered at separate times. The introduction of carbidopa to levodopa therapy, which inhibits the peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine, counteracts the metabolic-enhancing effect of pyridoxine.

Carbidopa is combined with levodopa in carbidopa-levodopa and carbidopa-levodopa extended release tablets. When carbidopa is to be given to carbidopa-naive patients who are being treated with levodopa alone, the two drugs should be given at the same time. At least twelve hours should elapse between the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa in combination. Start with no more than one-fifth to one-fourth of the previous daily dosage of levodopa when given without carbidopa. See the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section before initiating therapy.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Carbidopa

Following oral dosing of RYTARY the maximum concentration occurred at approximately 3 hours. The bioavailability of carbidopa from RYTARY relative to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets was approximately 50%.

Levodopa

The pharmacokinetics of RYTARY were evaluated following single-doses in healthy subjects and following single- and multiple-doses in patients with Parkinson's disease. The bioavailability of levodopa from RYTARY in patients was approximately 70% relative to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. For comparable doses, RYTARY results in a levodopa peak concentration (Cmax) that is 30% that of immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. Following an initial peak at about one hour, plasma concentrations are maintained for about 4 to 5 hours before declining.

In patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple-dose pharmacokinetics was comparable to single-dose pharmacokinetics, i.e., there was minimal accumulation of levodopa. Variation in levodopa peak to trough plasma concentrations at steady-state defined as (Cmax-Cmin)/Cavgwas approximately 1.5 for RYTARY compared to approximately 3.2 for immediate-release levodopa.

Distribution

Carbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma proteins. Approximately 10% to 30% of levodopa is bound to plasma protein.

### Long-term safety, discontinuation and mortality in an Italian cohort with advanced Parkinson's disease on levodopa / carbidopa intestinal gel infusion [^59ef317d]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is an effective treatment in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, when wearing off, on–off phases, or dyskinesia cause significant functional impairment and make oral medications unable to produce satisfactory motor control. It is widely recognized that changes in peripheral pharmacokinetic parameters, erratic gastric emptying and jejunal absorption, as well as protein competition at intestinal and blood–brain barrier absorption sites contribute to the development of motor complications. LCIG is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa monohydrate (4:1 ratio) in a gel, introduced for the first time in Sweden in 1991, that obtained EU approval in 2004. Recently, significant efforts have been made to define the eligibility criteria for device-aided therapies and the "5:2:1 rule" (five-times oral levodopa doses/day, 2 h "off" symptoms/day, 1 h of troublesome dyskinesia/day) has been proposed to facilitate patient identification. However, there are no LCIG specific selection criteria or data on long-term safety, additionally identification of predictors of discontinuation and mortality are limited. The primary aim of this study was to perform a long-term safety analysis on a large cohort of PD patients treated with LCIG up to 15 years, recording serious adverse events (AEs) and mortality as well as causes and timing of discontinuation. The second aim of this study was to perform a long-term efficacy analysis on motor performance.

### Carbidopa, levodopa, and entacapone (Stalevo) [^c5f8a5e4]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Absorption and Distribution

Both levodopa and entacapone are rapidly absorbed and eliminated, and their distribution volume is moderately small. Carbidopa is absorbed and eliminated slightly more slowly compared with levodopa and entacapone. There are substantial inter- and intra-individual variations in the absorption of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone, particularly concerning its Cmax.

The food-effect on the Stalevo tablet has not been evaluated. Because levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients after eating a high protein meal. Meals rich in large neutral amino acids may delay and reduce the absorption of levodopa [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Levodopa

The pharmacokinetic properties of levodopa following the administration of single-dose Stalevo (carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone) tablets are summarized in Table 3.

Levodopa is bound to plasma protein only to a minor extent (about 10% to 30%).

Carbidopa

Following administration of Stalevo as a single dose to healthy male and female subjects, the peak concentration of carbidopa was reached within 2.5 hours to 3.4 hours on average. The mean Cmaxranged from about 40 nanogram per mL to 225 nanogram per mL and the mean AUC from 170 nanogram∙h per mL to 1,200 nanogram∙h per mL, with different Stalevo strengths providing 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg of carbidopa.

Carbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma protein.

Entacapone

Following administration of Stalevo as a single dose to healthy male and female subjects, the peak concentration of entacapone in plasma was reached within 0.8 hour to 1.2 hours on average. The mean Cmaxof entacapone was about 1,200 nanogram per mL to 1,500 nanogram per mL and the AUC 1,250 nanogram∙h per mL to 1,750 nanagram∙h per mL after administration of different Stalevo strengths all providing 200 mg of entacapone.

The plasma protein binding of entacapone is 98% over the concentration range of 0.4 mcg per mL to 50 mcg per mL. Entacapone binds mainly to serum albumin.

### To restrict or not to restrict? Practical considerations for optimizing dietary protein interactions on levodopa absorption in Parkinson's disease [^e144fa35]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Unlike levodopa, dietary forms of protein must undergo enzymatic digestion in the stomach and proximal intestine to unfold quaternary, tertiary and secondary structures prior to absorption in the proximal intestine. These series of reactions yield mainly di- and tripeptides that can transport via intestinal peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) on the apical membrane where they are further broken down in the enterocyte into free amino acids by cytosolic peptidases. Free amino acids circulating in the lumen can enter the enterocyte at the apical membrane and exit on the basolateral side through these amino acid transport systems. Amino acid transport systems are highly specific depending on affinity, and competition can arise during absorption. These transport systems are the primary target for levodopa absorption across the intestine and through the BBB.

In practice it has been thought that levodopa is absorbed by the same transporters as free, large neutral amino acids; however, current evidence remains limited on the intestinal transporters involved in this mechanism. To date, only one study published in 2014 has identified the transporters involved. Using in vitro and in vivo models, Camrago et al. demonstrated levodopa can be transported by enterocytes across the apical membrane through the b 0,+ AT-rBAT (SLC7A9-SLC3A1) and exits the basolateral side primarily by TAT1 (SLC16A10) and LAT2-4F2hc (SLC7A8-SLC3A2) to a lesser extent. b 0,+ AT-rBAT is an antiporter exchanging large neutral amino acids on the luminal side, while TAT1 is an aromatic amino acid uniporter and LAT2-4F2hc is antiporter on the basolateral side. In these models, levodopa is competitively inhibited by neutral and cationic amino acids such as leucine and arginine for uptake by b 0,+ AT-rBAT (Fig. 1). Earlier reports have suggested levodopa is only absorbed at the duodenum and proximal jejunum. However, Camrago et al. demonstrated levodopa may be transported equally across the entire small intestine in in vitro models. Interestingly, a recent in silico computational model for levodopa kinetics proposed amino acid affinities of these transporters with levodopa having among the lowest affinity. Future studies should look to confirm these findings in vivo to better understand the absorption and affinity for levodopa in comparison to other large neutral and cationic amino acids. The presence of AADC inhibitors (i.e. carbidopa and benserazide) or COMT inhibitors (i.e. entacapone) does not seem to inhibit levodopa transport across b 0,+ AT-rBAT despite having a similar structure to levodopa. In the postprandial phase, increased amino acid accumulation in the portal vein may trans-stimulate increased efflux from LAT2-4F2hc on the basolateral membrane, suggesting a potential target for improving levodopa absorption with meals.

### Carbidopa [^7cba94ac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients Requiring Individual Titration of Carbidopa-levodopa Dosage

Although carbidopa and levodopa is the most frequently used method of carbidopa-levodopa administration, there may be an occasional patient who requires individually titrated doses of these two drugs. In these patients, carbidopa should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg three or four times a day. The two drugs should be given at the same time, starting with no more than one-fifth (20%) to one-fourth (25%) of the previous or recommended daily dosage of levodopa when given without carbidopa. In patients already receiving levodopa therapy, at least twelve hours should elapse between the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa. A convenient way to initiate therapy in these patients is in the morning following a night when the patient has not taken levodopa for at least twelve hours. Health care providers who prescribe separate doses of carbidopa and levodopa should be thoroughly familiar with the directions for use of each drug.

Dosage Adjustment

Dosage of carbidopa may be adjusted by adding or omitting one-half or one tablet a day. Carbidopa Tablets have functional scoring to facilitate the dosage adjustment by one-half tablet. Because both therapeutic and adverse responses occur more rapidly with combined therapy than when only levodopa is given, patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements will occur more rapidly when carbidopa and levodopa are given concomitantly than when levodopa is given without carbidopa. The occurrence of involuntary movements may require dosage reduction. Blepharospasm may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients.

Current evidence indicates other standard antiparkinsonian drugs may be continued while carbidopa and levodopa are being administered. However, the dosage of such other standard antiparkinsonian drugs may require adjustment.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to advise patients a protein redistribution diet (eating most of the protein in the final main meal of the day) in patients with PD on levodopa experiencing motor fluctuations. Advise patients to avoid a reduction in their total daily consumption of protein.

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^087492fe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets contain either 25 mg of carbidopa and 100 mg of levodopa, or 50 mg of carbidopa and 200 mg of levodopa in a sustained-release dosage form designed to release these ingredients over a 4- to 6-hour period. With carbidopa and levodopa extended-release there is less variation in plasma levodopa levels than with carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release, the conventional formulation. However, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is less systemically bioavailable than carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release and may require increased daily doses to achieve the same level of symptomatic relief as provided by carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release.

In clinical trials, patients with moderate to severe motor fluctuations who received carbidopa and levodopa extended-release did not experience quantitatively significant reductions in 'off' time when compared to carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release. However, global ratings of improvement as assessed by both patient and physician were better during therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release than with carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release. In patients without motor fluctuations, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, under controlled conditions, provided the same therapeutic benefit with less frequent dosing when compared to carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release.

I could only eat 30 minutes after I took my medication for about a 15- to 20-minute window of time. and if I didn't eat too much food of anything, but especially protein, um, then I was relatively okay and sometimes I would make it the whole 2 hours without um, going 'Off', but most often, more often than not, I would still be 'Off' within an hour and just still have like a half an hour um, before I could take my next dose". (female, age 52)

"I had a terrible time getting any sleep because. I had to take medicine and set an alarm a couple of times in the middle of the night, so it would take me a long time to get to sleep because of either dystonia or dyskinesia, really bad versions". (male, age 56)

Some participants found waiting for their medication to take effect and its wearing off negatively impacted them and was demotivating for doing activities.

"Take the meds, you're going to be 'On' for a couple hours, and then you're going to be 'Off', and you're going to, you know, take your meds again. And it was just these peaks and valleys. it was disrupting life". (male, age 61)

Given these challenges with their oral medications, participants sought a new treatment for PD with more consistent medication release for improved and predictable symptom control.

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^39979480]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In these studies, using similar total daily doses of levodopa, plasma levodopa concentrations with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release fluctuated in a narrower range than with carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release. Because the bioavailability of levodopa from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release relative to carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release is approximately 70–75%, the daily dosage of levodopa necessary to produce a given clinical response with the extended-release formulation will usually be higher.

The extent of availability and peak concentrations of levodopa after a single dose of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release increased by about 50% and 25%, respectively, when administered with food.

At steady state, the bioavailability of carbidopa from carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release tablets is approximately 99% relative to the concomitant administration of carbidopa and levodopa. At steady state, carbidopa bioavailability from 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is approximately 58% relative to that from carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release.

Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), in oral doses of 10 mg to 25 mg, may reverse the effects of levodopa by increasing the rate of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation. Carbidopa inhibits this action of pyridoxine.

Special Populations

Geriatric

A study in eight young healthy subjects (21–22 yr) and eight elderly healthy subjects (69–76 yr) showed that the absolute bioavailability of levodopa was similar between young and elderly subjects following oral administration of levodopa and carbidopa. However, the systemic exposure (AUC) of levodopa was increased by 55% in elderly subjects compared to young subjects. Based on another study in forty patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a correlation between age of patients and the increase of AUC of levodopa following administration of levodopa and an inhibitor of peripheral dopa decarboxylase. AUC of levodopa was increased by 28% in elderly patients (≥ 65 yr) compared to young patients (< 65 yr). Additionally, mean value of Cmaxfor levodopa was increased by 24% in elderly patients (≥ 65 yr) compared to young patients (< 65 yr) (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

The AUC of carbidopa was increased in elderly subjects (n = 10, 65–76 yr) by 29% compared to young subjects (n = 24, 23–64 yr) following IV administration of 50 mg levodopa with carbidopa (50 mg). This increase is not considered a clinically significant impact.

### Safety and efficacy of continuous subcutaneous levodopa-carbidopa infusion (ND0612) for Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations (bouNDless): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre trial [^5af45003]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Conventional oral levodopa therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease can be associated with variations in plasma concentrations. Levodopa infusion strategies might provide more consistent drug delivery and fewer motor fluctuations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a continuous 24 h/day subcutaneous infusion of ND0612 (a levodopa-carbidopa solution) compared with oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa for the treatment of motor fluctuations in people with Parkinson's disease.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multicentre trial at 117 academic and community neurology sites in 16 countries, including in Europe, Israel, and the USA. Eligible participants were men and women aged 30 years or older with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage ≤ 3 in the on state) who experienced at least 2·5 h/day of off time. Participants underwent an open-label run-in phase (< 12 weeks), during which time optimal regimens were established for both oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa and for 24 h/day subcutaneous ND0612 infusion (levodopa-carbidopa 60·0/7·5 mg/mL), with supplemental oral levodopa-carbidopa if needed. Participants were then randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with their optimised regimen of either subcutaneous ND0612 or oral levodopa-carbidopa, with matching oral or subcutaneous placebo given as required to maintain blinding. Randomisation was done via an interactive web response system, stratified by region, using a permuted block schedule. Participants, study partners, treating investigators, study site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline (ie, time of randomisation, when all patients were receiving an optimised open-label ND0612 regimen) to end of the double-blind phase in total daily on time without troublesome dyskinesia, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04006210, and is complete.

Findings

Between Sept 30, 2019, and April 8, 2022, 381 participants were enrolled, of whom 259 (68%) were randomly assigned, 128 (49%) to subcutaneous ND0612 and 131 (51%) to oral levodopa-carbidopa. 243 (94%) participants completed the study. Treatment with subcutaneous ND0612 provided an additional 1·72 h (95% CI 1·08 to 2·36) of on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared with oral levodopa-carbidopa (change from baseline of -0·48 h [-0·94 to -0·02] with subcutaneous ND0612 vs -2·20 h [-2·65 to -1·74] with oral levodopa-carbidopa; p < 0·0001). Significant treatment differences favouring subcutaneous ND0612 were also found in the first four of nine prespecified hierarchical outcomes of daily off time (-1·40 h [95% CI -1·99 to -0·80]), Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II scores (-3·05 [-4·28 to -1·81]), Patients Global Impression of Change (odds ratio [OR] 5·31 [2·67 to 10·58]), and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (OR 7·23 [3·57 to 14·64]). Hierarchical testing ended after the fourth secondary endpoint. Adverse events were reported by 287 (89%) of 322 participants during open-label ND0612 optimisation, and by 103 (80%) of 128 in the ND0612 group and 97 (74%) of 131 in the oral levodopa-carbidopa group during the double-blind phase. The most common adverse events were infusion-site reactions (266 [83%] participants during open-label ND0612, and 73 [57%] in the ND0612 group vs 56 [43%] in the oral levodopa-carbidopa group during the double-blind phase), most of which were mild. Serious adverse events in four participants in the ND0612 group were related to study treatment (infusion-site cellulitis [n = 2], infusion-site abscess and infusion-site ulcer [n = 1]; and paraesthesia and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy [n = 1]). One participant in the ND0612 group died during the double-blind phase, but the death was not related to study treatment (fall leading to traumatic brain injury).

Interpretation

Results of this phase 3 study showed that subcutaneous ND0612 used in combination with oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa increased on time without troublesome dyskinesia and reduced off time, with a favourable benefit-risk profile. ND0612 might offer a safe and efficacious subcutaneous levodopa infusion approach to managing motor fluctuations in people with Parkinson's disease. The ongoing open-label extension phase will provide further information on the long-term efficacy and safety of treatment.

### Association of Enterococcus faecalis and tyrosine decarboxylase gene levels with levodopa pharmacokinetics in Parkinson's disease [^91f6c95d]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. The number of patients with PD is growing rapidly and is projected to exceed 12 million worldwide by 2040. PD is pathologically characterized by the degeneration and depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to reduced dopamine levels in the striatum. Because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, treatment for PD involves the administration of levodopa, a precursor of dopamine, to replenish the depleted dopamine levels in the striatum. Despite the availability of various pharmacological interventions to alleviate PD symptoms, levodopa remains the cornerstone of PD therapy, offering the most effective symptomatic relief. However, orally administered levodopa is extensively metabolized peripherally, primarily by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which reduces the amount of levodopa reaching the brain, limiting its therapeutic efficacy. Even when administered in combination with carbidopa, the AADC inhibitor, levodopa has a short half-life of approximately 90 min. Moreover, as PD pathology progresses, the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and depletion of presynaptic dopamine stores in the striatum lead to a closer correlation between plasma levodopa concentrations and striatal dopamine levels. Therefore, understanding the factors affecting levodopa absorption and optimizing its bioavailability is crucial for effective symptom management in patients with PD.

Levodopa is absorbed into the bloodstream via a large neutral amino acid transporter, primarily in the upper jejunum. Absorption of orally administered levodopa is influenced by various factors in the gastrointestinal tract, from the oral cavity to the small intestine. Endoscopic evaluation has shown that patients experiencing the delayed-on phenomenon have a higher incidence of swallowing dysfunction and residual medication in the pharynx. Delayed gastric emptying can impair levodopa absorption. Peak plasma levodopa concentrations were delayed in patients with delayed gastric emptying, as demonstrated by the results of the 13 C-octanoic acid expiration breath test. Our recent studies have shown that the concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors or magnesium oxide may reduce the bioavailability of levodopa due to its pharmacokinetic properties. In addition, meal timing, competition for levodopa transport by large neutral amino acids contained in dietary proteins, and Helicobacter pylori infection reportedly influence the efficacy of levodopa –.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Duopa) [^51a3a507]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the controlled clinical trial, the intra-subject variability in carbidopa and levodopa plasma concentrations were lower for patients treated with DUOPA (N = 33, 25% and 21%, respectively) than in patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (25/100 mg) tablets (N = 28, 39% and 67%, respectively).

Distribution

Carbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma proteins. Levodopa is approximately 10–30% bound to plasma proteins.

Metabolism and Elimination

Carbidopa

Carbidopa is metabolized to two main metabolites (α-methyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and α-methyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid). These 2 metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine unchanged or as glucuronide conjugates. Unchanged carbidopa accounts for 30% of the total urinary excretion. The elimination half-life of carbidopa is approximately 2 hours.

Levodopa

Levodopa is mainly eliminated via metabolism by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) and the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) enzymes. Other routes of metabolism are transamination and oxidation. The decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine by AAAD is the major enzymatic pathway when no enzyme inhibitor is co-administered. O-methylation of levodopa by COMT forms 3-O-methyldopa. When administered with carbidopa, the elimination half-life of levodopa is approximately 1.5 hours (see Figure 1).

### Gastrointestinal barriers to levodopa transport and absorption in Parkinson's disease [^9cd38345]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Levodopa is the gold standard for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). There are well documented motor and non-motor fluctuations, however, that occur almost inevitably once levodopa is started after a variable period in people with PD. Whilst brain neurodegenerative processes play a part in the pathogenesis of these fluctuations, a range of barriers across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can alter levodopa pharmacokinetics, ultimately contributing to non-optimal levodopa response and symptoms fluctuations. GI barriers to levodopa transport and absorption include dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying, constipation, Helicobacter pylori infection, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and gut dysbiosis. In addition, a protein-rich diet and concomitant medication intake can further alter levodopa pharmacokinetics. This can result in unpredictable or sub-optimal levodopa response, 'delayed on' or 'no on' phenomena. In this narrative review, we provided an overview on the plethora of GI obstacles to levodopa transport and absorption in PD and their implications on levodopa pharmacokinetics and development of motor fluctuations. In addition, management strategies to address GI dysfunction in PD are highlighted, including use of non-oral therapies to bypass the GI tract.

Opportunities for future research

More investigations to support the customization of dietary protein in the management of PwP is of utmost importance. Levodopa absorption within the intestine facilitated by saturable transporters (e.g. b 0,+ AT-rBAT, TAT1 and LAT2-4F2hc) has been recently elucidated in vitro and in vivo. Future studies should confirm these findings with in vivo models and elucidate strategies for increasing trans-stimulation of levodopa by the transporter LAT2-4F2hc. While addressing dietary protein interactions with levodopa may aide in medication bioavailability, larger randomized, controlled clinical trials are warranted to clarify efficacy of PRD in subpopulations of different disease severity, ages, sex, ethnic, GI and genetic influences. Other dietary interventions such as plant-based diets (vegan or vegetarian) may also be a key area of investigation given plant-based proteins are lower in essential amino acids (i.e. leucine)that could compete with levodopa absorption. Future development of biomarkers or machine learning algorithms that can predict responsiveness of dietary protein modifications on levodopa pharmacokinetics could be helpful. Currently, dietary interventions for optimizing levodopa response in PwP are implemented only as a "rescue" therapy instead of utilizing a more holistic, proactive, and preventative therapeutic approach.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to levodopa, AAN 2021 guidelines recommend to counsel patients in later disease stages that taking levodopa with meals may affect levodopa absorption and efficacy, but this is usually not problematic at the time of levodopa initiation in early PD.

### IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of motor fluctuations in parkinson disease: the RISE-PD randomized clinical trial [^9535d9e3]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can extended-release carbidopa-levodopa (IPX203) improve symptomatic control in patients with Parkinson disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations while taking immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa?

Findings

In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial involving 506 participants, IPX203 showed statistically significant improvement in daily good on-time compared to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa when dosed a mean of 3 times per day compared to 5 times per day for immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa.

Meaning

The results of this study suggest that IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa may be useful in patients with Parkinson disease and motor fluctuations by providing more sustained benefit throughout the day, even with fewer daily doses.

Patients Requiring Individual Titration of Carbidopa and Levodopa Dosage

Although carbidopa-levodopa is the most frequently used of carbidopa and levodopa administration, there may be an occasional patient who requires individually titrated doses of these two drugs. In these patients, Carbidopa Tablets should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg three or four times a day. The two drugs should be given at the same time, starting with no more than one-fifth (20%) to one-fourth (25%) of the previous or recommended daily dosage of levodopa when given without Carbidopa Tablets. In patients already receiving levodopa therapy, at least twelve hours should elapse between the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with Carbidopa Tablets and levodopa. A convenient way to initiate therapy in these patients is in the morning following a night when the patient has not taken levodopa for at least twelve hours. Health care providers who prescribe separate doses of Carbidopa Tablets and levodopa should be thoroughly familiar with the directions for use of each drug.

Dosage Adjustment

Dosage of Carbidopa Tablets may be adjusted by adding or omitting one-half or one tablet a day. Because both therapeutic and adverse responses occur more rapidly with combined therapy than when only levodopa is given, patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements will occur more rapidly when Carbidopa Tablets and levodopa are given concomitantly than when levodopa is given without Carbidopa Tablets. The occurrence of involuntary movements may require dosage reduction. Blepharospasm may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients.

### Special low-protein foods ameliorate postprandial off in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease [^fb491c51]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Protein intake interferes with levodopa therapy. Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) should restrict daily protein intake and shift protein intake to the evening. For further reduction of protein intake in the first part of the day, special low-protein products (LPP) should be used instead of normal food products at breakfast and lunch. We studied the efficacy of LPP on postprandial off periods, in PD patients on levodopa therapy. The methods included a randomized, cross-over, single-blind, pilot clinical trial comparing a 2-month balanced diet with a 2-month LPP diet in 18 PD patients with motor fluctuations. The off phases were significantly shorter after LPP diet than after balanced diet (postprandial off, 49 ± 73 min vs. 79 ± 72 min and total off, 164 ± 148 min vs. 271 ± 174 min, both P < 0.0001). Moreover, a reduction in total off time during LPP diet (3.3 ± 2.7 hr vs. 4.7 ± 3.3 hr, P < 0.0001), occurred also in the 9 patients who did not experience subjective benefit. No significant changes in hematological and biochemical variables or body composition were recorded; a slight reduction in body weight (mean, -1.8%) was observed. Consumption of LPP in the first part of the day ameliorates off periods in PD patients, but additional studies including pharmacokinetics are needed.

### Foscarbidopa / foslevodopa (Vyalev) [^a0254e9d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

VYALEV is administered directly into the subcutaneous space and is converted to carbidopa and levodopa by alkaline phosphatase. In a phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, carbidopa and levodopa were detectable in plasma within 30 minutes at the first pharmacokinetic (PK) collection point. In healthy volunteer subjects the steady state levodopa was achieved within 2 hours when VYALEV dosing was delivered as a loading dose followed by continuous infusion.

Healthy volunteers were administered VYALEV to different subcutaneous sites (i.e., abdomen, arm, and thigh) using a 3-way crossover design. PK analysis from this study showed that the 3 sites provided comparable carbidopa and levodopa exposure suggesting VYALEV absorption is similar at the different subcutaneous sites.

Effect of Food

VYALEV bypasses the gut, so consumption of food does not change absorption or systemic exposure of carbidopa/levodopa.

Distribution

Both foslevodopa and foscarbidopa have binding to plasma proteins between 24% to 26%.

Levodopa

Levodopa is distributed between erythrocytes and plasma in approximately 1:1 ratio. Levodopa binding to plasma proteins is < 10%. Levodopa is transported into the brain by the carrier mechanism for large neutral amino acids.

Carbidopa

Carbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma protein. Carbidopa does not cross the blood-brain barrier.

Metabolism and Excretion

The foscarbidopa and foslevodopa from VYALEV are converted by alkaline phosphatases into carbidopa and levodopa.

Levodopa

Levodopa is mainly eliminated via metabolism by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) and the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) enzymes. Other routes of metabolism are transamination and oxidation. The decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine by AAAD is the major enzymatic pathway when no enzyme inhibitor is co-administered. O-methylation of levodopa by COMT forms 3-O-methyldopa. When administered with carbidopa, the elimination half-life of levodopa is approximately 1.5 hours.

Carbidopa

Carbidopa is metabolized to two main metabolites (α-methyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and α-methyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid). These 2 metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine unchanged or as glucuronide conjugates. Unchanged carbidopa accounts for 30% of the total urinary excretion. The elimination half-life of carbidopa is approximately 2 hours.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Duopa) [^026d1b2f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Selective MAO-B inhibitors: May cause orthostatic hypotension (7.1)
Antihypertensive drugs: May cause symptomatic postural hypotension. Dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be needed (7.2)
Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, isoniazid, iron salts, and high-protein diet may reduce the effectiveness of DUOPA (7.3, 7.4, 7.5)

7.1 Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors

The use of nonselective MAO inhibitors with DUOPA is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue use of any nonselective MAO inhibitors at least two weeks prior to initiating DUOPA.

The use of selective MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., rasagiline and selegiline) with DUOPA may be associated with orthostatic hypotension. Monitor patients who are taking these drugs.

7.2 Antihypertensive Drugs

The concurrent use of DUOPA with antihypertensive medications can cause symptomatic postural hypotension. A dose reduction of the antihypertensive medication may be needed after starting or increasing the dose of DUOPA.

7.3 Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists and Isoniazid

Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, metoclopramide, papaverine) and isoniazid may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa. Monitor patients for worsening Parkinson's symptoms.

7.4 Iron Salts

Iron salts or multi-vitamins containing iron salts can form chelates with levodopa, carbidopa, and can cause a reduction in the bioavailability of DUOPA. If iron salts or multi-vitamins containing iron salts are co-administered with DUOPA, monitor patients for worsening Parkinson's symptoms.

7.5 High-Protein Diet

Because levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be decreased in patients on a high-protein diet. Advise patients that a high-protein diet may reduce the effectiveness of DUOPA.

### Optimization of oral entacapone administration in patients undergoing levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel treatment [^2ecec422]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment markedly reduces motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease; however, some patients undergoing LCIG treatment may demonstrate clinical deterioration in the afternoon. Entacapone, a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, may be a promising adjunctive option for LCIG-treated patients; however, the optimal timing of oral entacapone administration to ameliorate clinical symptoms in the afternoon remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the optimal timing of oral entacapone administration in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing LCIG treatment.

Methods

Pharmacokinetic analysis and symptom assessment were performed on three days: a day without entacapone administration, day with oral entacapone administration at 13:00, and day with oral entacapone administration at 15:00.

Results

Eight LCIG-treated patients were enrolled, of whom seven completed this study. The relative plasma concentrations of levodopa with entacapone administration at 13:00 were gradually increased, especially at 18:00 and were significantly higher than those without entacapone administration (127.10 ± 25.06% vs. 97.51 ± 22.20%). The relative plasma concentrations of 3-O-methyldopa were gradually increased without entacapone administration, whereas those with entacapone administration at 13:00 were lower than those without entacapone administration, especially at 17:00 (97.47 ± 3.70% vs. 110.71 ± 9.84%). Administering oral entacapone at 15:00 increased and decreased the relative plasma concentrations of levodopa and 3-O-methyldopa, respectively, but without significant difference. The "Off" time was shorter with entacapone administration at 13:00 (0.43 ± 0.79 h) and at 15:00 (0.57 ± 0.79 h) than that without entacapone administration (1.14 ± 1.46 h).

Conclusions

The concomitant use of oral entacapone in the early afternoon may be effective in improving afternoon symptoms in patients undergoing LCIG treatment.

### The modern pre-levodopa era of Parkinson's disease: insights into motor complications from sub-saharan Africa [^42ceb9ca]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present study provides evidence that motor fluctuations and dyskinesias are not associated with the duration of exposure to levodopa therapy, but rather to disease progression itself. Therefore, there is no reason to delay the initiation of adequate levodopa therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. In contrast with past drug trials, recent experimental studies suggest that the best therapeutic option to delay the molecular changes in gene expression, synaptic morphology and abnormal corticostriatal connectivity associated with dyskinesias may be early initiation of levodopa treatment. We emphasize the importance of considering the pharmacokinetic properties of levodopa and recommend (i) to adjust the individual levodopa dose regimen per kilogram of body weight to reduce the risk of dyskinesias; and (ii) to consider the potential benefits of dietary protein redistribution during the daytime to minimize levodopa requirement and improve the control of motor fluctuations. Further studies are needed to better understand the natural course of Parkinson's disease without the confounding effect of medications, and the pathophysiology of motor and non-motor symptoms. Whether the answers will come from Africa, time will tell.

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^625e3b94]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid.

Elimination half-life of levodopa in the presence of carbidopa is about 1.5 hours. Following carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, the apparent half-life of levodopa may be prolonged because of continuous absorption.

In healthy elderly subjects (56–67 years old) the mean time-to-peak concentration of levodopa after a single dose of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release was about 2 hours as compared to 0.5 hours after standard carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release. The maximum concentration of levodopa after a single dose of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release was about 35% of the standard carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release (1151 vs. 3256 ng/mL). The extent of availability of levodopa from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release was about 70–75% relative to intravenous levodopa or standard carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release in the elderly. The absolute bioavailability of levodopa from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release (relative to I.V.) in young subjects was shown to be only about 44%. The extent of availability and the peak concentrations of levodopa were comparable in the elderly after a single dose and at steady state after t.i.d. administration of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. In elderly subjects, the average trough levels of levodopa at steady state after the extended-release tablet were about 2-fold higher than after the standard carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release (163 vs. 74 ng/mL).

### Concomitant medication usage with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel: results from the COSMOS study [^e51287c9]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite proven efficacy and widespread use of levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), the chemical properties of orally administered levodopa include a short plasma half‐life that leads to intermittent receptor stimulation and subsequent fluctuations in symptom control. As PD progresses, the therapeutic window of levodopa treatment narrows and patients experience intermittent motor and nonmotor symptoms that require addition of drugs such as dopamine agonists, catechol‐ O ‐methyl‐transferase (COMT) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase‐B (MAO‐B) inhibitors, or amantadine. Poor treatment adherence is common among patients with PD, possibly because of side effects and/or drug–drug interactions from comedications to help manage PD, other comorbidities, or aspects of PD disease progression such as cognitive decline and dysphagia. Therefore, the complex oral drug regimens that are often used and frequently result in inadequate symptom control can be particularly burdensome to patients with advancing PD, creating a paradoxical need to simplify drug regimen while the disease progresses.

### Effect of opicapone on levodopa pharmacokinetics in patients with fluctuating Parkinson's disease [^ff5fdf52]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibiting catechol-O-methyltransferase extends the plasma half-life of levodopa, potentially allowing physicians to optimize the levodopa regimen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing motor fluctuations.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of once-daily opicapone on levodopa plasma pharmacokinetics and motor response when added to two different levodopa dosing regimens.

Methods

A total of 24 patients with PD and motor fluctuations were enrolled in an exploratory, open-label, modified cross-over trial. Participants first received levodopa/carbidopa 500/125mg (five intakes) for 2weeks and were then randomly assigned (1:1) to levodopa/carbidopa 400/100mg given over either four or five daily intakes plus opicapone 50mg for an additional 2weeks. Levodopa 12-hour pharmacokinetics was the primary outcome (ie, excluding the effect of last/evening levodopa/carbidopa intake), with motor complications evaluated as secondary outcomes.

Results

Over 12-hour pharmacokinetics and compared with five-intake levodopa/carbidopa 500/125mg without opicapone, maximal levodopa concentrations were similar or nonsignificantly higher on both levodopa/carbidopa 400/100mg regimens plus opicapone. Despite a 100mg lower total levodopa/carbidopa daily dose, adding opicapone 50mg at least doubled the levodopa plasma half-life and minimal concentrations, with a significant ≈30% increase in total exposure. The levodopa fluctuation index was only significantly lower for the five intakes plus opicapone regimen (difference of -71.8%; P < 0.0001). Modifications to levodopa pharmacokinetics were associated with decreased off time and increased on time.

Conclusions

Combining opicapone 50mg with a 100mg lower daily dose of levodopa provides higher levodopa bioavailability with avoidance of trough levels. Despite the lower levodopa dose, modifying the levodopa pharmacokinetic profile with opicapone was associated with decreased off time and increased on time. © 2022 The Authors.

### Randomized delayed-start trial of levodopa in Parkinson's disease [^30cf9042]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Levodopa is the main treatment for symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Determining whether levodopa also has a disease-modifying effect could provide guidance as to when in the course of the disease the treatment with this drug should be initiated.

Methods

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start trial, we randomly assigned patients with early Parkinson's disease to receive levodopa (100 mg three times per day) in combination with carbidopa (25 mg three times per day) for 80 weeks (early-start group) or placebo for 40 weeks followed by levodopa in combination with carbidopa for 40 weeks (delayed-start group). The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the mean change from baseline to week 80 in the total score on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS; scores range from 0 to 176, with higher scores signifying more severe disease). Secondary analyses included the progression of symptoms, as measured by the UPDRS score, between weeks 4 and 40 and the noninferiority of early initiation of treatment to delayed initiation between weeks 44 and 80, with a noninferiority margin of 0.055 points per week.

Results

A total of 445 patients were randomly assigned: 222 to the early-start group and 223 to the delayed-start group. The mean (± SD) UPDRS score at baseline was 28.1 ± 11.4 points in the early-start group and 29.3 ± 12.1 points in the delayed-start group. The change in UPDRS score from baseline to week 80 was -1.0 ± 13.1 points and -2.0 ± 13.0 points, respectively (difference, 1.0 point; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.5 to 3.5; P = 0.44); this finding of no significant between-group difference at week 80 implies that levodopa had no disease-modifying effect. Between weeks 4 and 40, the rate of progression of symptoms, as measured in UPDRS points per week, was 0.04 ± 0.23 in the early-start group and 0.06 ± 0.34 in the delayed-start group (difference, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.03). The corresponding rates between weeks 44 and 80 were 0.10 ± 0.25 and 0.03 ± 0.28 (difference, 0.07; two-sided 90% CI, 0.03 to 0.10); the difference in the rate of progression between weeks 44 and 80 did not meet the criterion for noninferiority of early receipt of levodopa to delayed receipt. The rates of dyskinesia and levodopa-related fluctuations in motor response did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with early Parkinson's disease who were evaluated over the course of 80 weeks, treatment with levodopa in combination with carbidopa had no disease-modifying effect.

Study conduct

The study consisted of a screening period, 3 treatment periods of 4 weeks each, and a posttreatment period. There were no washout periods between the treatment periods.

The patients' individually optimized daily levodopa regimens were kept stable for at least 2 weeks before randomization. The patients were randomized to receive ODM-101 with 200 mg of entacapone and 65 mg of carbidopa and 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg of levodopa (ODM-101/65), ODM-101 with 200 mg of entacapone and 105 mg of carbidopa and 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg of levodopa (ODM-101/105), and LCE. At each levodopa intake, the patients received either ODM-101/65 or ODM-101/105 and the corresponding placebo for LCE, or LCE and the corresponding placebo for ODM-101.

The levodopa dosage in the study drug (75, 100, 125, or 150 mg) was determined by the patient's individually optimized levodopa regimen (3–8 daily doses including soluble and controlled-release evening formulations if taken regularly). Baseline 75 mg levodopa dosage without entacapone was switched to 75 mg study-drug dosage, 100 mg was switched to 75 mg, 125 mg was switched to 100 mg, 150 mg was switched to 125 mg, and 200 mg was switched to 150 mg. Baseline levodopa dosage with entacapone was switched to the same dosage of the study drug. During the first 2 weeks of each treatment period, the patient's levodopa dosage (but not frequency) was adjusted as needed by the investigator. For the remaining 2 weeks of each treatment period, levodopa dosages were kept stable. The use of tolcapone was prohibited, but stable doses of dopamine agonists (except apomorphine), monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, amantadine, and anticholinergics were allowed.

The patients who had signed informed consent for pharmacogenetic studies (n = 76) were included in a substudy. Blood samples for DNA extraction were taken at the screening visit from these patients and checked for COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism.

### Interaction between levodopa and enteral nutrition [^bd486027]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report and discuss a drug-nutrient interaction involving levodopa and protein in enteral nutrition.

Case Summary

A 77-year-old male with Parkinson's disease was admitted to an intensive care unit for an intracerebral hemorrhage. To provide nutritional support, an oral gastric tube was placed and continuous enteral nutrition was initiated, with 1.4 g/kg of protein administered daily. The following medications were continued during hospitalization: immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa 25 mg/100 mg, with 1.5 tablets administered 4 times daily; pramipexole 1.5 mg 3 times daily; and entacapone 200 mg 4 times daily. Despite this drug therapy, the patient developed severe rigidity. A review of the literature revealed a potential interaction between levodopa and protein intake. To resolve this interaction, the amount of protein in the enteral nutrition was decreased to 0.9 g/kg/day and the nutritional administration was changed from continuous enteral feeding to bolus feeding, with levodopa given between boluses. After these adjustments, the patient showed marked improvement of parkinsonian symptoms.

Discussion

The drug-nutrient interaction between protein and levodopa in outpatient settings has been reported widely in the literature; however, this interaction has not been previously reported with continuous enteral nutrition. Decreased parkinsonian symptom control, despite adherence to an established medication regimen, together with dramatic improvement observed after manipulation of enteral nutrition delivery and content, strongly suggest interference with levodopa absorption. Use of the Naranjo probability scale supports a probable interaction between the protein content in tube feeds and levodopa, resulting in decreased levodopa efficacy.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be cognizant of the potential drug-nutrient interaction between levodopa and enteral nutrition.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (parcopa) [^7e9a0e28]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about

75 percent and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid.

The plasma half-life of levodopa is about 50 minutes, without carbidopa. When carbidopa and levodopa are administered together, the half-life of levodopa is increased to about 1.5 hours. At steady state, the bioavailability of carbidopa from carbidopa-levodopa tablets is approximately 99% relative to the concomitant administration of carbidopa and levodopa.

In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of carbidopa and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion to the excretion of dopamine than administration of the two drugs at separate times.

Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), in oral doses of 10 mg to 25 mg, may reverse the effects of levodopa by increasing the rate of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation. Carbidopa inhibits this action of pyridoxine; therefore, PARCOPA®can be given to patients receiving supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone [^f861ab1b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

Hospitalization is advised, and general supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage and repeated doses of charcoal over time. This may hasten the elimination of entacapone in particular, by decreasing its absorption and reabsorption from the GI tract. Intravenous fluids should be administered judiciously and an adequate airway maintained.

Respiratory, circulatory and renal function should be monitored and appropriate supportive measures employed. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient carefully observed for the development of arrhythmias; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility that the patient may have taken other drugs, increasing the risk of drug interactions (especially catechol-structured drugs) should be taken into consideration. To date, no experience has been reported with dialysis; hence, its value in overdosage is not known. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion is unlikely to reduce entacapone levels due to its high binding to plasma proteins.

Pyridoxine is not effective in reversing the actions of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets.

### Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel in advanced Parkinson's disease: long-term results from COSMOS [^6c4e34cb]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Levodopa is the current gold standard therapy for the improvement of motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, long-term oral levodopa administration is associated with irregular, pulsatile dopamine stimulation and insufficient symptom control in patients with PD. Progressive loss of striatal dopamine neurons and compromised dopamine signaling over time can contribute to greater motor complications in some patients with PD. Specifically, long-term use of oral levodopa (4–6 years) can be associated with up to a 40–75% likelihood of developing disabling motor complications and a 40% dyskinesia risk. Further, the short levodopa half-life and irregular gastric emptying can lead to erratic plasma levodopa levels. Without consistent levodopa brain influx, patients are less likely to achieve a clinical response with oral levodopa over time. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation produces several advantages over pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation. Taken together, oral levodopa may not provide sufficient symptom control or clinical response as motor symptoms worsen over time in patients with PD.

Motor disturbances with long-term levodopa are also associated with a variety of nonmotor symptoms (NMS), all of which contribute to reduced health-related quality of life. Treatment regimens include multiple medications aimed to increase dopamine neurotransmission (eg, addition of dopamine agonists) or to prolong the oral levodopa effect (eg, addition of monoamine oxidase [MAO] or catecholamine- O -methyltransferase [COMT] inhibitors). These treatment regimens may provide symptom control for a period of time, but are often associated with drug-drug interactions, risk for medication errors, and reduced treatment adherence. Additionally, add-on medications can have undesired side effects, such as impulse control disorders with dopamine agonists or diarrhea with COMT inhibitors. Likewise, medication non-adherence is prevalent in patients with PD, especially those with cognitive impairment or swallowing difficulties, leading to further motor dysfunction, as well as increased healthcare costs.

### IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of motor fluctuations in parkinson disease: the RISE-PD randomized clinical trial [^727e29ab]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Levodopa has a short half-life and a limited window of opportunity for absorption in the proximal small intestine. IPX203 is an oral, extended-release formulation of carbidopa-levodopa developed to address these limitations.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

RISE-PD was a 20-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial. The study was conducted between November 6, 2018, and June 15, 2021, at 105 academic and clinical centers in the US and Europe. Patients with Parkinson disease taking a total daily dose of 400 mg or more of levodopa and experiencing an average of 2.5 hours or more daily off-time were included in the study. A total of 770 patients were screened, 140 were excluded (those taking controlled-release carbidopa-levodopa apart from a single daily bedtime dose, Rytary (Amneal Pharmaceuticals), additional carbidopa or benserazide, or catechol O-methyl transferase inhibitors or who had a history of psychosis within the past 10 years), and 630 were enrolled in the trial.

Interventions

Following open-label immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa dose adjustment (3 weeks) and conversion to IPX203 (4 weeks), patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to double-blind, double-dummy treatment with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa or IPX203 for 13 weeks.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary end point was mean change in daily good on-time (ie, on-time without troublesome dyskinesia) from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment period.

Results

A total of 630 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [8.95] years; 396 [62.9%] men) were enrolled, and 506 patients were randomly assigned to receive IPX203 (n = 256) or immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (n = 250). The study met its primary end point, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in daily good on-time for IPX203 compared to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (least squares mean, 0.53 hours; 95% CI, 0.09–0.97; P = 0.02), with IPX203 dosed a mean 3 times per day vs 5 times per day for immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. Good on-time per dose increased by 1.55 hours with IPX203 compared to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (95% CI, 1.37–1.73; P < .001). IPX203 was well tolerated. The most common adverse events in the double-blind phase (IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa) were nausea (4.3% vs 0.8%) and anxiety (2.7% vs 0.0%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, IPX203 provided more hours of good on-time per day than immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa, even as IPX203 was dosed less frequently.

### 24-hour levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel may reduce troublesome dyskinesia in advanced Parkinson's disease [^9b99334d]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of levodopa induced dyskinesias (LID) is a complex phenomenon comprising a combination of nigrostriatal degeneration, pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation and synaptic remodelling.LCIG has the capacity to influence both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors, but until now pharmacokinetic factors have been thought to be the dominant mechanism. This is supported by the effectiveness of 16-h LCIG, where improvements in dyskinesia can be observed rapidly within hours to days of commencing therapy. However, evidence derived from clinical studies suggests that pharmacodynamic factors may also play a role in LID. – The pharmacodynamic effects of LCIG from studies of 24-h intravenous levodopa infusion demonstrated an increase of the threshold for LID with a reduction in the severity of dyskinesia, independent of the antiparkinsonian effect of levodopa.– We also observed a reduction in dyskinesias without loss of antiparkinsonian effect over the course of LCIG therapy despite the increment of total daily levodopa dose. The improvement in dyskinesia observed in some patients with 24-h LCIG, which could not be controlled with 16-h LCIG at the same or lower continuous rate, suggests that this improvement is due to pharmacodynamic processes that may rely on steady, continuous levodopa delivery to the brain. Due to the limitations in our study, we are unable to draw conclusions regarding potential mechanisms of our observations; this should be a focus of future research in this area.

In this cohort, there was a wide range in night-time LCIG rates at the time of follow-up (0.5–5.1 ml/h; 43–100% of day-rate, median 69%). Our approach when transitioning to 24-h LCIG is to commence the night-time rate at approximately 50% that of the day rate. If tolerated, slow up-titration (0.1 ml/h of night-time rate) in 1–4 weeks intervals, is then attempted, until therapeutic benefit and/or side effects are encountered. Based on this study it is not possible to determine the minimal night-time LCIG rate at which dyskinesia may be improved, however this is an important aspect of management which should be evaluated in prospective trials. It is interesting to note that at the time of follow-up, the night time rate varied from 43% of the day rate (patient 3) to 100% (patient 4) of the concurrent day rate among the responders (Table 2).

### Extended-release carbidopa-levodopa (IPX066) compared with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations: a phase 3 randomised, double-blind trial [^6bd038fd]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

IPX066 is an oral, extended-release, capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa. We aimed to assess this extended-release formulation versus immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study at 68 academic and clinical centres in North America and Europe. Patients with Parkinson's disease who had at least 2·5 h per day of off-time underwent 3 weeks of open-label immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa dose adjustment followed by 6 weeks of open-label extended-release carbidopa-levodopa dose conversion. These patients were then randomly allocated (1:1), by use of an interactive web-response system, to 13 weeks of double-blind treatment with extended-release or immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa plus matched placebos. The primary efficacy measure was off-time as a percentage of waking hours in all patients randomly allocated to treatment groups, adjusted for baseline value. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00974974.

Findings

Between Sept 29, 2009, and Aug 16, 2010, we enrolled 471 participants, of whom 393 (83%) were randomly allocated in the double-blind maintenance period and were included in the main efficacy analyses. As a percentage of waking hours, 201 patients treated double-blind with extended-release carbidopa-levodopa (mean 3·6 doses per day [SD 0·7]) had greater reductions in off-time than did 192 patients treated double-blind with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (mean 5·0 doses per day [1·2]). Covariate-adjusted end-of-study means were 23·82% (SD 14·91) for extended-release carbidopa-levodopa and 29·79% (15·81) for immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (mean difference -5·97, 95% CI -9·05 to -2·89; p < 0·0001). Extended-release carbidopa-levodopa reduced daily off-time by, on average, an extra -1·17 h (95% CI -1·69 to -0·66; p < 0·0001) compared with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. During dose conversion with extended-release carbidopa-levodopa, 23 (5%) of 450 patients withdrew because of adverse events and 13 (3%) withdrew because of a lack of efficacy. In the maintenance period, the most common adverse events were insomnia (seven [3%] of 201 patients allocated extended-release carbidopa-levodopa vs two [1%] of 192 patients allocated immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa), nausea (six [3%] vs three [2%]), and falls (six [3%] vs four [2%]).

Interpretation

Extended-release carbidopa-levodopa might be a useful treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease who have motor fluctuations, with potential benefits including decreased off-time and reduced levodopa dosing frequency.

Globally, Parkinson's disease (PD) affects > 6,000,000 people and has the fastest rate of growth among neurological disorders, the leading source of worldwide disability. 1 Our understanding of the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors involved in the development of PD 2 has advanced substantially 3 over the 2 centuries since James Parkinson's Essay on the Shaking Palsy 4; however, the primary pathological hallmark of the disease is still dopamine (DA) deficiency within the basal ganglia, leading to death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 5 Despite significant efforts to fulfill the substantial clinical need to identify disease‐modifying agents, 6 chronic DA replacement therapy remains the most effective method to treat the tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity motor symptoms of PD. 7

Levodopa (LD) remains the gold standard in DA replacement therapy. 7, 8, 9 The mechanism of action for LD as DA replacement therapy in the central nervous system involves the enzymatic decarboxylation of LD (a DA prodrug) by central dopa decarboxylase (Fig 1A). Without a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, minimal LD crosses the blood–brain barrier owing to premature decarboxylation; thus, high LD doses are required for PD therapy, leading to side effects. The development of the dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa (CD), 10 was a key breakthrough in LD treatment and led to the approval of oral LD/CD combination therapy in 1975. In early stage PD, oral LD/CD is effective at managing symptoms (see Fig 1B) when there is tolerance of fluctuating brain DA concentrations. 7 Later in disease progression, higher and more frequent doses are required, eventually leading to dyskinesias (involuntary exaggerated movements) at high DA concentrations and increased "off" time at low DA concentrations. Efforts to remove the peaks and troughs from oral LD/CD therapy and deliver a consistent and optimal DA level led to the development of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa). Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel decreases the "off" time of advanced PD patients by an average of 1.9 hours per day 11 but requires surgery for administration. Nevertheless, clinical experience with levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel demonstrated that sustained LD concentrations of ≤ 5μg/ml should be effective in treating the vast majority of patients with advanced PD, 12, 13 an important observation guiding our efforts to develop improved LD therapeutic approaches.

### Major nutritional issues in the management of Parkinson's disease [^bb1a12b5]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

As with other neurodegenerative diseases, neurologic and nutritional elements may interact affecting each other in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the long-term effects of such interactions on prognosis and outcome have not been given much attention and are poorly addressed by current research. Factors contributing to the clinical conditions of patients with PD are not only the basic features of PD, progression of disease, and the therapeutic approach but also fiber and nutrient intakes (in terms of both energy and protein content), fluid and micronutrient balance, and pharmaconutrient interactions (protein and levodopa). During the course of PD nutritional requirements frequently change. Accordingly, both body weight gain and loss may occur and, despite controversy, it seems that both changes in energy expenditure and food intake contribute. Nonmotor symptoms play a significant role and dysphagia may be responsible for the impairment of nutritional status and fluid balance. Constipation, gastroparesis, and gastro-oesophageal reflux significantly affect quality of life. Finally, any micronutrient deficiencies should be taken into account. Nutritional assessments should be performed routinely. Optimization of pharmacologic treatment for both motor and nonmotor symptoms is essential, but nutritional interventions and counseling could and should also be planned with regard to nutritional balance designed to prevent weight loss or gain; optimization of levodopa pharmacokinetics and avoidance of interaction with proteins; improvement in gastrointestinal dysfunction (e.g., dysphagia and constipation); prevention and treatment of nutritional deficiencies (micronutrients or vitamins). A balanced Mediterranean-like dietary regimen should be recommended before the introduction of levodopa; afterward, patients with advanced disease may benefit considerably from protein redistribution and low-protein regimens.

### Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone [^6b05873c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease was established in three 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with Parkinson's disease. In 2 of these studies (Studies 1 and 2), the patients' disease was "fluctuating", i.e., was characterized by documented periods of "On" (periods of relatively good functioning) and "Off" (periods of relatively poor functioning), despite optimum levodopa therapy. There was also a withdrawal period following 6 months of treatment. In the third trial patients were not required to have been experiencing fluctuations. Prior to the controlled part of these studies, patients were stabilized on levodopa for 2 weeks to 4 weeks.

There is limited experience using entacapone in patients who do not experience fluctuations.

In Studies 1 and 2, patients were randomized to receive placebo or entacapone 200 mg administered concomitantly with each dose of carbidopa/levodopa (up to 10 times daily, but patients averaged 4 doses to 6 doses per day). The double-blind portion of both studies was 6 months long. Patients periodically recorded the time spent in the "On" and "Off" states in home diaries throughout the duration of the trial. In one study, conducted in the Nordic countries, the primary outcome measure was the total mean time spent in the "On" state during an 18 hour diary recorded day (6 a.m. to midnight). In the other study, the primary outcome measure was the proportion of awake time spent over 24 hours in the "On" state.

### Entacapone (Comtan) [^9f9491a4]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Effect on the Pharmacokinetics of Levodopa and its Metabolites

When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours. In general, the average peak levodopa plasma concentration and the time of its occurrence (Tmaxof 1 hour) are unaffected. The onset of effect occurs after the first administration and is maintained during long-term treatment. Studies in Parkinson's disease patients suggest that the maximal effect occurs with 200 mg entacapone. Plasma levels of 3-OMD are markedly and dose-dependently decreased by entacapone when given with levodopa and carbidopa.

Pharmacokinetics of Entacapone

Entacapone pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range of 5 mg to 800 mg, and are independent of levodopa and carbidopa coadministration. The elimination of entacapone is biphasic, with an elimination half-life of 0.4 hour to 0.7 hour based on the β-phase and 2.4 hours based on the γ-phase. The γ-phase accounts for approximately 10% of the total AUC. The total body clearance after intravenous administration is 850 mL per min. After a single 200 mg dose of Comtan (entacapone), the Cmaxis approximately 1.2 mcg per mL.

Absorption: Entacapone is rapidly absorbed, with a Tmaxof approximately 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability following oral administration is 35%. Food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone.

Distribution: The volume of distribution of entacapone at steady state after intravenous injection is small (20 L). Entacapone does not distribute widely into tissues due to its high plasma protein binding. Based on in vitro studies, the plasma protein binding of entacapone is 98% over the concentration range of 0.4 mcg per mL to 50 mcg per mL. Entacapone binds mainly to serum albumin.

Selegiline

Selegiline, the first selective and irreversible MAO-B inhibitor to be approved, is available as an immediate release tablet and as an orally dissolvable tablet (ODT) as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa. Because selegiline is an irreversible inhibitor of the MAO-B enzyme, the duration of clinical effect exceeds its elimination half-life (of about 1.5 h), and decline in clinical effect after discontinuation of selegiline depends upon recovery of brain MAO-B via protein synthesis. The rate of MAO-B recovery is dose-, organ- and species-dependent; recovery of MAO-B activity occurs after 2 weeks in human platelets, whereas the half-life of recovery of MAO-B in pig brains is about 6.5 days. Following a number of small studies suggesting that oral selegiline added to carbidopa-levodopa improved motor fluctuations, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral selegiline plus optimized carbidopa-levodopa in 99 patients found that subject diary measures of walking and overall motor disability favored selegiline over placebo (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively). The ODT formulation reduces first-pass metabolism. In one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 140 subjects with at least 3 h of OFF time per day were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to ODT selegiline at two successively increasing doses or placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, subjects in the selegiline ODT group experienced significant improvements in both OFF time and ON time without dyskinesia relative to placebo (− 2.2 h vs − 0.6 h, p < 0.001; + 1.8 h vs + 0.4 h, p = 0.006), whereas ON time with dyskinesia was not significantly different between groups. However, a second identically designed trial randomizing 99 patients in a 2:1 fashion to the same escalating selegiline ODT doses or placebo found no significant differences in home diary measures of OFF time, although selegiline ODT significantly improved ON time without dyskinesia at 12 weeks (+ 1.9 h vs + 0.9 h, p = 0.035). These differences appeared to be largely due to significantly greater placebo responses in the latter trial. Selegiline ODT was approved by the FDA based on a pooled analysis of both trials finding significant improvements in the primary endpoint of percent reduction in OFF time, and an open-label extension study of selegiline ODT 2.5 mg/day showed similar sustained reductions in OFF time from baseline. The most common adverse effects in these studies included dizziness, nausea, insomnia, headache, and dyskinesia.
