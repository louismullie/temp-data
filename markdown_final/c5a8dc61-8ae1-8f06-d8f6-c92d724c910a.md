## Question

ADAT

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ADAT, specifically the ADAT2/ADAT3 tRNA deaminase complex, its function, disease links, and therapeutic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what ADAT stands for and how it differs from ADAR. Then, I should verify the core biochemistry and structural organization of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex. Next, I will examine the mechanistic consequences of A-to-I editing at the wobble position. After that, I should review the clinical phenotype and genetic spectrum of ADAT3-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Then, I will assess functional data in model systems and the strength of causality. Finally, I will consider translational implications, including diagnostics, potential therapies, and how this integrates with broader tRNA modification biology and neurodevelopmental disease paradigms.

> Let me first confirm the acronym and scope. ADAT here refers to adenosine deaminase acting on tRNA, specifically the ADAT2/ADAT3 heterodimeric complex that edits adenosine to inosine at position 34 of tRNAs, the wobble base, which is distinct from ADARs that edit double-stranded RNA in transcripts and are implicated in innate immunity and cancer vulnerabilities [^4e5aa8d4] [^dfc6398e].

> I need to check the core biochemistry and structure. The ADAT2/ADAT3 complex is a heterodimer in which ADAT2 provides the catalytic deaminase activity, while ADAT3 is catalytically inactive yet essential for complex stability and tRNA recognition. Cryo-EM and structural work show sequence-independent contacts and a gating mechanism for tRNA substrate entry, with ADAT3's N-terminal domain engaging the tRNA and presenting the anticodon loop to the catalytic core formed by ADAT2 and ADAT3's C-terminal domain [^7c77f118] [^92657756] [^e3a1536c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the functional impact of A34-to-I34 editing. I should confirm the decoding consequences. Inosine at the wobble position pairs with U, C, or A, enabling a single tRNA to read three codons and expanding the decoding capacity of ANN tRNAs, which is particularly important in eukaryotes where GNN tRNAs for some codons are absent. This modification shapes codon usage and can influence proteome homeostasis in a codon-specific manner [^fbfa8fb9] [^50080c25].

> Next, I should review the human disease association. Multiple studies converge on biallelic ADAT3 variants causing a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, microcephaly, abnormal brain structure, facial dysmorphism, and epilepsy; founder and recurrent variants include p. Val144Met and p. Ala196Val/Leu, with additional cases expanding the allelic spectrum and confirming recessive inheritance and phenotypic consistency across cohorts [^e898024f] [^454a1ff0] [^05d4e778].

> I will now examine the mechanistic link to neurodevelopment. Patient-derived and in vitro studies show that ADAT3 variants reduce complex abundance and/or catalytic activity, leading to decreased I34 levels in target tRNAs, with particularly pronounced effects on tRNA-Ala isodecoders. Computational and experimental data suggest that genes governing neuronal migration are enriched for codons decoded by I34-dependent tRNAs, implying codon-specific translational impairment rather than a global translation defect, which aligns with the observed cortical migration phenotype [^5b6b9e8e] [^50080c25] [^35bccf39].

> Wait, let me verify the functional causality in vivo. Acute knockdown of Adat3 in mouse cortical neurons impairs radial migration, and this defect is rescued by co-expression of wild-type ADAT3 and ADAT2, but not by catalytically inactive ADAT2, establishing that the enzymatic activity of the complex is required. Complementation assays also show dose-dependent rescue, reinforcing a threshold model of activity required for normal cortical development [^88bc92ba] [^3f808a93] [^454a1ff0].

> I should double-check the translational implications. The convergence of genetic, biochemical, and in vivo data supports a model wherein ADAT3 variants disrupt tRNA editing, destabilize specific tRNA isodecoders, and selectively impair translation of migration-related proteins, thereby causing delayed or defective neuronal positioning. This mechanistic clarity strengthens the case for ADAT3 as a bona fide neurodevelopmental disease gene and highlights tRNA modification biology as a key node in brain development [^4e5aa8d4] [^50080c25].

> Let me consider diagnostics and counseling. Given the recessive inheritance and the existence of founder variants, targeted genetic testing for ADAT3 in patients with syndromic ID, microcephaly, epilepsy, and brain anomalies is warranted. Carrier frequencies in certain populations and the absence of biallelic ADAT2 variants in humans suggest that ADAT3 is the principal clinically relevant locus in this pathway, which should guide testing strategies and family counseling [^e898024f] [^454a1ff0].

> But wait, what about therapeutics? I need to ensure I don't overstate current options. There are no disease-modifying therapies yet; management is supportive and symptomatic. However, the mechanistic insights open avenues such as gene therapy to restore ADAT3 expression, small molecules to stabilize the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex, or strategies to mitigate codon-specific translational stress. These remain speculative and would require preclinical validation before clinical translation [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how this fits into the broader landscape. ADAT3-related disease joins a growing set of neurodevelopmental disorders linked to tRNA modification enzymes, reinforcing the concept that precise translational control is essential for brain development. This aligns with other tRNA modification defects causing microcephaly, ID, and epilepsy, and underscores the need to consider tRNA biology in undiagnosed neurodevelopmental presentations [^bff66b65].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. The ADAT2/ADAT3 complex performs essential A34-to-I34 tRNA editing that expands decoding capacity. Biallelic ADAT3 variants impair complex activity, destabilize specific tRNAs, and cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder with cortical migration defects. In vivo functional data establish causality, and the field is poised to translate these mechanistic insights into diagnostic workflows and, eventually, targeted interventions [^4e5aa8d4] [^88bc92ba] [^50080c25].

ADAT refers to **adenosine deaminase acting on tRNA** (ADAT2/ADAT3), which catalyzes A-to-I editing at the wobble position of tRNAs, expanding codon-anticodon pairing and shaping the proteome [^7c77f118] [^50080c25]. ADAT3 variants cause **neurodevelopmental disorders** with impaired neuronal migration and intellectual disability, linked to reduced tRNA editing and translation defects in migration-related genes [^4e5aa8d4] [^50080c25]. ADAT is essential for brain development and is a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disease [^4e5aa8d4].

---

## Molecular function of ADAT

- **Enzyme complex**: ADAT is a heterodimer of ADAT2 (catalytic) and ADAT3 (non-catalytic, structural) that edits adenosine to inosine at position 34 (wobble base) of tRNAs [^7c77f118] [^92657756].

- **Codon expansion**: Inosine pairs with U, C, or A, enabling one tRNA to read three codons and increasing translational efficiency [^fbfa8fb9].

- **Proteome shaping**: ADAT modifies tRNA decoding, influencing codon usage and protein synthesis [^50080c25].

---

## Clinical significance of ADAT mutations

- **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Biallelic ADAT3 variants cause intellectual disability, speech delay, microcephaly, and abnormal brain structure [^e898024f] [^454a1ff0].

- **Neuronal migration defects**: ADAT3 variants impair radial migration of cortical neurons, correlating with reduced tRNA editing and translation defects in migration genes [^4e5aa8d4] [^50080c25].

- **Genetic spectrum**: Common variants include p. Val144Met and p. Ala196Val/Leu, with severity linked to the degree of ADAT2/ADAT3 dysfunction [^e898024f] [^454a1ff0].

---

## Mechanisms underlying ADAT-related neurodevelopmental disorders

- **tRNA editing loss**: ADAT3 variants reduce A34-to-I34 editing, destabilizing tRNAs and impairing translation of migration-related proteins [^5b6b9e8e] [^50080c25].

- **Codon-specific translation defects**: Migration genes are enriched for ADAT-dependent codons, explaining selective vulnerability in brain development [^50080c25].

- **Threshold model**: A minimal ADAT activity is required for normal cortical development; below this, neurodevelopmental phenotypes emerge [^454a1ff0].

---

## Therapeutic implications

Therapeutic strategies include **gene therapy** to restore ADAT3 expression or deliver functional ADAT2/ADAT3, and **small molecules** to stabilize the complex or enhance residual activity. ADAT is a promising target for neurodevelopmental disease, though therapies remain investigational [^notfound].

---

ADAT is a tRNA-editing complex that expands the genetic code and is essential for brain development; **ADAT3 variants cause neurodevelopmental disease** via impaired tRNA editing and translation, offering a therapeutic target for future intervention [^4e5aa8d4].

### The prognostic significance of ALDH1A1 expression in early invasive breast cancer [^679e5448]. Histopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A1 (ALDH1A1) is reportedly a key ALDH isozyme linked to the cancer stem cells (CSC) of many solid tumours, where it is involved in self-renewal, differentiation and self-protection. In this study, the prognostic significance of ALDH1A1 expression in early invasive breast cancer (BC) and its role as a BC stem cell (BCSC) were evaluated.

Methods and Results

ALDH1A1 expression was assessed, using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays, in a large well-characterised BC cohort. ALDH1A1 mRNA expression was also assessed at transcriptomic levels, utilising data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium. The associations of ALDH1A1 with clinicopathological parameters, other stem cell markers and patient outcomes were determined. ALDH1A1 was expressed in 71% of BC cases at both the protein and mRNA levels. High ALDH1A1 expression was associated with poor prognostic features, including high grade, poor Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), lymph node metastasis and highly proliferative ER + (luminal B) and triple-negative (TNBC) subtypes. ALDH1A1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of CD44, CD24, TWIST, SOX9, EPCAM and CD133. The high immunoexpression of ALDH1A1 was significantly associated with poor BC-specific survival (P < 0.001), and specifically in the luminal B and TNBC subtypes (P = 0.042 and P = 0.003, respectively). The immunoexpression of ALDH1A1 was an independent predictor of poor prognosis (P = 0.015).

Conclusions

ALDH1A1, as assessed using immunohistochemistry, seems to act as a BCSC marker associated not only with other BCSC markers but also with poor prognostic characteristics and poor outcomes, particularly in the luminal B and TNBC subtypes.

### The cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase is required to maintain a drug-tolerant tumor cell subpopulation [^ffe7d8a3]. Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Selective kinase inhibitors have emerged as an important class of cancer therapeutics, and several such drugs are now routinely used to treat advanced-stage disease. However, their clinical benefit is typically short-lived because of the relatively rapid acquisition of drug resistance following treatment response. Accumulating preclinical and clinical data point to a role for a heterogeneous response to treatment within a subpopulation of tumor cells that are intrinsically drug-resistant, such as cancer stem cells. We have previously described an epigenetically determined reversibly drug-tolerant subpopulation of cancer cells that share some properties with cancer stem cells. Here, we define a requirement for the previously established cancer stem cell marker ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) in the maintenance of this drug-tolerant subpopulation. We find that ALDH protects the drug-tolerant subpopulation from the potentially toxic effects of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these cells, and pharmacologic disruption of ALDH activity leads to accumulation of ROS to toxic levels, consequent DNA damage, and apoptosis specifically within the drug-tolerant subpopulation. Combining ALDH inhibition with other kinase-directed treatments delayed treatment relapse in vitro and in vivo, revealing a novel combination treatment strategy for cancers that might otherwise rapidly relapse following single-agent therapy.

### ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of hematopoiesis and suppression of interferon signaling [^9ef3e2be]. Nature Immunology (2009). Medium credibility.

The deaminase ADAR1 edits adenosines in nuclear transcripts of nervous tissue and is required in the fetal liver of the developing mouse embryo. Here we show by inducible gene disruption in mice that ADAR1 is essential for maintenance of both fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells. Loss of ADAR1 in hematopoietic stem cells led to global upregulation of type I and II interferon-inducible transcripts and rapid apoptosis. Our findings identify ADAR1 as an essential regulator of hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and suppressor of interferon signaling that may protect organisms from the deleterious effects of interferon activation associated with many pathological processes, including chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and cancer.

### The role of ALDH1A1 in contributing to breast tumour aggressiveness: a study conducted in an African population [^b9da0a21]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 member A1 (ALDH1A1) is one of the most well studied breast cancer stem cells. Its expression has been associated with poor clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes in several studies. This paper studies the expression of ALDH1A1 and its combination with CD44 + /CD24 -/low breast cancer stem cell and their association with clinicopathological parameters and molecular subtypes.

Method

Tissue Microarray was constructed from 222 Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissues. The expression of ALDH1A1, CD44 and CD24 were assessed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The association of ALDH1A1 and its association with clinicopathological parameters, molecular subtypes, CD44 and CD24 were studied in an African population. The association between CD44 + /CD24 -/low /ALDH1 + and the clinicopathological phenotypes were also studied.

Results

A high ALDH1A1 expression of 90% was recorded in this study. No association was found between ALDH1A1 and clinicopathological parameters. ALDH1A1 was positively associated with CD24 (r = 0.228, OR-4.599 95% CI- 1.751-12.076, p = 0.001) and CD44 (r = 0.228, OR-5.538 95%CI- 1.841-16.662, p = 0.001) but not associated with CD44 + /CD24 -/low (r = 0.134, OR- 2.720 95%CI- 0.959-7.710, p = 0.052). CD44 + /CD24 - /ALDH1 + however had significant associations with Age (p- 0.020, r = 0.161, OR- 2.771, 95%CI 1.147-6.697), Gender (p = 0.004, OR- 15.333 95%CI 1.339-175.54), Tumour grade (p = 0.005, r = 0.197, OR-3.913 95%CI 1.421-10.776) and clinical prognostic staging (p = 0.014, r = 0.182, OR-3.028 95%CI- 1.217-7.536). There was no association between CD44 + /CD24 - /ALDH1 + and the molecular subtypes.

Conclusion

The high expression of ALDH1A1 in breast cancer makes it an important target for targeted therapy. This study further confirms the increased tumourigenicity of CD44 + /CD24 - /ALDH1 + combination phenotype and its association with increased tumour grade and clinical prognostic stage. Survival studies of ALDH1A1 and other breast cancer stem cells in African populations are strongly recommended to help further understand their effect on tumour aggressiveness.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^bff66b65]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellular homeostasis and growth require protein synthesis to be both efficient to guarantee sufficient production and accurate to prevent the generation of defective or unstable proteins. Efficient and faithful protein translation rely on the activity of transfer RNAs (tRNAs), the adaptor molecules needed to decode genetic information into a peptide sequence. To be fully active, tRNA molecules need to be heavily modified post-transcriptionally. About 30 chemical modifications have been identified at various positions in human tRNAs.On average, a single tRNA carries 13 modifications.These modifications are catalysed by different classes of tRNA-modifying enzymes and influence tRNA structure, function and stability.Nucleotides in the anticodon loop are extensively modified.Those modifications are crucial, as they regulate the tRNA–mRNA interaction to either stabilize cognate Watson–Crick base pairing (position 37) or to facilitate wobble pairing (position 34) to increase the decoding capacity and to prevent frameshift errors.Thanks to the recent identification of human homologues for many tRNA-modifying enzymes and the wide use of whole exome sequencing, an increasing number of genes encoding for tRNA-modifying enzymes have been linked to human diseases.Interestingly, neurodevelopmental anomalies are the primary manifestation of variants in genes coding for tRNA-modifying enzymes suggesting a specific sensitivity of the brain during development to perturbations in tRNA modifications.Although most of those variants have been shown to affect tRNA modification in vitro, their direct implication in disease and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms have only been identified for a few of them.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^fbfa8fb9]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

ADAT2/ADAT3 is a heterodimeric enzyme complex that edits adenosine (A) to inosine (I) at the wobble position 34 of tRNAs starting with an A in their anticodon (ANN-tRNAs).It recognizes specifically tRNAs through the ADAT3 N-terminal domain (ADAT3N), which subsequently rotates to present the bound tRNAs to the ADAT catalytic domain, composed of the C-terminal domain of ADAT3 (ADAT3C) and ADAT2, that carries the catalytic activity.Given the ability of inosine to pair with uracil (U), cytosine (C) or adenosine (A),the A to I conversion at position 34 provides an extended base pairing capacity to the modified tRNAs and is essential for decoding the C-ending codons, as GNN-tRNAs do not exist in eukaryotic genomes. In accordance, complete deletion or loss of activity of this tRNA modification complex leads to lethality. Knocking down the activity of the complex leads to impaired cell cycle progressionand growth retardationin several species including yeast and humans, possibly due to its role in controlling translational kinetics.

### Normal and neoplastic urothelial stem cells: getting to the root of the problem [^da62a278]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Most epithelial tissues contain self-renewing stem cells that mature into downstream progenies with increasingly limited differentiation potential. It is not surprising that cancers arising from such hierarchically organized epithelial tissues retain features of cellular differentiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the urothelium of the urinary bladder is a hierarchically organized tissue, containing tissue-specific stem cells that are important for both normal homeostasis and injury response. The phenotypic and functional properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs; also known as tumour-initiating cells) from bladder cancer tissue have been studied in detail. Urothelial CSCs are not isolated by a 'one-marker-fits-all' approach; instead, various cell surface marker combinations (possibly reflecting the cell-of-origin) are used to isolate CSCs from distinct differentiation subtypes of urothelial carcinomas. Additional CSC markers, including cytokeratin 14 (CK14), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1 (ALDH1A1), and tumour protein 63 (p63), have revealed prognostic value for urothelial carcinomas. Signalling pathways involved in normal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation are implicated in the malignant transformation of different subsets of urothelial carcinomas. Early expansion of primitive CK14+ cells--driven by genetic pathways such as STAT3--can lead to the development of carcinoma in situ, and CSC-enriched urothelial carcinomas are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Given that bladder CSCs are the proposed root of malignancy and drivers of cancer initiation and progression for urothelial carcinomas, these cells are ideal targets for anticancer therapies.

### Synergizing genomic analysis with biological knowledge to identify and validate novel genes in pancreatic development [^38d9185c]. Pancreas (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study investigated the utility of advanced computational techniques to large-scale genome-based data to identify novel genes that govern murine pancreatic development.

Methods

An expression data set for mouse pancreatic development was complemented with high-throughput data analyzer to identify and prioritize novel genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were used to validate selected genes.

Results

Four new genes whose roles in the development of murine pancreas have not previously been established were identified: cystathionine β-synthase (Cbs), Meis homeobox 1, growth factor independent 1, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family, member A1. Their temporal expression during development was documented. Cbs was localized in the cytoplasm of the tip cells of the epithelial chords of the undifferentiated progenitor cells at E12.5 and was coexpressed with the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 and pancreas-specific transcription factor, 1a-positive cells. In the adult pancreas, Cbs was localized primarily within the acinar compartment.

Conclusions

In silico analysis of high-throughput microarray data in combination with background knowledge about genes provides an additional reliable method of identifying novel genes. To our knowledge, the expression and localization of Cbs have not been previously documented during mouse pancreatic development.

### P63: a crucial player in epithelial stemness regulation [^0120c15a]. Oncogene (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5 
The signaling pathway by which p63 affects CSCs in epithelial cancers.

A Distinct expression levels of the p63 protein in different tumor tissues (The Human Protein Atlas,). B The ΔNp63 isoform plays a crucial role in regulating various signaling pathways implicated in CSC stemness regulation, particularly in breast and SCC cancers. C p63 regulates ALDH1A1 in the context of prostate cancer, in which p63 affects CSC stemness. D TAp63 modulates the expression of specific Hippo pathway components to regulate the stemness of CSCs in breast cancer.

ΔNp63 is enriched in breast cancer CSCs and promotes their colony formation ability (Fig. 5B). Memmi and colleagues reported that ΔNp63 is preferentially expressed in CSCs from transgenic mice with mammary gland targeted ErbB2 (MMTV-ErB2) tumors and is required to maintain their self-renewal potential. Mechanistically, ΔNp63 directly binds to the gene regulatory regions of Shh, Gli2, and Ptch1 genes, regulating their expression and ultimately contributing to pathway activation. Additionally, p63 inactivation in ErbB2 progenitors reduces the transcription of genes for encoding components of the Shh signaling, to which mainly ΔNp63 isoform contributes, thus attenuating mammary CSC self-renewal. Similar to the normal counterparts, the tumor-initiating activity of CSCs of basal breast cancer is governed by ΔNp63-dependent transcription of Fzd7. A clinical study showed that ΔNp63 was enriched in a cell subpopulation from triple negative breast cancer patients. Furthermore, ΔNp63α positively correlates with Notch1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, and increases the fraction of CSC-like cells in a luminal breast cancer cell line. The interaction between ΔNp63 and BMPs, especially BMP7, is able to commit human breast cancer cells to a stem-like phenotype. The ΔNp63 isoform stimulates the transcription of the gene that encodes the cell-surface antigen CD44, a marker associated with cancer stem cells in breast, colorectal, and squamous cell carcinomas. Albeit at levels lower than in normal prostate, p63 expression is essential for regulating stem cell functions of neoplastic prostate epithelial cells. Cytoplastic aberrance of p63 is associated with high ALDH1A1(Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family, Member A1) expression, thus leading to increased cell proliferation rate of prostate CSCs (Fig. 5C). Su and colleagues demonstrated that TAp63 is the main regulator of the transition from mammary cells to TICs (Fig. 5D). In the absence of TAp63, mammary epithelial cells (MECs) unleash stemness potential by expressing MaSCs signatures as well as by activating the Hippo pathway. Therefore, TAp63 null mice develop aggressive metastasis.

### Novel role of engrailed 1 as a prosurvival transcription factor in basal-like breast cancer and engineering of interference peptides block its oncogenic function [^d4ca6abb]. Oncogene (2014). Low credibility.

Lastly, we examined potential downstream transcriptional targets of EN1 by performing genome-wide gene expression microarray analysis of SUM149PT cells overexpressing the EN1 cDNA and control vector (Supplementary Table S2). We specifically chose SUM149PT cells as they represent one of the few cell lines isolated from inflammatory breast cancer. Gene ontology analysis of differentially regulated genes revealed the upregulation of pathways involved in inflammation, cytokine and chemokine activity and angiogenesis (e.g. CXCL11, CD69, IL23A, interleukin 1 receptor-like 1/2, CXCL6, interleukin 8 and vascular epithelial growth factor A; Supplementary Table S3). These results suggest a potential link between EN1 expression and inflammatory breast cancer via the activation of downstream chemokine signaling pathways.

To better understand the function of EN1 in the pathology of breast cancer, the EN1 cDNA was overexpressed using a lentiviral vector in primary preparations of HUMECs generated from reduction mammoplasties. HUMEC cells were transduced with either EN1 cDNA or a control enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and 72 h after transduction, these cells were seeded in fibroblast feeder cultures with human embryonic stem cell medium, conditions that favor the propagation of mammary stem/progenitor cells.Although the primary HUMEC control cells could not be maintained in culture or passaged after 3 weeks, the EN1 -overexpressing cells survived for more than 6 months in culture with a very low division rate (Figure 2g). Furthermore, the HUMEC- EN1 cells differentiated into neural-like cells within a period of 3 weeks when placed in a neural differentiation medium. As EN1 is normally expressed in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, the expression of mesencephalic dopaminergic-specific markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase, vesicular monoamine transporter 2, dopamine transporter, neuron-specific class III β-tubulin (Tuj1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 was assessed by immunofluorescence. The HUMEC- EN1 cells displayed strong EN1 nuclear and faint cytoplasmic staining, the later overlapping with Tuj1 expression (Figure 2g, top right panel). Interestingly, these cells also displayed strong dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter expression (Figure 2g, lower right panel) as well as tyrosine hydroxylase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (Figure 2g, lower left panel). Despite the increase in dopaminergic markers, the HUMEC- EN1 cells failed to display typical neuronal excitability as assessed by whole-cell electrophysiological recording (data non shown), suggesting that more than a single TF is necessary for full conversion to functional dopaminergic neurons. Alternatively, transduction of EN1 could give rise to dopaminergic neurons at a very low frequency. Overall, these results suggest that expression of EN1 in breast cells could activate developmental pathways similar to those of dopaminergic neurons, providing cells a means to sustain survival against apoptotic stimuli.

### Clinical prognostic value of combined analysis of aldh1, survivin, and EpCAM expression in colorectal cancer [^e41871cf]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

To date, treatment allocation of CRC patients is based on the TNM (Tumour, Node, Metastasis) classification system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Under the current classification, patient groups still show large differences in clinical outcome (;;). Biomarkers that can better predict patient survival and the development of recurrent disease or metastasis are therefore warranted. These biomarkers can be used to further refine the TNM-staging system to identify CRC patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy and/or close follow-up in addition to surgery. This will contribute to an approach of personalised treatment, based on individual tumour characteristics.

Advances have been made towards the discovery of biomarkers in order to improve tumour staging. The American Society of Clinical Oncology's Tumor Markers Expert Panel (ASCO TMEP-2006) and the European Group on Tumor Markers (EGTM) reviewed the literature on a collection of biomarkers, of which most lacked the significant and discriminative value required for clinical implementation (;;,). Combining biomarkers based on tumour biology, thereby better reflecting tumour aggressiveness, might increase their clinical discriminative and prognostic value synergistically. The cancer hallmarks, as described by Hanahan and Weinberg, are those features that a tumour needs to attain to be able to sustain itself as tumour. Tumour aggressiveness may be related to the extent to which these different cancer hallmarks are acquired throughout the tumour, reflected by expression levels of specific individual biomarkers. In this study, we investigated the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1 or Aldh1), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5 or Survivin) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM or EpCAM). Together the expression levels of these markers represent the degree of acquirement of the main cancer hallmarks in CRC (Table 1). Aldh1 is a cytoplasmatic enzyme responsible for the oxidation of intracellular aldehydes (;), thereby conferring therapeutic resistance to alkylating agents. Research suggests that Aldh1 has a role in early differentiation of stem cells and their proliferation and metastasis. Expression of Aldh1 is associated with cancer stem cells. Survivin plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis (;,;;;) and cell division. Survivin is required for normal fetal development, and is generally no longer expressed in most adult tissues. Re-expression of Survivin is observed in a range of human cancers and linked to (colorectal) carcinogenesis. Expression of Survivin is associated with metastasis (;;), local recurrent disease and poor prognosis (;;;) in CRC. Membrane glycoprotein EpCAM is expressed on the highly proliferative cells of the intestinal epithelium, and is overexpressed in most human carcinomas, including colorectal carcinomas (;). Contradictory roles for EpCAM in cancer development have been published and reviewed. In CRC, loss of membranous EpCAM expression is generally associated with a tumour-promoting role and poor patient survival (,;;;;).

### Stem cell biomarker ALDH1A1 in breast cancer shows an association with prognosis and clinicopathological variables that is highly cut-off dependent [^6190caab]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A1 (ALDH1A1) is a putative marker of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) with prognostic implications when expressed in cancer or stroma. However, previous results are contradictory and we therefore aimed to further evaluate the impact of ALDH1A1 on distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and correlation with clinicopathological variables in breast cancer, specifically by evaluating different cut-offs.

Methods

Two breast cancer cohorts (N=216 and N=210) were evaluated with immunohistochemistry for ALDH1A1 on tissue microarrays with three different cut-offs in cancer cells and in stromal cells. The association of ALDH1A1 with DDFS and other clinicopathological variables was assessed. As further validation, gene expression levels of ALDH1A1 and association with survival were analysed in one of the cohorts and a separate cohort.

Results

ALDH1A1 expression in cancer cells was associated with either a better or a worse prognosis, depending on cut-off. Considering weakly stained cancer cells as positive, ALDH1A1+ was associated with a better prognosis in both cohorts. Considering only strongly stained cells as positive, ALDH1A1+ was associated with oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negativity in both cohorts and worse prognosis in one of the cohorts. Stromal ALDH1A1 staining was associated with improved DDFS in one cohort. Gene expression analysis showed that a high ALDH1A1 expression was associated with a better prognosis.

Conclusions

ALDH1A1 is associated with DDFS and clinicopathological variables, both in cancer cells and stroma, but is highly cut-off dependent. Only the strongly ALDH1A1-stained cells show a more aggressive phenotype typical for CSCs.

### Dual disruption of aldehyde dehydrogenases 1 and 3 promotes functional changes in the glutathione redox system and enhances chemosensitivity in nonsmall cell lung cancer [^30133dd4]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family is a superfamily of intracellular enzymes that oxidize numerous diverse physiologically and pathophysiologically relevant aldehydes to their corresponding nontoxic carboxylic acids. Whereas ALDH family members play primarily cytoprotective biological roles via detoxification of aldehydes, they also modulate cell proliferation, differentiation and survival.

In nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 85% of lung cancers, increasing evidence suggests that ALDHs play functional roles in tumorigenicity and drug resistance. Class 1 ALDH expression was found to correlate with invasive properties, chemoresistance and the in vivo ability to recapitulate original NSCLC. Activity of these enzymes was also reported to correlate with Notch expression, which drives a signaling pathway with alterations in ~30% of NSCLCs. The STAT3-NF-ĸB/DDIT3/CEBPβ axis, one of the key oncogenic drivers in NSCLC, was found to regulate ALDH1A3 expression. More recent data indicated that stem cells located in airways may initiate cancer formation and cause the poor clinical outcome of NSCLC. Notably, a main approach to isolate these tumor-initiating cells was based on their increased ALDH activity.

The involvement of ALDHs in tumor initiation, therapeutic resistance, and malignant behavior has been extensively described in the literature ; however, the identity and therapeutic value of the specific isoform(s) contributing to these effects in particular tumor types—including lung cancer—remains largely elusive, partially due to the dearth of specific inhibitors and the misinterpretation of the extensively used ALDEFLUOR assay.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify ALDH isoforms with clinical and prognostic value in NSCLC. Using genetic and pharmacological targeting approaches, we showed that simultaneous inhibition of class 1 and class 3 ALDHs compromises glutathione (GSH) homeostasis. This condition ultimately results in severe oxidative damage and cell death. Finally, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that are independent of EGFR and KRAS status, ALDH1 and ALDH3 may be key therapeutic targets for NSCLC either alone or combined with ROS-inducing chemotherapeutic agents.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenases inhibition eradicates leukemia stem cells while sparing normal progenitors [^2e843982]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with a median age of 69 years.The vast majority of patients with AML achieve complete remission after standard induction chemotherapy. However, the majority subsequently relapse and die of the disease. A leukemia stem cell (LSC) paradigm may explain this failure of complete remission to reliably translate into cure. LSCs, like normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), have self-renewal capacity and give rise to partially differentiated progeny that composes the bulk of the leukemia, but possesses only limited proliferative potential.The currently existing treatments in AML, such as cytarabine (ara-C) and anthracycline (for example, daunorubicin), at the cost of a great toxicity, are highly active against the leukemic bulk, but spare the LSCs responsible for relapse. Therefore, AML remains a clinical challenge and new therapies are urgently needed.

Only a rare population of AML cells enriched for LSCs, characterized by a CD34+CD38− phenotype is capable of generating leukemia in immunodeficient mice.More recently, evidence has been presented for a clinically relevant population of leukemic cells CD34+CD38− in AML. This leukemic subpopulation, with a positive aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH+) in flow cytometry has been shown to be highly enriched in LSCs. Interest in ALDH is due to its activity as a marker for identification of stem cell in different tissues. The different isoforms of ALDHs (ALDH1, 2 and 3) control the levels of three endogenous apoptogenic aldehydes: methional, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Cancer cells protect themselves from the apoptogenic effect of these aldehydes by the ALDHs that oxidize them to their non-apoptogenic carboxylic acids.

### The prognostic significance of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and CD133 expression in early stage non-small cell lung cancer [^865d0f8d]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Table 5 
Comparison of major studies performed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to investigate the prognostic significance of ALDH1/ALDH1A1 and CD133

According to the stem cell hypothesis, a small subgroup of specialised cells recapitulates the entire tumour after initial treatment, which eventually results in treatment failure. Clinical validation of stem cell hypothesis is best examined in a uniform population, reducing the impact of other prognostic factors like stage, nodal status or by adjuvant treatments. Although our results support this hypothesis, their variable prognostic role in different histological groups suggests that the expressions of CD133 and ALDH1A1 represent distinct markers of stem-like function rather than a single stem cell. Nevertheless, the expression of markers known to be functionally associated with stem-like phenotypes may well be a useful approach that can prospectively identify patients at high risk of recurrence following resection of early-stage lung cancer ADC.

### Ductal keratin 15luminal progenitors in normal breast exhibit a basal-like breast cancer transcriptomic signature [^39fd8a22]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The ductal-enriched group comprises immature luminal progenitors including K14 + /K19 + double-positive cells and a human-specific population of K15 + cells

To infer the roles of the clusters, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were examined and summarized in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1. From these data, it became obvious that clusters 1.1–1.4 in general may represent immature progenitors by expression of, e.g. ALDH1A3 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3) and KRT15,–, whereas clusters 2.1–2.6 and 3 represent more mature luminal epithelial cells by expression of BCL2, FOXA1 (forkhead box A1) and several endocrine receptors (Fig. 2a),,. This hierarchical division was echoed in a screen of lineage-specific cell-surface markers within the list of the in silico human surfaceome. Thus, we found expression of established progenitor markers TNFRSF11A (RANK), CD55, PROM1 (prominin 1) and KIT (c-Kit) – in clusters 1.1–1.4 and differentiated luminal epithelial markers ALCAM (CD166), AREG (amphiregulin), and TNFSF11 (RANKL) in clusters 2.1–2.6 (Fig. 2a),–. The full list of DEGs encoding cell-surface proteins is available in Supplementary Data 2. Intriguingly, the significantly duct-enriched cluster 1.2 accumulates MCAM (CD146), KRT14 and KRT15 expressing cells on a KRT19 -positive background (Fig. 2b, c)—a combination of phenotypes, which have been amply validated in functional progenitor assays and which have been localized primarily to ducts at the protein level,,. Cluster 3 was characterized by a significant expression of prolactin induced protein (PIP) and mucin like 1 (MUCL1) compared to other clusters. Also, immunoglobulin superfamily 1 (IGSF1) encoding a cell-surface molecule is exclusively upregulated in cluster 3 (Fig. 2a). To uncover any species related controversy concerning the generation of epithelial lineages, we compared our data with existing scRNA-seq data based on the mouse mammary gland. Of note, in accordance with others, we found that expression of KRT15 in the luminal compartment is specific for the human breast, and moreover that the mapping of the human stem cell hierarchy differs from that of mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^249cd8eb]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

At the molecular level, we provide the first exhaustive quantitative analysis of the impact of ADAT3 variants on both deamination and expression of ADAT2/ADAT3 target tRNAs. Analysis of the proportion of wobble inosine (I 34) in ANN isodecoders in cells derived from patients carrying either the p.V144M/p.V144M or p.A196V/p.A196L variants revealed a striking decrease of A 34 to I 34 editing in about 45% of the INN isodecoders (Fig. 5). This extends the initial observations showing impaired deamination on a few tRNA species in patients’ cells expressing the p.V144M/p.V144M variant.Of note, in contrast to ADAT2-depleted human HEK293T cells, where all the ADAT substrate tRNA families showed severe defects in deamination,in ADAT3 patients’ cells, only the tRNA-Ala family is affected (Supplementary Fig. 4E and F), suggesting a cell-specific effect of ADAT perturbation. Corroborating this hypothesis, it has been shown that proliferating versus differentiating cells translate the codons read by I 34 tRNAs with different efficiency.In addition, tRNA-Ala anticodon is one of the only enriched families in the embryonic brain,suggesting further potential brain sensitivity to ADAT impairment.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^eb016994]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings highlight a critical role of the heterodimeric enzyme complexes, ADAT2/ADAT3, in the regulation of radial migration of projection neurons. We provide several lines of evidence which suggest that the catalytic activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex is required for proper neuronal migration. First, we demonstrated that silencing of both the catalytic (ADAT2) and non-catalytic (ADAT3) subunits of the complex impaired neuronal migration to a similar extent (Fig. 2). Second, the co-expression of ADAT3 together with ADAT2 is required to abolish the phenotype induced by the loss of Adat3 (Supplementary Fig. 1G and H), suggesting that co-abundance of ADAT2 is likely necessary to stabilize ADAT3 in vivo. This result correlates with in vitro findings showing that ADAT3 tends to self-associate and aggregate when not assembled with ADAT2.In addition, co-expression of the catalytic-inactive form of ADAT2 and ADAT3 is unable to rescue the Adat3 -induced migratory phenotype (Fig. 2E and F). Third, while the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex bearing the p.A196V (A180V mADAT3) variant, that retained a similar enzymatic activity than the WT ADAT complex, restored the faulty migration observed upon Adat3 depletion; the ADAT2/ADAT3 complexes bearing the p.V144M (V128M mADAT3) and the p.A196L (A180L mADAT3) variants, respectively, which exhibit reduced enzymatic activity lost their ability to rescue the migration phenotype (Figs 4E and 6). Fourth, combined decreased expression and reduced catalytic activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex in patient-derived cell lines impaired the A to I conversion at the wobble position of tRNAs, to an extent that is compatible with life but that likely causes detrimental brain phenotypes (Figs 5 and 6).

### Targeted therapy for a subset of acute myeloid leukemias that lack expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 [^5742e5e3]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDHs) gene family contains at least 19 isoforms that metabolize retinoids, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endogenous and exogenous aldehydes. High levels of the ALDH1A1 isoform are expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as measured by mRNA analysis and staining with the fluorescent ALDH1A1 substrate Aldefluor.Despite this, ALDH1A1 is dispensable in murine HSCs, as it is compensated for by increased expression of the ALDH3A1 isoform and possibly others. Murine HSCs deficient in both ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 (Aldh1a1/3a1 DKOs) have a blocked B-cell development and reduced numbers of HSCs.The early B cells in these mice have increased levels of ROS and reactive aldehydes along with abnormalities in cell cycling, intracellular signaling and gene expression. Notably, HSCs and progenitors in these mice have elevated p38MAPK activity, increased sensitivity to DNA damage, and aberrant cell cycle distribution.These findings suggest an important role for ALDHs in metabolizing ROS and reactive aldehydes in primitive and differentiated hematopoietic cells, and show that the ALDHs and their substrates impact a variety of cellular processes in hematopoiesis.

The role that ALDHs play in normal HSCs suggests they may have important roles in leukemia as well. Several prior reports support this contention. In Fanconi anemia, loss of activity of the ALDH2 isoform in concert with FANC-D deficiency predisposes to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and bone marrow failure. ALDH activity in human leukemia also mediates resistance to a number of drugsand high levels of ALDH activity, as measured by Aldefluor staining, predict for a poor outcome to treatment. – Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that drive leukemia growth and disease relapse may also be identified with Aldefluor staining with either high or intermediate levels of staining.

Given these prior observations, in the present study, we sought to further clarify and define the role and significance of ALDH activity in acute leukemia with a particular focus on determining whether ALDH biology could be exploited for new treatment approaches.

### Getting to know adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency inside and out [^1c10eacc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ten years after the description of the first cohorts of patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA2) deficiency (DADA2), the pathomechanisms underlying the disease on a cellular level remain poorly understood. With the establishment of the lysosomal localization of the ADA2 protein and its involvement in nucleic acid sensing, the pathophysiologic focus has shifted to the inside of the cell. At the same time, extracellular (serum) ADA2 enzyme activity continues to be the diagnostic reference standard in patients with suspected DADA2. The diverse clinical phenotype and weak genotype-phenotype correlations further complicate the identification of shared cellular mechanisms that cause inflammation, immunodeficiency, and bone marrow failure in the absence of functional ADA2. This review inspects the characteristics of the ADA2 protein and its proposed function. The latter is discussed in the context of possible mechanisms driving the clinical phenotype in patients lacking functional ADA2. We discuss established processes and introduce unexplored pathways in the pathogenesis of DADA2.

### Dual disruption of aldehyde dehydrogenases 1 and 3 promotes functional changes in the glutathione redox system and enhances chemosensitivity in nonsmall cell lung cancer [^790e2aa1]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The involvement of ALDH in tumor initiation, therapeutic resistance and malignant behavior has become a popular topic in cancer research (reviewed in). Previous studies reported a significant correlation of class 1 ALDHs with poor clinical outcome in patients with NSCLC. Although these initial studies could not separate the contribution of individual isoenzymes, the results underscored the clinical potential of ALDHs in lung cancer. More recently, ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 were reported to be highly expressed in NSCLCs, and both isoenzymes were found to be overexpressed in putative lung epithelial stem cell niches in tumors compared with normal lung tissues. These observations have generated interesting speculation on the relationship of ALDHs to lung cancer.

Here, we described ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, and ALDH3A1 gains and mRNA upregulation to be associated with prognosis in lung ADC and SCC histological subgroups and provided supporting evidence that ALDH1A3 and ALDH3A1 could be a prognostic marker in NSCLC patients. In addition, we found that ALDH1A3 expression was associated with ADC histology, while ALDH3A1 was strongly associated with squamous histology. Consistent with our results, Shao et al. found that ALDH1A3 was highly expressed in early-stage tumors and patients with a nonsmoking history. We also revealed a significant association of high ALDH1A1 with never-smoker status, identifying ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 as possibly related to new risk factors in the ~10–20% of lung cancers occurring in never smokers. Interestingly, normal pneumocytes of smokers are reported to exhibit increased expression of ALDH1A1 compared with those of nonsmokers. These data, with our findings, support the key role that ALDH1A1 plays in the response to xenobiotics (likely, tobacco, chemotherapy and other chemicals) and invite a careful interpretation of studies comparing ALDH1A1 expression in lung tumor vs. normal lung tissues considering smoking patterns and exposure to other toxic agents. Consistent with this observation and in partial contrast with three earlier studies reporting ALDH1A1 as a predictor of poor prognosis in NSCLC, our results using more restrictive exclusion criteria indicated that high levels of ALDH1A1 determine significantly better OS in patients with well-differentiated tumors and provide an overall minimal benefit in patients with early-stage tumors and no neoadjuvant treatment. Although this protective effect of ALDH1A1 was reversed in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors and in chemotherapy-treated patients, this trend was nonsignificant. ALDH1A1 is likely to be linked to a generally protective role in xenobiotic clearance in the lungs. These observations place the ALDH1A1 in a different category of ALDHs.

### Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of ALDH1A3 as a treatment of β-cell failure [^7b7bec9e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we report that activation of ALDH1a3 expression in pancreatic β-cells is a reversible pathogenetic mechanism of β-cell dysfunction whose inhibition can be leveraged for treatment purposes. We have shown in previous work that this isoform of ALDH is normally not expressed in β-cells, and that its activation occurs in many mouse models of diabetes as well as in patients suffering from the disease,. We show that ALDH1A3 activation impairs insulin secretion and is associated with a loss of cellular differentiation features, and that these effects can be mimicked by the enzymatic product of ALDH1A3 activity, RA, presumably in an RAR/RXR-dependent fashion.

Approaches to treat β-cell failure can be subdivided into two categories: increasing cell number or promoting insulin secretion. The former has been pursued by transplantation of cadaver isletsor stem cell-derived β-cellsin patients requiring immune suppression for organ transplant. Stimulation of β-cell proliferationand inhibition of β-cell apoptosis have also been proposed,. Drugs that promote insulin secretion have been used for decades but are plagued by secondary failures.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenases inhibition eradicates leukemia stem cells while sparing normal progenitors [^4230e125]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The vast majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) achieve complete remission (CR) after standard induction chemotherapy. However, the majority subsequently relapse and die of the disease. A leukemia stem cell (LSC) paradigm has been invoked to explain this failure of CR to reliably translate into cure. Indeed, LSCs are highly enriched in CD34+CD38- leukemic cells that exhibit positive aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH+) on flow cytometry, these LSCs are resistant to currently existing treatments in AML such as cytarabine and anthracycline that, at the cost of great toxicity on normal cells, are highly active against the leukemic bulk, but spare the LSCs responsible for relapse. To try to combat the LSC population selectively, a well-characterized ALDH inhibitor by the trivial name of dimethyl ampal thiolester (DIMATE) was assessed on sorted CD34+CD38- subpopulations from AML patients and healthy patients. ALDH activity and cell viability were monitored by flow cytometry. From enzyme kinetic studies DIMATE is an active enzyme-dependent, competitive, irreversible inhibitor of ALDH1. On cells in culture, DIMATE is a powerful inhibitor of ALDHs 1 and 3, has a major cytotoxic activity on human AML cell lines. Moreover, DIMATE is highly active against leukemic populations enriched in LSCs, but, unlike conventional chemotherapy, DIMATE is not toxic for healthy hematopoietic stem cells which retained, after treatment, their self-renewing and multi-lineage differentiation capacity in immunodeficient mice, xenografted with human leukemic cells. DIMATE eradicates specifically human AML cells and spares healthy mouse hematologic cells.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^ec818b8a]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Altogether, our results demonstrate that maintaining a proper level of ADAT2/ADAT3 complex activity and subsequent level of I 34 modification is critical for cerebral cortex development. We propose a model in which the variant alters both the solubility and the activity of the complex so that it dictates the severity of the phenotype induced by the given variant. Whether or not the threshold activity of the complexes required for proper migration or for other developmental process is the same remains to be tested. Overall, our results raise the possibility of a threshold of activity below which the tRNAs modification (I 34) would be compatible with life but not sufficient to ensure protein demand during brain development, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders.

### All-trans retinoic acid sensitizes epithelial ovarian cancer to PARP inhibition after exposure to cisplatin [^b3393dca]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal of gynecologic malignancies. The standard-of-care treatment for EOC is platinum-based chemotherapy such as cisplatin (CDDP). Notably, platinum-based chemotherapy induces resistance of EOC to PARP inhibition. However, therapeutic approaches targeting PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance remain to be explored. In this study, we show that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) reduces PARPi resistance-associated EOC cells induced by CDDP treatment. Clinically applicable ATRA suppressed the outgrowth of CDDP-treated EOC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, a CDDP treatment followed by niraparib maintenance therapy in combination with ATRA improved the survival of EOC-bearing mice. These phenotypes correlated with the PARPi-resistant EOC signature, which consists of elevated expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, PARP1, and checkpoint kinase 1, as well as elevated NAD+ level-mediated high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 and PARP1. Mechanistically, ATRA downregulates the expression of these genes and level of intracellular NAD+. Our results suggest that ATRA in conjunction with PARPi represents a promising maintenance therapeutic strategy for EOC.

### CSN6-TRIM21 axis instigates cancer stemness during tumorigenesis [^eebfa070]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumour initiation, metastasis and recurrence. However, the mechanism of CSC formation, maintenance and expansion in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly characterised.

Methods

The role of COP9 signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6) in regulating cancer stemness was evaluated by organoid formation and limited dilution analysis. The role of CSN6-TRIM21-OCT1-ALDH1A1 axis in CSC formation was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The association of CSN6, TRIM21 and ALDH1A1 expression was validated by a tissue microarray with 267 CRC patients.

Results

The results showed that CSN6 is critical for sphere formation and maintaining the growth of patient-derived organoids (PDOs). We characterised the role of CSN6 in regulating cancer stemness, which involves the TRIM21 E3 ubiquitin ligase, transcription factor POU class 2 homeobox 1 (OCT1) and cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A1 (ALDH1A1). Our data showed that CSN6 facilitates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRIM21, which in turn decreases TRIM21-mediated OCT1 ubiquitination and subsequently stabilises OCT1. Consequently, OCT1 stabilisation leads to ALDH1A1expression and promotes cancer stemness. We further showed that the protein expression levels of CSN6, TRIM21 and ALDH1A1 can serve as prognostic markers for human CRC.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we validate a pathway for cancer stemness regulation involving ALDH1A1 levels through the CSN6-TRIM21 axis, which may be utilised as CRC molecular markers and be targeted for therapeutic intervention in cancers.

### Oncorequisite role of an aldehyde dehydrogenase in the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^10ad9616]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematologic malignancy that arises from immature T-cell precursors. This type of leukemia occurs mostly in children but is also found in adults. A number of chromosomal and genetic abnormalities have been identified in T-ALL, many of which affect genes encoding transcription factors.Gene expression and mutational profiles have demonstrated that T-ALL cases can be classified into mutually exclusive subgroups based on the expression of several transcription factors (TAL1, TAL2, LYL1, LMO1, LMO2, TLX1/HOX11, TLX3/HOX11L2, HOXA and NKX3-1).This suggests that each transcription factor drives a distinct cellular program that may work in concert with other molecular pathways in T-ALL cells.

TAL1- positive T-ALL constitutes the largest subgroup, accounting for 40-60% of all primary cases. One of the known downstream targets of TAL1 in T-ALL cells is ALDH1A2,, a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family of genes that encode oxidoreductases. ALDH proteins convert a variety of aldehydes into carboxylic acids. They detoxify endogenous aldehydes, generated during the metabolism of membrane lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates and steroids.The reaction is NAD(P) + -dependent and generates an important component of the cellular antioxidant system, NAD(P)H, which also acts as an essential coenzyme in several metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.Retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, a subfamily of ALDH genes, including ALDH1A2, are also capable of converting retinaldehyde into retinoic acid. ALDH activity has also been implicated as a cancer stem cell marker in various solid tumors. The Aldefluor assay is commonly used to isolate an ALDH-positive population to refine the cancer stem cell population. Overexpression of ALDH genes confers drug resistance to cancer cells.These findings suggest that high levels of ALDH activity may be advantageous and, even required, for cancer cell maintenance.

In this study, we elucidated the molecular function and role of ALDH1A2 in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. We demonstrated that ALDH1A2 is directly activated by TAL1 and protects against intracellular stress, supporting leukemia cell metabolism and promoting leukemia cell survival.

### Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation rescues the immunologic phenotype and prevents vasculopathy in patients with adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency [^33ca06e4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Allogeneic HSCT restored normal plasma ADA2 activity in P1, which is consistent with bone marrow–derived monocytes and macrophages being the main sources of secreted ADA2. Whether ADA2 plays a role in other tissues and the effect of this on long-term prognosis remains unclear. A recent report on HSCT in a patient with ADA2 deficiency with a 9-year follow-up is promising and supports our findings.However, it is plausible that the benefit from HSCT to our patient is entirely due to restoration of normal plasma ADA2 levels. If true, future treatment with exogenous ADA2 might provide an alternative therapy for ADA2 deficiency in patients in whom allogeneic HSCT is contraindicated.

### Β-catenin / POU5F1 / SOX2 transcription factor complex mediates IGF-I receptor signaling and predicts poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma [^6b9b0cdf]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSLC) are crucial in tumor initiation and progression; however, the underlying mechanism for the self-renewal of cancer cells remains undefined. In the study, immunohistochemical analysis of specimens freshly excised from patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that high expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) in lung adenocarcinoma cells was positively correlated with the expressions of cancer stem cell markers CD133 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1). IGF-IR activation enhanced POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1) expression on human lung adenocarcinoma stem-like cells (LACSLC) through PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin cascade. POU5F1 could form a novel complex with β-catenin and SOX2 to bind Nanog promoter for transcription to maintain self-renewal of LACSLCs, which was dependent on the functional IGF-IR. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of IGF-IR abrogated LACSLC capabilities for self-renewal and tumorigenicity in vitro. In an in vivo xenograft tumor model, knockdown of either IGF-IR or POU5F1 impeded tumorigenic potentials of LACSLCs. By analyzing pathologic specimens excised from 200 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, we found that colocalization of highly expressed IGF-IR with β-catenin and POU5F1 predicted poor prognosis. Taken together, we show that IGF-IR-mediated POU5F1 expression to form a complex with β-catenin and SOX2 is crucial for the self-renewal and oncogenic potentials of LACSLCs, and the integrative clinical detection of the expressions of IGF-IR, β-catenin, and POU5F1 is indicatory for predicting prognosis in the patients of lung adenocarcinoma.

### Refining classification of cholangiocarcinoma subtypes via proteogenomic integration reveals new therapeutic prospects [^c5a1cd65]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (iCCs) are characterized by their rarity, difficult diagnosis, and overall poor prognosis. The iCC molecular classification for developing precision medicine strategies was investigated.

Methods

Comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analyses were performed on treatment-naïve tumor samples from 102 patients with iCC who underwent surgical resection with curative intent. An organoid model was constructed for testing therapeutic potential.

Results

Three clinically supported subtypes (stem-like, poorly immunogenic, and metabolism) were identified. NCT-501 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 [ALDH1A1] inhibitor) exhibited synergism with nanoparticle albumin-bound-paclitaxel in the organoid model for the stem-like subtype. The oncometabolite dysregulations were associated with different clinical outcomes in the stem-like and metabolism subtypes. The poorly immunogenic subtype harbors the non-T-cell tumor infiltration. Integrated multiomics analysis not only reproduced the 3 subtypes but also showed heterogeneity in iCC.

Conclusions

This large-scale proteogenomic analysis provides information beyond that obtained with genomic analysis, allowing the functional impact of genomic alterations to be discerned. These findings may assist in the stratification of patients with iCC and in developing rational therapeutic strategies.

We provide further insights into the structural basis of the ADAT3-related NDD. Although the V128 (V144 in humans) and A180 (A196 in humans) residues lie in different structural domains, the N-terminal (ADAT3N)and C-terminal domains, respectively, the V128M and A180L variants are both suggested to affect the presentation of the tRNAs anticodon loop to the active catalytic site of the complex, yet through distinct structural perturbation. Based on the crystal structure of the ADAT2/V128L-ADAT3 mouse complex, we previously predicted that the V128M variant hinders the proper positioning of the ADAT3N terminal domain to correctly present the anticodon loop to ADAT2, likely through perturbation of the interaction between ADAT3N and the ADAT2/ADAT3 catalytic domain.Here, the crystal structure of the ADAT2/A180V-ADAT3 mutant complex did not reveal any defect in the ADAT3N domain, but rather local perturbations in the α-helix, where the A180 residue is located, and in the ADAT3 C-terminal domain β-sheet, both located close to the interaction surface with ADAT3N. We anticipated that the A180L substitution aggravates these local perturbations and alters the interaction between the ADAT3N and the ADAT2/ADAT3 catalytic domains and therefore, the correct presentation of the tRNAs to ADAT2. This structurally predicted loss of enzymatic activity of the ADAT2/V128M-ADAT3 and ADAT2/A180V-ADAT3 but not of ADAT2/A180L-ADAT3 is supported by: (i) a severe decrease of the tRNAs deamination activity of the V128M and A180L complexes compared with the WT and A180V complexes in vitro (Fig. 4E); and (ii) the lack of rescue of the migration phenotype with the two variants showing an impaired enzymatic activity (Fig. 6). Intriguingly, we also showed impaired solubility of the variants (Fig. 4C). However, the structural perturbations observed in the mutant complexes (V128M/L > A180L >> A180V > WT) correlate better with the defects in enzymatic activity (V128M/L; A180L > WT; A180V = WT) than the defects in solubility (A180L > A180V >> V128M/L = WT) (Table 1). Altogether, these results suggest that, although one cannot exclude that the variants preclude the formation of the complexes in vivo, the structural alterations are likely one of the major determinants of the loss of deamination activity of the mutant complexes and might greatly contribute to the development of NDDs.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenases inhibition eradicates leukemia stem cells while sparing normal progenitors [^6fcf54b2]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Resistance to cytarabine and anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure in AML.More precisely, CD34+CD38− leukemic cell population, enriched in LSCs, are highly resistant to these and other conventional chemotherapies.Therefore new therapies are urgently needed for this deadly disease. Furthermore, conventional chemotherapy have similar cytotoxic effects on normal or leukemic HSCs.In sharp contrast, we demonstrated that DIMATE, through ALDH inhibition, targeted and eradicated in vitro and in vivo several human myeloid leukemia cell lines and human leukemic cells population highly enriched in LSCs, but spared healthy HSCs. Most interestingly, we have determined a therapeutic zone, between 5 and 9 μmol/l, where DIMATE eradicated all LSCs (100% of lethality) and showed low toxicity (under 3% of lethality) on healthy HSCs. Moreover, with such treatment concentrations, healthy HSCs retained their self-renewing and multi-lineage differentiation capacity.

ALDH detoxifying enzymes has been extensively associated with a number of malignancies and drug-resistant phenotypes. In the particular case of AML, the ALDH gene family is found upregulated or amplificated in 42% of cases, impacting also life expectancy, negatively (Supplementary Figures 2A and B). These data suggest that the altered ALDH activity in AML confers advantages for cell proliferation and survival and/or for the progression of the disease. DIMATE is described as an irreversible inhibitor of recombinant ALDH1 and ALDH3. Therefore, we evaluated the capacity of DIMATE to inhibit the ALDH activity in leukemic cells.

Selective cytotoxicity of DIMATE on cancer cells of human and murine origin has already been demonstrated in vitro on human epithelial cancer cells. Indeed, DIMATE induces an irreversible apoptosis in human prostate epithelial cancer cells DU145, but it is a reversible cytostatic agent on human prostate epithelial normal cells. In the specific AML framework, safety of ALDH inhibitor on healthy HSCs has already been demonstrated, and even more remarkable is the inhibition of ALDH and retinoid signaling induces expansion of human HSCs.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^6d5a2278]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Variants in ADAT3 affect the stability, structure and enzymatic activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex

We next evaluated the impact of the identified variants on the remaining ADAT2/ADAT3 complex. We first mapped the variants using the crystal structure of the mouse WT ADAT2/ADAT3 complex.The ADAT3 V128 residue (corresponding to the V144 residue in humans, Supplementary Fig. 3A) is part of a large hydrophobic core located in the middle of the N-terminal domain of ADAT3 (ADAT3N),while the ADAT3 A180 residue (corresponding to the A196 residue in humans), is buried within the ADAT3 C-terminal domain (ADAT3C, Fig. 4A). Despite their different 3D locations, the p.V144M and p.A196V/L variants cause similar clinical phenotypes raising the question of the impact of these mutations on ADAT3 and ADAT2/ADAT3 complex solubility, structure and activity.

### All-trans retinoic acid sensitizes epithelial ovarian cancer to PARP inhibition after exposure to cisplatin [^21aae340]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal of gynecologic malignancies. The standard-of-care treatment for EOC is platinum-based chemotherapy such as cisplatin (CDDP). Notably, platinum-based chemotherapy induces resistance of EOC to PARP inhibition. However, therapeutic approaches targeting PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance remain to be explored. In this study, we show that all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) reduces PARPi resistance–associated EOC cells induced by CDDP treatment. Clinically applicable ATRA suppressed the outgrowth of CDDP-treated EOC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, a CDDP treatment followed by niraparib maintenance therapy in combination with ATRA improved the survival of EOC-bearing mice. These phenotypes correlated with the PARPi-resistant EOC signature, which consists of elevated expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, PARP1, and checkpoint kinase 1, as well as elevated NAD + level–mediated high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 and PARP1. Mechanistically, ATRA downregulates the expression of these genes and level of intracellular NAD +. Our results suggest that ATRA in conjunction with PARPi represents a promising maintenance therapeutic strategy for EOC.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^3f808a93]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

The catalytic activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex is required for proper neuronal migration

To assess whether the migratory function of ADAT3 depends on its function within the heterodimeric ADAT2/ADAT3 enzymatic complex, we next explored the effect of silencing the catalytically active partner, ADAT2, on neuronal migration. We performed acute depletion of Adat2 specifically in neurons by IUE of NeuroD-driven Adat 2-miRNAs in WT cortices at E14.5. The ability of miRNAs to efficiently and specifically target Adat2 was tested by qPCR and immunoblotting (reduction of 83% of protein levels for both miR1- and miR2- Adat2) (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Table 2). Consistent with a critical role of the complex in the regulation of radial migration, the migration defects observed after depletion of Adat2 were comparable to those observed after silencing of Adat3 (−21%, −19.5% of cells reaching the upper cortical plate in ND miR1- and ND miR2- Adat2, respectively) (Fig. 2E and F). We next addressed whether the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex controls neuronal migration through its catalytic activity and tested for rescue of the phenotype induced by the loss of Adat3 by expressing WT DCX-ADAT3 and a catalytically inactive form of ADAT2 (ND-ADAT2 CI, Supplementary Fig. 1I). In accordance with the need of enzymatic activity, co-expression of ADAT3 with WT ADAT2 but not with catalytic inactive ADAT2 rescued the impaired positioning of Adat3 -depleted cells (Fig. 2C and D). Altogether, these results demonstrate the catalytic activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex is required to exert its function in migrating projection neurons.

The V128M and A180V/L ADAT3 mutants affect ADAT2/ADAT3 stability, structure and deamination activity. (A) Ribbon representation of the crystallographic structure of the wild-type (WT) mouse ADAT complex (PDB entry 7nz8). The catalytic domain of ADAT is composed of ADAT2 (magenta) and the C-terminal domain of ADAT3 (blue; ADAT3C). The N-terminal domain of ADAT3 (cyan; ADAT3N) is key to recognizing tRNAs through its ferredoxin-like domain (FLD) and to rotate with respect to the ADAT catalytic domain to position the tRNA anticodon loop within the ADAT2 active site. The two residues (V128 and A180), shown in red and that are found mutated in patients, are displayed. These are located in different regions of the ADAT complex. (B) SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analysis of expression levels in E. coli of untagged ADAT2 WT and His-tagged ADAT3 (WT and A180V, A180L, V128M mutants) constructs, either alone or in combination. Expression levels are similar for all constructs used. (C) SDS-PAGE analysis of His-tag affinity-purified samples of B. In the absence of ADAT2, the ADAT3 mutant constructs show a significant decrease in solubility compared with WT.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenases inhibition eradicates leukemia stem cells while sparing normal progenitors [^398fc71f]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Among the family of acetylenic ALDH inhibitors, we identified the dimethyl ampal thiolester (DIMATE), an α,β, acetylenic N-substituted aminothiol ester, as an interesting candidate for cancer treatment. DIMATE is an active enzyme-dependent, competitive, irreversible inhibitor of ALDHs 1 and 3. It induces apoptosis in the chemoresistant mouse lymphoid cells BAF3bcl2 that are also resistant to disulfiram, a well-characterized inhibitor of ALDH2.Moreover, although DIMATE was apoptogenic on cultures of human prostate cancer cells DU145, it was reversibly cytostatic on normal human prostate epithelial cells.

On the basis of these preliminary data on ALDH activity in LSC and differential effects between normal and cancer cells, we hypothesized that DIMATE could be a candidate for targeted therapy on LSC while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitors, thus providing an efficient and safe approach for chemotherapy of acute leukemia aiming at the eradication of minimal residual disease.

### The prognostic significance of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and CD133 expression in early stage non-small cell lung cancer [^e0a96a0f]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Analysis from our study confirms that ALDH1A1 and CD133 overexpression is independently associated with poor survival in stage 1 lung cancer. Moreover, in our cohort, combined overexpression of ALDH1A1 and CD133 selects the patients from the worst prognostic group. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the prognostic role of these markers may be different in different histological subtypes. In ADC, ALDH1A1 expression was highly significant for poor survival, while CD133 showed a direction of effect towards poor survival. However, neither marker showed a significant difference in squamous histology. Further examination of ADC histologic subtypes suggested that both ALDH1A1 and CD133 are markers of poor survival in acinar predominant histological subtype. Results with other subtypes were not significant, possibly due to fewer numbers of patients. We did not include AIS and MIA in our study due to their excellent prognosis.

Work by Jiang et al showed that ALDH1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in stage 1 NSCLC and that ALDH1 expression overlapped with CD133 in a small subset of patients. Similarly, Sullivan et al reported that only ALDH1A1 (an isoform of ALDH1), but not CD133, was marker of poor prognosis in stage 1 NSCLC. Table 5 compares the methodologies and main results from previous studies with our findings. The consistencies in results support the importance of ALDH1A1 as a prognostic marker in lung cancer. By contrast, our results differ with respect to CD133 expression. This could be best explained by the variation in the patient's population, or in the specificity of the antibodies used in IHC. Currently available commercial antibodies may not be able to adequately discriminate the most specific epitope of CD133, emphasising the need to investigate the multiple epitopes and their function in maintaining stem cell-like phenotype.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^88bc92ba]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

ADAT3 regulates the radial migration of projection neurons

To evaluate the function of mouse ADAT3 (mADAT3), we cloned two different microRNAs (miRNA) targeting specifically Adat3 mRNA (Supplementary Table 2) and confirmed their efficacy by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting (reduction of 85.3% and 96.5% of protein levels for miR1- and miR2- Adat3, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B). We first assessed the consequences of acute depletion of m Adat3 on neuronal migration in wild-type (WT) mouse cortices using in utero electroporation (IUE) at E14.5 of miRNAs under the control of a ubiquitous CAG promoter together with a NeuroD(ND)-IRES-GFP reporter construct, allowing the expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein) specifically in postmitotic neurons. Four days after IUE, the distribution of GFP+ neurons depleted for Adat 3 was significantly impaired with a notable reduction of GFP+ neurons reaching the upper cortical plate (up CP) upon acute depletion of Adat3 (−32.7% and −21.7% for miR1- and miR2- Adat 3, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 1C and D). Yet, after birth, most of the Adat3 -silenced cells showed correct positioning with nearly all cells found in the upper layer of the cortex, indicating a delay in migration rather than a permanent arrest (Supplementary Fig. 1E). As pCAGGS is a ubiquitous promoter, impaired neuronal positioning observed upon pCAGGS-driven Adat3 deletion might result from defects arising in progenitors, in their neuronal progeny or in both. We performed IUE of plasmids expressing the same miRNAs under the control of the neuronal promoter NeuroD (ND) to induce neuron-specific knockdown. We showed faulty migration of Adat3 -silenced neurons with a reduction of 21.9% and 22.7% of cells distributed in the upper CP for ND miR1- and ND miR2- Adat3, respectively, suggesting that defect in postmitotic neurons largely contributed to the Adat3 -dependent migration phenotype in a cell autonomous manner (Fig. 2A and B). To further validate the specificity of the migratory phenotype induced by Adat3 silencing, we tested the ability of WT mADAT3 protein to restore the migration defects. We performed co-electroporation of NeuroD-driven miRNAs together with plasmids expressing miRNA-insensitive mADAT3 under the regulation of a neuronal promoter DCX (Supplementary Fig. 1F). While co-electroporation of WT DCX-ADAT3 alone failed to rescue the impaired distribution of Adat3 -depleted neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1G and H), Adat3 -silenced neurons expressing both WT DCX-ADAT3 and NeuroD(ND)-ADAT2 displayed correct positioning within the upper cortical plate (Fig. 2C and D and Supplementary Fig. 1G and H) indicating that the ability of ADAT3 to restore the migration phenotype depends on the stoichiometric expression of ADAT3 and ADAT2 in vivo. Of note, ND-ADAT2, alone (Supplementary Fig. 1G and H) or in combination with DCX-ADAT3 (Supplementary Fig. 5B and C) did not induce migration phenotypes while overexpressed under control conditions (sh-Scramble). Altogether, these results demonstrate that ADAT3 is cell autonomously required for the proper migration of projection neurons and suggest a contribution of tRNAs modification to radial migration.

### Targeted therapy for a subset of acute myeloid leukemias that lack expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 [^52fedabb]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Since a substantial subgroup of AMLs is deficient in ALDH1A1 expression at different stages of disease (diagnosis and relapse), we speculated that these ALDH1A1 − AMLs may specifically be more sensitive to compounds that directly or indirectly generate toxic ALDH1A1 substrates. First, 4HNE, a prototypical toxic reactive aldehyde substrate of ALDH1A1 was quite effective at killing ALDH1A1 − cell lines while CD34 + UCB, which expresses high levels of ALDH1A1, was quite resistant to this compound. Of more clinical relevance, we found that ATO, a widely used drug in the treatment of APL, could induce the intracellular production of 4HNE, leading to selective killing of ALDH1A1 − AMLs. This effect was at least partially blocked by restoration of ALDH1A1 activity through gene transfer, further supporting a role for ALDH1A1 in this effect. The finding that ALDH1A1 gene transfer did not fully block the effect of ATO is likely because ATO potentially works through a variety of mechanisms, of which generating 4HNE is only one.To amplify the effect of ATO in ALDH1A1 − AML, it was combined with 4HC for in vitro studies and Cy for in vivo studies as these generate a toxic intermediate substrate termed aldophosphamide that is primarily metabolized by ALDH1A1. ALDH1A1 − AML cell lines as well as primary ALDH1A1 − AMLs were particularly sensitive to the ATO and 4HC/Cy combinations both in vitro and in vivo, while, again, normal HSCs were relatively resistant. The in vivo studies ultimately may be extended to determine mechanisms of resistance to ALDH-directed therapy.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^09f12365]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial expression of the WT and mutant mouse ADAT3 constructs alone showed that, despite similar expression levels (Fig. 4B), all three mutants significantly affect the solubility of ADAT3 (Fig. 4C). However, co-expression of these constructs with ADAT2 partially restored ADAT3 solubility upon formation of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex. Co-expressed with ADAT2, the V128M ADAT3 construct was almost as soluble as the WT construct, whereas the A180V and A180L constructs were less soluble, albeit the A180V being slightly more soluble than the A180L construct (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, as assessed during the purification process, once formed and soluble, the mutant complexes do not show aggregation properties and can be used for further biochemical assays and structural analyses. We therefore sought to characterize the structural effect of the A180V/L mutations as was done previously for the variant at the V128 residue.In our initial study, crystals were obtained for the ADAT2/ADAT3-p.V128M complex but those did not diffract sufficiently. However, the structure of the ADAT2/ADAT3-V128L complex showed that the V128L mutation perturbs the ADAT3N region involved in the interaction with the ADAT catalytic domain, suggesting a partially impaired presentation of the bound tRNA anticodon loop to the ADAT2 active site. These defects should be exacerbated in the case of the V128M mutant.Crystallization assay of the ADAT2/ADAT3-A180V and ADAT2/ADAT3-A180L complexes were successful for the former complex, while the latter failed to crystallize. Following structure determination at 2.9 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 4), comparison with the structure of the WT ADAT2/ADAT3 complex revealed that, unlike the p.V128L variant that mostly affects the ADAT3N, the p.A180V substitution causes small local perturbations in the structure of the ADAT3 C-terminal domain (Fig. 4D). We anticipate in this case also that this effect is exacerbated with the A180L mutant due to the bulkier character of the leucine residue compared with the valine residue. The structural effects caused by the mutation of the A180 residue are more difficult to predict than those of the V128 residue.Indeed, this residue is relatively far away from ADAT2 and its active site, and it is unlikely that mutation of this residue directly affects the catalytic mechanism. On the other hand, A180 is located in the long α-helix that immediately follows the ADAT3N domain (Fig. 4A). Its mutation into leucine could affect the proper folding and positioning of this helix but also those of the central ADAT3 C-terminal domain β-sheet that is also involved in the interaction with ADAT3N. Therefore, our structural analysis suggested that the A180L mutation probably also affects the interaction between the ADAT3N domain and the ADAT catalytic domain, thereby hampering the correct presentation of the tRNA to the ADAT catalytic domain and, consequently, the deaminase activity.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^4e5aa8d4]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The ADAT2/ADAT3 (ADAT) complex catalyses the adenosine to inosine modification at the wobble position of eukaryotic tRNAs. Mutations in ADAT3, the catalytically inactive subunit of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex, have been identified in patients presenting with severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, the physiological function of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex during brain development remains totally unknown.

Here, we investigated the role of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex in cortical development. First, we report 21 neurodevelopmental disorders patients carrying biallelic variants in ADAT3. Second, we used structural, biochemical and enzymatic assays to deeply characterize the impact of those variants on the ADAT2/ADAT3 structure, biochemical properties, enzymatic activity, and tRNAs editing and abundance. Finally, in vivo complementation assays were performed to correlate functional deficits with neuronal migration defects in the developing mouse cortex.

Our results showed that maintaining a proper level of ADAT2/ADAT3 catalytic activity is essential for radial migration of projection neurons in the developing mouse cortex. We demonstrated that the identified ADAT3 variants significantly impaired the abundance and, for some, the activity of the complex, leading to a substantial decrease in inosine 34 levels with direct consequence on tRNAs steady state. We correlated the severity of the migration phenotype with the degree of loss of function caused by the variants.

Altogether, our results highlight the critical role of ADAT2/ADAT3 during cortical development and provide cellular and molecular insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ADAT3-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^05d4e778]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Here, we show that the catalytic activity of the heterodimeric ADAT2-ADAT3 complex is critical to promote the radial migration of projection neurons during corticogenesis. We also expand the molecular spectrum of ADAT3 -related neurodevelopmental disorders by reporting 21 patients presenting with IDs, structural brain anomalies and global growth retardation carrying the previously identified homozygous p.Val144Met variant or the biallelic p.Ala196Val/p.Ala196Leu variants. Using structural, biochemical, molecular and in vivo complementation assays, we showed that, although all the variants act through a loss of function mechanism, they have various effects on complex structure, stability and deamination activity that dictate their ability to restore migration defects upon Adat3 deficiency. We further drew an exhaustive list of tRNA species affected in disease conditions, providing strong evidence of a causal relationship between variants in ADAT3, loss of translationally competent ANN tRNAs and neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 is a host factor required for effective bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell therapy [^22f54d1a]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a promising treatment for ischemic injury. However, the environmental regulatory mechanism is essentially unclear and thus greatly limits its application in clinical setting. Accumulating evidence suggests a vital role of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) in microenvironment homeostasis after ischemia. About 540 million people or 8% of population worldwide carry a loss-of-function allele of ALDH2. It is unknown whether ALDH2 functions as a host factor regulating the therapeutic potential of donor MSCs. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether and how host ALDH2 regulates MSC retention and therapeutic efficacy after transplantation into ischemic tissues.

Approach and Results

Mice limb ischemia was performed by femoral artery ligation. A total of 10(6) MSCs were injected into the ischemic thigh muscles. One, 2, and 4 weeks after transplantation, MSC retention, blood perfusion recovery, limb necrosis, and fibrosis were analyzed. Compared with wild-type tissue, ALDH2 deficiency tissue significantly limited MSC retention and its perfusion recovery and limb salvage effects after ischemia. Importantly, local overexpression of ALDH2 optimized tissue microenvironment and significantly magnified all these MSC-induced improvement. Further study indicated that host ALDH2 regulated transplanted MSC survival and therapy as a microenvironment homeostasis mediator via local capillary density, energy supply, and oxidative stress regulating after ischemia.

Conclusions

Our study establishes ALDH2 as a key mediator of host stem cell niche for optimal MSC therapy and suggests that ALDH2 deficiency present in the general population is a limiting host factor to be considered for MSC therapy.

### Targeted therapy for a subset of acute myeloid leukemias that lack expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 [^bb63e5bf]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) activity is high in hematopoietic stem cells and functions in part to protect stem cells from reactive aldehydes and other toxic compounds. In contrast, we found that approximately 25% of all acute myeloid leukemias expressed low or undetectable levels of ALDH1A1 and that this ALDH1A1 - subset of leukemias correlates with good prognosis cytogenetics. ALDH1A1 - cell lines as well as primary leukemia cells were found to be sensitive to treatment with compounds that directly and indirectly generate toxic ALDH substrates including 4-hydroxynonenal and the clinically relevant compounds arsenic trioxide and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. In contrast, normal hematopoietic stem cells were relatively resistant to these compounds. Using a murine xenotransplant model to emulate a clinical treatment strategy, established ALDH1A1 - leukemias were also sensitive to in vivo treatment with cyclophosphamide combined with arsenic trioxide. These results demonstrate that targeting ALDH1A1 - leukemic cells with toxic ALDH1A1 substrates such as arsenic and cyclophosphamide may be a novel targeted therapeutic strategy for this subset of acute myeloid leukemias.

### Let-7c blocks estrogen-activated wnt signaling in induction of self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells [^798e8e03]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Let-7 miRNAs are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression through their roles in maintaining differentiation and normal development. However, there is little research focusing on the effects of let-7 on Wnt-activated self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells. By analyzing the expression levels of let-7 family members in clinical tissues, we found that higher expression levels of let-7b and let-7c were correlated with better clinical prognosis of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)α-positive breast tumor. Further, we found that only let-7c was inversely correlated with ERα expression, and there is corelationship between let-7c and Wnt signaling in clinical tissues. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1 sorting and mammosphere formation assays showed that let-7c inhibited the self-renewal of stem cells in ERα-positive breast cancer. Let-7c decreased ERα expression through directly binding to the 3'UTR (untranslated region), and let-7c inhibited the estrogen-induced activation of Wnt signaling. Depletion of ERα abolished let-7c functions in stem cell signatures, which further confirmed that let-7c inhibited estrogen-induced Wnt activity through decreasing ERα expression. Taken together, our findings identified a biochemical and functional link between let-7c with ERα/Wnt signaling in breast cancer stem cells.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^56d6fc5f]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

The ADAT2/ADAT3 (ADAT) complex catalyzes the adenosine to inosine modification at the wobble position of eukaryotic tRNAs. Mutations in ADAT3, the catalytically inactive subunit of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex, have been identified in patients presenting with severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, the physiological function of ADAT2/ADAT3 complex during brain development remains totally unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex in cortical development. First, we reported 21 neurodevelopmental disorders patients carrying biallelic variants in ADAT3. Second, we used structural, biochemical, and enzymatic assays to deeply characterize the impact of those variants on ADAT2/ADAT3 structure, biochemical properties, enzymatic activity and tRNAs editing and abundance. Finally, in vivo complementation assays were performed to correlate functional deficits with neuronal migration defects in the developing mouse cortex. Our results showed that maintaining a proper level of ADAT2/ADAT3 catalytic activity is essential for radial migration of projection neurons in the developing mouse cortex. We demonstrated that the identified ADAT3 variants significantly impaired the abundance and, for some, the activity of the complex, leading to a substantial decrease in I34 levels with direct consequence on their steady-state. We correlated the severity of the migration phenotype with the degree of the loss of function caused by the variants. Altogether, our results highlight the critical role of ADAT2/ADAT3 during cortical development and provide cellular and molecular insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ADAT3-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

### MCL ‑ 1 safeguards activated hair follicle stem cells to enable adult hair regeneration [^db797713]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

While genetic models have elucidated the diverse roles of individual BCL‑2 family members in various tissues, none has identified an essential physiological role in HF development or HFSC function. Although pharmacological inhibition of BCL‑2 depleted supra‑basal bulge stem cells, genetic deletion of Bcl‑2 did not disrupt HF growth. Nonetheless, deletion of Bcl‑2 sensitized HFSCs to DNA‑damage induced apoptosis and caused premature hair graying in mice, due to melanocyte depletion –. No skin or hair related defects have been reported in A1/Bfl‑1 or Bcl‑w knockout mice,. Among the pro‑survival molecules, MCL‑1 and BCL‑XL are critical for embryonic development, and their respective knockouts cause embryonic lethality,. Given that Mcl‑1 and Bcl‑x knockout causes embryonic lethality respectively, conditional knockout systems are used to investigate the roles of MCL‑1 and BCL‑XL in various tissues. Although Keratin 5 (K5) ‑Cre mediated Bcl‑x deletion did not affect hair regeneration, it increased keratinocyte sensitivity to UV‑induced apoptosis. Despite insights from knockout models, the molecular mechanisms governing HFSC survival, HF cycling, and hair regeneration remain unclear. Studies from conditional knockout mouse models have revealed that MCL‑1 is essential for the survival of numerous cell types (as reviewed in). Interestingly, MCL‑1 has also been attributed several apoptosis‑unrelated roles including regulating mitochondrial morphology and cell cycle, promoting pluripotency of stem cells, and accelerating long‑chain fatty acid oxidation –. In this study, we unveiled the crucial role of MCL‑1 in HFSC regulation and hair regeneration in mice.

### Targeted therapy for a subset of acute myeloid leukemias that lack expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 [^500ea601]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this report, we demonstrate that there is expression of a number of ALDH isoforms in AML and several have substantial variability in expression. The most prominent of these is ALDH1A1, which has low levels of expression and activity in a subset of AMLs, despite its nearly universal expression in normal HSCs and progenitors. In fact, in 25%–40% of AMLs we could find few or no cells expressing any ALDH1A1 as determined by Aldefluor staining and flow cytometry as well as qPCR analysis (termed ALDH1A1 − AML). This includes finding low to absent levels of ALDH1A1 in LSCs as well. The factors governing the variability of ALDH1A1 expression in AMLs are unknown; however, the majority of ALDH1A1 − AMLs in public databases do not have obvious ALDH1A1 gene deletions (data not shown) suggesting that loss of ALDH1A1 expression may occur as a consequence of gene regulation either through epigenetic or gene expression/repression mechanisms.Further studying the underlying mechanisms of ALDH1A1 gene regulation in HSCs, as well as AMLs, may provide useful insights into the biology of each. We also found that loss of ALDH1A1 may have prognostic implications as ALDH1A1 − AMLs correlate with good prognosis cytogenetics and there was a trend to improved outcomes in intermediate risk cytogenetic AML patients based on level of ALDH1A1 expression, although we could not formally prove an association. It would be interesting to seek to extend and confirm these observations in larger prospective studies. If this trend is confirmed, then ALDH1A1 status may become a useful tool to stratify patients to different treatment approaches. These observations also raise additional questions regarding why ALDH1A1 expression would be associated with cytogenetic status. In addition, if outcomes are indeed impacted by ALDH1A1 status, it would be important to determine whether this was because loss of ALDH1A1 renders ALDH1A1 − AMLs more sensitive to chemotherapies that induce ROS and/or reactive aldehydes or whether this acts through a different mechanism.

### Embryoid body-based differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells into cells with a corneal stromal keratocyte phenotype [^0bf63110]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Objective

The transparency of the cornea is determined by the extracellular matrix, which is secreted by corneal stromal keratocytes (CSKs). Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived keratocytes (hiPSC-CSKs) can be used in cell-based therapy for treating corneal blindness. Our goal was to develop an effective small molecule-based technique for differentiating hiPSCs into keratocytes.

Methods and Analysis

hiPSCs were cultured in chemically defined medium, and embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated; these EBs were induced into CSKs using keratocyte-differentiated medium. The expression of keratocyte-specific markers was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR, immunostaining and Western blotting.

Results

We found that the expression of genes encoding keratocyte markers, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1), lumican and keratocan, was upregulated. Immunostaining showed positive staining for ALDH1A1 and keratocan in the hiPSC-CSK samples. Similarly, western blot analysis indicated that ALDH1A1 and keratocan expression levels were significantly greater in the hiPSC-CSKs than in the control cells. In addition, hiPSC-CSKs were not transformed into fibroblasts or myofibroblasts.

Conclusion

We established an innovative and effective method to generate CSKs via the EB-based differentiation of hiPSCs, which might be employed for cell-based therapy of corneal stromal opacities.

### PFKFB3 regulates cancer stemness through the hippo pathway in small cell lung carcinoma [^9ed5294f]. Oncogene (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely malignant disease that often advances to treatment-resistant tumors. This cancer generally responds to initial treatment, but most patients will experience recurrence with an average survival of less than 6 months at this phase. Resistance to conventional chemotherapies is an important clinical challenge. The presence of a small subset of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) that promote tumor initiation, expansion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and relapse are associated with the development of resistant disease. This CSC population has numerous crucial properties such as the ability to disproportionately replicate, differentiate and self-renew, in addition to having extensive inherent resistance to therapy. Although cytotoxic chemotherapy eradicates most tumor cells, CSCs are more protected and capable to recapture the heterogenic tumor mass through self-renewal with high expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A (Aldh1A), CD133, CD44 and Sox2.

Dysregulation of the hippo pathway has been associated with cancer progression, including the abnormal expression and activity of yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), and a deficiency in large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2) level. Recent evidence supports a role of YAP/TAZ in cancer stem cells and tumor recurrence. The CSC subpopulation can also efflux many chemotherapeutic agents through transporters as a mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy drugs. CSCs show increased expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that reflect the efflux capacity and among the ABC transporter members, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) has been shown to be associated with drug efflux and CSC formation. We hypothesize that drugs targeting ABCG2 and stemness in SCLC will address the subpopulation of tumor cells that promote recurrence.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^35bccf39]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the isodecoders of a tRNA family are not affected to the same extent (ranging from 100% I 34 to 11% for the more severely affected isodecoders). One possible explanation for this differential effect on isodecoders within a same tRNA family is that the mutations in the mammalian ADAT2/ADAT3 complex selectively affect the binding and/or accommodation of specific tRNAs to its catalytic site. Interestingly, the structure of the Trypanosoma brucei ADAT2/ADAT3 complex bound to a full length tRNA showed that the eukaryotic ADAT2/ADAT3 complex selects and correctly positions the tRNA substrate within the catalytic site through sequence-independent interactions.Additional biochemical analysis using chimeric tRNAs or fragments of tRNAs confirm that tRNA structural features are key for tRNA recognition by human ADAT and suggest that the mode of recognition of tRNA by the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex varies between different tRNAs.A non-exclusive alternative is that I 34 specifically stabilizes some tRNAs more than others. In such cases, some tRNAs would be found as both I 34 and A 34, while others would be found only as I 34, the A 34 species being degraded. This is supported by the fact that: (i) our analysis of tRNA abundance showed that most tRNAs commonly downregulated in all three patient samples were ADAT targets (Fig. 5); and that (ii) the extent of I 34 loss in target tRNA molecules negatively correlate with the degree of downregulation (Fig. 5D). How the lack of I 34 modification could affect the stability of specific tRNAs remains unknown. While some specific structural determinants might be at play, the often very limited sequence changes between isodecoders suggest that additional mechanisms might be involved. Although none of the modifications detected by mim-tRNAseq, including m 1 A at position 58 of the tRNA-Val-AAC, Thr-AGU and Pro-AGG,, are severely impaired in the disease context, one cannot exclude that other I 34 -dependent tRNA modifications that are known to stabilize tRNAs (i.e. methylation), could account for the decreased steady-state level of some but not other ADAT2/ADAT3 cognate tRNAs. For example, the varying sensitivity of the different Ala isodecoders (Fig. 5D) may arise from specific modifications that preferentially stabilize certain tRNA-Ala species. Considerable evidence is in favour of crosstalk between I 34 and the modification of other bases. First, we previously showed that the recombinant Escherichia coli TadA enzyme co-purifies exclusively with its cognate tRNA-Arg-ACG that is fully modified with I 34 but unexpectedly also harbours an uncharacterized methylation at G 18.Second, a recent study demonstrated that the formation of m 5 C 38 by Dnmt2 on Val-AAC depends on the pre-existing A-to-I modification at position 34.Given that methylation of C 38 of Asp-GTC and Gly-GCC protect them against endonucleolytic cleavage,it is possible that hypomodification of Val-AAC at position 34 makes it more vulnerable to such cleavage. Therefore, full characterization of the modification status of each tRNA molecule will be a strong asset to understand the differential downregulation of ADAT2/ADAT3 target tRNAs upon decreased I 34 levels.

### Vitamin A metabolism and resistance of hepatic metastases to immunotherapy [^d5227f33]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Disulfiram suppression of RA synthesis

There are various agents that can inhibit RALDH or block RA receptors. However, disulfiram is an approved drug, with a long-established safety profile, that can block synthesis of RA. Because of that and other tumor suppressing and recently described immune checkpoint blockade enhancing attributes, we have chosen disulfiram as the focus of this review.

Disulfiram (tetraethylthiuram) is a drug approved more than 70 years ago for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (Fig. 3). Its mechanism of action includes inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Alcohol is first oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then acetaldehyde is further oxidized to acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Irreversible inactivation of ALDH by disulfiram causes buildup of toxic acetaldehyde in blood and tissues when alcohol is consumed, which results in the disulfiram–ethanol reaction, with symptoms akin to severe hangover (e.g. flushing, headache, and nausea). The threat or experience of these symptoms produces an aversion to drinking.

Figure 3. 
Disulfiram and active metabolites. DDC, diethyldithiocarbamate.

ALDH is a 19-member isoenzyme family with members having different locations in the cell and aldehyde substrate-binding specificities. Mitochondrial ALDH-2 is primarily responsible for acetaldehyde metabolism to nontoxic acetic acid, along with metabolizing other toxic aldehyde substrates such as 4-hydroxynonenal, a product of lipid peroxidation. ALDH-1 (or RALDH) isoforms are located primarily in the cytosol and oxidize retinaldehyde to RA, after oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde by retinol dehydrogenases. Disulfiram also irreversibly inactivates RALDH, and thus generation of RA. RALDH includes a subgroup of three isoenzymes, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3. ALDH 8A1 also generates RA and is termed RALDH4. ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 are cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and contribute to the “ALDEFLUOR” test reaction which identifies CSC or tumor-initiating cells. These markers are often elevated in advanced cancers, including colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver. ALDH1A1, which, in addition to retinaldehyde, also oxidizes acetaldehyde along with ALDH2, is inactivated by disulfiram. Along with being a CSC marker, ALDH1A1 is maximally expressed in a normal liver, in conjunction with the highest concentration of vit A in the body.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 in aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia and hematopoietic stem cells [^903435a5]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment depends on the ability to metabolize exogenously and endogenously generated toxins, and to repair cellular damage caused by such toxins. Reactive aldehydes have been demonstrated to cause specific genotoxic injury, namely DNA interstrand cross-links. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a member of a 19 isoenzyme ALDH family with different substrate specificities, subcellular localization, and patterns of expression. ALDH2 is localized in mitochondria and is essential for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby placing it directly downstream of ethanol metabolism. Deficiency in ALDH2 expression and function are caused by a single nucleotide substitution and resulting amino acid change, called ALDH2*2. This genetic polymorphism affects 35-45% of East Asians (about ~560 million people), and causes the well-known Asian flushing syndrome, which results in disulfiram-like reactions after ethanol consumption. Recently, the ALDH2*2 genotype has been found to be associated with marrow failure, with both an increased risk of sporadic aplastic anemia and more rapid progression of Fanconi anemia. This review discusses the unexpected interrelationship between aldehydes, ALDH2 and hematopoietic stem cell biology, and in particular its relationship to Fanconi anemia.

### Identification of ADAR1 adenosine deaminase dependency in a subset of cancer cells [^dfc6398e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Systematic exploration of cancer cell vulnerabilities can inform the development of novel cancer therapeutics. Here, through analysis of genome-scale loss-of-function datasets, we identify adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR or ADAR1) as an essential gene for the survival of a subset of cancer cell lines. ADAR1-dependent cell lines display increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Activation of type I interferon signaling in the context of ADAR1 deficiency can induce cell lethality in non-ADAR1-dependent cell lines. ADAR deletion causes activation of the double-stranded RNA sensor, protein kinase R (PKR). Disruption of PKR signaling, through inactivation of PKR or overexpression of either a wildtype or catalytically inactive mutant version of the p150 isoform of ADAR1, partially rescues cell lethality after ADAR1 loss, suggesting that both catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of ADAR1 may contribute to preventing PKR-mediated cell lethality. Together, these data nominate ADAR1 as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of cancers.

### The prognostic significance of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and CD133 expression in early stage non-small cell lung cancer [^3fbe9baf]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite progress in surgical techniques, the proportion of patients relapsing and ultimately dying of pathological stage 1 NSCLC after curative resection remains substantial.A number of prognostic factors associated with disease relapse and death have been described. Currently, tumour stage appears to be the best indicator of poor outcome. Although several studies have reported intratumour vascular invasion,as a poor prognostic marker, it is yet to be incorporated into clinical practice. Similarly, patient factors such age and sex are not reliable indicators for disease relapse.

In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of ALDH1A1 and CD133 expression in patients with resected stage 1 NSCLC. Our results showed that the expression of ALDH1A1 and CD133 in primary NSCLC was significantly associated with shorter OS. In multivariable model, ALDH1A1 and CD133 were an independent factor for worse OS. Tumours expressing both ALDH1A1 and CD133 were associated with the worst outcome. By contrast, tumours negative for both markers were in the best prognostic group, whereas expression of one or other stem cell marker conferred an intermediate prognosis.

ALDH1 is a cytosolic isoenzyme, a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family responsible for oxidisation of intracellular aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Increased ALDH1 activity has been found in haematopoietic stem cellsand has been reported as a surrogate marker of cancer stem cells in several malignancies.In vitro experiments suggest that isolated lung cancer cells with high ALDH1 activity are associated with cancer stem cell characteristics, including capacities of proliferation, self-renewal and resistance to chemotherapy.ALDH1 positive cells have also showed enhanced engraftment capacity in nude mice.CD133 (PROM-1 or AC133) is a transmembrane glycoprotein originally described in human haematopoietic stem cells.Its expression is used for the isolation of normal stem cells from numerous tissues such as bone marrow,brainand kidney.Recent data have provided evidence of strong association between expression of CD133 and stem cell characteristics in malignant tumours of brain,prostate,liver,pancreas,lungand colon.

### Cancer stem cells of esophageal adenocarcinoma are suppressed by inhibitors of TRPV2 and SLC12A2 [^62012371]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The potential of membrane transporters activated in cancer stem cells (CSCs) as new therapeutic targets for cancer is attracting increasing interest. Therefore, the present study examined the expression profiles of ion transport-related molecules in the CSCs of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

Methods

Cells that highly expressed aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) were separated from OE33 cells, a human Barrett's EAC cell line, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. CSCs were identified based on the formation of tumorspheres. Gene expression profiles in CSCs were examined by a microarray analysis.

Results

Among OE33 cells, ALDH1A1 messenger RNA levels were higher in CSCs than in non-CSCs. Furthermore, CSCs exhibited resistance to cisplatin and had the capacity to redifferentiate. The results of the microarray analysis of CSCs showed the up-regulated expression of several genes related to ion channels/transporters, such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) and solute carrier family 12 member 2 (SLC12A2). The cytotoxicities of the TRPV2 inhibitor tranilast and the SLC12A2 inhibitor furosemide were higher at lower concentrations in CSCs than in non-CSCs, and both markedly reduced the number of tumorspheres. The cell population among OE33 cells that highly expressed ALDH1A1 also was significantly decreased by these inhibitors.

Conclusions

Based on the present results, TRPV2 and SLC12A2 are involved in the maintenance of CSCs, and their specific inhibitors, tranilast and furosemide, respectively, have potential as targeted therapeutic agents for EAC.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^50080c25]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Defects in tRNA modifications lead to either global or codon-specific translational impairment. As the I 34 resides in the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, it can have a profound impact upon codon-anticodon recognition and shape the proteome landscape in a codon-specific manner. First, ADAT deficiency in HEK293cells and Neurospora specifically modulates decoding rates for ADAT-dependent codons, meaning codons that are only read by I 34 tRNAs (C-ending codons), leading to impaired translation of specific proteins containing regions encoded by sequences enriched in those codons. Interestingly, our computational analysis of synonymous codon usage revealed that genes involved in neuronal migration preferentially use codons that are only read by I 34 tRNAs (C-ending codons) compared with the whole genome. This preference is statistically significant (P < 0.05) in four out of the eight ANN-tRNA families and show a trending significance in the remaining four families (P < 0.1) (Supplementary Fig. 6A). Second, computation of tRNA gene usage has suggested that the specific enrichment of tRNA-Ala-AGC anticodon in neurons drives an increased translational efficiency at Ala codons including GCC codons that are read by tRNA-Ala-I 34 GC.Given that deamination of tRNA-Ala-AGC is the most severely affected in patient cells (Fig. 5A), this raises the possibility that defects in decoding Ala codons contribute to neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with the mutant ADAT2/ADAT3 complex. Third, as tRNA I 34 modification has been shown in vitro to be a critical determinant for recognition by the yeast isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase,defects in the I 34 formation observed upon ADAT3 mutation might lead to accumulation of uncharged or mischarged tRNAs and subsequent translational stalling or errors, directly affecting homeostasis of proteins enriched in a specific amino acid. Additionally, genes involved in neuronal migration, compared with the brain cortex whole genome, showed an enrichment in codons read by tRNAs found to be dysregulated upon ADAT3 mutation (Supplementary Fig. 6B). This enrichment was observed even when comparing these genes to those associated with generalized cellular migration (Supplementary Fig. 6B). This suggests that a specific translational impairment of neuronal migration genes, which are enriched for ADAT-dependent codons, rather than a global translation defect, likely underlies the defective neuronal migration. Yet, the identity of affected proteins and how mutant ADAT3 impairs the efficiency and accuracy of their translation remain to be identified to better understand the sensitivity of the brain to ADAT3 loss of function.

### ALDH1A3 promotes aggressive basal-like pancreatic cancer through an AP-1 / RUNX2 enhancer network [^54b3a648]. Oncogene (2025). Medium credibility.

The basal-like transcriptional subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is linked to therapy resistance and poor prognosis. The cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3) is a critical enzyme in acetaldehyde metabolism, but the interconnection to the basal-like subtype is poorly understood. Here, we identified ALDH1A3 as a key gene, which correlates with reduced survival and increased tumor growth. Functional studies revealed interaction of ALDH1A3 with genes like FAM3C, MCC, PMEPA1, and IRS2, forming a network driving PDAC progression. Chromatin profiling showed that ALDH1A3 affects acetylation of histone 3, mediating AP-1 activity, particularly via FOS family members, activating oncogenic pathways such as MAPK and TNF signaling. RUNX2 emerged as a therapeutic target within this network, as its knockdown disrupted MAPK signaling and reduced tumor growth. These findings emphasize the role of ALDH1A3 in linking nuclear metabolic-epigenetic programming in basal-like PDAC, highlighting it as a promising therapeutic target for novel treatment strategies.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^e898024f]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Reflecting a key role of I 34 modification in brain development, pathogenic variants in ADAT3 have been identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The same homozygous ADAT3 variant (NM_138422.4:c.430G>A; p.Val144Met) has been reported in 55 patients from 29 consanguineous families presenting with an autosomal recessive syndromic form of intellectual disability (ID) characterized by developmental delay, moderate to severe ID, speech delay, microcephaly, abnormal brain structure, facial dysmorphism and epilepsy (Supplementary Table 1).In addition to this founder mutation, a homozygous duplication in ADAT3 (NM_138422.4:c.99_106dupGAGCCCGG; p.Glu36Glyfs*44)and two compound heterozygous missense ADAT3 variants in the conserved non-catalytic deaminase domain (NM_138422.4:c.587C>T, p.Ala196Val; c.586_587delinsTT, p.Ala196Leu)and (NM_138422.4:c.587C>T, p.Ala196Val; c.820C>T p.Gln274*)have been described in six patients with similar but milder ID syndrome features. The p.Val144Met variant alters the tRNAs A 34 deaminase activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex, possibly through impaired presentation of ADAT2/3 bound tRNAs to the catalytic site without compromising the formation of the complex.Yet the structural and functional impact of other variants on the ADAT2/3 complex is unknown. Moreover, although I 34 levels were shown to be decreased in total tRNAs isolated from patients carrying the homozygous p.Val144Metand compound heterozygous p.Ala196Val; p.Gln274* variants,our knowledge of the molecular effect of ADAT3 variants on specific ADAT-target tRNAs is very limited and the neurodevelopmental processes that require the proper function of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex have not been elucidated.

Moreover, persistence of this population after therapy is a marker of clinically significant minimal residual disease.

### Dissecting the basis for differential substrate specificity of ADAR1 and ADAR2 [^2aca3425]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Millions of adenosines are deaminated throughout the transcriptome by ADAR1 and/or ADAR2 at varying levels, raising the question of what are the determinants guiding substrate specificity and how these differ between the two enzymes. We monitor how secondary structure modulates ADAR2 vs ADAR1 substrate selectivity, on the basis of systematic probing of thousands of synthetic sequences transfected into cell lines expressing exclusively ADAR1 or ADAR2. Both enzymes induce symmetric, strand-specific editing, yet with distinct offsets with respect to structural disruptions: -26 nt for ADAR2 and -35 nt for ADAR1. We unravel the basis for these differences in offsets through mutants, domain-swaps, and ADAR homologs, and find it to be encoded by the differential RNA binding domain (RBD) architecture. Finally, we demonstrate that this offset-enhanced editing can allow an improved design of ADAR2-recruiting therapeutics, with proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating increased on-target and potentially decreased off-target editing.

As an additional quality control, we assessed editing levels across a series of constructs in which the double-stranded stem was randomly disrupted to varying levels. Consistent with our expectations, we found that editing by both ADAR1 and ADAR2 was continuously disrupted with progressive disruption of the secondary structure (Fig. 1H & Figure S1D). ADAR2 was slightly more resilient to the introduction of structural disruptions, consistent with previous studies showing that ADAR2 can efficiently edit shorter double-stranded substrates than ADAR1,. Collectively, these analyses establish that the two synthetic constructs and their perturbed counterparts are edited by both ADAR1 and ADAR2, yet these two enzymes are associated with both varying levels and different patterns of editing.

### Expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is associated with basal-like markers and features of aggressive tumours in African breast cancer [^7371e562]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

The importance of BMI-1, a transcriptional repressor of the polycomb group of transcription factors and a key regulator of self-renewal in both normal and malignant stem cells, has been more controversial. Still, BMI-1 has been linked to mammary carcinogenesis in some previous studies (;). Although some find BMI-1 expression to be associated with a favourable prognosis (;;), others have reported the opposite (;).

Breast cancers in African populations and among African Americans seem to be more aggressive than breast cancers in Caucasians (;), and better insight about differences in tumour characteristics (;;;) may suggest strategies to improve clinical management among Africans. In general, there is some evidence that the limitation of chemotherapy and radiation treatment may be associated with the inability to target breast cancer stem cells (;;;), and the efficacy of HER2 inhibitors may relate to their influence on stem cell populations in HER2-positive tumours.

On this background, the purpose of our study was to examine the expression of candidate stem cell markers ALDH1 and BMI-1 in breast cancer in relation to basal-like markers, other molecular features and clinicopathological phenotype. These markers were examined in tumours from an African population in which breast cancer is assumed to be more aggressive and also associated with frequent basal-like differentiation. In these populations, early diagnosis and effective treatment is especially challenging.

### Human mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into keratocyte-like cells in keratocyte-conditioned medium [^93ff5ce3]. Experimental Eye Research (2012). Low credibility.

Culturing corneal keratocytes is difficult because keratocytes growing in a monolayer rapidly lose their stellate morphology and cease to express keratocyte markers such as keratocan, lumican and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1 (ALDH1A1). Conversely, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be easily expanded in cell culture, and they have a variety of differentiation pathways. We studied the feasibility of using MSCs as a source for corneal tissue engineering. Based on the observation that keratocytes have MSC-like properties, similar to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), we hypothesized that MSCs would differentiate into corneal keratocyte-like cells in keratocyte-conditioned medium (KCM). We measured changes in the expression of keratocyte markers through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and found that human MSC's cultured in KCM expressed both keratocan and ALDH1A1. Western blot analysis demonstrated that human MSCs cultured in KCM steadily increased their expression of lumican and ALDH1A1, while they lost expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Immunocytochemistry indicated that human MSCs grown in KCM acquired characteristics similar to those of keratocytes. These results suggest that KCM can direct human MSCs to differentiate into keratocyte-like cells.

### Characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying increased ischemic damage in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 genetic polymorphism using a human induced pluripotent stem cell model system [^4b7d4110]. Science Translational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Nearly 8% of the human population carries an inactivating point mutation in the gene that encodes the cardioprotective enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). This genetic polymorphism (ALDH2*2) is linked to more severe outcomes from ischemic heart damage and an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), but the underlying molecular bases are unknown. We investigated the ALDH2*2 mechanisms in a human model system of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) generated from individuals carrying the most common heterozygous form of the ALDH2*2 genotype. We showed that the ALDH2*2 mutation gave rise to elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species and toxic aldehydes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptotic signaling pathways, especially during ischemic injury. We established that ALDH2 controls cell survival decisions by modulating oxidative stress levels and that this regulatory circuitry was dysfunctional in the loss-of-function ALDH2*2 genotype, causing up-regulation of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes after ischemic insult. These results reveal a new function for the metabolic enzyme ALDH2 in modulation of cell survival decisions. Insight into the molecular mechanisms that mediate ALDH2*2-related increased ischemic damage is important for the development of specific diagnostic methods and improved risk management of CAD and may lead to patient-specific cardiac therapies.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^454a1ff0]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

We examined the pathological mechanisms associated with the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex-related NDD at the genetic, structural/biochemical and molecular levels. All results converged towards a loss of function mechanism. At the genetic level, we expanded the clinical spectrum of ADAT-related NDDs by reporting 19 new patients from 17 different families carrying the previously identifiedp.V144M/pV144M variant and by providing clinical updates for two previously reported patientscarrying the biallelic p.Ala196Val/p.Ala196Leu variant. Clinical presentation and MRI of the newly identified individuals matched with the clinical features observed in patients with ADAT-related NDDs., Interestingly, variants in the ADAT3 gene identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders were only found at the biallelic state (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). Consistently, human ADAT3 and ADAT2 genes tolerate loss-of-function variants with many loss-of-function heterozygous variants reported in the gnomAD general population (Genome Aggregation Database, v.4.0.0), suggesting that cortical development can sustain ADAT3 hemizygosity. Of note, no biallelic null variant has been found in ADAT2 yet. Corroborating the human findings, we showed that full knock-out of Adat3 is lethal in mice (data not shown), and that expression of WT mADAT3 restored the neurodevelopmental phenotype in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A and B). Altogether, these findings indicate that a minimal level of complex activity is required to ensure proper mammalian neuronal development.

### Effects of the common polymorphism in the human aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene on the lung [^9abea34d]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Histological and functional assessment of human bronchial and lung epithelium revealed no major difference between individuals with ALDH2 and ALDH2*2 genotypes

The human surgical samples assessed, included 26 lung and 23 bronchial samples. DNA was isolated from all samples and genotyped for the ALDH2 polymorphism (with ALDH2/ALDH2 alleles i.e. has functional ALDH2, heterozygous ALDH2/ALDH2*2, or homozygous for the ALDH2*2 allele i.e. with non-functional ALDH2). All human samples examined were either ALDH2/ALDH2 or ALDH2/ALDH2*2 heterozygous and no ALDH2*2 homozygous samples. Fixed and embedded bronchial portions were histologically assessed for epithelial abnormalities. Of 13 bronchial samples with the ALDH2 alleles, three samples showed goblet cell hyperplasia. Of 10 ALDH2/ALDH2*2 heterozygous bronchial samples, two showed basal cell hyperplasia, one showed goblet cell hyperplasia, and one showed both goblet and basal cell hyperplasia (Fig. 1a-f). Smoking history was not associated with hyperplasia development in both genotypes. Then, to detect a potential functional impairment on stem cells, both bronchial and lung epithelial stem cells were examined using the in vitro 3D colony forming assay. The CFE of primary and passaged epithelial cells of ALDH2/ALDH2 and ALDH2/ALDH2*2 heterozygous bronchial and lung samples was compared (Fig. 1g-l). The average primary bronchial CFE from 8 ALDH2/ALDH2 samples was 2.33%, while that from 5 ALDH2/ALDH2*2 heterozygous samples was only 1.58% (Fig. 1m). When the colonies were passaged to examine clonality, CFE at passage 1 in 6 ALDH2/ALDH2 samples was 0.86%, and that in 4 ALDH2/ALDH2*2 heterozygous samples was 0.56% (Fig. 1n). The primary lung CFE in 11 ALDH2/ALDH2 samples was 0.3%, and that in 6 ALDH2/ALDH2*2 heterozygous samples was 0.12% (Fig. 1o). Although the average CFE of both bronchial and lung samples in samples with the ALDH2 genotype tended to be higher than that with the ALDH2*2 genotype, the difference was not statistically significant. ALDH2 activation using a small molecule activator, Alda-1, successfully increased the CFE of both bronchial and lung ALDH2/ALDH2*2 heterozygous epithelium by approximately 50% and 34% of their original efficiency, respectively. However, Alda-1 treatment of ALDH2/ALDH2 bronchial and lung epithelium produced a similar respective induction of 51% and 32.5% (Fig. 1k, l, p, q). Analysis of the differentiation profile of bronchial and lung colonies from both genotypes revealed no difference.

### ADAT3 variants disrupt the activity of the ADAT tRNA deaminase complex and impair neuronal migration [^a26fd8b9]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

To ascertain the effect of the variants on the enzymatic activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex, we performed sequencing of an in vitro -transcribed cognate tRNA, tRNA Arg(ACG), after incubation with different amounts of purified recombinant WT or mutant ADAT2/ADAT3 complexes.As inosine is read as a ‘G’ by reverse transcriptase,we sought the percentage of G 34 as a proxy of A 34 to I 34 editing. While the p.V128M ADAT3 exhibited a significantly impaired enzymatic activity (−68% of A 34 to I 34 with the lowest concentration of the ADAT2/ADAT3-V128M complex) as expected,, the ADAT2/ADAT3-A180V heterodimer retained comparable activity to the WT complex and the ADAT2/ADAT3-A180L displayed a severely diminished deamination capacity (−76% compared with the WT complex at the lowest concentration) (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. 3B). Notably, the two variants found in the Patients 10 and 11 (p.A180V/L; corresponding to p.A196V/L in humans) impair ADAT2/ADAT3 deamination activity differently, although they affect the solubility of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex similarly (Fig. 4C). Along the same lines, the p.V128M ADAT3 variant strongly affected the enzymatic activity of the complex despite the lack of any effect on its solubility (Fig. 4C and E). Overall, these data strongly suggest that the level of deamination activity does not directly correlate to the level of solubility but rather indicate that the faulty deamination activity of the mutant complexes might mostly stem from structural perturbations (Table 1).

### The role of G22 A adenosine deaminase 1 gene polymorphism and the activities of ADA isoenzymes in fertile and infertile men [^94e4dc95]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate frequency distribution of adenosine deaminase 1 (ADA1) G22 A alleles and genotypes in fertile and infertile men.

Methods

In this study we evaluate frequency distribution of ADA1 G22 A alleles and genotypes in 200 fertile and 200 infertile men. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was used for determining ADA1 G22 A variants. In addition, ADA isoenzymes activities (ADA1 and ADA2) were measured using colorimetric method.

Results

The frequency of GG genotype was significantly higher and GA genotype was lower in infertile males compared with fertile men (P = .048 and P = .045, respectively). However, there was not any noticeable difference in allele distribution between groups (P >.05). Based on logistic regression analysis, the GA genotype has a protective role and can decrease the risk of male infertility 1.7 times (P = .046). There were significantly higher activities of ADAT and its isoenzymes in infertile males compared with fertile men (P <.05). Also, the ADA1 activity with GG genotype was higher than GA carriers in all population (P = .001).

Conclusion

Our results revealed that the activity of ADA isoenzymes and distribution of ADA1 G22 A genotypes were different among fertile and infertile men and more likely the GA genotype, which had lower ADA1 activity and was higher in fertile men is a protective factor against infertility.

### Targeting adenosine with adenosine deaminase 2 to inhibit growth of solid tumors [^d4c51903]. Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Extracellular adenosine in tumors can suppress immune responses and promote tumor growth. Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) converts adenosine into inosine. The role of ADA2 in cancer and whether it can target adenosine for cancer therapy has not been investigated. Here we show that increased ADA2 expression is associated with increased patient survival and enrichment of adaptive immune response pathways in several solid tumor types. Several ADA2 variants were created to improve catalytic efficiency, and PEGylation was used to prolong systemic exposure. In mice, PEGylated ADA2 (PEGADA2) inhibited tumor growth by targeting adenosine in an enzyme activity-dependent manner and thereby modulating immune responses. These findings introduce endogenous ADA2 expression as a prognostic factor and PEGADA2 as a novel immunotherapy for cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies ADA2 as a prognostic factor associated with prolonged cancer patient survival and introduces the potential of enzymatic removal of adenosine with engineered ADA2 for cancer immunotherapy.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity identifies a population of human skeletal muscle cells with high myogenic capacities [^e21fdf5a]. Molecular Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH) activity is one hallmark of human bone marrow (BM), umbilical cord blood (UCB), and peripheral blood (PB) primitive progenitors presenting high reconstitution capacities in vivo. In this study, we have identified ALDH(+) cells within human skeletal muscles, and have analyzed their phenotypical and functional characteristics. Immunohistofluorescence analysis of human muscle tissue sections revealed rare endomysial cells. Flow cytometry analysis using the fluorescent substrate of ALDH, Aldefluor, identified brightly stained (ALDH(br)) cells with low side scatter (SSC(lo)), in enzymatically dissociated muscle biopsies, thereafter abbreviated as SMALD(+) (for skeletal muscle ALDH(+)) cells. Phenotypical analysis discriminated two sub-populations according to CD34 expression: SMALD(+)/CD34(-) and SMALD(+)/CD34(+) cells. These sub-populations did not initially express endothelial (CD31), hematopoietic (CD45), and myogenic (CD56) markers. Upon sorting, however, whereas SMALD(+)/CD34(+) cells developed in vitro as a heterogeneous population of CD56(-) cells able to differentiate in adipoblasts, the SMALD(+)/CD34(-) fraction developed in vitro as a highly enriched population of CD56(+) myoblasts able to form myotubes. Moreover, only the SMALD(+)/CD34(-) population maintained a strong myogenic potential in vivo upon intramuscular transplantation. Our results suggest that ALDH activity is a novel marker for a population of new human skeletal muscle progenitors presenting a potential for cell biology and cell therapy.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity selects for lung adenocarcinoma stem cells dependent on notch signaling [^fd2e5d12]. Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a candidate marker for lung cancer cells with stem cell-like properties. Immunohistochemical staining of a large panel of primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples for ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1, and CD133 revealed a significant correlation between ALDH1A1 (but not ALDH3A1 or CD133) expression and poor prognosis in patients including those with stage I and N0 disease. Flow cytometric analysis of a panel of lung cancer cell lines and patient tumors revealed that most NSCLCs contain a subpopulation of cells with elevated ALDH activity, and that this activity is associated with ALDH1A1 expression. Isolated ALDH(+) lung cancer cells were observed to be highly tumorigenic and clonogenic as well as capable of self-renewal compared with their ALDH(-) counterparts. Expression analysis of sorted cells revealed elevated Notch pathway transcript expression in ALDH(+) cells. Suppression of the Notch pathway by treatment with either a γ-secretase inhibitor or stable expression of shRNA against NOTCH3 resulted in a significant decrease in ALDH(+) lung cancer cells, commensurate with a reduction in tumor cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Taken together, these findings indicate that ALDH selects for a subpopulation of self-renewing NSCLC stem-like cells with increased tumorigenic potential, that NSCLCs harboring tumor cells with ALDH1A1 expression have inferior prognosis, and that ALDH1A1 and CD133 identify different tumor subpopulations. Therapeutic targeting of the Notch pathway reduces this ALDH(+) component, implicating Notch signaling in lung cancer stem cell maintenance.

### High-throughput mutagenesis reveals unique structural features of human ADAR1 [^263c4bb2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Adenosine Deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are enzymes that catalyze adenosine to inosine conversion in dsRNA, a common form of RNA editing. Mutations in the human ADAR1 gene are known to cause disease and recent studies have identified ADAR1 as a potential therapeutic target for a subset of cancers. However, efforts to define the mechanistic effects for disease associated ADAR1 mutations and the rational design of ADAR1 inhibitors are limited by a lack of structural information. Here, we describe the combination of high throughput mutagenesis screening studies, biochemical characterization and Rosetta-based structure modeling to identify unique features of ADAR1. Importantly, these studies reveal a previously unknown zinc-binding site on the surface of the ADAR1 deaminase domain which is important for ADAR1 editing activity. Furthermore, we present structural models that explain known properties of this enzyme and make predictions about the role of specific residues in a surface loop unique to ADAR1.

### Genotype is an important determinant of phenotype in adenosine deaminase deficiency [^d3b737c5]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is associated with a broad clinical and mutational spectrum. Defining the relationship of genotype to phenotype among patients with different degrees of immunodeficiency has been complicated because the disease is rare, most mutations are 'private' and patients are often heteroallelic. In recent years, knowledge of ADA structure and systematic expression of mutant alleles have revealed that phenotype is strongly associated with the sum of ADA activity provided by both alleles. A scale for ranking novel ADA alleles based on expression may have utility if newborn screening for primary immunodeficiency disorders is initiated.

### Predicting sites of ADAR editing in double-stranded RNA [^5a33bc66]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

ADAR (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA) editing enzymes target coding and noncoding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and are essential for neuronal function. Early studies showed that ADARs preferentially target adenosines with certain 5' and 3' neighbours. Here we use current Sanger sequencing protocols to perform a more accurate and quantitative analysis. We quantified editing sites in an ∼800-bp dsRNA after reaction with human ADAR1 or ADAR2, or their catalytic domains alone. These large data sets revealed that neighbour preferences are mostly dictated by the catalytic domain, but ADAR2's dsRNA-binding motifs contribute to 3' neighbour preferences. For all proteins, the 5' nearest neighbour was most influential, but adjacent bases also affected editing site choice. We developed algorithms to predict editing sites in dsRNA of any sequence, and provide a web-based application. The predictive power of the algorithm on fully base-paired dsRNA, compared with biological substrates containing mismatches, bulges and loops, elucidates structural contributions to editing specificity.

### Smad4 decreases the population of pancreatic cancer-initiating cells through transcriptional repression of ALDH1A1 [^47952b6a]. The American Journal of Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Cancer progression involves a rare population of undifferentiated cancer-initiating cells that have stem cell-like properties for self-renewal capacity and high tumorigenicity. We investigated how maintenance of pancreatic cancer-initiating cells is influenced by Smad4, which is frequently deleted or mutated in pancreatic cancers cells. Smad4 silencing up-regulated the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) mRNA, whereas forced expression of Smad4 in pancreatic cancer cells down-regulated it. Smad4 and ALDH1 expression inversely correlated in some human clinical pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues, suggesting that ALDH1 in pancreatic cancer cells was associated with decreased Smad4 expression. We then examined whether ALDH1 served as a marker of pancreatic cancer-initiating cells. Pancreatic cancer cells contained ALDH1(hi) cells in 3% to 10% of total cells, with high tumorigenic potential. Because Smad4 is a major mediator of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family signaling, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of ALDH activity by TGF-β and bone morphogenetic proteins. Treatment with TGF-β attenuated ALDH1(hi) cells in several pancreatic cancer cells, whereas bone morphogenetic protein-4 was not as potent. Biochemical experiments revealed that TGF-β regulated ALDH1A1 mRNA transcription through binding of Smad4 to its regulatory sequence. It appears that TGF-β negatively regulates ALDH1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells in a Smad-dependent manner and in turn impairs the activity of pancreatic cancer-initiating cells.

### Structural basis for sequence-independent substrate selection by eukaryotic wobble base tRNA deaminase ADAT2 / 3 [^7c77f118]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The essential deamination of adenosine A 34 to inosine at the wobble base is the individual tRNA modification with the greatest effects on mRNA decoding, empowering a single tRNA to translate three different codons. To date, many aspects of how eukaryotic deaminases specifically select their multiple substrates remain unclear. Here, using cryo-EM, we present the structure of a eukaryotic ADAT2/3 deaminase bound to a full-length tRNA, revealing that the enzyme distorts the anticodon loop, but in contrast to the bacterial enzymes, selects its substrate via sequence-independent contacts of eukaryote-acquired flexible or intrinsically unfolded motifs distal from the conserved catalytic core. A gating mechanism for substrate entry to the active site is identified. Our multi-step tRNA recognition model yields insights into how RNA editing by A 34 deamination evolved, shaped the genetic code, and directly impacts the eukaryotic proteome.

### Structural basis for sequence-independent substrate selection by eukaryotic wobble base tRNA deaminase ADAT2 / 3 [^92657756]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

I 34 formation is essential for viability and catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA (ADATs) –. Several RNA-free bacterial tRNA deaminase A (TadA) structures were reported –, followed by the Staphylococcus aureus enzyme bound to a synthetic hairpin mimicking the anticodon-stem loop of bacterial tRNA Arg. TadA is a homodimeric enzyme, which binds one RNA ligand per protomer, forming a 2:2 protein: RNA complex. In this complex, the tRNA anticodon loop adopts an unusual conformation where the nucleosides are splayed out in a manner that is different from a canonical anticodon loop. TadA makes sequence-specific contacts to the exposed nucleobases. In eukaryotes, the essential enzyme catalyzing I 34 formation in tRNA is a heterodimer, composed by one active (ADAT2) and one inactive (ADAT3) paralogous subunits, both homologs of the bacterial enzyme,,,,,. These ADATs carry a characteristic cytidine deaminase (CDA) active-site amino acid signature motif (C/H)XEX n PCXXC (with X being any amino acid, and n being any number of residues), containing the active-site acidic glutamate (inert valine in inactive subunit ADAT3) and cysteine/histidine residues coordinating a Zn 2+ cation,,. The motif, shared with other members of the CDA superfamily, is also found in the C-to-U deaminases which include the AID/APOBEC family.

### Selection based on CD133 and high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity isolates long-term reconstituting human hematopoietic stem cells [^48320057]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The development of novel cell-based therapies requires understanding of distinct human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations. We recently isolated reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by lineage depletion and purification based on high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(hi)Lin- cells). Here, we further dissected the ALDH(hi)-Lin- population by selection for CD133, a surface molecule expressed on progenitors from hematopoietic, endothelial, and neural lineages. ALDH(hi)CD133+Lin- cells were primarily CD34+, but also included CD34-CD38-CD133+ cells, a phenotype previously associated with repopulating function. Both ALDH(hi)CD133-Lin- and ALDH(hi)CD133+Lin- cells demonstrated distinct clonogenic progenitor function in vitro, whereas only the ALDH(hi)CD133+Lin- population seeded the murine bone marrow 48 hours after transplantation. Significant human cell repopulation was observed only in NOD/SCID and NOD/SCID beta2M-null mice that received transplants of ALDH(hi)CD133+Lin- cells. Limiting dilution analysis demonstrated a 10-fold increase in the frequency of NOD/SCID repopulating cells compared with CD133+Lin- cells, suggesting that high ALDH activity further purified cells with repopulating function. Transplanted ALDH(hi)CD133+Lin- cells also maintained primitive hematopoietic phenotypes (CD34+CD38-) and demonstrated enhanced repopulating function in recipients of serial, secondary transplants. Cell selection based on ALDH activity and CD133 expression provides a novel purification of HSCs with long-term repopulating function and may be considered an alternative to CD34 cell selection for stem cell therapies.

### Autocatalytic base editing for RNA-responsive translational control [^1ef5192a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Genetic circuits that control transgene expression in response to pre-defined transcriptional cues would enable the development of smart therapeutics. To this end, here we engineer programmable single-transcript RNA sensors in which adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) autocatalytically convert target hybridization into a translational output. Dubbed DART VADAR (Detection and Amplification of RNA Triggers via ADAR), our system amplifies the signal from editing by endogenous ADAR through a positive feedback loop. Amplification is mediated by the expression of a hyperactive, minimal ADAR variant and its recruitment to the edit site via an orthogonal RNA targeting mechanism. This topology confers high dynamic range, low background, minimal off-target effects, and a small genetic footprint. We leverage DART VADAR to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms and modulate translation in response to endogenous transcript levels in mammalian cells.

### Inborn errors of purine metabolism: clinical update and therapies [^a9060592]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Inborn errors of purine metabolism exhibit broad neurological, immunological, haematological and renal manifestations. Limited awareness of the phenotypic spectrum, the recent descriptions of newer disorders and considerable genetic heterogeneity, have contributed to long diagnostic odysseys for affected individuals. These enzymes are widely but not ubiquitously distributed in human tissues and are crucial for synthesis of essential nucleotides, such as ATP, which form the basis of DNA and RNA, oxidative phosphorylation, signal transduction and a range of molecular synthetic processes. Depletion of nucleotides or accumulation of toxic intermediates contributes to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Maintenance of cellular nucleotides depends on the three aspects of metabolism of purines (and related pyrimidines): de novo synthesis, catabolism and recycling of these metabolites. At present, treatments for the clinically significant defects of the purine pathway are restricted: purine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency with uridine; familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy (FJHN), adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) deficiency, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) deficiency and phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthetase superactivity (PRPS) with allopurinol; adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiencies have been treated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and ADA deficiency with enzyme replacement with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ADA, or erythrocyte-encapsulated ADA; myeloadenylate deaminase (MADA) and adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiencies have had trials of oral ribose; PRPS, HPRT and adenosine kinase (ADK) deficiencies with S-adenosylmethionine; and molybdenum cofactor deficiency of complementation group A (MOCODA) with cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). In this review we describe the known inborn errors of purine metabolism, their phenotypic presentations, established diagnostic methodology and recognised treatment options.

### Learning cis-regulatory principles of ADAR-based RNA editing from CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis [^d3d1113e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing catalyzed by ADAR enzymes occurs in double-stranded RNAs. Despite a compelling need towards predictive understanding of natural and engineered editing events, how the RNA sequence and structure determine the editing efficiency and specificity (i.e., cis-regulation) is poorly understood. We apply a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated saturation mutagenesis approach to generate libraries of mutations near three natural editing substrates at their endogenous genomic loci. We use machine learning to integrate diverse RNA sequence and structure features to model editing levels measured by deep sequencing. We confirm known features and identify new features important for RNA editing. Training and testing XGBoost algorithm within the same substrate yield models that explain 68 to 86 percent of substrate-specific variation in editing levels. However, the models do not generalize across substrates, suggesting complex and context-dependent regulation patterns. Our integrative approach can be applied to larger scale experiments towards deciphering the RNA editing code.

### Epigenetic regulation of planarian stem cells by the SET1 / MLL family of histone methyltransferases [^c5020651]. Epigenetics (2013). Low credibility.

Chromatin regulation is a fundamental mechanism underlying stem cell pluripotency, differentiation, and the establishment of cell type-specific gene expression profiles. To examine the role of chromatin regulation in stem cells in vivo, we study regeneration in the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. These animals possess a high concentration of pluripotent stem cells, which are capable of restoring any damaged or lost tissues after injury or amputation. Here, we identify the S. mediterranea homologs of the SET1/MLL family of histone methyltransferases and COMPASS and COMPASS-like complex proteins and investigate their role in stem cell function during regeneration. We identified six S. mediterranea homologs of the SET1/MLL family (set1, mll1/2, trr-1, trr-2, mll5–1 and mll5–2), characterized their patterns of expression in the animal, and examined their function by RNAi. All members of this family are expressed in the stem cell population and differentiated tissues. We show that set1, mll1/2, trr-1, and mll5–2 are required for regeneration and that set1, trr-1 and mll5–2 play roles in the regulation of mitosis. Most notably, knockdown of the planarian set1 homolog leads to stem cell depletion. A subset of planarian homologs of COMPASS and COMPASS-like complex proteins are also expressed in stem cells and implicated in regeneration, but the knockdown phenotypes suggest that some complex members also function in other aspects of planarian biology. This work characterizes the function of the SET1/MLL family in the context of planarian regeneration and provides insight into the role of these enzymes in adult stem cell regulation in vivo.

### Outcomes following treatment for ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency: a report from the PIDTC [^026f393b]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency causes ∼13% of cases of severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), and gene therapy (GT). We evaluated 131 patients with ADA-SCID diagnosed between 1982 and 2017 who were enrolled in the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium SCID studies. Baseline clinical, immunologic, genetic characteristics, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. First definitive cellular therapy (FDCT) included 56 receiving HCT without preceding ERT (HCT); 31 HCT preceded by ERT (ERT-HCT); and 33 GT preceded by ERT (ERT-GT). Five-year event-free survival (EFS, alive, no need for further ERT or cellular therapy) was 49.5% (HCT), 73% (ERT-HCT), and 75.3% (ERT-GT; P < .01). Overall survival (OS) at 5 years after FDCT was 72.5% (HCT), 79.6% (ERT-HCT), and 100% (ERT-GT; P = .01). Five-year OS was superior for patients undergoing HCT at <3.5 months of age (91.6% vs 68% if ≥3.5 months, P = .02). Active infection at the time of HCT (regardless of ERT) decreased 5-year EFS (33.1% vs 68.2%, P < .01) and OS (64.7% vs 82.3%, P = .02). Five-year EFS (90.5%) and OS (100%) were best for matched sibling and matched family donors (MSD/MFD). For patients treated after the year 2000 and without active infection at the time of FDCT, no difference in 5-year EFS or OS was found between HCT using a variety of transplant approaches and ERT-GT. This suggests alternative donor HCT may be considered when MSD/MFD HCT and GT are not available, particularly when newborn screening identifies patients with ADA-SCID soon after birth and before the onset of infections. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01186913 and #NCT01346150.
