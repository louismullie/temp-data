## Question

apolipoprotein b and lipoprotein (a) means what

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a) are, how they compare, and what they mean for cardiovascular risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and physiologic roles of apoB and Lp(a). Then, I should verify how they relate to each other mechanistically and clinically. Next, I will assess risk prediction, discordance, and measurement nuances. After that, I need to check guideline thresholds and screening strategy. Finally, I will review treatment implications and synthesize key distinctions into practical takeaways, ensuring I cross-check claims against high-credibility sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm apoB fundamentals. ApoB is the structural protein on all atherogenic lipoproteins — VLDL, IDL, LDL, and Lp(a) — with one apoB molecule per particle, so the plasma apoB concentration reflects the number of circulating atherogenic particles, which is the proximate driver of atherosclerosis risk rather than the cholesterol mass within those particles [^113TymL3]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify predictive value too: physiologic and epidemiologic data indicate apoB tracks risk at least as well as, and often better than, LDL-C or non–HDL-C, especially in settings of discordance, and ESC/EAS guidelines endorse apoB as an alternative primary measure for screening, diagnosis, and management when available [^114RW8mF].

> Now, I need to define Lp(a) precisely. Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle that contains apoB100 but carries an additional apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] covalently linked by a disulfide bond, conferring distinct biology, including carriage of oxidized phospholipids and structural homology of apo(a) to plasminogen [^1127qXiw]. Let me verify the genetic piece: circulating Lp(a) levels are more than 90% genetically determined, vary substantially by ancestry, are about 17% higher post-menopause, and approximately 1 in 5 people have elevated concentrations that confer higher ASCVD and aortic valve stenosis risk [^111Rref9] [^113HhNRq].

> Wait, I should clarify the relationship between apoB and Lp(a). Lp(a) contains one apoB per particle, so each Lp(a) particle contributes to the total apoB count, but in most individuals Lp(a) constitutes a relatively small fraction of total apoB particles, which are primarily LDL [^11381ncC]. Lp(a) is a subclass of apoB-containing lipoproteins that adds to apoB particle number while imparting unique, additional risk mechanisms beyond particle number alone [^1127qXiw] [^11381ncC].

> Next, I should review Lp(a)'s distinct pathophysiology. Let me think about thrombosis and inflammation: apo(a) is homologous to plasminogen but does not promote fibrinolysis, thereby interfering with clot breakdown, and Lp(a) is the major carrier of oxidized phospholipids that amplify vascular inflammation, foam cell formation, and potentially calcification, including in valves [^1127qXiw] [^1113UmfL]. Hold on, I should verify comparative atherogenicity: due to reduced LDL receptor–mediated clearance and proinflammatory OxPL load, Lp(a) exhibits approximately six-fold higher atherogenicity per particle relative to LDL in mechanistic summaries, underscoring risk beyond apoB particle number alone [^11215S7e].

> I will now examine risk associations. I need to ensure independence and additivity: participant-level meta-analysis of statin trials shows Lp(a) and LDL-C confer independent and additive risk, and reducing LDL-C does not mitigate Lp(a)-mediated risk, so both need explicit consideration in risk assessment [^1137pjHN]. I should double-check combined risk signals: community data demonstrate higher 15-year CVD risk when both Lp(a) and LDL-C are elevated, supporting additive risk and the need to identify patients with concomitant elevations [^112X6SCD].

> Let me verify the discordance problem and measurement caveats. ApoB captures particle number when LDL-C is deceptively low because of cholesterol-depleted LDL particles, a common reason for LDL-C/apoB discordance and for the superior physiologic linkage of apoB to risk [^113TymL3]. But wait, what if LDL-C is inflated by Lp(a) cholesterol content? LDL-C as reported on standard panels includes Lp(a)-C; correcting LDL-C for Lp(a)-C can substantially change "true LDL-C", yet cholesterol content within Lp(a) varies across individuals, so fixed-percentage conversions are unreliable in clinical practice [^112GQmEq] [^1127qXiw]. This is why apoB and direct Lp(a) measurement together often provide clearer risk attribution than LDL-C alone [^111V5wPS].

> Next, I should review measurement, units, thresholds, and screening. I need to check that apoB is easily measured nonfasting and is endorsed by ESC/EAS and CCS as an alternative to LDL-C for risk assessment and management, especially in hypertriglyceridemia, very low LDL-C, metabolic syndrome, or obesity, where discordance is common [^114RW8mF] [^116by6yD]. For Lp(a), let me confirm units and cut points: assays report either nmol/L (particle number, preferred) or mg/dL (mass), with widely used high-risk thresholds of ≥ 50 mg/dL or > 125 nmol/L; very high Lp(a) > 180 mg/dL (> 430 nmol/L) carries lifetime ASCVD risk comparable to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and ESC/EAS recommends a once-in-lifetime Lp(a) measurement in every adult to identify such individuals [^115XUJDa] [^115Qq6KL] [^111Rref9]. I should confirm nonfasting convenience for both tests and the emphasis on isoform-insensitive assays for Lp(a) where feasible [^115XUJDa].

> I will now consider therapeutic implications for apoB reduction. Let me verify: lowering apoB particle number with statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors reduces events in proportion to apoB lowering, with PCSK9 therapy producing large decreases in apoB and non–HDL-C, consistent with particle number reduction being central to benefit [^111V5wPS]. Evolocumab, for example, reduces apoB by roughly 48–52% at 12 weeks versus placebo across populations, aligning with robust LDL particle depletion and attendant risk reduction in outcomes trials of LDL-lowering, where apoB tracks benefit [^112Ez9zp].

> Treatment for Lp(a) requires separate attention. I should confirm that statins have little or no effect on Lp(a), PCSK9 inhibitors reduce Lp(a) modestly by about 20–30%, and apheresis is an option in select, very high–risk settings, but dedicated Lp(a)-lowering agents are in development [^112Ez9zp] [^113GRb1B]. Let me verify the pipeline: antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA directed at LPA can lower Lp(a) by approximately 65–98%, with multiple large cardiovascular outcomes trials underway to determine whether such reductions translate into fewer events [^111Rref9] [^113GRb1B].

> Synthesis time — let me reconsider the key distinctions and ensure clinical clarity. ApoB quantifies total atherogenic particle number across LDL, IDL, VLDL, and Lp(a) and is a physiologically grounded primary target for lipid management and residual risk assessment, especially when LDL-C is discordant with particle burden [^113TymL3]. Lp(a) is a genetically determined, apoB-containing subclass with additional prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties that confer risk independent of LDL-C and apoB, warranting at least one lifetime measurement and more aggressive global risk factor control when elevated, with specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies on the horizon [^115Qq6KL] [^111Rref9] [^114RW8mF].

> Before concluding, hold on, I should verify an edge case: occasionally, Lp(a) can contribute materially to both measured LDL-C and total apoB, potentially obscuring attribution if Lp(a) is not measured; in such scenarios, reliance on apoB plus a direct Lp(a) value helps disentangle particle number from particle type–specific hazard and avoids misinterpretation from fixed Lp(a)-C corrections [^112uaahV] [^112GQmEq] [^1127qXiw]. I need to ensure clinicians recognize that discordance and dual elevation (high apoB with high Lp(a)) identify patients who may merit intensified LDL-lowering now and consideration for Lp(a)-targeted therapy as outcome data emerge [^112X6SCD] [^1137pjHN].

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the **primary structural protein** of atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a)) [^113TymL3], with each particle carrying one apoB molecule [^11381ncC]; thus, apoB quantifies the number of atherogenic particles and is a **superior risk marker** to LDL-C [^113FUxXb] [^111V5wPS]. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an LDL-like particle with apo(a) covalently bound to apoB-100 [^113HhNRq], conferring **independent risk** for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and calcific aortic stenosis [^111Rref9] via proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and antifibrinolytic mechanisms [^1113UmfL]. Elevated apoB and Lp(a) are both associated with increased cardiovascular risk [^113HhNRq], and Lp(a) risk is largely genetically determined [^111Rref9] and not mitigated by LDL-C lowering alone [^1137pjHN].

## Apolipoprotein B (apoB)

### Structure and function

- **Structural role**: ApoB is the main structural protein of LDL, VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a) [^1158izp1], essential for their assembly and secretion [^113TymL3].
- **Particle number**: Each atherogenic particle contains one apoB molecule [^11381ncC], so apoB concentration reflects the number of atherogenic particles [^111V5wPS].
- **Atherogenesis**: ApoB-containing particles enter the arterial wall [^113TymL3], become trapped, and initiate atherosclerosis [^1158izp1].

---

### Clinical significance

In clinical practice, apoB is a **superior marker of cardiovascular risk** compared with LDL-C and non-HDL-C [^113TymL3], and elevated levels are linked to an **increased risk** of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events [^111V5wPS]. ApoB is also a **therapeutic target** for lipid-lowering therapies, including statins and PCSK9 inhibitors [^112Ez9zp].

---

## Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]

### Structure and function

- **LDL-like core**: Lp(a) consists of an LDL-like particle with apo(a) covalently bound to apoB-100 [^113HhNRq] [^1127qXiw].
- **Apo(a) homology**: Apo(a) is structurally similar to plasminogen, conferring antifibrinolytic properties [^113HhNRq] [^111Rref9].
- **OxPL carrier**: Lp(a) carries oxidized phospholipids, promoting inflammation and atherogenesis [^113HhNRq] [^1127qXiw].

---

### Clinical significance

Elevated Lp(a) is an **independent risk factor** for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and calcific aortic stenosis [^111Rref9], with levels largely **genetically determined** and stable throughout life [^113HhNRq]. Few therapies **effectively lower Lp(a)**, though antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs are in development [^113GRb1B] [^113HhNRq].

---

## Relationship between apoB and Lp(a)

Because Lp(a) contains apoB-100, it **contributes to total apoB** levels [^113HhNRq]. Nevertheless, it confers cardiovascular **risk beyond apoB** due to its unique structure and properties [^112uaahV]. When both apoB and Lp(a) are elevated, cardiovascular risk is **significantly increased** [^112X6SCD].

---

## Clinical measurement and interpretation

- **ApoB measurement**: Recommended for cardiovascular risk assessment [^114RW8mF], especially in patients with high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, or obesity [^1153kxSu].
- **Lp(a) measurement**: Recommended at least once in adulthood [^115Qq6KL], particularly in individuals with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease [^115XUJDa].
- **Interpretation**: Elevated apoB indicates increased atherogenic particle number [^111V5wPS]; elevated Lp(a) indicates additional independent risk [^111Rref9].

---

## Therapeutic implications

Statins, PCSK9 inhibitors [^112Ez9zp], and other lipid-lowering agents **effectively reduce apoB levels** [^113TymL3] and cardiovascular risk [^111V5wPS]. In contrast, **therapeutic options for Lp(a) are limited**, although antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs are promising [^113HhNRq] [^113GRb1B]. Both apoB and Lp(a) should be **considered in cardiovascular risk assessment** and management strategies [^114RW8mF].

---

ApoB is the main structural protein of atherogenic lipoproteins [^113TymL3], while Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with apo(a) bound to apoB-100. Both are **important cardiovascular risk markers**, with Lp(a) providing **additional independent risk** [^111Rref9] due to its unique structure and properties.

### Independence of lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: A participant-level meta-analysis [^1137pjHN]. Circulation (2025).

In this meta-analysis of statin trials, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were identified as independent and additive cardiovascular risk factors. The reduction of LDL-C levels did not mitigate the risk mediated by Lp(a). Our findings emphasize the necessity for testing and incorporating Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessments. Future trials will explore the role of targeted Lp(a) therapeutics in cardiovascular risk reduction within the context of LDL-C levels.

### Apolipoprotein B: Bridging the gap between evidence and clinical practice [^113FUxXb]. Circulation (2024). Low credibility.

Despite evidence suggesting that apolipoprotein B (apoB) measurement outperforms low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level measurement in predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, apoB measurement has not been widely adopted into routine clinical practice. One barrier to the use of apoB measurement is the lack of consistent guidance for clinicians on how to interpret and apply apoB results in a clinical context. Guidelines often provide clear low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets or triggers to initiate treatment changes; however, consistent targets for apoB are lacking.

In this review, we synthesize existing data regarding the epidemiology of apoB by comparing guideline recommendations on its use, describing population percentiles of apoB relative to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, summarizing studies on discordance between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB levels, and evaluating apoB levels in clinical trials of lipid-lowering therapy to guide potential treatment targets. We propose evidence-guided apoB thresholds for use in cholesterol management and clinical care.

### Physiological bases for the superiority of apolipoprotein B over low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^113TymL3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society stated that apolipoprotein B (apoB) was a more accurate marker of cardiovascular risk than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Since then, the evidence has continued to mount in favor of apoB. This review explicates the physiological mechanisms responsible for the superiority of apoB as a marker of the cardiovascular risk attributable to the atherogenic apoB lipoprotein particles, chylomicron remnants, very low-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein particles.

- **Outlined overview**: First, the nature and relative numbers of these different apoB particles will be outlined. This will make clear why low-density lipoprotein particles are almost always the major determinants of cardiovascular risk and why the concentrations of triglycerides and LDL-C may obscure this relation.
- **Mechanisms governing particle numbers**: Next, the mechanisms that govern the number of very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein particles will be outlined because, except for dysbetalipoproteinemia, the total number of apoB particles determines cardiovascular risk.
- **Cholesterol mass mechanisms**: Then, the mechanisms that govern the cholesterol mass within very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein particles will be reviewed. This is responsible for the discordance between the mass of cholesterol within apoB particles, measured either as LDL-C or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the number of apoB particles measured as apoB. This discordance creates the superior predictive power of apoB over LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^1113UmfL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This figure illustrates the mechanistic pathways linking lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] to atherosclerosis. Lp(a) plays a central role in promoting atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Elevated Lp(a) levels contribute to atherogenesis due to its structural similarity with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Oxidized phospholipids carried on Lp(a) promote inflammation, which amplifies vascular immune activation and foam cell formation. The risk of thrombosis is increased via structural homology between apolipoprotein(a) and plasminogen, inhibiting fibrinolysis and promoting clot formation. Collectively, these mechanisms link elevated Lp(a) to heightened cardiovascular risk.

### Lipoprotein(a) - from biomarker to therapy: A review for the clinician [^113HhNRq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Amid rising CVD rates, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been recognized as a critical biomarker identifying individuals at an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS), independent of traditional risk factors. Lp(a) is a lipoprotein variant similar to LDL but includes apolipoprotein(a), which influences its pathogenic potential. Elevated Lp(a) levels are genetically determined and have been implicated in promoting vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, enhanced calcification, and thrombosis.

Emerging antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)- and small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs)-based therapies have been shown to lower Lp(a) concentrations, with ongoing trials underway to determine whether they reduce the risk of CVD. While guidelines on screening and management continue to evolve, the advent of specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies may transform CVD prevention and treatment. This review aims to consolidate the knowledge on Lp(a) from its biological functions to its implications for clinical practice, focusing on its role as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^115Rji5b]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been considered a cardiovascular risk factor for many years. Due to incomplete scientific evidence, screening and treatment of high Lp(a) levels have primarily been performed by lipid specialists. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in understanding the causal role of elevated Lp(a) in premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). These new findings have led to the creation of a Consensus Paper critically appraising the evidence base.

Lipoprotein(a) is a plasma lipoprotein consisting of a cholesterol-rich LDL particle with one molecule of apolipoprotein B100 and an additional protein, apolipoprotein(a), attached via a disulfide bond. Elevated Lp(a) levels can potentially increase the risk of CVD through two primary mechanisms:

- **Prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effects**: Apolipoprotein(a) has structural homology with plasminogen and plasmin but lacks fibrinolytic activity.
- **Accelerated atherogenesis**: This occurs as a result of intimal deposition of Lp(a) cholesterol, or through both mechanisms.

Apolipoprotein(a) includes 10 different types of plasminogen kringle 4-like repeats, as well as regions homologous to the kringle 5 and protease regions of plasminogen.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor [^115rm4hY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a class of lipoprotein particles having the lipid composition of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but with a distinct protein moiety comprised of two proteins linked together by a disulfide bridge. The two proteins are apoB100, the protein moiety of LDL, and apo(a), a heavily glycosylated protein that is specific for Lp(a). Apo(a) has a strong structural similarity to plasminogen and has a wide-size polymorphism that has a genetic origin and is partially responsible for the size and density heterogeneity of Lp(a).

High plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease related to the atherogenic and thrombogenic potentials of this lipoprotein enhanced by the presence of other risk factors, among which are high plasma levels of LDL or low levels of high-density lipoprotein. The factors determining the plasma levels of Lp(a) have not been clearly identified except for an association with different alleles of the apo(a) gene, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 6.

Currently, there are no generally accepted ways to normalize the plasma levels of Lp(a) by either dietary or pharmacologic means. Until further progress in this area is made, patients with high plasma levels of Lp(a) should be advised to correct modifiable risk factors to decrease the cardiovascular pathogenicity of this lipoprotein class.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^112srr6t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

It is well documented that lipoprotein(a) levels are largely controlled at the stage of biosynthesis rather than the catabolism of the particle. A potential mechanism to explain the inverse association between apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and lipoprotein(a) concentration is based on the decreased residency time of smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms in the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in decreased susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation and more efficient maturation of smaller apolipoprotein(a) proteins. This correlates with increased hepatic secretion of smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms and higher susceptibility of larger apolipoprotein(a) proteins to endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation, resulting in reduced secretion of larger apolipoprotein(a) isoforms.

- **Gene: Polymorphisms and splicing**: Recently, it has been shown that there are complex relationships between the genetic factors affecting lipoprotein(a) levels. This includes, for example, that modulation of the contribution of allele size to lipoprotein(a) levels is modified by many functional SNPs over the entire range of LPA allele frequencies, as well as interactions of SNPs with other SNPs and with short tandem repeats. Several loss‐of‐function SNPs have been identified within the LPA gene locus, such as the null alleles rs41272114 and rs143431368, which are caused by splice site mutations.

### Age and cardiovascular risk attributable to apolipoprotein B, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^115evQgF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Higher concentrations of the apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoproteins increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, whether the risk associated with apoB lipoproteins varies with age has not been well examined.

- **Methods and results**: We determined the associations for total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apoB, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with myocardial infarction at different ages in 11,760 controls and 8,998 myocardial infarction cases. Logistic regression was used to compute the odds ratio of myocardial infarction for a 1 SD change in each lipid marker by decade from 70 years of age. Except for those over 70, plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB were greater in cases than controls. However, the average levels of these markers decreased significantly as age increased. By contrast, levels of apoA-I and HDL-C were significantly greater in controls than cases but increased significantly as age increased. The cardiovascular risk associated with the atherogenic lipid markers differed at different ages. Most notably, there was a significant decline in the odds ratio for total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB with increases in age, whereas the odds ratios associated with apoA-I and HDL-C were consistent across the age groups.

- **Conclusions**: These data indicate that the risk of cardiovascular events associated with apoB particles is greater in younger compared to older individuals. This finding is consistent with greater relative benefit from certain interventions in younger populations.

### A meta-analysis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B as markers of cardiovascular risk [^115xyWqs]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2011). Low credibility.

Whether apolipoprotein B (apoB) or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) adds to the predictive power of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) for cardiovascular risk remains controversial.

- **Methods and results**: This meta-analysis is based on all the published epidemiological studies that contained estimates of the relative risks of non-HDL-C and apoB for fatal or nonfatal ischemic cardiovascular events. Twelve independent reports, including 233,455 subjects and 22,950 events, were analyzed. All published risk estimates were converted to standardized relative risk ratios (RRRs) and analyzed by quantitative meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Whether analyzed individually or in head-to-head comparisons, apoB was the most potent marker of cardiovascular risk (RRR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.51), LDL-C was the least (RRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.33), and non-HDL-C was intermediate (RRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.44). The overall comparisons of the within-study differences showed that apoB RRR was 5.7% greater than non-HDL-C (P < 0.001), which was 6.3% greater than LDL-C (P < 0.001). Only HDL-C accounted for any substantial portion of the variance of the results among the studies.

We calculated the number of clinical events prevented by a high-risk treatment regimen of all those above the 70th percentile of the US adult population using each of the three markers. Over a 10-year period, a non-HDL-C strategy would prevent 300,000 more events than an LDL-C strategy, whereas an apoB strategy would prevent 500,000 more events than a non-HDL-C strategy.

### Comparison of conventional lipoprotein tests and apolipoproteins in the prediction of cardiovascular disease [^116E676a]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperlipidemia has been widely documented to be associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and pharmacological reduction of circulating non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is beneficial in primary and secondary CVD prevention. Widely used clinical CVD risk calculators frequently include classical biochemistry measures of total cholesterol, HDL-C, or a combination of these.

Total cholesterol is an estimate of the cholesterol in all very-low-density lipoproteins, intermediate-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, and lipoprotein(a) in the fasted state, as well as chylomicrons and their remnant particles in the unfasted state. Notably, the majority of total cholesterol resides in LDL particles. The additional clinical utility of recently developed direct LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) measurements is not entirely clear. Non–HDL-C has been suggested as a pragmatic and cost-effective alternative to direct LDL-C measurement, requiring only total cholesterol and HDL-C to be performed.

Apolipoproteins (Apo) A1 and B are the principal protein components of HDL and non-HDL particles, respectively, and have also been of interest for their potential in improving CVD risk prediction. This interest is partly due to the proteins being key components of lipoprotein function, and their measurement facilitating quantification of objective particle numbers. ApoB is thought to be of similar use in CVD prediction as non–HDL-C and LDL-C, but in some studies, has shown improvements in prediction.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^112GQmEq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There are several clinical implications to the findings. First, these observations apply to almost all patients in whom a lipid panel is measured, because the absence of circulating lipoprotein(a) is extremely rare. The methodological limitations of measures/calculations of LDL‐C particularly affect patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), because the contribution of their lipoprotein(a) mass to LDL‐C will be proportionally higher as lipoprotein(a) mass increases. Lipoprotein(a) concentration > 30 mg/dL is present in approximately 35% of patients in the United States and similar numbers in Europe, and there are approximately 1.4 billion people globally with lipoprotein(a) levels > 50 mg/dL.

Second, our data suggest that CVD risk is imprecisely depicted by "LDL‐C". For example, an "LDL‐C" of "70 mg/dL" may represent two different patients: one with a lipoprotein(a) mass of 15 mg/dL, Lp(a)‐C of 5 mg/dL, and true LDL‐C of 65 mg/dL, or another with a lipoprotein(a) mass of 210 mg/dL, Lp(a)‐C of 70 mg/dL, and true LDL‐C of 0 mg/dL. Despite having identical "LDL‐C" values, these two individuals would be expected to have unique risk profiles.

In a recent analysis of the Copenhagen cohorts, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality was 1.18 for every 15‐mg/dL increase in Lp(a)‐C. In contrast, the hazard ratio for the same outcome was only 1.07 for every 15‐mg/dL increase in LDL‐C. This finding supports a more granular understanding of the components comprising "LDL‐C" for improved risk prediction. At a population level, differential lifelong exposure to LDL‐C levels as low as 10 mg/dL results in distinct risk categories.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^115XUJDa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Testing for elevated lipoprotein(a) is not routinely performed in clinical practice despite recommendations from numerous medical societies for cascade screening in people with a family history of premature ASCVD and/or elevated lipoprotein(a). In a 2022 Scientific Statement, the American Heart Association recommended testing lipoprotein(a) in individuals with a family or personal history of ASCVD. It proposed that once standardization of lipoprotein(a) assays is achieved, a reassessment of broader population-based screening should be considered. Furthermore, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the European Atherosclerosis Society advise lipoprotein(a) testing at least once in all adults, irrespective of family history. The success of cascade screening for identifying affected family members has already been demonstrated in familial hypercholesterolemia and has been shown to be cost-effective.

- **Lipoprotein(a): Clinical considerations for diagnosis and testing**: Lipoprotein(a) testing requires only routine, nonfasting blood draws, making it convenient for patients and healthcare professionals. While plasma lipoprotein(a) levels can be measured in nmol/L or mg/dL, intensive CVD risk factor management should be recommended for all individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) (high risk is defined as ≥ 50 mg/dL [> 125 nmol/L]). The benefits of lipoprotein(a) testing include improved CVD risk stratification by proactively identifying individuals at risk.

### Apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in atherogenesis [^1158izp1]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the main structural protein of LDLs, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a), and is crucial for their formation, metabolism, and atherogenic properties. In this review, we present insights into the role of apoB-containing lipoproteins in atherogenesis, emphasizing the mechanisms leading to plaque initiation and growth. LDL, the most abundant cholesterol-rich lipoprotein in plasma, is causally linked to atherosclerosis. LDL enters the artery wall by transcytosis and, in vulnerable regions, is retained in the subendothelial space by binding to proteoglycans via specific sites on apoB. A maladaptive response ensues, involving modification of LDL particles, which promotes LDL retention and the release of bioactive lipid products that trigger inflammatory responses in vascular cells, as well as adaptive immune responses.

Resident and recruited macrophages take up modified LDL, leading to foam cell formation and ultimately cell death due to inadequate cellular lipid handling. Accumulation of dead cells and cholesterol crystallization are hallmarks of the necrotic core of atherosclerotic plaques. Other apoB-containing lipoproteins, although less abundant, have substantially greater atherogenicity per particle than LDL. These lipoproteins probably contribute to atherogenesis in a similar way to LDL but might also induce additional pathogenic mechanisms. Several targets for intervention to reduce the rate of atherosclerotic lesion initiation and progression have now been identified, including lowering plasma lipoprotein levels.

### Apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, lipoprotein(a) concentration, and coronary artery disease: A Mendelian randomisation analysis [^111yDcea]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

The lipoprotein(a) pathway is a causal factor in coronary heart disease. We used a genetic approach to distinguish the relevance of two distinct components of this pathway: apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and circulating lipoprotein(a) concentration, to coronary heart disease.

In this Mendelian randomisation study, we measured lipoprotein(a) concentration and determined apolipoprotein(a) isoform size with a genetic method, specifically the kringle IV type 2 (KIV2) repeats in the LPA gene, along with a serum-based electrophoretic assay. This was conducted in patients and controls who were frequency matched for age and sex from the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for myocardial infarction per one standard deviation (SD) difference in either LPA KIV2 repeats or lipoprotein(a) concentration.

In a genome-wide analysis of up to 17,503 participants in PROMIS, we identified genetic variants associated with either apolipoprotein(a) isoform size or lipoprotein(a) concentration. Using a Mendelian randomisation study design, and genetic data on 60,801 patients with coronary heart disease and 123,504 controls from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium, we calculated ORs for myocardial infarction with variants that produced similar differences in either apolipoprotein(a) isoform size in serum or lipoprotein(a) concentration. Finally, we compared phenotypic versus genotypic ORs to estimate whether apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, lipoprotein(a) concentration, or both were causally associated with coronary heart disease.

### Association of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins and risk of myocardial infarction in individuals with and without atherosclerosis: Distinguishing between particle concentration, type, and content [^111V5wPS]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Lipid management typically focuses on levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and, to a lesser extent, triglycerides (TG). However, animal models and genetic studies suggest that atherogenic particle subpopulations, such as LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), are both important and that the number of particles is more predictive of cardiac events than their lipid content.

The study aimed to determine whether common measures of cholesterol concentration, TG concentration, or their ratio are associated with cardiovascular risk beyond the number of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins. This prospective cohort analysis included individuals from the population-based UK Biobank and two large international clinical trials, FOURIER and IMPROVE-IT. The median interquartile range (IQR) follow-up was 11.1 (10.4–11.8) years in the UK Biobank and 2.5 (2.0–4.7) years in the clinical trials. Two populations were studied in this analysis: 389,529 individuals in the primary prevention group who were not taking lipid-lowering therapy and 40,430 patients with established atherosclerosis who were receiving statin treatment.

- **Exposures**: ApoB, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, and TG.
- **Main outcome and measures**: The primary study outcome was incident myocardial infarction (MI).

Results indicated that, of the 389,529 individuals in the primary prevention group, 224,097 (58%) were female, and the median IQR age was 56.0 (49.5–62.5) years. Of the 40,430 patients with established atherosclerosis, 9,647 (24%) were female.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol - The Framingham Heart Study [^112s1Lqd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but is not measured in routine clinical care. Screening for high lipoprotein(a) in individuals with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods and results**: We examined 2,606 Framingham Offspring participants (median age, 54 years; 45% men) prospectively with a median follow-up of 15 years (n = 392 incident cardiovascular events). Individuals with higher (≥ 100 nmol/L) versus lower lipoprotein(a) were divided into groups based on LDL-C < 135 mg/dL versus ≥ 135 mg/dL.

In Cox models, after adjustment for known risk factors, high lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL were each significant predictors of cardiovascular disease (LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL: hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006; high lipoprotein(a): HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026). Across the groups of high/low lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL or < 135 mg/dL, the absolute cardiovascular disease risks at 15 years were 22.6% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 248), 17.3% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 758), 12.7% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 275), and 11.5% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 1,328, reference group).

Among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, those with high lipoprotein(a) had a 43% higher risk (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02). The presence of high lipoprotein(a) with moderate LDL-C levels (135–159 mg/dL) yielded absolute risks equivalent to those with…

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well‐established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but is not measured in routine clinical care.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: Current status [^1173Ysam]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

We suggest that Lp(a) should be measured once in all subjects at intermediate or high risk of CVD/CHD who present with:

- **Premature CVD**: Individuals exhibiting early onset cardiovascular disease.
- **Familial hypercholesterolaemia**: Those with inherited high cholesterol levels.
- **Family history**: A family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a).
- **Recurrent CVD despite statin treatment**: Patients experiencing CVD even after taking statins.
- **European guidelines risk**: Individuals with a ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to the European guidelines.
- **US guidelines risk**: Individuals with a ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal and/or non-fatal CHD according to the US guidelines.

Repeat measurement is only necessary if treatment for high Lp(a) levels is initiated in order to evaluate therapeutic response.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^115xSH1h]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

- **Methods and results**: The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or coronary heart disease (CHD), together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity. Additionally, it may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) below the 80th percentile (less than approximately 50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily involve niacin at 1–3 g/day, as suggested by a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials.

### Comparison of conventional lipoprotein tests and apolipoproteins in the prediction of cardiovascular disease [^115z9rw8]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) measurements are central to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment, but there is continuing debate around the utility of other lipids for risk prediction.

- **Methods**: Participants from the UK Biobank without baseline CVD and not taking statins, with relevant lipid measurements (n = 346,686), were included in the primary analysis. An incident fatal or nonfatal CVD event occurred in 6,216 participants (1,656 fatal) over a median of 8.9 years. Associations of nonfasting lipid measurements (total cholesterol, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, direct and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and apolipoproteins [Apo] A1 and B) with CVD were compared using Cox models adjusting for classical risk factors. Predictive utility was determined by the C-index and net reclassification index. Prediction was also tested in 68,649 participants taking a statin with or without baseline CVD (3,515 CVD events).

- **Results**: ApoB, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C were highly correlated (r > 0.90), while HDL-C was strongly correlated with ApoA1 (r = 0.92). After adjustment for classical risk factors, a 1 SD increase in ApoB, direct LDL-C, and non-HDL-C had similar associations with composite fatal/nonfatal CVD events (hazard ratio, 1.23, 1.20, 1.21, respectively). Associations for a 1 SD increase in HDL-C and ApoA1 were also similar (hazard ratios, 0.81 for both). Adding either total cholesterol and HDL-C, or ApoB and ApoA, to a CVD risk prediction model (C-index, 0.7378) yielded similar improvement in discrimination (C-index change, 0.0084).

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^11215S7e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The objectives of this narrative review are threefold. First, we discuss underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that make Lp(a) a potent contributor to cardiovascular risk. Second, we discuss the landscape of Lp(a) measurement, including available assay techniques, standardization efforts, and interpretation of results, with a particular focus on addressing the ongoing challenges in clinical application. Third, we outline recommendations regarding who should undergo Lp(a) testing, incorporating insights from recent clinical practice guidelines. By synthesizing the latest data, this review seeks to inform clinicians and provide practical guidance on integrating Lp(a) measurement into routine cardiovascular risk assessment. Lastly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting Lp(a), underscoring their potential to reshape clinical practice in the future.

- **Pathophysiological role**: Lp(a) is a structurally unique lipoprotein particle consisting of an LDL‐like core (apolipoprotein‐B‐100) that is attached to apo(a) via a disulfide bond. Though both LDL and Lp(a) contain one apolipoprotein‐B (ApoB) molecule, Lp(a) does not bind to LDL receptors with the same affinity as LDL due to the steric interference of the apo(a) moiety on Lp(a). Additionally, apo(a) alters the shape of ApoB, which may, in turn, decrease binding to the LDL receptor. Decreased uptake by the LDL receptor and the presence of oxidized phospholipids on the apo(a) moiety overall contribute to an approximately six‐fold higher atherogenicity for Lp(a) when compared to LDL.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham heart study [^1134Jzx4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The absolute and relative risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were examined among individuals with high lipoprotein(a) levels (≥ 100 nmol/L) with and without low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 135 mg/dL. Across the four groups with high/low lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C, the group with both high lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL had the highest absolute risk at 15 years.

The group with the lowest absolute risk included participants with both lipoprotein(a) < 100 nmol/L and LDL-C < 135 mg/dL.

The presence of lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L was associated with a 43% higher risk among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02). However, the addition of lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L led to no improvements in net reclassification improvement (NRI) for the full sample. In individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, the inclusion of lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L resulted in marginal improvements in risk reclassification (NRI, 0.02).

### Physiological bases for the superiority of apolipoprotein B over low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^111duyTW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Based on these concepts, caregivers will understand why, except for dysbetalipoproteinemia, apoB includes all the information about cardiovascular risk from LDL‐C, non–HDL‐C, and triglycerides, and, therefore, how apoB could improve diagnosis and simplify therapy. We will explain why LDL particles are more important drivers of cardiovascular risk than very low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, even in those with hypertriglyceridemia, and why not all individuals with hypertriglyceridemia have an elevated apoB, and, therefore, why not all those with high triglycerides have the same cardiovascular risk. We will also demonstrate how the number of LDL apoB particles, and, therefore, cardiovascular risk, can be elevated when LDL‐C and/or non–HDL‐C are normal. Finally, we will illustrate the most significant proatherogenic apoB lipoprotein phenotypes to help reframe the conventional disorders of lipid metabolism as disorders of apoB lipoprotein particle metabolism.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^114FT1XD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines consider plasma LDL‐C levels ≥ 160 mg/dL as a risk enhancer and an optional indication for treatment. To better evaluate the clinical utility of screening for high lipoprotein(a), we calculated the observed cardiovascular risks for high LDL‐C ≥ 160 mg/dL and for LDL‐C 135 to < 160 mg/dL plus lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L. The absolute risks at 15 years for those with LDL‐C ≥ 160 mg/dL was 21.0%. Among participants who had LDL‐C levels between 135 to < 160 mg/dL, risk was estimated at 23.5% when lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L and 17.3% when lipoprotein(a) < 100 nmol/L. Risk for individuals with LDL‐C < 135 mg/dL was 13.7%.

In sensitivity analysis, we calculated the observed cardiovascular risk using different cutoff values for low, moderate, and high LDL‐C (LDL < 130, LDL‐C ≥ 130, and LDL‐C ≥ 160) and moderate (70 nmol/L) and high lipoprotein(a) (100 nmol/L) and results were largely consistent with the main analysis.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^113mypi6]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

### The contribution of ApoB and ApoA1 measurements to cardiovascular risk assessment [^111KcjsV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

LDL has been widely recognized as the major atherogenic lipoprotein and designated as the primary target for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, there is growing evidence that other triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), carry atherogenic potential as well. This has led to the designation of non-HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (LDL + IDL + VLDL) as a secondary target of treatment for hyperlipidaemia. Since each LDL, IDL, and VLDL particle carries only one apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100) molecule, the total ApoB value represents the total number of potentially atherogenic lipoproteins, whereas non-HDL-C provides the cholesterol content of these same lipoproteins.

Recent data from epidemiological, observational, and interventional studies suggest that non-HDL-C, apolipoproteins ApoA1 and ApoB, may improve CHD risk assessment by identifying more high-risk individuals than the usual lipid profile alone. However, the targets for the optimal treatment of dyslipidaemia remain a subject of considerable debate. Further studies are needed to determine whether ApoB and ApoA1 are superior to conventional lipid parameters as predictors of cardiovascular disease or as therapeutic targets of hyperlipidaemias.

In this review, we summarize the opinions on the use of ApoA1 and ApoB values as estimates of cardiovascular risk or as treatment goals in patients undergoing treatment for hyperlipidaemia.

### Eradicating the burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by lowering apolipoprotein B lipoproteins earlier in life [^116UZSPV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The evidence for a causal role of Apo B lipoproteins in atherosclerosis is supported by epidemiology and genetics. Atherogenesis often begins in childhood, with some individuals developing advanced plaque by late adolescence or early adulthood. The rate of plaque progression and the occurrence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events depend on the level and duration of exposure to Apo B lipoproteins, the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, and genetic predisposition.

In countries with long-term exposure to atherogenic diets, most adults have advanced fibrocalcific plaque by age 50. Without risk factor intervention, clinical atherothrombotic events commonly begin occurring in men during their 60s and 70s and in women during their 70s and 80s.

Plasma Apo B lipoprotein levels, as indicated by total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)‐C, and Apo B levels, are associated with greater subclinical atheroma burden and increased risk of ASCVD events across all age, sex, and race and ethnicity groups and regions. Both the Apo B lipoprotein level and the cholesterol content of the particles are associated with increased ASCVD risk. The increase in the relative risk of ASCVD per increment increase in total cholesterol or LDL-C depends on the level and duration of exposure and the presence of other risk factors.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: Current status [^113HxoWu]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were, first, to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and, second, to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

- **Methods and results**: The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) < 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1–3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials suggests its efficacy.

### Lipoprotein (a)-we know so much yet still have much to learn… Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Aside from its role as a recognized independent CVD biomarker, the physiological function of Lp(a) still is not completely understood. Because of its structural similarity to plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for its binding site, leading to reduced fibrinolysis. Moreover, as a result of stimulating the secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1, Lp(a) leads to thrombogenesis.

Lp(a) also carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids. This activity attracts inflammatory cells to vessel walls, leading to smooth muscle cell proliferation. Consequently, Lp(a) strongly contributes to the process of atherogenesis.

Despite the recognition of Lp(a) as an independent risk factor for CVD events, irrespective of other coexisting risk factors, physician knowledge regarding Lp(a) is limited. Consequently, Lp(a) is measured infrequently. One reason for this is the lack of clear recommendations concerning Lp(a) cut‐off values. Another relates to the cost and difficulties associated with diagnostic methods. Additionally, there is a lack of recommendations on the management and therapy of patients with high levels of this biomarker.

The first guideline relating to the management of high levels of Lp(a) was the Consensus Paper of the European Society of Atherosclerosis (EAS; 2010). The authors recommended the measurement of Lp(a) once in all subjects at intermediate or high risk of CVD/CHD who present with premature CVD and/or familial hypercholesterolemia.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to lipoprotein(a), EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering obtaining lipoprotein(a) at least once in each adult person's lifetime. This helps identify patients with very high inherited lipoprotein(a) levels greater than 180 mg/dL (> 430 mmol/L), which carry a lifetime risk of ASCVD equivalent to the risk associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Physiological bases for the superiority of apolipoprotein B over low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^112uaahV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Other apolipoproteins, such as apoE, apo CII, and apo CIII, play important roles in regulating the metabolism of the chylomicron and VLDL particles. However, we will not deal with these here because these other markers have not yet been shown to add clinically relevant information beyond that provided by apoB. That is not the case for lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) particles. Lp(a) is an LDL particle to which a molecule of apo(a) has been disulfide-bonded to apo B 100. Lp(a) appears to increase the risk of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease independently of LDL‐C or total apoB. Therefore, to assess the atherogenic risk attributable to the apoB lipoproteins, Lp(a) must be measured as well as apoB. Lp(a) also plays a causal role in the genesis of calcific aortic stenosis.

Lp(a) particles generally account for only a small minority of total apoB particles in plasma. Occasionally, however, they may contribute significantly to total apoB and LDL‐C. Newer assays that report Lp(a) in nanomoles per liter rather than mass should solve this problem because the proportion of total apoB attributable to Lp(a) will be calculable. The levels of Lp(a) are determined genetically, and there is little variance over our lifetimes. Medications to lower Lp(a) with the goal to reduce cardiovascular risk and the likelihood of aortic stenosis are being developed, but the results of randomized controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes are not yet available. Therefore, we will not deal further with Lp(a).

### High-density lipoproteins and atherosclerosis [^111XDufv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are strongly related to the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Low levels of HDL cholesterol are a major cardiovascular risk factor, and overexpression of the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, markedly inhibits progression and even induces regression of atherosclerosis in animal models. Clinical data regarding the effect of increasing HDL cholesterol on vascular events are limited. HDL remains an important potential target for therapeutic intervention. A variety of gene products are involved in the regulation of HDL metabolism; yet, the mechanisms by which HDL inhibits atherosclerosis are not yet fully understood. There remains much to be learned about HDL metabolism and its relation to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular risk factors.

### Assessing the accuracy of estimated lipoprotein(a) cholesterol and lipoprotein(a)-free low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116uzFMy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Advancements in risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment response to future therapies have increased the impetus for accurate measurement of the atherogenic burden of Lp(a). Currently, the reporting of Lp(a) levels varies substantially. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommends Lp(a) particle number (Lp[a]‐P), an assessment of molar concentration, as the clinical standard for assessing Lp(a). However, in contemporary clinical cohorts, Lp(a) levels have often been expressed in mass concentration (mg/dL) of the entire lipoprotein particles (e.g. cholesterol, esters, phospholipids, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins) to allow familiarity in evaluating cardiovascular risk.

A proposed method for the estimation of Lp(a) cholesterol (Lp[a]‐C) has emerged. This method involves dividing Lp(a)‐P (in nmol/L) by a conversion factor of 2.4 to reflect mass in mg/dL and then multiplying by 30% to reflect the cholesterol content of Lp(a). This method is of clinical interest since the calculated LDL‐C value on a standard lipid panel contains Lp(a)‐C. As such, the ability to express Lp(a)‐C as a measure of cholesterol content within Lp(a) particles may be appealing to clinicians. Comparing Lp(a)‐C with LDL‐C would provide clinicians with a qualitative understanding of the degree to which Lp(a) is contributing to the underlying atherosclerotic disease process. Moreover, assessing Lp(a)‐C might help to explain situations wherein LDL‐C reduction is less than anticipated with LDL‐targeted therapies such as statins. There is evidence that statins, by far the most…

### Apolipoprotein B modifies the association between lipoprotein(a) and ASCVD risk [^115mEcfH]. American Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and apolipoprotein B (apoB) are individually associated with the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Moreover, previous basic research has implicated the potential interaction between apoB and Lp(a) in the atherogenic process. We aimed to determine whether apoB levels significantly modulate ASCVD risk associated with Lp(a) in a large community-based population without baseline cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods**: Plasma Lp(a) and apoB were measured in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Elevated Lp(a) was defined as the highest race-specific quintile, and elevated apoB was defined as ≥ 89 mg/dl (median value). The modifying effect of apoB on the Lp(a)-related risk of ASCVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) was determined using Cox regression models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors.

- **Results**: Among 12,988 ARIC participants, 3,888 ASCVD events and 1,754 CHD events were observed. Elevated apoB (≥ 89 mg/dl) and elevated Lp(a) (race-specific quintile 5) were independently associated with ASCVD (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.08–1.30; P < 0.001; HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.16–1.40; P < 0.001, respectively). An Lp(a)-by-apoB interaction was noted [Lp(a) (quintile 1–4 or quintile 5) * apoB (< 89 or ≥ 89 mg/dl) = 0.002]. Compared to the concordantly low Lp(a) group, the individuals with high Lp(a) had a greater ASCVD risk only when apoB was elevated (HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.34–1.63; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: In the context of primary prevention, ASCVD risk associated with Lp(a) was observed only when apoB was elevated.

### Physiological bases for the superiority of apolipoprotein B over low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^11381ncC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Relative numbers of apoB particles reveal that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are by far the most numerous, whereas chylomicron particles are the least numerous. On average, there are nine times the number of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles compared to chylomicron and chylomicron remnants combined during the postprandial period, but nine times the number of LDL particles compared to VLDL particles. Note that VLDL and LDL particles can differ in size based on the relative amounts of triglycerides and cholesterol they contain. LDL particles also vary in the mass of cholesterol, thus forming different subclasses: LDL1, LDL2, and LDL3. In Figure 2, one chylomicron and one chylomicron remnant particle are combined to accurately illustrate the relative number of apoB particles in the postprandial period. Here, apoB signifies apolipoprotein B, LDL represents low‐density lipoprotein, and VLDL indicates very low‐density lipoprotein.

At peak postprandial periods, there are 9 to 10 times as many VLDL apo B 100 particles as apo B 48 particles, and there are nine times as many LDL apoB particles as VLDL apoB particles, as shown in Figure 2. All clinically available immunoassays that measure apoB detect both apo B 48 and apo B 100. However, because there are so few apo B 48 particles relative to apo B 100 particles, there is no significant difference between fasting and postprandial apoB levels. Consequently, fasting samples are not required to measure apoB accurately.

In normotriglyceridemic subjects, 5% to 10% of total apoB particles are VLDL particles; the remainder are LDL particles.

### Data-driven multivariate population subgrouping via lipoprotein phenotypes versus apolipoprotein B in the risk assessment of coronary heart disease [^114UWC7e]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Low credibility.

Population subgrouping has been suggested as a means to improve coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment. We explored how unsupervised data-driven metabolic subgrouping, based on comprehensive lipoprotein subclass data, would work in large-scale population cohorts.

- **Methods**: We applied a self-organizing map (SOM) artificial intelligence methodology to define subgroups based on detailed lipoprotein profiles in a population-based cohort (n = 5789) and utilized the trained SOM in an independent cohort (n = 7607). We identified four SOM-based subgroups of individuals with distinct lipoprotein profiles and CHD risk and compared those to univariate subgrouping by apolipoprotein B quartiles.

- **Results**: The SOM-based subgroup with the highest concentrations for non-HDL measures had the highest risk for CHD, while the subgroup with the lowest concentrations had the lowest risk. However, apolipoprotein B quartiles produced better resolution of risk than the SOM-based subgroups and also exhibited striking dose-response behavior.

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that the majority of lipoprotein-mediated CHD risk is explained by apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein particles. Therefore, even advanced multivariate subgrouping, with comprehensive data on lipoprotein metabolism, may not advance CHD risk assessment.

### Lipoprotein(a) and atherogenesis [^111ZyD2k]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) is a major inherited risk factor for atherosclerosis. Many of its activities depend on its plasmin-like component, apolipoprotein(a). In vitro studies suggest that apolipoprotein(a) could enhance lipid deposition through binding to sites in the vessel wall, interfere with fibrinolysis, and modulate smooth muscle cell activity. Human and animal studies will be necessary to establish the physiologic importance of these mechanisms.

### Estimation of plasma apolipoprotein B concentration using routinely measured lipid biochemical tests in apparently healthy Asian adults [^1114Jd2x]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

The association between increased concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and increased rates of premature coronary heart disease has been clearly demonstrated. Recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia are largely based on treatments to decrease LDL concentration. However, a significant residual risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) often remains after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels have been treated to target.

Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) is the structural protein for atherogenic lipoproteins and facilitates the transportation of lipids from the liver to peripheral tissues. A single apo B100 molecule is present in all major atherogenic particles derived from the liver (very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL). Consequently, measurement of apoB100 provides direct information about the number of circulating atherogenic particles. Apo B100 concentration is a better measure of LDL particle number concentration and is a more reliable indicator of risk than LDL concentration. Thus, the addition of apo B100 concentration to the routine lipid profile could improve the identification of patients at risk of CVD and could enhance the management of those patients who are receiving lipid-lowering therapy.

Apo B100 measurement also improves coronary heart disease (CHD) risk prediction in people with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and apo B100 may provide a better assessment of on-treatment residual risk than LDL, providing support for the notion that the addition of apo B100 measurement to the routine lipid profile is beneficial.

### Role of the apolipoprotein B-apolipoprotein A-I ratio in cardiovascular risk assessment: a case-control analysis in EPIC-Norfolk [^112CdxN1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

An elevated apolipoprotein B-apolipoprotein A-I (apo B-apo A-I) ratio is a risk factor for future coronary artery disease (CAD). It is not known whether this ratio is better than traditional lipid values for risk assessment and prediction and whether it adds predictive value to the Framingham risk score.

- **Objective**: To evaluate whether the apo B-apo A-I ratio is associated with future CAD events independent of traditional lipid measurements and the Framingham risk score and to evaluate the ability of this ratio to predict the occurrence of future CAD.

- **Design**: Prospective, nested case-control study.

- **Setting**: Norfolk, United Kingdom.

- **Participants**: Apparently healthy men and women (45 to 79 years of age) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk. Cases (n = 869) were persons who developed fatal or nonfatal CAD. Controls (n = 1511) were persons without CAD who were matched for age, sex, and enrollment period.

- **Measurements**: Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein, and C-reactive protein levels were measured directly. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values were calculated using the Friedewald formula.

- **Results**: The apo B-apo A-I ratio was associated with future CAD events, independent of traditional lipid values (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.15 to 2.98]), including the total cholesterol-HDL cholesterol ratio, and independent of the Framingham risk score (adjusted odds ratio, 1.77 [CI, 1.31 to 2.39]). However, it did no better than lipid values at discriminating future CAD events.

### Relationship of apolipoproteins A-1 and B, and lipoprotein(a) to cardiovascular outcomes: the AIM-HIGH trial (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes) [^117FNwA1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). High credibility.

This study sought to examine the relationship between baseline and on-study apolipoproteins (apo) A-1 and B, and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels, and the development of subsequent cardiovascular (CV) events in the AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trial. Niacin has been reported to lower apoB and Lp(a) and to raise apoA-1.

Individuals with CV disease and low baseline levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were randomized to receive either simvastatin plus placebo or simvastatin plus extended-release niacin (ERN, 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day), with ezetimibe added as needed in both groups, to maintain an on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol range of 40 to 80 mg/dl. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to evaluate the relationship between levels of apoA-1, apoB, and Lp(a), and CV events in each treatment group.

- **Results**: Baseline apoB and the apoB/apoA-I ratio were significantly predictive of CV events only for the placebo group (HR: 1.17 [p = 0.018] and HR: 1.19 [p = 0.016]). Baseline and on-study Lp(a) were predictive of CV events in both simvastatin plus placebo (baseline HR: 1.24 [p = 0.002] and on-study HR: 1.21 [p = 0.017]) and the simvastatin plus ERN group (baseline HR: 1.25 [p = 0.001] and on-study HR: 1.18 [p = 0.028]). The ERN modestly increased 1-year apoA-1 (7%), decreased apoB (13%), decreased the ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio (19%), and decreased Lp(a) by 21%, but did not reduce CV events.

- **Conclusions**: Lp(a) was associated with increased CV risk.

### Age and cardiovascular risk attributable to apolipoprotein B, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^114mn8ce]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (apoB) have all been proposed as markers to quantify the atherogenic damage attributable to apoB particles. LDL-C measures the mass of cholesterol within LDL particles, whereas non-HDL-C measures the mass of cholesterol within very-low-density lipoprotein, LDL, and lipoprotein Lp(a) particles. Each of these lipoprotein particles contains one molecule of apoB. However, except for unusual circumstances such as remnant lipoprotein disorder, typically 90% of apoB particles are LDL particles. Thus, apoB is determined by LDL particle number even though apoB also includes very-low-density lipoprotein and Lp(a) particles.

Given that apoB lipoprotein particles are a major determinant of cardiovascular risk and the rapid increase in cardiovascular risk with age, one might assume that the cardiovascular risk associated with apoB particles would increase with age. However, multiple prospective epidemiological studies have shown that LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), and apoB all appear to be more potent risk factors for a coronary event for those who are 70. Nevertheless, because age is such a strong determinant of risk, the algorithms adopted by guidelines such as the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association strongly favor lowering LDL-C for the primary prevention of those over 60 compared to those under 60.

However, this practice is hard to reconcile with…

### Age and cardiovascular risk attributable to apolipoprotein B, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112N94dW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Higher concentrations of the apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoproteins increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, whether the risk associated with apoB lipoproteins varies with age has not been well examined.

- **Methods and results**: We determined the associations for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apoB, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) with myocardial infarction at different ages in 11,760 controls and 8,998 myocardial infarction cases of the INTERHEART Study. Logistic regression was used to compute the odds ratio of myocardial infarction for 1 SD change in each lipid marker by decade from 70 years of age. Except for those over 70, plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB were greater in cases than controls. However, the average levels of these markers decreased significantly as age increased. By contrast, levels of apoA-I and HDL-C were significantly greater in controls than cases but increased significantly as age increased. The cardiovascular risk associated with the atherogenic lipid markers differed at different ages. Most notably, there was a significant decline in the odds ratio for total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB with increases in age whereas the odds ratios associated with apoA-I and HDL-C were consistent across the age groups.

- **Conclusions**: These data indicate that the risk of cardiovascular events associated with apoB particles is greater in younger compared to older individuals.

### Lipoprotein(a) and cardiovascular disease [^111Rref9]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

One in five people are at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis due to high lipoprotein(a). Lipoprotein(a) concentrations are lowest in people from East Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia, intermediate in people from South Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, and highest in people from Africa. Concentrations are more than 90% genetically determined and 17% higher in post-menopausal women than in men.

Individuals at a higher cardiovascular risk should have lipoprotein(a) concentrations measured once in their lifetime to inform those with high concentrations to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and receive medication to lower other cardiovascular risk factors. With no approved drugs to lower lipoprotein(a) concentrations, it is promising that at least five drugs in development lower concentrations by 65–98%, with three currently being tested in large cardiovascular endpoint trials.

This review covers historical perspectives, physiology and pathophysiology, genetic evidence of causality, epidemiology, role in familial hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes, management, screening, diagnosis, measurement, prevention, and future lipoprotein(a)-lowering drugs.

### Age and cardiovascular risk attributable to apolipoprotein B, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^111EpiCZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

This is the first study to systematically evaluate the effects of LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apoB, HDL-C, and apoA-I on the risk of a coronary event at different ages. Overall, the ORs were higher for apoB, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C in myocardial infarction cases compared to controls. However, contrary to what might have been expected from the fact that the risk of cardiovascular events dramatically increases with age, these ORs all significantly decreased with age. We also found significant decreases in the concentrations of the three LDL-related markers of cardiovascular risk as age increased. By contrast, while there were significant increases in the concentrations of apoA-I and HDL-C at older ages, there was no significant trend in the change in ORs for apoA-I and HDL-C.

At the present time, risk is the primary criterion that has been adopted by guidelines to initiate lipid-lowering therapy to reduce the subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease. Because age is the principal determinant of risk as calculated by guideline algorithms, except for those with markedly elevated levels of LDL-C or diabetes, lipid-lowering interventions become common only after the age of 60. The evidence that even moderately lower lifelong levels of LDL-C are associated with substantially lower levels of cardiovascular events and that even moderate elevations of LDL-C and non-HDL-C, if sustained, can produce considerable 15-year cardiovascular risk, suggest that important treatment opportunities are being lost. There is no doubt, therefore, that elevated levels of the apoB lipo

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham heart study [^114pwUBa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Results indicate the following baseline characteristics: The median age of study participants was 54 years (SD, 10 years), with women comprising 55% of the cohort. The mean LDL-C level was 126.6 mg/dL, and the mean lipoprotein(a) level was 51.9 nmol/L (SD, 70.4 nmol/L). During a median follow-up period of 15 years, 394 individuals experienced their first cardiovascular disease (CVD) event.

- **Relative risks of CVD attributable to high lipoprotein(a) or high LDL‐C**: The hazard ratios (HR) for each known CVD risk factor are summarized in the study. Participants with higher lipoprotein(a) levels showed a significantly increased cardiovascular risk after adjustments for other known risk factors, including high LDL-C [lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L, HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026; LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006]. Although the multiplicative interactions between lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C were nonsignificant, they had limited statistical power. The results remained significant after corrections were made for the cholesterol content carried by lipoprotein(a).

### Existing and emerging strategies to lower lipoprotein(a) [^113GRb1B]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

Abundant evidence links elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) to higher cardiovascular risk, leaving clinicians with the challenge of what measures to take to mitigate Lp(a)-associated risk. Some therapies that may reduce cardiovascular risk, such as aspirin, statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, have little effect on Lp(a) and in some cases may even increase its concentration. Other agents that reduce levels of Lp(a), such as niacin or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have neutral or only slightly favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes.

The only currently available therapeutic approaches that lower Lp(a) and reduce cardiovascular risk are PCSK9 inhibitors and lipoprotein apheresis. For PCSK9 inhibitors, the magnitude of clinical benefit is associated with the baseline level of Lp(a) and appears to be associated with the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein(a) have the potential to reduce circulating Lp(a) concentrations by more than 70%. The results of cardiovascular outcomes trials will determine whether such substantial reductions in Lp(a) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit.

### Apolipoprotein proteomics for residual lipid-related risk in coronary heart disease [^115PkVJW]. Circulation Research (2023). Low credibility.

Currently, apolipoproteins (beyond ApoB or ApoA1) are not routinely measured when estimating the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) or broader cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is an unmet clinical need for more comprehensive apolipoprotein assays. The findings of this study highlight the utility of a single mass spectrometry (MS) assay that measures 13 apolipoproteins. This has the potential to enhance apolipoprotein profiling, facilitating the development of increasingly personalized approaches to risk management. Additionally, it may guide the use of lipid-modifying medications beyond statin therapy, which could further reduce the risk of CHD in patients with optimized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^1127qXiw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) is an apolipoprotein B–containing lipoprotein that comprises a single apolipoprotein B particle covalently bound to an apolipoprotein(a) molecule via a disulfide bond. Although a complete understanding of the role of lipoprotein(a) in humans remains elusive, it is distinct from low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and comprises a relatively small amount of the total plasma cholesterol in the LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) pool (Figure 1).

- **Figure 1: Structure of lipoprotein(a) vs LDL**. ApoB indicates apolipoprotein B; CE, cholesterol ester; FC, free cholesterol; KIV, kringle IV; LDL, low‐density lipoprotein; Lp(a), lipoprotein(a); OxPL, oxidized phospholipid; PL, phospholipid; SS, disulfide bond; and TG, triglyceride.

While efforts have been made to estimate the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) by a fixed percentage of measured lipoprotein(a) in mg/dL, data have shown that there is considerable variability in the amount of cholesterol contained within different lipoprotein(a) particles, which restricts the use of this approach in clinical practice. The structural components of lipoprotein(a) are associated with multiple pathological effects that will be discussed later in this review. In particular, lipoprotein(a) is the major carrier of oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) in human plasma that can be identified in the lipid phase and/or covalently bound to apolipoprotein(a).

Apolipoprotein(a) is encoded by the lipoprotein(a) LPA gene, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q27). LPA is expressed almost exclusively in the liver.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a potential causal genetic risk factor of cardiovascular disease: A rationale for increased efforts to understand its pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies [^112biF27]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent published studies have provided increasing evidence that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] may be a potential causal, genetic, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lp(a) levels greater than 25 mg/dl are present in approximately 30% of Caucasians and 60% to 70% of Blacks. Lp(a) is composed of apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein (a) [(apo(a)]. Circulating Lp(a) levels are primarily influenced by the LPA gene without significant dietary or environmental effects, mediating CVD risk throughout the patient's lifetime. Recent clinical outcomes studies, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization studies, in which randomization of Lp(a) levels is achieved through the random assortment of LPA gene variants thereby removing confounders, have shown that genetically determined Lp(a) levels are continuously and linearly related to the risk of CVD.

Currently, Lp(a) pathophysiology is not fully understood, and specifically targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not available. We provide a rationale for increased basic and clinical investigational efforts to further understand Lp(a) pathophysiology and assess whether reducing Lp(a) levels minimizes CVD risk. First, a detailed understanding of Lp(a) synthesis and clearance has not been realized. Second, several mechanisms of atherogenicity are known to varying extents, but the relative contributions of each are not known. Lp(a) may be atherothrombotic through its low-density lipoprotein moiety, but also through apo(a), including its ability to be retained in the vessel wall and mediate pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects, including those potential.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^112X6SCD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is among the most common genetic dyslipidemias worldwide, affecting 1 in 5 individuals, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although evidence from Mendelian randomization supports a causal role of lipoprotein(a) in CVD, limited therapeutic options exist to directly lower lipoprotein(a). Recommended strategies for the management of individuals with high lipoprotein(a) emphasize the importance of managing other risk factors, including lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) concentrations, without much supporting evidence for such an approach.

Among individuals with premature acute coronary syndromes, elevations of LDL‐C > 135 mg/dL were more frequent among patients with high lipoprotein(a), suggesting greater absolute risk when both lipoproteins were elevated. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the absolute and relative risks of incident CVD associated with elevated lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L, approximately equivalent to 50 mg/dL) in the presence of LDL‐C values above and below 135 mg/dL, prospectively in the community‐based Framingham Offspring Cohort. Given that American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association lipids guidelines also consider an LDL‐C ≥ 160 mg/dL as an optional indication for early lipid‐lowering therapy, we also evaluated whether the concomitant presence of high lipoprotein(a) with LDL‐C levels between 135 and < 160 mg/dL conferred similar CVD risk.

### Effect of evolocumab on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a): A pooled analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies [^112Ez9zp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Evolocumab effects on lowering non-HDL-C, ApoB, and Lp(a) were highly consistent across the patient populations studied, namely, hypercholesterolemia/mixed dyslipidemia, statin intolerance, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as over time and up to 5 years.

- **Effects of evolocumab, ezetimibe, and placebo on non-HDL-C, ApoB, and Lp(a)**: When both dosing regimens of evolocumab were pooled, non-HDL-C percent change from baseline at 12 weeks was −55% to −57% (placebo-corrected) and −32% to −35% (ezetimibe-corrected), in all corresponding subgroups considered. Percent change ranged from −39% to −43% in the long-term studies (1–5 years; not control-corrected). Consistent reductions of ApoB with evolocumab treatment were also observed. Percent change from baseline in ApoB at 12 weeks was −48% to −52% (placebo-corrected) and −32% to −35% (ezetimibe-corrected), in all corresponding subgroups considered. Percent change ranged from −39% to −42% in the long-term studies (not control-corrected). Across all 12-week studies, Lp(a) median percent change from baseline ranged from −21.2% to −33.3% (placebo-corrected). In long-term studies, median percent change in Lp(a) ranged from −23.8% to −33.3% (not control-corrected). Both ezetimibe and placebo had median percent changes in Lp(a) of 0.0% across all 12-week studies.
