## Question

What are the advantages of using rocuronium over succinylcholine in RSI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the advantages of rocuronium over succinylcholine for rapid sequence intubation, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why RSI is performed. Then, I should compare pharmacologic profiles and onset/duration. Next, I will examine intubation conditions and first-pass success across settings. After that, I need to evaluate safety and contraindications. I will then consider reversal strategies and post-intubation sedation logistics. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and synthesize practical advantages with caveats and dosing considerations [^1142Q8rG] [^116vSwBF] [^115dfdDd].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why we RSI. RSI is the sequential administration of a sedative-hypnotic and a neuromuscular blocker to secure the airway rapidly while minimizing aspiration risk in patients at risk, and it is indicated to optimize intubating conditions and reduce complications such as failed airways and esophageal intubation, so any comparison of NMBAs must be framed against these goals [^1142Q8rG].

> Now, I should review pharmacologic profiles carefully. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing agent with very rapid onset (about 40–60 seconds) and short duration (about 6–10 minutes), which facilitates quick recovery of spontaneous ventilation if intubation fails, whereas rocuronium is a nondepolarizing aminosteroid with dose-dependent onset and substantially longer duration; at 0.6 mg/kg, onset is about 1–2 minutes with 31 minutes of clinical relaxation, and at 1.0–1.2 mg/kg, onset approaches succinylcholine's speed but duration remains 30–90 minutes, which can be problematic if the airway is not secured promptly [^1116t5Ln] [^112hNVgC] [^112gWQGV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intubation quality. Historically, meta-analyses in elective settings found succinylcholine produced excellent intubating conditions more reliably than standard-dose rocuronium, with risk ratios around 0.86 for excellent conditions favoring succinylcholine, and this shaped early teaching that succinylcholine was the gold standard for RSI [^112gLamZ] [^111jE8Ki] [^116kQzF9]. But wait, I should verify whether this holds in emergency and critical care settings; in fact, ICU RCTs showed no difference in clinically acceptable intubation conditions or failed first attempts between succinylcholine and rocuronium, and a large prehospital RCT found rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg did not meet noninferiority for first-attempt success by a small margin (74.6% vs 79.4%), suggesting near-equivalence with a slight edge to succinylcholine in that context [^113Vsfxb] [^114q7fxC] [^115TgwoH]. I should double-check ED observational data too; large registries show no significant difference in first-pass success between agents, reinforcing that operator and airway factors often outweigh paralytic choice in real-world practice [^117VvdUx].

> Next, I should review safety and contraindications, because this is where rocuronium's advantages are most compelling. Succinylcholine carries risks of hyperkalemia (especially in burns, crush injury, denervation, renal failure), malignant hyperthermia, bradyarrhythmias, increased intracranial and intraocular pressure, and myalgias, which are particularly concerning in ICU populations with high comorbidity burdens; in contrast, rocuronium lacks these depolarization-related hazards, making it suitable when these risks are present or unknown [^112hNVgC] [^113L4fnt] [^111FWfKF]. Let me verify whether any trials directly show fewer adverse events with rocuronium; yes, randomized data comparing magnesium plus rocuronium versus succinylcholine showed significantly fewer adverse events with the rocuronium regimen, largely driven by less myalgia and histamine-release phenomena, supporting a better tolerability profile in RSI contexts [^116tkhVE] [^113kDF7u].

> I will now examine reversal and failed airway strategies. Initially, I thought sugammadex could restore spontaneous ventilation faster than succinylcholine's natural recovery, but wait, let me verify that claim; the randomized trial actually showed that after intubation, reversal of rocuronium with sugammadex restored spontaneous ventilation in a median of 216 seconds versus 406 seconds with succinylcholine, meaning faster pharmacologic reversal than waiting for succinylcholine to wear off, which is a meaningful advantage in cannot-intubate scenarios when sugammadex is immediately available and dosed correctly at 16 mg/kg [^112c66N6] [^112gWQGV]. I should confirm that guidelines acknowledge this tactical role; contemporary airway guidance includes rocuronium with sugammadex as a viable strategy in unanticipated difficult intubation algorithms, emphasizing preparedness with the correct reversal dose [^115dfdDd].

> Let me consider post-intubation sedation logistics, because prolonged paralysis without analgesia is a recognized pitfall. Rocuronium's longer duration can delay initiation of sedative-analgesic infusions, and observational ED data show longer times to sedation after rocuronium compared with succinylcholine; however, hold on, I should verify whether this is inevitable or modifiable, as more recent multicenter ED data suggest no difference in time to sedation when processes are optimized, and guidelines emphasize protocolized, pharmacist-supported workflows to mitigate delays and awareness risk with longer-acting NMBAs [^117B3p4x] [^113ZgzVG] [^112bvVXU] [^112NcRnG]. So, the delay is a systems risk rather than an intrinsic pharmacologic necessity if institutions proactively address it [^112bvVXU].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The Society of Critical Care Medicine suggests either rocuronium or succinylcholine for RSI in critically ill adults when there are no contraindications to succinylcholine, reflecting equipoise in many outcomes and the importance of patient-specific risk, while ESAIC recommends fast-acting agents such as succinylcholine 1 mg/kg or rocuronium 0.9–1.2 mg/kg for RSI, acknowledging both as acceptable standards of care [^113L4fnt] [^113aTrXN] [^116vSwBF]. I should confirm that the ASA difficult airway guidance also includes rocuronium with sugammadex as a strategy in difficult intubation pathways, reinforcing its legitimacy in contingency planning [^115dfdDd].

> I need to ensure dosing nuances are addressed. For rocuronium, higher doses of 1.0–1.2 mg/kg achieve onset times comparable to succinylcholine but at the cost of longer paralysis; in obese patients, dosing should be based on actual body weight to preserve onset and quality, and pretreatment strategies like magnesium can modestly hasten rocuronium onset without clearly improving excellent conditions versus succinylcholine in RCTs, though with fewer adverse effects than succinylcholine [^112gWQGV] [^114a57G9] [^116tkhVE] [^113kDF7u]. Let me reconsider the balance here: near-equivalent intubation performance with fewer contraindications and a reliable reversal pathway is a compelling package when systems are prepared to manage prolonged paralysis [^113Vsfxb] [^117VvdUx] [^112c66N6] [^112hNVgC].

> Putting this together, the principal advantages of rocuronium over succinylcholine for RSI are a superior safety profile without depolarization-related risks, the availability of rapid, specific reversal with sugammadex for rescue, and near-equivalent intubation performance in emergency and critical care settings when dosed adequately, albeit with a trade-off of longer paralysis that requires proactive sedation-analgesia protocols; guidelines endorse either agent, and agent selection should be individualized to contraindications, institutional resources, and airway risk, with rocuronium particularly attractive when hyperkalemia risk, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, neurologic denervation, burns, or crush injuries are present, or when sugammadex is immediately available for rescue [^113L4fnt] [^113aTrXN] [^112hNVgC] [^112c66N6].

---

Rocuronium offers several advantages over succinylcholine for RSI: **fewer contraindications** (no hyperkalemia, malignant hyperthermia, or denervation injury risks) [^113L4fnt] [^112hNVgC], **rapid reversal with sugammadex** for cannot-intubate scenarios [^112c66N6] [^112gWQGV], and a **longer duration** that maintains paralysis through multiple attempts without repeated dosing [^112hNVgC]. High-dose rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg) achieves onset comparable to succinylcholine [^116kQzF9], and modern practice increasingly favors rocuronium when succinylcholine is contraindicated or when sugammadex is available [^115tCt3k] [^111U1ZPn].

## Pharmacological properties

| **Property** | **Rocuronium** | **Succinylcholine** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset time | 60–90 seconds (1.2 mg/kg) [^114a57G9] | 30–60 seconds [^112jhhKq] |
| Duration of action | 30–90 minutes [^112hNVgC] | 3–5 minutes [^116UDpKB] |

## Clinical advantages of rocuronium

### Safety profile

- **Hyperkalemia risk**: Rocuronium does not cause hyperkalemia, making it safer for patients with renal impairment, burns, or neuromuscular disorders [^115tCt3k] [^112hNVgC].
- **Malignant hyperthermia**: Rocuronium does not trigger malignant hyperthermia, unlike succinylcholine [^113L4fnt] [^112hNVgC].
- **Cardiovascular stability**: Rocuronium has minimal cardiovascular effects, whereas succinylcholine can cause bradycardia and arrhythmias [^113L4fnt] [^112hNVgC].

---

### Reversibility

Rapid reversal with sugammadex enables **faster recovery of spontaneous ventilation** than succinylcholine's spontaneous recovery, which is advantageous in cannot-intubate scenarios [^112c66N6] [^112gWQGV].

---

### Duration of action

A **longer duration** maintains paralysis through multiple intubation attempts without redosing, whereas succinylcholine may require repeated dosing if intubation fails [^116UDpKB].

---

### Onset time

At high doses, **comparable onset** to succinylcholine is achieved with rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg, making it a viable alternative for rapid sequence intubation [^116vSwBF] [^112gWQGV].

---

## Clinical outcomes and guidelines

- **First-pass success**: Rocuronium and succinylcholine have similar first-pass intubation success rates in emergency and critical care settings [^114gehhq] [^117VvdUx].
- **Guideline support**: The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) recommends either rocuronium or succinylcholine for RSI, emphasizing patient-specific factors and contraindications [^1161PKa9] [^113aTrXN].
- **Increasing use**: Rocuronium use has increased due to its favorable safety profile and the availability of sugammadex [^111U1ZPn] [^112hNVgC].

---

## Limitations of rocuronium

- **Longer duration**: Prolonged paralysis may delay spontaneous ventilation if intubation fails, though sugammadex mitigates this [^1116t5Ln] [^112c66N6].
- **Cost**: Sugammadex is expensive and may not be universally available [^115zFiVG].
- **Allergy**: Rare allergic reactions can occur with rocuronium [^115qNEE1].

---

Rocuronium is a **valuable alternative** to succinylcholine for RSI, particularly when succinylcholine is contraindicated or when sugammadex is available. Its favorable safety profile, reversibility, and comparable onset make it an increasingly preferred choice in modern practice [^115tCt3k] [^112gWQGV] [^114q7fxC] [^112hNVgC].

### Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction intubation [^112gLamZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients often require a rapid sequence induction (RSI) endotracheal intubation technique during emergencies or electively to protect against aspiration, increased intracranial pressure, or to facilitate intubation. Traditionally succinylcholine has been the most commonly used muscle relaxant for this purpose because of its fast onset and short duration; unfortunately, it can have serious side effects. Rocuronium has been suggested as an alternative to succinylcholine for intubation. This is an update of our Cochrane review published first in 2003 and then updated in 2008 and now in 2015.

Objectives

To determine whether rocuronium creates intubating conditions comparable to those of succinylcholine during RSI intubation.

Search Methods

In our initial review we searched all databases until March 2000, followed by an update to June 2007. This latest update included searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 2 2015), and EMBASE (1988 to February 14 2015) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) relating to the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine. We included foreign language journals and handsearched the references of identified studies for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included any RCT or CCT that reported intubating conditions in comparing the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine for RSI or modified RSI in any age group or clinical setting. The dose of rocuronium was at least 0.6 mg/kg and succinylcholine was at least 1 mg/kg.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (EN and DT) independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality for the 'Risk of bias' tables. We combined the outcomes in Review Manager 5 using a risk ratio (RR) with a random-effects model.

Main Results

The previous update (2008) had identified 53 potential studies and included 37 combined for meta-analysis. In this latest update we identified a further 13 studies and included 11, summarizing the results of 50 trials including 4151 participants. Overall, succinylcholine was superior to rocuronium for achieving excellent intubating conditions: RR 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.92; n = 4151) and clinically acceptable intubation conditions (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99; n = 3992, 48 trials). A high incidence of detection bias amongst the trials coupled with significant heterogeneity provides moderate-quality evidence for these conclusions, which are unchanged from the previous update. Succinylcholine was more likely to produce excellent intubating conditions when using thiopental as the induction agent: RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.88; n = 2302, 28 trials). In the previous update, we had concluded that propofol was the superior induction agent with succinylcholine. There were no reported incidences of severe adverse outcomes. We found no statistical difference in intubation conditions when succinylcholine was compared to 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium; however, succinylcholine was clinically superior as it has a shorter duration of action.

Authors' Conclusions

Succinylcholine created superior intubation conditions to rocuronium in achieving excellent and clinically acceptable intubating conditions.

### Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction intubation [^111jE8Ki]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients requiring emergency endotracheal intubation often require a rapid sequence induction (RSI) intubation technique to protect against aspiration or increased intracranial pressure, or to facilitate intubation. Succinylcholine is the most commonly used muscle relaxant because of its fast onset and short duration; unfortunately, it can have serious side effects. Rocuronium has been suggested as an alternative to succinylcholine for intubation. This meta-analysis is an update since our initial Cochrane systematic review in 2003.

Objectives

To determine if rocuronium creates comparable intubating conditions to succinylcholine during RSI intubation. Comparisons were made based on dose of rocuronium, narcotic use, emergency versus elective intubation, age and induction agent. The primary outcome was excellent intubation conditions. The secondary outcome was acceptable conditions.

Search Strategy

In our initial systematic review we searched all databases until March 2000. We have updated that search and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2007 issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to June Week 3 2007), EMBASE (1988 to 2007 Week 26) for randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials relating to the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine. We included foreign language journals and handsearched the references of identified studies for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included all trials meeting the inclusion criteria (comparison of rocuronium and succinylcholine, main outcomes of intubation conditions).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (JP, JL or VS) independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality for allocation concealment. We combined the outcomes in RevMan using relative risk (RR) with a random-effects model.

Main Results

In our initial systematic review we identified 40 studies and included 26. In this update we identified a further 18 studies and included 11. In total, we identified 58 potential studies; 37 were combined for meta-analysis. Overall, succinylcholine was superior to rocuronium, RR 0.86 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.80 to 0.92) (n = 2690). In the group that used propofol for induction, the intubation conditions were superior with succinylcholine (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97) (n = 1183). This is contrary to our previous meta-analysis results where we reported that intubation conditions were superior in the rocuronium group when propofol was used. We found no statistical difference in intubation conditions when succinylcholine was compared to 1.2mg/kg rocuronium; however, succinylcholine was clinically superior as it has a shorter duration of action.

Authors' Conclusions

Succinylcholine created superior intubation conditions to rocuronium when comparing both excellent and clinically acceptable intubating conditions.

### Rocuronium vs. succinylcholine for rapid sequence intubation: a Cochrane systematic review [^116kQzF9]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

This systemic review was performed to determine whether rocuronium creates intubating conditions comparable to those of succinylcholine during rapid sequence intubation of the trachea. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 2 2015), and EMBASE (1988 to February 14 2015) for any randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials that reported intubating conditions comparing rocuronium and succinylcholine for rapid or modified rapid sequence intubation. The dose of rocuronium was at least 0.6 mg.kg -1 and succinylcholine was at least 1 mg.kg -1. Sixty-six studies were identified and 50 included, representing 4151 participants. Overall, succinylcholine was superior to rocuronium for achieving excellent intubating conditions (risk ratio (95%CI) 0.86 (0.81 to 0.92), n = 4151) and clinically acceptable intubation conditions (risk ratio (95%CI) 0.97 (0.95–0.99), n = 3992). A high incidence of detection bias amongst the trials coupled with significant heterogeneity means that the quality of evidence was moderate for these conclusions. Succinylcholine was more likely to produce excellent intubating conditions when using thiopental as the induction agent: risk ratio (95%CI) 0.81 (0.73–0.88), n = 2302) with or without the use of opioids (risk ratio (95%CI) 0.85 (0.78–0.93), n = 2292 or 0.85 (0.76–0.95), n = 1428).

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^114rrDHG]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The dose of rocuronium was chosen based on the best evidence available at the time of the design of the trial, that is, the Cochrane Review of 2003: For the outcome acceptable versus suboptimal intubating conditions, this review revealed no significant difference between succinylcholine and rocuronium at a dose of 0.6 to 0.7 mg/kg. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis within the propofol induction group (n = 640) for dose of rocuronium used (0.6 to 0.7 mg/kg versus 0.9 to 1.0 mg/kg) demonstrated that dose did not alter intubating conditions. Weighing the risk of prolonged neuromuscular blockade associated with higher doses of rocuronium against the lack of convincing evidence of better intubating conditions, we chose the smallest dose proven to be effective, that is, 0.6 mg/kg. However, the 2008 update of the Cochrane Review demonstrated an advantage of succinylcholine against lower (0.6 to 0.7 mg/kg), but not against higher (> 0.9 mg/kg), doses of rocuronium for the outcome acceptable versus suboptimal intubating conditions. As the difference is small (risk ratio 0.95, 95% confidence intervals 0.90 to 0.99) and, as extensively discussed above, appeared to be mainly caused by the response to intubation, we decided not to modify the protocol of our ongoing trial. Our trial demonstrates identical intubating conditions with 1 mg/kg succinylcholine and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Thus, in critically ill patients there is not an advantage in choosing higher doses of rocuronium than 0.6 mg/kg.

### Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction intubation [^115zTooz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients requiring emergent endotracheal intubation often require a rapid sequence induction intubation (RSI) technique to protect against gastric aspiration, to facilitate intubation, or to protect against increased intracranial pressure. Succinylcholine is the most common muscle relaxant used because it has a fast onset and a short duration. Unfortunately it can have serious side effects as a result of it's membrane depolarizing effect and release of potassium. Rocuronium has been suggested to create intubating conditions similar to succinylcholine. Previous studies have been underpowered to determine equivalence and there has been no previous meta-analysis performed.

Objectives

To determine if rocuronium creates comparable intubating conditions to succinylcholine during RSI intubation. Comparisons were made with succinylcholine based on the dose of rocuronium, use of a narcotic, emergent versus elective intubation, age group and the induction agent used. The primary outcome was excellent intubation conditions. A secondary outcome of clinically acceptable conditions was also performed. These were all dichotomous outcomes using cutpoints from a four point scale by Goldberg to evaluate intubation conditions.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966-March 2000), EMBASE (1988-March 2000) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENRAL) (March 2000) for randomized controlled trials (RCT) or controlled clinical trials (CCT) relating to the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine. Foreign language journals were included. References of identified studies were hand-searched for citations missed by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

All trials meeting the inclusion criteria (comparison of rocuronium and succinylcholine, one of study's main outcomes was scoring of intubation conditions) were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers for allocation concealment. The outcomes were combined using MetaView 4.1 with risk differences for all categories and RR for the excellent outcomes with a random effects model.

Main Results

40 studies were identified; 26 were combined for analysis. Overall, rocuronium was inferior to succinylcholine, with a RR = 0.87 (95%CI = 0.81 to 0.94) (N = 1606). In the group that used propofol for induction of anaesthesia, the intubation conditions were similar, with a RR = 0.96 (95%CI = 0.87 to 1.06) (N = 640). No major adverse events were reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Succinylcholine created superior intubation conditions to rocuronium when comparing excellent intubation conditions. Using the less stringent outcome, clinically acceptable intubation conditions, the two agents were not statistically different. Intubation conditions were not statistically different between succinylcholine and rocuronium when propofol was used.

### Are intubation conditions using rocuronium equivalent to those using succinylcholine? [^116jptdQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the intubation conditions created by rocuronium are equivalent to those of succinylcholine during rapid-sequence induction (RSI).

Methods

Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The search strategy included all generic and trade names for succinylcholine and rocuronium, anesthesia, neuromuscular blockade, and a validated RCT filter. Intubation conditions were a required outcome. Two reviewers assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction, and quality. Intubation conditions were scored with Goldberg's scale (excellent conditions defined as clear vocal cords, easy tube insertion, and no cough). A-priori subgroup analysis was conducted for the sedative, use of opioids, true versus modified RSI, age group, and the dose of rocuronium. Data were analyzed with Metaview 4.1 for relative risk (RR) of achieving excellent intubation conditions. A sample size calculation determined that n = 468 is required for equivalence.

Results

Forty articles were identified; ten articles were excluded by the inclusion criteria, two were duplicate publications, and two had insufficient data. Therefore, 26 studies were analyzed. Overall, rocuronium was inferior to succinylcholine, with a RR = 0.87 (95% CI = 0.81 to 0.94) (N = 1,606). However, intubation conditions were similar in the propofol subgroup, with a RR = 0.96 (95% CI = 0.87 to 1.06) (N = 640). Failed intubations (N = 28) were equivalent in the two groups.

Conclusions

Overall, succinylcholine creates excellent intubation conditions more reliably than rocuronium. If a second-line agent is required, rocuronium used with propofol creates intubation conditions equivalent to those with succinylcholine.

### Effect of rocuronium vs succinylcholine on endotracheal intubation success rate among patients undergoing out-of-hospital rapid sequence intubation: a randomized clinical trial [^115TgwoH]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Rocuronium and succinylcholine are often used for rapid sequence intubation, although the comparative efficacy of these paralytic agents for achieving successful intubation in an emergency setting has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Succinylcholine use has been associated with several adverse events not reported with rocuronium.

Objective

To assess the noninferiority of rocuronium vs succinylcholine for tracheal intubation in out-of-hospital emergency situations.

Design, Setting and Participants

Multicenter, single-blind, noninferiority randomized clinical trial comparing rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg) with succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) for rapid sequence intubation in 1248 adult patients needing out-of-hospital tracheal intubation. Enrollment occurred from January 2014 to August 2016 in 17 French out-of-hospital emergency medical units. The date of final follow-up was August 31, 2016.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to undergo tracheal intubation facilitated by rocuronium (n = 624) or succinylcholine (n = 624).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the intubation success rate on first attempt. A noninferiority margin of 7% was chosen. A per-protocol analysis was prespecified as the primary analysis.

Results

Among 1248 patients who were randomized (mean age, 56 years; 501 [40.1%] women), 1230 (98.6%) completed the trial and 1226 (98.2%) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The number of patients with successful first-attempt intubation was 455 of 610 (74.6%) in the rocuronium group vs 489 of 616 (79.4%) in the succinylcholine group, with a between-group difference of -4.8% (1-sided 97.5% CI, -9% to ∞), which did not meet criteria for noninferiority. The most common intubation-related adverse events were hypoxemia (55 of 610 patients [9.0%]) and hypotension (39 of 610 patients [6.4%]) in the rocuronium group and hypoxemia (61 of 616 [9.9%]) and hypotension (62 of 616 patients [10.1%]) in the succinylcholine group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients undergoing endotracheal intubation in an out-of-hospital emergency setting, rocuronium, compared with succinylcholine, failed to demonstrate noninferiority with regard to first-attempt intubation success rate.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^114q7fxC]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The adverse effect profile of succinylcholine is of concern and some authors even considered its use in the ICU as obsolete. Optimal intubation conditions, a short intubation sequence, and the return of spontaneous respiratory activity within 5 to 10 minutes are the main arguments of the proponents of the use of succinylcholine in the ICU. The present study is the first formal comparison of succinylcholine and rocuronium in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial in critically ill patients. Our results demonstrate that in emergent intubations in intensive care 1) the incidence and severity of hypoxaemia does not differ between rocuronium and succinylcholine; 2) intubating conditions do not differ between rocuronium and succinylcholine; 3) the advantage of succinylcholine with regard to the length of the intubation sequence is markedly reduced to a difference of questionable clinical significance; and 4) the incidence of failed intubation attempts does not differ between rocuronium and succinylcholine. Lee et al. reported that the reversal of profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex was significantly faster than spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine. Taking together its favourable safety profile, the availability of a rapid-acting antagonist, and our present results, rocuronium appears to be more than a suitable alternative to succinylcholine for emergent RSI intubations in acutely ill patients.

Introduction

Endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients is a high risk procedure containing the danger of hypoxia and cardiovascular collapse. The method of choice for emergency intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a rapid sequence induction (RSI). Because of its fast onset, succinylcholine is the most commonly used neuromuscular blocking drug in RSI. Due to its depolarizing mechanism of action resulting in an increase in extracellular potassium, succinylcholine is contraindicated in a number of circumstances and diseases frequently present in critically ill patients. Rocuronium has the most rapid onset of the currently available non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. As the only contraindication to rocuronium is the very rare occasion of allergy, this agent is regarded as an attractive alternative to succinylcholine. Assessing current clinical practice by analyzing large contemporary trials reveals a wide variation in the use of rocuronium or succinylcholine for RSI in the ICU. However, neither agent has been so far tested against each other or any other neuromuscular blocking agent in an adequately powered randomized trial in critically ill patients.

Compared to succinylcholine, rocuronium is associated with less optimal intubation conditions and a longer intubation sequence in the operating theatre. As the most frequent complication of RSI in the ICU is severe hypoxemia the combination of less optimal intubation conditions and longer intubation sequence may be of relevance. Given the low rate of hypoxemia during RSI in the operating theatre, available studies are underpowered for this outcome. The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was, therefore, to compare the incidence of hypoxemia after rocuronium or succinylcholine in critically ill patients requiring an emergent RSI.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^111p6WYC]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

During emergent intubations in the operating theatre, succinylcholine allowed for a 35 sec earlier completion of the intubation sequence than rocuronium. In the present study involving critically ill patients, this favorable effect of succinylcholine was reduced to 14 sec, that is, to approximately 15% of the total length of the intubation sequence with rocuronium. In almost 40% of our patients visible fasciculations had not occurred or had not ceased within 45 sec after the injection of succinylcholine, and, according to study protocol, laryngoscopy was started in these patients at the same time as in the rocuronium group. To the best of our knowledge, a delayed onset of succinylcholine-induced fasciculations in critically ill patients has not been reported so far. As severe illness may have a profound effect on the neuromuscular system it is tempting to speculate that the severity of underlying illness is responsible for the difference in the onset of fasciculations and, hence, the reduced advantage of succinylcholine with regard to rapid completion of the intubation sequence between patients in the operating theatre and patients in intensive care.

A limitation of this trial is the lack of a double-blind design. However, masking the effects of drugs like succinylcholine that have visible effects (fasciculations) is inherently difficult. A RSI in critically ill patients is a high-risk procedure requiring the full attention of an appropriately trained physician. Since in our settings the simultaneous achievement of perfect blinding and optimal patient safety was not feasible, we opted for a single-blind study design. Using experienced operators and a checklist (containing all relevant aspects recently found to decrease complications related to intubation in intensive care), every effort was made to protect the patients' safety. Thus, our results are not necessarily generalisible to settings with less stringent procedural guidelines and/or less experienced operators. Our findings were obtained with an induction sequence of fentanyl and propofol or etomidate and cannot be extrapolated to other drugs and/or doses.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^113Vsfxb]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Succinylcholine and rocuronium are widely used to facilitate rapid sequence induction (RSI) intubation in intensive care. Concerns relate to the side effects of succinylcholine and to slower onset and inferior intubation conditions associated with rocuronium. So far, succinylcholine and rocuronium have not been compared in an adequately powered randomized trial in intensive care. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of hypoxemia after rocuronium or succinylcholine in critically ill patients requiring an emergent RSI.

Methods

This was a prospective randomized controlled single-blind trial conducted from 2006 to 2010 at the University Hospital of Basel. Participants were 401 critically ill patients requiring emergent RSI. Patients were randomized to receive 1 mg/kg succinylcholine or 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium for neuromuscular blockade. The primary outcome was the incidence of oxygen desaturations defined as a decrease in oxygen saturation ≥ 5%, assessed by continuous pulse oxymetry, at any time between the start of the induction sequence and two minutes after the completion of the intubation. A severe oxygen desaturation was defined as a decrease in oxygen saturation ≥ 5% leading to a saturation value of ≤ 80%.

Results

There was no difference between succinylcholine and rocuronium regarding oxygen desaturations (succinylcholine 73/196; rocuronium 66/195; P = 0.67); severe oxygen desaturations (succinylcholine 20/196; rocuronium 20/195; P = 1.0); and extent of oxygen desaturations (succinylcholine -14 ± 12%; rocuronium -16 ± 13%; P = 0.77). The duration of the intubation sequence was shorter after succinycholine than after rocuronium (81 ± 38 sec versus 95 ± 48 sec; P = 0.002). Intubation conditions (succinylcholine 8.3 ± 0.8; rocuronium 8.2 ± 0.9; P = 0.7) and failed first intubation attempts (succinylcholine 32/200; rocuronium 36/201; P = 1.0) did not differ between the groups.

Conclusions

In critically ill patients undergoing emergent RSI, incidence and severity of oxygen desaturations, the quality of intubation conditions, and incidence of failed intubation attempts did not differ between succinylcholine and rocuronium.

### Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation: a prospective, randomized trial in emergent cases [^111wnYha]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

When anesthesia is induced with propofol in elective cases, endotracheal intubation conditions are not different between succinylcholine and rocuronium approximately 60 s after the injection of the neuromuscular relaxant. In the present study, we investigated whether, in emergent cases, endotracheal intubation conditions obtained at the actual moment of intubation under succinylcholine differ from those obtained 60 s after the injection of rocuronium. One-hundred-eighty adult patients requiring rapid sequence induction of anesthesia for emergent surgery received propofol (1.5 mg/kg) and either rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg; endotracheal intubation 60 s after injection) or succinylcholine (1 mg/kg; endotracheal intubation as soon as possible). The time from beginning of the induction until completion of the intubation was shorter after the administration of succinylcholine than after rocuronium (median time 95 s versus 130 s; P < 0.0001). Endotracheal intubation conditions, rated with a 9-point scale, were better after succinylcholine administration than after rocuronium (8.6 ± 1.1 versus 8.0 ± 1.5; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in patients with poor intubation conditions (7 versus 12) or in patients with failed first intubation attempt (4 versus 5) between the groups. We conclude that during rapid sequence induction of anesthesia in emergent cases, succinylcholine allows for a more rapid endotracheal intubation sequence and creates superior intubation conditions compared with rocuronium.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^116GZBji]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

During the course of an emergent intubation the incidence and severity of oxygen desaturations did not differ between critically ill patients undergoing RSI with succinylcholine and those undergoing RSI with rocuronium as the neuromuscular blocking agent. The mean intubation sequence was 14 sec shorter after succinylcholine than after rocuronium. Succinylcholine and rocuronium resulted in similar intubation conditions and a similar incidence of intubation related complications.

A recent Cochrane Review demonstrated that for a RSI succinylcholine created better intubation conditions than rocuronium. However, all patients included in the Cochrane Review were intubated in the operating theatre. Conditions in intensive care and in the emergency department may differ in several important aspects from those in the operating theatre (for example, severity of patients' illness, limited possibility to perform a pre-intubation airway assessment, less ideal ergonomic conditions) so that findings from one setting are not necessarily applicable to the other. Particularly, the incidence of relevant intubation-related complications is very small in the operating theatre so that available studies are underpowered for these outcomes. In keeping with previous work, the present study demonstrates that emergent intubations in intensive care are associated with a high rate of immediate and potentially life-threatening complications like oxygen desaturations and failed intubation attempts.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^116tkhVE]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Succinylcholine remains the muscle relaxant of choice for rapid sequence induction (RSI) but has many adverse effects. High-dose rocuronium bromide may be an alternative to succinylcholine for RSI but recovery times are nearly doubled compared with a standard intubating dose of rocuronium. Magnesium sulfate significantly shortens the onset time of a standard intubating dose of rocuronium. We set out to investigate whether intravenous (IV) pretreatment with MgSO 4 followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium achieved superior intubation conditions compared with succinylcholine.

METHODS:

Adults were randomized to receive a 15-minute IV infusion of MgSO 4 (60 mg·kg –1) immediately before RSI with propofol 2 mg·kg –1, sufentanil 0.2 μg·kg – 1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1, or a matching 15-minute IV infusion of saline immediately before an identical RSI, but with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1. Primary end point was the rate of excellent intubating conditions 60 seconds after administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent and compared between groups using multivariable log-binomial regression model. Secondary end points were blood pressure and heart rate before induction, before and after intubation, and adverse events up to 24 hours postoperatively.

RESULTS:

Among 280 randomized patients, intubating conditions could be analyzed in 259 (133 MgSO 4 -rocuronium and 126 saline-succinylcholine). The rate of excellent intubating conditions was 46% with MgSO 4 -rocuronium and 45% with saline-succinylcholine. The analysis adjusted for gender and center showed no superiority of MgSO 4 -rocuronium compared with saline-succinylcholine (relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.39, P = .659). The rate of excellent intubating conditions was higher in women (54% [70 of 130]) compared with men (37% [48 of 129]; adjusted RR 1.42, 95% CI, 1.07–1.91, P = .017). No significant difference between groups was observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Mean heart rate was significantly higher in the MgSO 4 -rocuronium group. The percentage of patients with at least 1 adverse event was lower with MgSO 4 -rocuronium (11%) compared with saline-succinylcholine (28%) (RR 0.38, 95% CI, 0.22–0.66, P < .001). With saline-succinylcholine, adverse events consisted mainly of postoperative muscle pain (n = 26 [19%]) and signs of histamine release (n = 13 [9%]). With MgSO 4 -rocuronium, few patients had pain on injection, nausea and vomiting, or skin rash during the MgSO 4 -infusion (n = 5 [4%]).

CONCLUSIONS:

IV pretreatment with MgSO 4 followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium did not provide superior intubation conditions to succinylcholine but had fewer adverse effects.

### Rocuronium vs. succinylcholine in the emergency department: a critical appraisal [^115tCt3k]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Two methods of paralysis are available for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department (ED): depolarizing agents such as succinylcholine, and non-depolarizing drugs such as rocuronium. Rocuronium is a useful alternative when succinylcholine is contraindicated. Contraindications to succinylcholine include allergy, history of malignant hyperthermia, denervation syndromes, and patients who are 24–48 h post burn or crush injury. Non-depolarizing drugs have the advantage of causing less pain due to post-paralysis myalgias.

Clinical Question

Can rocuronium replace succinylcholine as the paralytic of choice for RSI in the ED?

Evidence Review

Four relevant studies were selected from an evidence search and a structured review performed.

Results

For the outcomes of clinically acceptable intubation conditions and time to onset, the two agents were not statistically significantly different. Succinylcholine seems to produce conditions that have higher satisfaction scores.

Conclusion

Succinylcholine remains the drug of choice for ED RSI unless there is a contraindication to its usage.

Adults were randomized to receive a 15-minute IV infusion of MgSO4 (60 mg·kg-1) immediately before RSI with propofol 2 mg·kg-1, sufentanil 0.2 μg·kg-1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg-1, or a matching 15-minute IV infusion of saline immediately before an identical RSI, but with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg-1. Primary end point was the rate of excellent intubating conditions 60 seconds after administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent and compared between groups using multivariable log-binomial regression model. Secondary end points were blood pressure and heart rate before induction, before and after intubation, and adverse events up to 24 hours postoperatively.

Results

Among 280 randomized patients, intubating conditions could be analyzed in 259 (133 MgSO4-rocuronium and 126 saline-succinylcholine). The rate of excellent intubating conditions was 46% with MgSO4-rocuronium and 45% with saline-succinylcholine.

Conclusions

IV pretreatment with MgSO4 followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium did not provide superior intubation conditions to succinylcholine but had fewer adverse effects.

### The optimal dose of succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114g6F3z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a quantitative systematic review following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and according to Cochrane methodology. A PRISMA checklist is available as a supplement (Table S1).

Systematic search and study selection

Two authors (MG, AP) searched three electronic databases (PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE) from inception to 15 February 2019 using a variety of high-sensitivity and low-specificity search strategies. Details of the search strategy for PubMed are available as a supplement (Methods S1). There was no language restriction. Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked for further potentially relevant publications (backward snowballing). Retrieved articles were screened by three authors (CC, AP, MG). Discrepancies and queries for inclusion were resolved through consensus. If agreement could not be reached, discrepancies were discussed with the fourth author (MRT).

Inclusion and non-inclusion criteria

We included full reports of RCTs performed in adults (≥ 18 years) undergoing surgery that compared any experimental regimen of succinylcholine with the standard regimen, 1.0 mg kg − 1, for RSI. We included studies that tested a 'true' or a 'modified' RSI procedure. A true procedure involves intravenous induction with a hypnotic, intravenous administration of succinylcholine immediately (i.e. without any delay) after loss of consciousness, an apnoea period of no more than 60 s followed by orotracheal intubation. A modified RSI procedure is different in that the delay between loss of consciousness and the administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent is longer and allows, for instance, the additional recording of electromyographic baseline measures. During this time period, the patient is usually ventilated and oxygenated through a facemask. However, as with true RSI, after administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent, the apnoea period before orotracheal intubation is lasting no longer than 60 s.

Eligible trials had to report on intubating conditions using a validated score that evaluated ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord position and movement, airway reaction, and movement of limbs. We did not consider studies including obese patients for two reasons. Firstly, obesity is an independent risk factor of difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Secondly, the best succinylcholine regimen in obese patients remains controversial. Data from non-randomized trials, paediatric studies, abstracts, and trials that lacked a succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg − 1 group were also not taken into account.

### Rapid sequence induction with rocuronium-a challenge to the gold standard [^113vo68z]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Succinylcholine has been indicted on account of the diverse risks associated with its administration, which include hyperkalemia, vagal arrest, and malignant hyperthermia. However, it provides excellent intubating conditions reliably and quickly, characteristics that sustain its appeal for use in the intensive care unit, where airway management is challenging. There is an increasing body of evidence, outlined here, that rocuronium is an acceptable alternative to succinylcholine.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^116u6fjd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We designed this trial as a superiority study. Therefore, the methodologically correct interpretation of the data must be that for RSI, a combination of IV magnesium pretreatment 60 mg·kg –1 followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg·kg –1) does not provide superior intubating conditions compared with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1, but might be an alternative to succinylcholine in circumstances where succinylcholine administration is not warranted. A randomized study with a noninferiority design and with a larger cohort should be carried out to investigate whether a magnesium-rocuronium combination provides intubation conditions that are not inferior to succinylcholine. Furthermore, a gender effect should be investigated.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^113xzWqv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participant Flow

In total, 280 patients were randomized between September 20, 2012, and July 9, 2015 (magnesium-rocuronium [141 patients]; saline-succinylcholine [139 patients]) (Figure). In 21 patients (magnesium-rocuronium [8 patients]; saline-succinylcholine [13 patients]), the primary end point could not be analyzed for various reasons (Figure). Eventually, 259 patients (magnesium-rocuronium [133 patients]; saline-succinylcholine [126 patients]) were included in the primary end point analysis.

Characteristics of the Study Population

The demographic characteristics of both groups were similar (Table 2); 50% of patients were women.

Primary End Point: Evaluation of Intubating Conditions

No significant difference was observed in the percentage of excellent intubating conditions between both groups (magnesium-rocuronium 46% [61 of 133]; saline-succinylcholine 45% [57 of 126]), although ease of laryngoscopy was more often graded excellent with magnesium-rocuronium (Table 3). Multivariable analysis adjusted for gender and center showed no superiority of magnesium-rocuronium on the rate of excellent intubating conditions (relative risk [RR] for magnesium-rocuronium compared with saline-succinylcholine 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.39; p = 0.659) (Table 4). The overall rate of excellent intubating conditions was higher in women (54% [70 of 130]) compared with men (37% [48 of 129]; adjusted RR 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07–1.91; p = 0.017).

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^114emnpV]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Secondary outcomes

More than one intubation attempt was required in 32/200 patients under succinylcholine and in 36/201 patients under rocuronium (P = 0.4; Table 3). In 77/200 (39%) patients of the succinylcholine group fasciculations were not visible or had not ceased 45 sec after the injection of the drug. Figure 3 depicts the duration of the intubation sequence which was significantly shorter (P = 0.002) in the succinylcholine group (81 ± 38 sec) than in the rocuronium group (95 ± 48 sec). Intubation was not completed within 90 sec in 50/200 patients under succinylcholine and 67/201 patients under rocuronium (P = 0.048). Qualitative scores of intubation conditions are shown in Figure 4. The numerical sub-scores for ease of laryngoscopy (succinylcholine 2.75 ± 0.45; rocuronium 2.75 ± 0.46; P = 0.84) and conditions of the vocal cords (succinylcholine 2.61 ± 0.52; rocuronium 2.67 ± 0.56; P = 0.32) did not differ between the groups while there was a small, but significant difference in the sub-score of the response to intubation (succinylcholine 2.97 ± 0.20; rocuronium 2.86 ± 0.36; P = 0.001). The overall numerical score for intubation conditions (succinylcholine 8.3 ± 0.8; rocuronium 8.2 ± 0.9; P = 0.7) did not differ between the groups. There was no difference between the groups in the incidence of hemodynamic consequences of intubation (Table 4).

### Rapid sequence induction and intubation with rocuronium-sugammadex compared with succinylcholine: a randomized trial [^112c66N6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

An unanticipated difficult airway may arise during rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII). The aim of the trial was to assess how rapidly spontaneous ventilation could be re-established after RSII. We hypothesized that the time period from tracheal intubation to spontaneous ventilation would be shorter with rocuronium-sugammadex than with succinylcholine.

Methods

This randomized and patient- and observer-blinded trial was approved by the regional Ethics Committee and the Danish Medicines Agency. We included elective surgical patients undergoing general anaesthesia for RSII using alfentanil (10 µg kg(-1)), propofol (2 mg kg(-1)), and either succinylcholine (1 mg kg(-1)) or rocuronium (1 mg kg(-1)). Sugammadex (16 mg kg(-1)) was given in the rocuronium group after tracheal intubation. The primary endpoint was the time from correct placement of the tracheal tube to spontaneous ventilation, defined as a respiratory rate of more than 8 bpm and a tidal volume of at least 3 mL kg(-1) for 30 s.

Results

We included 61 patients; of whom, 55 were evaluated for the primary endpoint. The median time from tracheal intubation to spontaneous ventilation was 406 s with succinylcholine and 216 s with rocuronium-sugammadex (P = 0.002). The median time from tracheal intubation to 90% recovery of the first twitch in train-of-four (T(1) 90%) was 518 s with succinylcholine and 168 s with rocuronium-sugammadex (P < 0.0001). Intubation conditions and time to tracheal intubation were not significantly different.

Conclusions

RSII with rocuronium followed by reversal with sugammadex allowed earlier re-establishment of spontaneous ventilation than with succinylcholine.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^116q9yGL]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does a combination of magnesium sulfate pretreatment followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg·kg –1) produce superior intubation conditions to succinylcholine?
Findings: For rapid sequence induction, a combination of pretreatment with magnesium sulfate followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium does not provide superior intubating conditions compared with succinylcholine but has fewer adverse effects.
Meaning: In view of our findings, we hypothesize that for rapid sequence induction, a combination of pretreatment with magnesium sulfate and a standard intubating dose of rocuronium might be an alternative to succinylcholine in circumstances where succinylcholine administration is not warranted.

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a frequently used procedure for endotracheal intubation in the emergency setting or in unfasted patients who are at risk of regurgitation. Succinylcholine remains the muscle relaxant of choice for RSI, but it has many adverse effects. There are alternatives that may be used instead of succinylcholine. For instance, with a high dose of rocuronium bromide, 1.0–1.2 mg·kg –1, the same intubating conditions with a similar onset time as with succinylcholine may be achieved. Also, pretreatment with intravenous (IV) magnesium may accelerate onset time of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. – The main problem with high dose nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents is prolonged recovery time. Today, this might not be perceived as a major problem as even deep, rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block can be antagonized with sugammadex. But in many countries, sugammadex is not available or its use is restricted due to its high costs and strategies to reduce its usage are welcomed. On the contrary, the role of magnesium in perioperative medicine is constantly increasing due to its analgesic and morphine sparing properties, neuroprotective features, and its potency to decrease overall anesthetic requirements. This begs the question as to whether a standard intubating dose of, for instance, rocuronium, combined with magnesium, differs with regard to onset times and intubation conditions compared with succinylcholine. With a 15-minute IV infusion of magnesium sulfate 60 mg·kg –1 before a standard dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg·kg –1), the onset time of the neuromuscular block was reduced by about 35% (from 120 to 72 seconds), but recovery was only prolonged by 25%. In addition, the interindividual variability in the onset of the neuromuscular blockade was lessened with this magnesium-rocuronium regimen, suggesting that the predictability of adequate intubating conditions was improved. We designed a randomized controlled trial to compare a combination of magnesium with a standard intubating dose of rocuronium with succinylcholine in patients undergoing RSI. We chose a superiority trial design.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^113Ai91j]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Material and methods

Design

This is a prospective randomized controlled single-blind trial. The trial is registered, ClinicalTrials.gov, number.

Setting

The trial took place in the medical and surgical ICUs of the University Hospital of Basel, a tertiary care center.

Patients

All adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients requiring emergent endotracheal intubation with a RSI were eligible. The indication for intubation was made by the staff physician in charge of the patient's care. Patients could be included only once in the trial. Exclusion criteria were contraindications against succinylcholine (that is, hyperkalemia, neuromuscular diseases, denervation of muscles, tetraplegia, long-term immobilization, extensive muscle trauma, burns, familial history of malignant hyperthermia), allergy to rocuronium, pregnancy, known or anticipated difficult intubation warranting awake fiberoptic intubation, and absence of a qualified study physician to perform the intubation. Patients excluded from the study because of the absence of a qualified study physician and those erroneously included more than once were included in a registry. Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were calculated for each patient based on the 24 hours preceding intubation.

The study was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the regional Ethics Committee (Ethikkommission beider Basel, Basel, Switzerland). Because critically ill patients requiring an emergent intubation are typically unable to give informed consent, the regional Ethics Committee granted a waiver of consent prior to the intubation. Instead, investigators were obliged to inform relatives and obtain written informed consent from patients as soon as feasible.

### Intubation conditions and neonatal outcomes with rocuronium versus suxamethonium in cesarean sections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111FWfKF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple trials comparing the safety and efficacy of both agents have reported conflicting outcomes. Some studies reported ROC as non-inferior in achieving rapid sequence induction intubation, whereas another reported succinylcholine superiority. This conflict is mostly related to the variation of ROC dose, use of opioids and hypnotics. Hwang et al. found that administering a high dose of ROC 1 mg/kg did not result in any maternal or fetal adverse effects compared to the conventional dose of 0.6 mg/kg. However, other studies reported a statistically significant decrease in the 1-minute Apgar score with the high dose of ROC (1 mg/kg). Authors of another trial recommended even a higher dose of ROC 1.2 mg/kg reversed with Sugammadex 4 mg/kg. However, this was a small, uncontrolled investigation with limited neonatal outcome data.

Our results indicate that SUX may have advantages over ROC in certain aspects of anesthesia management during CS. Notably, the time from induction to clamping the umbilical cord was significantly shorter with SUX, which could be clinically important in minimizing fetal exposure to anesthetic agents. However, the time from incision to delivery and surgery duration show no significant differences between ROC and SUX.

Intubation conditions, a critical factor in the safety and efficacy of anesthesia, showed a mixed picture. Our analysis revealed that SUX was associated with better odds of achieving excellent intubation conditions, but ROC was linked to better odds of achieving good intubation conditions, respectively (Fig. 7 A and B). Additionally, the odds of poor intubation conditions did not differ significantly between the ROC and SUX groups (Fig. 7 C). This suggests that while SUX might be preferred for optimal intubation, ROC remains a viable alternative, especially when SUX is contraindicated. Succinylcholine is known advantageous for rapid RSI because of its quick onset (40–60 s) and short duration of action (6–10 min) compared to ROC longer onset (60–120 s) and a significantly longer duration of action (30–67 min).

### The optimal dose of succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^11551KTJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Succinylcholine, also known as suxamethonium, has been introduced into anaesthesia practice in the early 1950s. Still today, it remains one of the most commonly used neuromuscular blocking agents for rapid sequence induction (RSI) because of its fast onset and short duration of action. The "cannot intubate, cannot ventilate" scenario is a threat of airway management. Therefore, clinicians are inclined to administer the minimally effective dose of succinylcholine that is meant to provide excellent intubating conditions but that provokes only a short apnoea time. The widely recommended standard intubating regimen of succinylcholine has been 1.0 mg kg − 1, although the scientific basis of that specific regimen remains unclear. Indeed, a dose of 1.0 mg kg − 1 corresponds to almost four times the ED95, which is unusual for a neuromuscular blocking agent.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to determine the optimal regimen of succinylcholine for RSI. In this context, the optimal regimen was defined as the mg per kg bodyweight regimen that provided the highest likelihood of excellent intubating conditions, the lowest risk of unacceptable intubating conditions, and the shortest apnoea time compared with the gold standard regimen. As 1.0 mg kg − 1 has been reported to be the gold standard in this context, we compared all alternative, experimental regimens with that gold standard regimen.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^113CHZgq]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to the majority of studies performed in the operating theatre, the present study demonstrated no difference in intubation conditions between succinylcholine and rocuronium. In emergency department RSI, Lauren et al. reported that succinylcholine resulted in less body movements as a reaction to intubation than rocuronium, while there was no difference between the two drugs with regard to the degree of vocal cord movements. In emergent RSI in the operating theatre, Sluga et al. reported that the difference in the overall intubation scores between succinylcholine and rocuronium was entirely due to a difference in the sub-score assessing the intubation response, that is, limb movements and/or coughing, while there was no difference in the remaining sub-scores assessing the ease of laryngoscopy or the conditions of the vocal cords. The previous finding of similar sub-scores for laryngoscopy and vocal cords is confirmed by our results. As limb movements and/or coughing were only rarely observed in the present study, sub-scores for the intubation response were very high in both groups and did not result in a difference in the overall score for intubation conditions. This absent response to intubation in the majority of critically ill patients is most likely due to the severity of the underlying illness. Based on the present results and previous findings we propose that the difference reported for intubation conditions between succinylcholine and rocuronium results entirely from a difference in the response to intubation, an event occurring after the completion of the intubation with marginal relevance for patients' safety. By contrast, succinylcholine and rocuronium do not differ in two aspects of intubation conditions highly relevant for patients' safety - the ease of laryngoscopy and the conditions of the vocal cords.

Alternatively, the outcome "unacceptable intubating conditions" may be regarded as the most relevant in the context of RSI (Fig. 3). Contrary to the outcome "excellent intubating conditions", the result was much more dichotomous; regimens below 0.5 mg kg − 1 were clearly less efficacious compared with the gold standard, 1 mg kg − 1, whereas regimens above 0.5 mg kg − 1 were no different from 1 mg kg − 1. Based on this outcome, it may be deduced that regimens below 0.5 mg kg − 1 should be avoided for RSI. Interestingly, with the gold standard regimen 1 mg kg − 1, the incidence of "unacceptable intubating conditions" showed much less variability between trials (0% to 6.7%) compared with the outcome "excellent intubating conditions". This suggests that indirect comparisons between different succinylcholine regimens are more reliable when the outcome "unacceptable intubating conditions" is chosen. It also suggests that the outcome "unacceptable intubating conditions" is not ideal to test various degrees of efficacy of experimental regimens compared with the gold standard regimen; with regimens above 0.6 mg kg − 1, unacceptable intubating conditions were virtually absent.

Additionally to the outcomes "excellent" and "unacceptable" intubating conditions, apnoea time may be used for rational decision-making (Fig. 4). With regimens below 0.8 mg kg − 1, median apnoea times became constantly shorter, and consequently, mean differences compared with the gold standard regimen increased. There is thus an argument in favour of using lower than standard succinylcholine regimens for RSI. This must however be weighted against the increased risk of having less often excellent intubating conditions and more frequently unacceptable intubating conditions. Data on apnoea times with regimens above 1 mg kg − 1 were lacking. Thus, clinically relevant prolongation of apnoea times with 1.5 or 2.0 mg kg − 1 needs to be formally shown. Also, the primary factor determining return of spontaneous respiration may not be the depth of neuromuscular block, but the degree of centrally mediated respiratory depression induced by the opioids and hypnotics used for induction of anaesthesia.

### A comparison of succinylcholine and rocuronium for rapid-sequence intubation of emergency department patients [^112jhhKq]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare rocuronium and succinylcholine for rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A one-year prospective cohort comparison study was performed using a data collection form completed at the time of intubation. Data collected included the reason for the neuromuscular-blocking agent (NMBA) chosen, the time to onset of paralysis, and any complications encountered. Three ten-point numerical descriptor scales recorded the degree of body movement, vocal cord movement, and the physician's overall satisfaction with the extent of paralysis.

Results

Succinylcholine was used in 382 patients and rocuronium was used in 138 (26% of all RSI) patients. The mean (± SD) times of onset of succinylcholine and rocuronium were 39 ± 13 sec and 44 ± 20 sec, respectively (p = 0.04). No patient desaturated and required assisted ventilations while waiting for paralysis to occur. Types of body movements were similar with the two agents, but less frequent with succinylcholine (median = 10, mean = 9.5 ± 1.1) than rocuronium (median = 10, mean = 9.1 ± 1. 5) (p = 0.01). Vocal cord movements were similar for succinylcholine (median = 10, mean = 9.2 ± 1.6) and rocuronium (median = 9, mean = 9.0 ± 1.6) (p = 0.15). The physician's overall satisfaction with the extent of paralysis was also higher for succinylcholine (median = 10, mean = 9.4 ± 1.3) than rocuronium (median = 10, mean = 8.8 ± 2.0) (p < 0.01). Only one complication, widening of the QRS complex secondary to succinylcholine use in a patient with unsuspected hyperkalemia, could be attributed to the choice of NMBA.

Conclusions

Both succinylcholine and rocuronium produced fast and reliable paralysis for RSI. Although succinylcholine had a faster onset and provided more relaxation, the difference had no clinical significance. Approximately a fourth of ED RSI patients qualified for use of rocuronium using these high-risk criteria.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^115nJZcT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Demographic characteristics were described as numbers of patients and percentages for qualitative data and as means and standard deviations for quantitative data. Intubating conditions were described as numbers of patients and percentages, and hemodynamic measurements as means and standard deviations. All data were described overall and by group of randomization. Due to the stratified randomization, the comparison of excellent intubating conditions between groups was performed using a log-binomial regression model adjusting for gender and center (and no interaction term). Similarly, between-group differences on secondary end points were assessed using linear regression models adjusting for gender and center. For the 3 variables of intubating conditions, both groups were compared using χ 2 test. The saline-succinylcholine group was used as a reference group for the calculation of relative risk.

The rate of excellent intubating conditions between groups stratified by gender, and by gender and center, were also compared using χ 2 test. In addition to the stratified analyses, we estimated interaction terms to test the differences in effects between subgroups of patients. Subgroup analyses should be regarded as explorative only since they were not described in the study protocol and they have low statistical power.

Two-sided P < .05 were considered significant for all analyses. There was no adjustment of P values to account for multiple comparisons. Analyses were performed using R software (Vienna, Austria;).

Sample Size Determination

This trial was designed as a superiority study. We tested the hypothesis that for RSI, a combination of magnesium with a standard intubating dose of rocuronium was superior to succinylcholine. Sample size was calculated by taking the level of statistical significance as α = .05 (2-sided) and β = .1. To test the primary hypothesis that the rate of excellent intubating conditions was higher (80%) with magnesium-rocuronium compared with succinylcholine (60%), we needed 110 patients in each group. We intended to randomize 2 times 140 patients in each group to allow for dropouts. The total number of patients necessary for inclusion was therefore 280.

### Newer agents for rapid sequence intubation: etomidate and rocuronium [^112BkxjZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The emergency airway management of children and adolescents with critical illnesses may necessitate rapid sequence intubation with a sedating and a neuromuscular blocking agent. Etomidate and rocuronium have become increasingly popular for the sedation and paralysis, respectively, of pediatric patients in rapid sequence intubation, and there are many advantages to the use of both agents. Both etomidate and rocuronium have a rapid onset of action, and both agents are relatively free of hemodynamic adverse effects. Etomidate does, however, suppress adrenal function, and consequently, its use in patients with septic shock is controversial. Rocuronium can produce optimal intubating conditions without the serious complications that can accompany succinylcholine. The available evidence supports the safety of etomidate and rocuronium in rapid sequence intubation but also suggests that more prospective studies are needed in pediatric patients.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^115GuABY]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Omitting high doses of rocuronium may allow to await spontaneous recovery of the neuromuscular block and avoid expensive antagonization with sugammadex under the premise that objective neuromuscular monitoring is available (documentation of train of four [TOF] ratio ≥ 0.9), which is the only method of assuring satisfactory recovery of neuromuscular function. If reversal is needed in patients with a magnesium pretreatment, the efficacy of recommended doses of sugammadex for the reversal of a moderate or deep neuromuscular block is not diminished.

Less than 50% of our patients had excellent intubating conditions with both experimental and control treatment. These rates were low compared with the literature. In the studies by Naguib et al, excellent intubating conditions were found in 63% and 80% of patients with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1. Kim et alreported on excellent intubating conditions in nearly 80% of patients who had received MgSO 4 50 mg·kg –1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1. However, none of these studies compared a magnesium 60 mg·kg –1 -rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 combination with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1. It remains unclear why our rates of excellent intubating conditions were relatively low. The induction and intubation protocols were strictly standardized. Several measures such as matching of treatments, anonymous delivery of treatments, no systematic reporting of symptoms related to the IV pretreatment by patients, intervention of 2 anesthesiologists (1 for the administration of drugs during induction and the follow-up of the patient during the surgical procedure, and the second for the intubation and the scoring of intubation conditions), and no more than 2 intubating anesthesiologists per center, were adopted to minimize observer bias and to maintain proper blinding of treatments. All observers were experienced anesthesiologists. Also, group sizes were much larger than in previous similar studies.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^112QtwUQ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Combining magnesium with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg·kg –1), instead of using high-dose rocuronium (1.2 mg·kg –1) alone, may be a more useful regimen for RSI as the duration of the neuromuscular block was prolonged by 25% only when magnesium was combined with rocuronium, compared with rocuronium alone, while the recovery time with high-dose rocuronium was nearly doubled. Magnesium in doses similar to our regimen is routinely used in anesthesia due to its analgesic and morphine sparing properties. It is also used as part of opioid-free anesthesia. Usual magnesium regimens often include a loading dose similar to ours (40–60 mg·kg –1) which can be easily anticipated before anesthesia induction while the patient is monitored and prepared for anesthesia. Few emergency patients requiring RSI for full stomach may need immediate intubation and even then there is often sufficient time to administer drugs before induction, such as gastric prokinetic agents.

### Rapid-sequence intubation: a review of the process and considerations when choosing medications [^113CF3PH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize published data regarding the steps of rapid-sequence intubation (RSI); review premedications, induction agents, neuromuscular blockers (NMB), and studies supporting use or avoidance; and discuss the benefits and deficits of combinations of induction agents and NMBs used when drug shortages occur.

Data Source

A search of Medline databases (1966-October 2013) was conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Databases were searched using the terms rapid-sequence intubation, fentanyl, midazolam, atropine, lidocaine, phenylephrine, ketamine, propofol, etomidate thiopental, succinylcholine, vecuronium, atracurium, and rocuronium. Citations from publications were reviewed for additional references.

Data Synthesis

Data were reviewed to support the use or avoidance of premedications, induction agents, and paralytics and combinations to consider when drug shortages occur.

Conclusions

RSI is used to secure a definitive airway in often uncooperative, nonfasted, unstable, and/or critically ill patients. Choosing the appropriate premedication, induction drug, and paralytic will maximize the success of tracheal intubation and minimize complications.

### Impact of rocuronium and succinylcholine on sedation initiation after rapid sequence intubation [^1121nfay]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) involves a rapidly acting sedative plus a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Rocuronium and succinylcholine are NMBAs commonly used in RSI with drastically different durations of action.

Objectives

Evaluate whether patients receiving RSI with a longer-acting NMBA had a greater delay in sedation or analgesia than patients that received a short-acting NMBA.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of patients presenting to the emergency department requiring endotracheal intubation. Exclusions included age < 18 years, pregnancy, prior intubation, and contraindication to sedation and analgesia. Primary endpoint was time to continuous sedation or analgesia after RSI in patients receiving rocuronium or succinylcholine. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay (HLOS), intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and impact of an emergency medicine pharmacist (EPh).

Results

A total 106 patients met inclusion criteria, 76 patients receiving rocuronium and 30 receiving succinylcholine. Mean time to sedation or analgesia was longer in the rocuronium group when compared to the succinylcholine group at 34 ± 36 min vs. 16 ± 21 min (p = 0.002). In the presence of an EPh, the mean time to sedation or analgesia was 20 ± 21 min, vs. 49 ± 45 min (p < 0.001). Time spent on ventilator, HLOS, and ICU LOS were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Patients receiving rocuronium in RSI had a significantly longer time to sedation or analgesia when compared to patients receiving succinylcholine. The presence of an EPh significantly decreased the time to administration of sedation or analgesia after RSI.

### Is succinylcholine appropriate or obsolete in the intensive care unit? [^1176Jsp3]. Critical Care (2001). Low credibility.

Muscle relaxants in intensive care unit (ICU) patients are predominantly administered to facilitate intubation. The adverse effect profile of succinylcholine is such that its use in the ICU must be considered obsolete. Suitable alternatives are the intermediately long-acting nondepolarizing relaxants, of which rocuronium is probably preferable.

### Intubation conditions after rocuronium or succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction with alfentanil and propofol in the emergency patient [^116TQDZq]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Previous studies mainly conducted on elective patients recommend doses of 0.9–1.2 mg kg[-1] rocuronium to obtain comparable intubation conditions with succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] after 60 s during a rapid-sequence induction. We decided to compare the overall intubating conditions of standard doses of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[-1] and succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] during a strict rapid-sequence induction regimen including propofol and alfentanil.

Methods

Male and female patients (ASA I-III) older than 17 yr scheduled for emergency abdominal or gynaecological surgery and with increased risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric content were randomized to a rapid-sequence induction with succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] or rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[-1]. Patients with a predicted difficult airway were excluded. A senior anaesthesiologist 'blinded' for the randomization performed the intubation 60 s after injection of the neuromuscular blocker. Intubating conditions were evaluated according to an established guideline. Tracheal intubation not completed within 30 s was recorded as failed.

Results

222 patients were randomized. Three patients had their operation cancelled and 10 did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Clinically acceptable intubation conditions were present in 93.5% and 96.1% of patients in the succinylcholine group (n = 107) and the rocuronium group (n = 102), respectively (P = 0.59).

Conclusions

During a rapid-sequence induction with alfentanil and propofol, both rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[-1] and succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] provide clinically acceptable intubation conditions in 60 s in patients scheduled for emergency surgery. Under the conditions of this rapid-sequence induction regimen rocuronium may be a substitute for succinylcholine.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^112uDKBF]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, the rate of excellent intubating conditions was significantly higher in women. This was related to a higher rate of women who had excellent intubating conditions after having received magnesium-rocuronium. This result, although not the primary interest of our study, was not unexpected as it is well known that there is an impact of gender on the action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Adamus et alhave shown an increased susceptibility of aminosteroidal blockers such as rocuronium in women. In these studies, the delay in the installation of the neuromuscular block was shortened, while the duration of the block was prolonged in women compared with men. Our observations may be regarded as an opportunity to define a research agenda to further study gender differences in pharmacology. Future trials may test the hypothesis that a magnesium-rocuronium combination has a more pronounced effect in women than in men.

Post hoc subgroup analyses also suggested an improvement in intubating conditions in patients receiving midazolam. Midazolam has muscle relaxant properties via α2 γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors. – Additionally, anxiolytic properties of midazolam may reduce basal tone in airway muscles. Midazolam also potentiates the effects of opioids and propofol. – When used as a premedication, midazolam has shown improved conditions of facial mask ventilation and insertion of a laryngeal mask. However, no data has so far identified a benefit of midazolam, alone or in combination with other drugs, on intubating conditions. It may be assumed that the improvement in intubating conditions after premedication with midazolam was caused by muscle relaxant effects and synergy with anesthetic induction agents.

Impact of Gender

In men, the rate of excellent intubating conditions was 30% (20 of 66) in the magnesium-rocuronium group and was 44% (28 of 63) in the saline-succinylcholine group (P = .139). In women, the rate of excellent intubating conditions was 61% (41 of 67) in the magnesium-rocuronium group and was 46% (29 of 63) in the saline-succinylcholine group (P = .120). The treatment effect was significantly different in men and women (interaction term, P = .019) with a higher rate of excellent intubating conditions with magnesium-rocuronium in women than in men. Stratified analyses by gender and center showed a similar tendency. In 1 center, the difference in the rate of excellent intubating conditions in men was significantly lower in the magnesium-rocuronium group (22% [6 of 27] compared with the saline-succinylcholine group (55% [16 of 29]) (P = .025) (Table 5).

Impact of Midazolam

Patients having received oral or IV midazolam (N = 135) had a better rate of excellent intubating conditions than those having not received midazolam (N = 124) (53% [71 of 135] vs 38% [47 of 124]), but without between-treatment group difference (52% [34 of 66] in the magnesium-rocuronium group and 54% [37 of 69] in the saline-succinylcholine group for patients having received midazolam versus 40% [27 of 67] and 35% [20 of 57], respectively, for patients having not received midazolam).

Secondary End Points

There was no significant difference between groups in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at any time point (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table 1). The mean heart rate was significantly higher in the magnesium-rocuronium group by approximately 5 beats per minute at each time point.

Induction techniques

In three studies, patients were premedicated (Table 1). Three studies used a true RSI, and two a modified RSI. All five used intravenous propofol 2 mg kg − 1 with a concomitant intravenous opioid for induction. The sixth study used an induction technique with sevoflurane without intravenous opioids; there was no delay between loss of consciousness and the administration of succinylcholine. One study specified the use of a cricoid pressure. In all studies, intubating conditions were evaluated 50 to 60 s after the administration of succinylcholine. Four studies specified that intubations were performed by an experienced anaesthetist.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — evidence gaps on NMBA choice and dosing: Future studies are needed to compare these two agents in the subset of patients with TBI, and although one single-center observational study showed that mortality may be increased in patients with severe TBI who receive succinylcholine, this finding needs to be further evaluated in larger multicenter observational studies or RCTs; the RCT with the most consequential results was out-of-hospital, so the findings may not be extrapolated to RSI in the critically ill population in the ED or ICU, and therefore future trials should compare these agents in an ED or ICU setting; the effects of the NMBA on outcomes, such as FPS, may be dependent on the dose used for RSI, similar FPS should be considered in the context of the doses used, pharmacokinetic alterations with poor perfusion or obesity may affect neuromuscular blockade, and the optimal dose in these circumstances requires additional investigation.

### Emergency department intubation success with succinylcholine versus rocuronium: a national emergency airway registry study [^117VvdUx]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Although both succinylcholine and rocuronium are used to facilitate emergency department (ED) rapid sequence intubation, the difference in intubation success rate between them is unknown. We compare first-pass intubation success between ED rapid sequence intubation facilitated by succinylcholine versus rocuronium.

Methods

We analyzed prospectively collected data from the National Emergency Airway Registry, a multicenter registry collecting data on all intubations performed in 22 EDs. We included intubations of patients older than 14 years who received succinylcholine or rocuronium during 2016. We compared the first-pass intubation success between patients receiving succinylcholine and those receiving rocuronium. We also compared the incidence of adverse events (cardiac arrest, dental trauma, direct airway injury, dysrhythmias, epistaxis, esophageal intubation, hypotension, hypoxia, iatrogenic bleeding, laryngoscope failure, laryngospasm, lip laceration, main-stem bronchus intubation, malignant hyperthermia, medication error, pharyngeal laceration, pneumothorax, endotracheal tube cuff failure, and vomiting). We conducted subgroup analyses stratified by paralytic weight-based dose.

Results

There were 2,275 rapid sequence intubations facilitated by succinylcholine and 1,800 by rocuronium. Patients receiving succinylcholine were younger and more likely to undergo intubation with video laryngoscopy and by more experienced providers. First-pass intubation success rate was 87.0% with succinylcholine versus 87.5% with rocuronium (adjusted odds ratio 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.3). The incidence of any adverse event was also comparable between these agents: 14.7% for succinylcholine versus 14.8% for rocuronium (adjusted odds ratio 1.1; 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3). We observed similar results when they were stratified by paralytic weight-based dose.

Conclusion

In this large observational series, we did not detect an association between paralytic choice and first-pass rapid sequence intubation success or peri-intubation adverse events.

For many years, SUX has been the most commonly used agent for general anesthesia during caesarean Sections. However, a 2021 survey revealed that the traditional use of SUX for rapid sequence induction (RSI) in obstetric anesthesia in the UK is gradually being supplemented by ROC. The survey data indicated a slight decrease in the dominance of SUX in obstetric general anesthesia compared to earlier surveys. In both the National Audit Project (NAP5) in 2013 and the 6th National Audit Project (NAP6) in 2016, SUX was used for tracheal intubation in over 90% of obstetric patients. In the 2021 study, it was used for 86% of patients, almost exclusively for RSI. The study also noted that drugs for reversing neuromuscular blockade were used in 88.1% of patients who received a non-depolarizing drug, an increase from the 68% reversal usage identified in NAP5. Current guidelines, published in 2015, suggest using ROC instead of SUX for neuromuscular blockade, although these guidelines are based on expert consensus rather than high-level evidence.

Succinylcholine, a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, is advantageous for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) because of its quick onset (40–60 s) and short duration of action (6–10 min). However, its benefits are limited by associated contraindications and adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia, malignant hyperthermia, and increased intraocular and intracranial pressure. The adverse effects of succinylcholine require extra caution in pregnant women because their levels of pseudocholinesterase can naturally decrease by up to 30%. Another disadvantage that hypothetically might impact neonatal outcome is that SUX increases oxygen consumption through its depolarizing action, and hence may cause earlier desaturation compared to ROC.

In contrast, ROC has a longer onset (60–120 s) and a significantly longer duration of action (30–67 min). Another reason why ROC is becoming more widely used as a substitute for succinylcholine is the availability of a specific reversal agent Sugammadex. Yet, Sugammadex cost and availability limits its use currently. Another variable to consider about ROC dose is its placental transfer rate of 16% and its effect on the newborn well-being while SUX does not cross the placenta when administered in usual clinical doses.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^112WPZLj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study showed no superiority of a combination of MgSO 4 60 mg·kg –1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 compared with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1 on the rate of excellent intubating conditions during RSI in adult patients. There were more adverse events with succinylcholine, mainly muscle pain and symptoms that may be attributed to histamine release. Overall, the rate of excellent intubating conditions was statistically higher in women. This was primarily due to the higher rate of women with excellent intubating conditions who received magnesium-rocuronium. Due to small sample sizes in the subgroup analyses, statistical power to detect clinically meaningful differences was insufficient.

Magnesium has a direct impact on neuromuscular transmission by decreasing the calcium influx and reducing the amount of acetylcholine released. – After pretreatment with IV MgSO 4, a reduction in the onset time was observed with atracurium, vecuronium, and rocuronium. – Several studies have tested the effect of various magnesium-rocuronium combinations on intubating conditions. – Kim et aland Park et alcompared a combination of MgSO 4 50 mg·kg –1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 with rocuronium 0.9 mg·kg –1. They did not include a control group receiving succinylcholine, the gold standard for RSI. We found no studies in the literature comparing MgSO 4 60 mg·kg –1 and a standard intubating dose of rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1. One study compared succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1 with high-dose rocuronium (1.2 mg·kg –1) and a combination of magnesium and high-dose rocuronium. Results of this study must be interpreted with caution as only 20 patients were included in each arm and the authors did not describe how intubation conditions were evaluated. They concluded that the magnesium-rocuronium combination significantly shortened the onset time of the neuromuscular block and significantly improved intubating conditions compared with high-dose rocuronium alone. Similar to our study, the combination of magnesium and high-dose rocuronium provided comparable intubating conditions to that of succinylcholine.

### Rapid sequence induction and intubation: current controversy [^112SrZ24]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

The changing opinion regarding some of the traditional components of rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) creates wide practice variations that impede attempts to establish a standard RSII protocol. There is controversy regarding the choice of induction drug, the dose, and the method of administration. Whereas some prefer the traditional rapid injection of a predetermined dose, others use the titration to loss of consciousness technique. The timing of neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD) administration is different in both techniques. Whereas the NMBD should immediately follow the induction drug in the traditional technique, it is only given after establishing loss of consciousness in the titration technique. The optimal dose of succinylcholine is controversial with advocates and opponents for both higher and lower doses than the currently recommended 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg dose. Defasciculation before succinylcholine was traditionally recommended in RSII but is currently controversial. Although the priming technique was advocated to accelerate onset of nondepolarizing NMBDs, its use has decreased because of potential complications and the introduction of rocuronium. Avoidance of manual ventilation before tracheal intubation was traditionally recommended to avoid gastric insufflation, but its use is currently acceptable and even recommended by some to avoid hypoxemia and to "test" the ability to mask ventilate. Cricoid pressure remains the most heated controversy; some believe in its effectiveness in preventing pulmonary aspiration, whereas others believe it should be abandoned because of the lack of scientific evidence of benefit and possible complications. There is still controversy regarding the best position and whether the head-up, head-down, or supine position is the safest during induction of anesthesia in full-stomach patients. These controversial components need to be discussed, studied, and resolved before establishing a standard RSII protocol.

### Post-intubation analgesia and sedation following succinylcholine vs. rocuronium in the emergency department [^113ZgzVG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Succinylcholine and rocuronium are the most commonly utilized neuromuscular blocker agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department (ED). The duration of action of rocuronium is significantly longer (∼30 min) compared to succinylcholine (∼10 min) and previous studies have shown that patients receiving rocuronium are more likely to have longer time to sedation initiation following RSI. Furthermore, patients receiving rocuronium may be more likely to experience awareness with paralysis than those receiving succinylcholine. The primary goal for this study was to evaluate the association between NMBA use during RSI and post-intubation sedation and analgesia practices in the ED.

Methods

This was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study including patients 18 years and older that received succinylcholine or rocuronium during RSI in the ED between September 1, 2020 and August 31, 2021. Patients were excluded if they were intubated prior to ED arrival, experienced an out-of-hospital or in ED cardiac arrest, or received sugammadex within 60 min of rocuronium administration. Patients were screened in reverse chronological order until the targeted sample size was achieved and all data was abstracted from the electronic health record. The primary outcome was the time to initiation of analgesia or sedation. Secondary outcomes included dose of sedatives or analgesia administered at 30- and 60 min, and medications administered for post-intubation sedation or analgesia.

Findings

A total of 200 ED patients were included of which 100 received succinylcholine and 100 received rocuronium. There was no difference in the median time to initiation of analgesia or sedation between the succinylcholine and rocuronium groups (10 vs 8.5 min, p = 0.82) or in Kaplan-Meier cumulative probabilities (p = 0.17). At 60 min post-RSI, those receiving succinylcholine received significantly higher median doses of propofol (20 μg/kg/min vs. 10 μg/kg/min; p = 0.02) and fentanyl [100 μg vs. 84.2 μg; p = 0.02].

Conclusion

While no differences were observed in the time to initiation of post-intubation sedation or analgesia in ED patients receiving succinylcholine compared to rocuronium, differences in the intensity of post-intubation regimens was observed. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the adequacy of sedation following RSI in the ED.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the percentage of patients with excellent intubating conditions. Intubating conditions were graded as excellent, good, or poor using a modified scale according to the recommendations of Good Clinical Research Practice in Neuromuscular Research (Table 1). Scoring was based on ease of laryngoscopy, the position of the vocal cords, and the patient's reactions to the insertion of the endotracheal tube. In addition to these qualifiers, we added the outcome "intubating failure", defined as a not completed orotracheal intubation within 30 seconds after the start of direct laryngoscopy (ie, 80 seconds after injection of the neuromuscular blocking agent). In the case of intubating failure, the usual guidelines for a "can ventilate – cannot intubate" situation were followed.

Table 1.
Intubating Conditions According to Good Clinical Practice in Neuromuscular Research

The intubating anesthesiologist rated the various variables describing intubating conditions and their quality immediately after orotracheal intubation. Patients with a Cormack & Lehane grade of 3 or 4 were excluded from the analysis of the primary end point as with these grades, the position of the vocal cords cannot be assessed. However, these patients were considered for the analysis of adverse events.

Secondary end points were heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure immediately before intubation, and at 1 and 5 minutes after intubation. Safety evaluation consisted of spontaneously reported symptoms and complaints during the infusion of the pretreatment (nausea/retching, skin rash, pain at injection) and the appearance of signs of histamine release (bronchospasm, erythema, edema, hypotension) after the injection of the neuromuscular blocking agent. Arterial hypotension was defined as a decrease in mean arterial pressure of > 40%. At the postanesthetic visit, the day after the intervention, patients were screened for intraoperative awareness, muscle pain, and for any minor or major adverse event.

### Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) [^114a57G9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rapid Sequence Intubation

Intubation was assessed in patients in 6 clinical studies where anesthesia was induced with either thiopental (3–6 mg/kg) or propofol (1.5–2.5 mg/kg) in combination with either fentanyl (2–5 mcg/kg) or alfentanil (1 mg). Most of the patients also received a premedication such as midazolam or temazepam. Most patients had intubation attempted within 60 to 90 seconds of administration of rocuronium bromide injection 0.6 mg/kg or succinylcholine 1 to 1.5 mg/kg. Excellent or good intubating conditions were achieved in 119/120 (99% [95% confidence interval: 95%-99.9%]) patients receiving Rocuronium Bromide Injection and in 108/110 (98% [94%-99.8%]) patients receiving succinylcholine. The duration of action of Rocuronium Bromide Injection 0.6 mg/kg is longer than succinylcholine and at this dose is approximately equivalent to the duration of other intermediate- acting neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Obese Patients

Rocuronium bromide injection was dosed according to actual body weight (ABW) in most clinical studies. The administration of rocuronium bromide injection in the 47 of 330 (14%) patients who were at least 30% or more above their ideal body weight (IBW) was not associated with clinically significant differences in the onset, duration, recovery, or reversal of rocuronium bromide injection-induced neuromuscular block.

In 1 clinical study in obese patients, rocuronium bromide injection 0.6 mg/kg was dosed according to ABW (n = 12) or IBW (n = 11). Obese patients dosed according to IBW had a longer time to maximum block, a shorter median (range) clinical duration of 25 (14–29) minutes, and did not achieve intubating conditions comparable to those dosed based on ABW. These results support the recommendation that obese patients be dosed based on actual body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Collective review of the status of rapid sequence intubation drugs of choice in trauma in low-and middle-income settings (prehospital, emergency department and operating room setting) [^113TqLb8]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Establishing a definitive airway in order to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation is an important aspect of resuscitation of the polytrauma patient.

Aim

To review the relevant literature that compares the different drugs used for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) of trauma patients, specifically reviewing: premedication, induction agents and neuromuscular blocking agents across the prehospital, emergency department and operating room setting, and to present the best practices based on the reviewed evidence.

Method

A literature review of rapid sequence intubation in the trauma population was carried out, specifically comparison of the drugs used (induction agent, neuromuscular blocking drugs and adjuncts).

Discussion

Studies involving the comparison of drugs used in RSI in, specifically, the trauma patient are sparse. The majority of studies have compared induction agents, etomidate, ketamine and propofol, as well as the neuromuscular blocking agents, succinylcholine and rocuronium.

Conclusion

There currently exists great variation in the practice of RSI; however, in trauma the RSI armamentarium is limited to agents that maintain hemodynamic stability, provide adequate intubating conditions in the shortest time period and do not have detrimental effects on cerebral perfusion pressure. Further, multicenter randomized controlled studies to confirm the benefits of the currently used agents in trauma are required.

### Difficult Airway Society 2015 guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults [^112gWQGV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Rapid sequence induction

The placement of a cuffed tube in the trachea offers the greatest protection against aspiration. Suxamethonium is the traditional neuromuscular blocking agent of choice because its rapid onset allows early intubation without the need for bag–mask ventilation. Several studies have compared suxamethonium with rocuronium for rapid sequence induction, and although some have shown better intubating conditions with suxamethonium, others have found that after rocuronium 1.2 mg kg −1 the speed of onset and intubation conditions are comparable. – Suxamethonium-induced fasciculation increases oxygen consumption during apnoea, which may become relevant in the event of airway obstruction. The ability to antagonize the effect of rocuronium rapidly with sugammadex may be an advantage, although it should be remembered that this does not guarantee airway patency or the return of spontaneous ventilation. If rapid antagonism of rocuronium with sugammadex is part of the failed intubation plan, the correct dose (16 mg kg −1) must be immediately available.

### Pharmacotherapy optimization for rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department [^114qAMjK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) is the process of administering a sedative and neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) in rapid succession to facilitate endotracheal intubation. It is the most common and preferred method for intubation of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The selection and use of medications to facilitate RSI is critical for success. The purpose of this review is to describe pharmacotherapies used during the RSI process, discuss current clinical controversies in RSI medication selection, and review pharmacotherapy considerations for alternative intubation methods.

Summary

There are several steps to the intubation process requiring medication considerations, including pretreatment, induction, paralysis, and post-intubation sedation and analgesia. Pretreatment medications include atropine, lidocaine, and fentanyl; but use of these agents in clinical practice has fallen out of favor as there is limited evidence for their use outside of select clinical scenarios. There are several options for induction agents, though etomidate and ketamine are the most used due to their more favorable hemodynamic profiles. Currently there is retrospective evidence that etomidate may produce less hypotension than ketamine in patients presenting with shock or sepsis. Succinylcholine and rocuronium are the preferred neuromuscular blocking agents, and the literature suggests minimal differences between succinylcholine and high dose rocuronium in first-pass success rates. Selection between the two is based on patient specific factors, half-life and adverse effect profiles. Finally, medication-assisted preoxygenation and awake intubation are less common methods for intubation in the ED but require different considerations for medication use.

Areas For Future Research

The optimal selection, dosing, and administration of RSI medications is complicated, and further research is needed in several areas. Additional prospective studies are needed to determine optimal induction agent selection and dosing in patients presenting with shock or sepsis. Controversy exists over optimal medication administration order (paralytic first vs induction first) and medication dosing in obese patients, but there is insufficient evidence to significantly alter current practices regarding medication dosing and administration. Further research examining awareness with paralysis during RSI is needed before definitive and widespread practice changes to medication use during RSI can be made.

### Rocuronium is not associated with more vocal cord injuries than succinylcholine after rapid-sequence induction: a randomized, prospective, controlled trial [^112ufowk]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Postoperative hoarseness (PH), sore throat (ST), and vocal cord injuries (VCI) are common complications after general anesthesia. Excellent endotracheal intubating conditions are associated with less laryngeal morbidity than good or poor intubating conditions. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that a rapid-sequence induction (RSI) with succinylcholine would lead to less PH and VCI than with rocuronium. In this prospective trial, 160 patients were randomized in 2 groups to receive thiopental 5.0 mg/kg, fentanyl 3.0 microg/kg, succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg, or rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg during RSI. PH and ST were assessed at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, VCI were examined by stroboscopy in those patients who had PH > 3 days. Excellent and clinically acceptable intubating conditions were significantly increased in the succinylcholine group compared with the rocuronium group: 57% versus 21% and 89% versus 59%, respectively (P < 0.001). The incidence and severity of PH, and VCI between the succinylcholine and the rocuronium groups did not differ significantly: PH: 50% versus 51% (P = 0.99) and VCI: 3% versus 1% (P = 0.98), respectively. Similar findings were found for ST, 39% versus 28% (P = 0.22), and postoperative myalgia, 39% versus 29% (P = 0.25), respectively. Intubating conditions were significantly better in the succinylcholine group compared with the rocuronium group. The incidence and severity of ST and myalgia were not increased in the patients receiving succinylcholine. However, the rate of PH and VCI was similar to the rocuronium group.

To the editor:

We have read with interest the case report by Terijian and colleagues and the comment from Brodsky et al.

We fully agree with the authors that succinylcholine-associated myalgia might be a serious issue for many patients, especially for morbidly obese patients. But we were a little bit surprised about the authors' opinion that there are no proven strategies to reduce succinylcholine-associated myalgia significantly. The authors have cited a meta-analysis by Schreiber et al. that was published in 2005 in Anesthesiology. In this article it has been shown that the relative risk of postoperative myalgia can be reduced significantly by using a pretreatment with low-dose non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers or sodium channel blockers such as lidocaine. Currently, the paper represents the best available evidence on the prevention of succinylcholine-associated myalgia.

Furthermore, we agree that sugammadex, a new binding agent for the reversal of rocuronium and vecuronium, will improve the safety profile of these agents but we are not convinced that this will be the solution of all of our problems. In case of a rapid sequence induction, the anesthesiologist wants optimal intubation conditions within seconds and in this specific situation succinylcholine still seems to be superior compared to high-dose rocuronium — according to a recent systematic review that was very well done by Perry et al.

The dilemma of systematic reviews and meta-analyses might be that they cannot focus onto specific patient populations. This could be seen as a limitation of evidence-based approaches. On the other hand, it represents the best way — unless the contrary has been proven.

Another aspect emerges from this case report. After dramatic improvements in clinical anesthesia during the last 50 years, a "dirty drug" that may cause potentially fatal complications such as malignant hyperthermia or hyperkalemia still represents the "gold standard" for rapid sequence induction. Surely, a non-depolarizing agent with a comparable pharmacological profile but no side effects would be the best replacement. Unfortunately, it has not been found yet.

### Tracheal intubation in critically ill patients: a comprehensive systematic review of randomized trials [^112sTZad]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Three unrelated heterogeneous RCTs evaluated sedatives. The only large one evaluated etomidate versus ketamine, finding no difference: a Cochrane meta-analysis also investigating non-intubation-related adverse effects of etomidate in critically ill patients concluded that its use is not associated with worsening of mortality, organ dysfunction or resource utilization, even if it negatively affects adrenal gland function. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, no RCT evaluated the very commonly used sedative propofol in this context.

Marsch at al. found that succinylcholine and rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) are equivalent, even if the duration of intubation was longer with rocuronium. It should be noted that the study did not consider the potential beneficial role of the antagonist sugammadex when using rocuronium. Moreover, even if RSI is commonly considered the technique of choice in critically ill patients, graded sedation intubation not using NMBA has also been proposed and applied. Unfortunately, the two approaches have never been compared.

### Comparison of succinylcholine and rocuronium for first-attempt intubation success in the emergency department [^116ihFDr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to determine the effect of paralytic type and dose on first-attempt rapid sequence intubation (RSI) success in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This was a retrospective evaluation of information collected prospectively in a quality improvement database between July 1, 2007, and October 31, 2008. Information regarding all intubations performed in a tertiary care ED was recorded in this database. All RSI performed using succinylcholine or rocuronium were included. Logistic regression was used to analyze the effect of paralytic type and dosing, as well as age, sex, body mass index, physician experience, device type, and presence of difficult airway predictors on first attempt RSI success.

Results

A total of 327 RSI were included in the final analyses. All patients received etomidate as the induction sedative and were successfully intubated. Of these, 113 and 214 intubations were performed using succinylcholine and rocuronium, respectively. The rate of first-attempt intubation success was similar between the succinylcholine and rocuronium groups (72.6% vs. 72.9%, p = 0.95). Median doses used for succinylcholine and rocuronium were 1.65 mg/kg (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.26–1.95 mg/kg) and 1.19 mg/kg (IQR = 1–1.45 mg/kg), respectively. In the univariate logistic regression analyses, variables predictive of first-attempt intubation success were laryngeal view (more success if Grade 1 or 2 compared to Grade 3 or 4 of the Cormack-Lehane classification, odds ratio [OR] = 55.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.87 to 161.39), intubation device (less success if direct laryngoscopy, OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34 to 0.96), and presence of a difficult airway predictor (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.99). In the multivariate analysis, the only variable predictive of first-attempt intubation success was laryngeal view.

Conclusions

Succinylcholine and rocuronium are equivalent with regard to first-attempt intubation success in the ED when dosed according to the ranges used in this study.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^1133tt2T]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Drug Administration

In the experimental group, patients received 1 mL·kg – 1 of the MgSO 4 solution as a pretreatment, which corresponded to 60 mg·kg –1 of MgSO 4. In the control group, patients received a matching 1 mL·kg – 1 infusion containing physiological saline (0.9% NaCl). Pretreatments were administered during 15 minutes using a volumetric infusion pump (Infusomat, Braun Medical SA, Sempach, Switzerland). Once the pretreatment was finished, anesthesia was induced (see Induction and Intubation) and 0.06 mL·kg – 1 of the neuromuscular blocking agent was administered using the matching 10-mL syringe. This regimen ensured that patients in the experimental group received rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 and those in the control group received succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1.

Induction and Intubation

The anesthesiologist in charge of the patient was free to administer oral midazolam as a premedication at last 1 hour before induction of anesthesia or IV midazolam in the preparation room. Standard noninvasive monitoring included acceleromyography with a TOF Watch SX monitor (Organon, Oss, the Netherlands). For induction, patients were installed with the head slightly raised (sniffing position). Preoxygenation via a facemask was begun, and IV sufentanil 0.2 μg·kg –1 was given. Anesthesia was induced 3 minutes later using IV propofol 2 mg·kg –1. On loss of consciousness, patients received the neuromuscular blocking agent according to randomization. Patients were not ventilated before orotracheal intubation. No cricoid pressure was exerted. The procedure of intubation was standardized. The time point of injection of the neuromuscular blocking agent was defined as time 0. At time 45 seconds, the intubating anesthesiologist entered the room, approached the head of the patient, started direct laryngoscopy at time 50 seconds, and intubated the trachea at time 60 seconds.

### Predictors of first pass success without hypoxemia in trauma patients requiring emergent rapid sequence intubation [^116zq81n]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to assess the factors associated with first pass success (FPS) without hypoxemia in traumatically injured patients requiring RSI. Patients requiring emergent intubation require first pass success to reduce adverse events, including hypoxemia. The most important finding of our study is that the use of succinylcholine (aOR 2.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.2) and patients with high GCS score (aOR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.3) were associated with FPS without hypoxemia via multivariate logistic regression among patients requiring RSI after a traumatic injury at a level 1 trauma center. Our analysis of variables affecting FPS without hypoxemia included both physician and patient-dependent variables.

The physician-dependent variables included the choice of NMBA (succinylcholine vs. rocuronium) and operator level of training. Our results support the EAST guidelinerecommendation of succinylcholine as the first-line NMBA for injured patients, in the absence of any contraindication for its use. Certainly, acutely injured patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia should be considered for the use of rocuronium in these settings; however, we did not identify any patients in this cohort to have pre-existing contraindications for succinylcholine. Although succinylcholine was associated with FPS without hypoxemia in this study, it is important to note that our FPS success rates did not differ between those receiving either NMBA. These findings are consistent with a large retrospective study in the ED setting which demonstrated no difference in FPS between the two NMBAs. The indication for intubation in this large study was trauma in one in four patients, and the mean dose of rocuronium given was 1.2 mg/kg. The onset of rocuronium is dose dependent with doses of 1.2 mg/kg or higher resulting in more rapid paralysis than the labeled dose of 0.6 mg/kg. A Cochrane review and meta-analysis found that rocuronium creates similar intubating conditions to succinylcholine only when dose at or above the threshold of 1.2 mg/kg. Since we do not have data on the dose of NMBAs, the strength of our findings regarding their performance is reduced. The choice of NMBA is a physician-dependent variable that may be affected by peri-intubation physiology, and further studies are warranted regarding the physician choice of NMBA for the emergent tracheal intubation of trauma patients.

Medications

A variety of medications are available to assist with the rapid sequence of adult trauma patients, but the medications can be broken down into two broad categories of induction agents and paralytics. Options for induction agents include sedative/hypnotics (ie, propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, high dose ketamine, high dose benzodiazepines, very high dose opioids), amnestic agents (lower dose benzodiazepines), analgesic agents (ketamine, opioids), with etomidate used most often. Etomidate is dosed at 0.3 mg/kg IV for an induction dose. Etomidate has advantageous characteristics including rapid onset and limited effect on hemodynamics. The biggest concern with etomidate is adrenal suppression and subsequent decrease in serum cortisol; however, this alteration in lab values has not been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Ketamine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg intravenously, is another option as an induction agent for rapid sequence intubation in trauma patients. It has characteristics that are potentially beneficial in trauma patients including rapid onset, analgesia, amnesia, and sympathomimetic effects and has been shown to have clinical outcomes comparable to etomidate for rapid sequence intubation

Paralytic agents include depolarizing (succinylcholine) and non-depolarizing (rocuronium, pancuronium, vecuronium) agents. Succinylcholine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg intravenously, is the most common paralytic agent used in trauma intubations. It has a rapid onset and short half-life, making it an ideal agent if there is a failed intubation, allowing quick return of spontaneous respirations. The most common non-depolarizing agent is rocuronium, dosed at 1.2 mg/kg intravenously, and approximates the rapid onset of succinylcholine but has a longer duration of action. Although there are not many direct comparisons of the two drugs, rocuronium has fewer side effects and contraindications and may be associated with lower mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. As mentioned previously, push-dose pressors may be used to treat or prevent hypotension around the time of intubation. The two most common agents used are epinephrine and phenylephrine, but epinephrine has the advantage of having both alpha and beta effects. A dilute epinephrine solution may be administered in 5 to 20 μg doses every 2 to 5 minutes to achieve desired effect.

### Effect of remifentanil vs neuromuscular blockers during rapid sequence intubation on successful intubation without major complications among patients at risk of aspiration: a randomized clinical trial [^1132jFWC]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It is uncertain whether a rapid-onset opioid is noninferior to a rapid-onset neuromuscular blocker during rapid sequence intubation when used in conjunction with a hypnotic agent.

Objective

To determine whether remifentanil is noninferior to rapid-onset neuromuscular blockers for rapid sequence intubation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial among 1150 adults at risk of aspiration (fasting for < 6 hours, bowel occlusion, recent trauma, or severe gastroesophageal reflux) who underwent tracheal intubation in the operating room at 15 hospitals in France from October 2019 to April 2021. Follow-up was completed on May 15, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive neuromuscular blockers (1 mg/kg of succinylcholine or rocuronium; n = 575) or remifentanil (3 to 4 μg/kg; n = 575) immediately after injection of a hypnotic.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was assessed in all randomized patients (as-randomized population) and in all eligible patients who received assigned treatment (per-protocol population). The primary outcome was successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt without major complications, defined as lung aspiration of digestive content, oxygen desaturation, major hemodynamic instability, sustained arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and severe anaphylactic reaction. The prespecified noninferiority margin was 7.0%.

Results

Among 1150 randomized patients (mean age, 50.7 [SD, 17.4] years; 573 [50%] women), 1130 (98.3%) completed the trial. In the as-randomized population, tracheal intubation on the first attempt without major complications occurred in 374 of 575 patients (66.1%) in the remifentanil group and 408 of 575 (71.6%) in the neuromuscular blocker group (between-group difference adjusted for randomization strata and center, -6.1%; 95% CI, -11.6% to -0.5%; p = 0.37 for noninferiority), demonstrating inferiority. In the per-protocol population, 374 of 565 patients (66.2%) in the remifentanil group and 403 of 565 (71.3%) in the neuromuscular blocker group had successful intubation without major complications (adjusted difference, -5.7%; 2-sided 95% CI, -11.3% to -0.1%; p = 0.32 for noninferiority). An adverse event of hemodynamic instability was recorded in 19 of 575 patients (3.3%) with remifentanil and 3 of 575 (0.5%) with neuromuscular blockers (adjusted difference, 2.8%; 95% CI, 1.2%-4.4%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults at risk of aspiration during rapid sequence intubation in the operating room, remifentanil, compared with neuromuscular blockers, did not meet the criterion for noninferiority with regard to successful intubation on first attempt without major complications. Although remifentanil was statistically inferior to neuromuscular blockers, the wide confidence interval around the effect estimate remains compatible with noninferiority and limits conclusions about the clinical relevance of the difference.

Rapid sequence intubation is the process involving administration of a sedative (eg, induction agent) followed almost immediately by a neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate endotracheal intubation The purpose of emergency RSI is to make emergent intubation easier and safer, thereby increasing the success rate of intubation while decreasing the complications. Possible disadvantages are complications from the additional drugs, prolonged intubation with hypoxia, and precipitating an emergent or crash airway. Controversy has arisen regarding various steps in RSI; however, RSI remains the standard of care in emergency medicine airway management.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^112hNVgC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The two neuromuscular blocking agents most commonly used for tracheal intubation in the ED or ICU are succinylcholine and rocuronium. Succinylcholine's short duration of action of 6 to 10 minutes allows faster resumption of spontaneous breathing. However, succinylcholine may cause rare but serious side effects, including rhabdomyolysis, malignant hyperthermia, and hyperkalemia. Rocuronium avoids these rare side effects but has a longer duration of action of 30 to 90 minutes, and recent observational studies have reported an association between receipt of rocuronium and patients experiencing the sensation of being awake but unable to move ("awareness with paralysis" or "awake immobility"). Medications capable of reversing the neuromuscular blockade of rocuronium, such as sugammadex, are now available in some settings. Among 1,248 patients being intubated in the prehospital setting in the CURASMUR (Succinylcholine versus Rocuronium for Out-of-Hospital Emergency Intubation) trial, the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt was 79.4% in the succinylcholine group and 74.6% in the rocuronium group. However, the incidences of arrhythmia, hypotension, and vasopressor receipt were greater in the succinylcholine group. A single-center trial found no difference between succinylcholine and rocuronium in the incidence of desaturation among ICU patients. Despite the lack of rigorous evidence to inform which neuromuscular blockade agent results in the best outcomes for patients, over the last decade, rocuronium has replaced succinylcholine as the most commonly used neuromuscular blockade agent in many ED and ICU settings. Further randomized trials could compare the effects of succinylcholine versus rocuronium on successful intubation on the first attempt, complications during intubation, awareness with paralysis, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.

### In-hospital airway management of COVID-19 patients [^116UDpKB]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several special procedure-related considerations for intubation that the team should bear in mind. To minimize exposure of healthcare providers during intubation, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be roomed in negative pressure suites with full airborne precautions. The choice of neuromuscular blocking agents for these patients remains a topic of debate. Cheung et al. recommend a rapid sequence intubation approach using a high dose of nondepolarizing agent, such as rocuronium, rather than succinylcholine. The longer duration of action of rocuronium prevents aerosolization via patient coughing in the event of multiple attempts at intubation, whereas succinylcholine has a duration of effect lasting only 3–5 min. An increased dose of rocuronium (greater than or equal to 1.2 mg/kg) reduces time to drug onset, which reduces the risk of patient coughing during intubation. Alternatively, succinylcholine given its rapid onset and recovery time may be preferred in the absence of contraindications such as long-term immobility, family history of malignant hyperthermia, certain neuromuscular disorders, and marked hyperkalemia. Use of intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) and avoidance of fentanyl are additional strategies which may help prevent coughing. Lidocaine should be used with caution and should be avoided in hemodynamically unstable patients. Awake fiberoptic intubation should be minimized in COVID-19-positive patients as coughing is common with this procedure, conferring risk of infection to those involved. Atomization of local anesthetic for airway topicalization, as is required for these intubations, also risks aerosolizing patient sputum.

### Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) [^1116t5Ln]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Dose for Tracheal Intubation

The recommended initial dose of Rocuronium Bromide Injection, regardless of anesthetic technique, is 0.6 mg/kg. Neuromuscular block sufficient for intubation (80% block or greater) is attained in a median (range) time of 1 (0.4–6) minute(s) and most patients have intubation completed within 2 minutes. Maximum blockade is achieved in most patients in less than 3 minutes. This dose may be expected to provide 31 (15–85) minutes of clinical relaxation under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Under halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane anesthesia, some extension of the period of clinical relaxation should be expected [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

A lower dose of Rocuronium Bromide Injection (0.45 mg/kg) may be used. Neuromuscular block sufficient for intubation (80% block or greater) is attained in a median (range) time of 1.3 (0.8–6.2) minute(s), and most patients have intubation completed within 2 minutes. Maximum blockade is achieved in most patients in less than 4 minutes. This dose may be expected to provide 22 (12–31) minutes of clinical relaxation under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Patients receiving this low dose of 0.45 mg/kg who achieve less than 90% block (about 16% of these patients) may have a more rapid time to 25% recovery, 12 to 15 minutes.

A large bolus dose of 0.9 or 1.2 mg/kg can be administered under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia without adverse effects to the cardiovascular system [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

2.3 Rapid Sequence Intubation

In appropriately premedicated and adequately anesthetized patients, Rocuronium Bromide Injection 0.6 to 1.2 mg/kg will provide excellent or good intubating conditions in most patients in less than 2 minutes [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A guideline panel of 20 Society of Critical Care Medicine members met virtually at least monthly from 2018 through 2020 and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework with recommendations of "strong" or "conditional" based on evidence and consensus; panelists created Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) questions and reviewed evidence using predetermined search terms, with recommendations provided when evidence was actionable, suggestions when evidence was equivocal, and best practice statements when benefits outweighed risks but direct evidence did not exist. From the original 35 proposed PICO questions, 10 were selected, and the panel issued one recommendation (strong, low-quality evidence), seven suggestions (all conditional recommendations with moderate-, low-, or very low-quality evidence), and two best practice statements; the panel made two suggestions for a single PICO question and did not make any suggestions for one PICO question due to lack of evidence. Using GRADE principles, the panel found substantial agreement regarding evidence supporting RSI recommendations and identified literature gaps for future research.

### The neuromuscular effects of rocuronium under sevoflurane-remifentanil or propofol-remifentanil anesthesia: a randomized clinical comparative study in an Asian population [^116vNH5R]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Rocuronium bromide is a monoquaternary, aminosteroid, non-depolarizing, muscle relaxant. Its main advantage compared with other currently available muscle relaxants is its rapid onset time and intermediate duration of action. The standard dose (2 × ED 95, 0.6 mg/kg) of rocuronium is reported to provide clinically acceptable (good or excellent) intubation conditions in all patients at 90 s after administration, and is comparable to 1 mg/kg (3 × ED 95) of succinylcholine. Clinically, anesthesiologists in Korea and Japan have sometimes experienced unacceptable intubation conditions after administration of a standard dose of rocuronium. It is unknown whether the ethnicity of the patient can directly affect rocuronium potency but Dahaba et al. have reported geographic regional differences in the rocuronium dose–response relation and time course of action. They have shown that the ED 95 of rocuronium is significantly higher in Chinese patients than in American patients (475 ± 155 μg/kg vs 362 ± 149 μg/kg, respectively). Hence, the standard dose of rocuronium might not provide clinically acceptable intubation conditions in Asian patients. The first purpose of this study was thus to evaluate the intubation conditions at 180 s after administration of three different doses of rocuronium to investigate whether 0.6 mg/kg was sufficient in a population of Asian patients.

The potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of muscle relaxants by inhalational anesthetics is well known. Consequently, inhalational anesthetics can decrease the dose requirement of muscle relaxants and prolong both the duration of action and recovery from neuromuscular block. The dose-response curves of rocuronium under sevoflurane, isoflurane, or desflurane shifts to the left compared with those obtained during propofol anesthesia. The interaction of inhalational anesthetics and muscle relaxants is a time-dependent phenomenon and the potentiation effect varies among inhalational agents. Sevoflurane markedly potentiates muscle relaxants, shortening the onset time compared with other anesthetics. Such potentiation is not clear during induction and only becomes significant during prolonged anesthesia. Thus, the second purpose of this study was to compare time to maximum block, and recovery profiles of rocuronium between sevoflurane-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.

### Effect of paralytic type on time to post-intubation sedative use in the emergency department [^117B3p4x]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the difference between rocuronium and succinylcholine with regard to post-intubation sedative initiation in the emergency department.

Methds

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care emergency department (ED) in the United States. Consecutive adult patients intubated in the ED using succinylcholine or rocuronium for paralysis were included. Data collected included patient demographics, vital signs, medications used post-intubation and times of drug administration. Patients were divided into two groups based on the type of paralytic used for rapid sequence intubation: (1) rocuronium or (2) succinylcholine. All patients received etomidate for induction of sedation. Time between intubation and post-intubation sedative use was compared between the two groups using an unpaired Student's t test.

Main Results

A total of 200 patients were included in the final analyses (100 patients in each group). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to patient demographics, vital signs or other baseline characteristics. After intubation, 77.5% (n = 155) of patients were initiated on a sedative infusion of propofol (n = 148) or midazolam (n = 7). The remaining patients received sedation as bolus doses only. Mean time between intubation and post-intubation sedative use was significantly greater in the rocuronium group compared with the succinylcholine group (27 min vs 15 min, respectively; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Patients intubated with rocuronium had greater delays in post-intubation sedative initiation compared with succinylcholine.

### Rapid sequence induction: an international survey [^111U1ZPn]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Suxamethonium is a part of the classical RSI technique but rocuronium (1.2 mg kg −1)provides comparable intubation conditions. Worldwide, suxamethonium remains the first-choice drug for neuromuscular blockade induction during RSI. However, the availability of suggamadex, a selective antidote for rocuronium, has increased the use of rocuronium for RSI over the past few years. In our survey, suxamethonium remained the drug of choice for RSI in adults, with 56% of respondents favouring it compared with 49.3% using rocuronium. This situation was reversed in paediatric patients, where 54.7% of respondents used rocuronium and 48.3% used suxamethonium. This could be explained by the fear of malignant hyperthermia in children, or by the availability of sugammadex for rapid reversal of rocuronium and the additional possibility of minimising the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade postoperatively. In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a warning regarding serious adverse effects and fatal cases of malignant hyperthermia after suxamethonium administration. Suxamethonium in children should be reserved for the treatment of laryngospasm and for RSI. Considering the serious side effects, the role of suxamethonium in paediatric RSI is debatable. Only a minority of respondents monitored the onset of neuromuscular blockade (adult/paediatric, sometimes 32.9%/28.6%, always 14.0%/11.2%). This could be a possible area for improvement. The majority of aspiration episodes during RSI have been linked to attempts to intubate the trachea during light anaesthesia before the onset of neuromuscular blockade.

The basic principle of the classical RSI is the avoidance of manual ventilation, thus minimising the risk of air insufflation into the stomach and reducing the risk of aspiration/regurgitation. However, this practice is associated with a risk of hypoxaemia and cardiovascular complications. Manual or mechanical controlled ventilation with a limited inspiratory pressure (≤ 12–15 cmH 2 O) can lead to effective ventilation and oxygenation without insufflating the stomach, and according to the published data, it can be considered well tolerated. – The inclusion of such pressure limited ventilation in the RSI algorithm is described as 'controlled RSI' or 'modified RSI'. Such 'controlled RSI' has been used by 67 to 85% of physicians (mainly in patients with respiratory insufficiency and in paediatric patients).

### Neuromuscular block in patients 80 years and older: a prospective, controlled study [^111E4anq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Succinylcholine may be contraindicated in many elderly patients because of comorbidities such as renal insufficiency with increased serum potassium levels or hemiplegia to name only a few. That's why rocuronium may be an interesting alternative for rapid sequence induction (RSI) in the elderly. In the present study, a tendency to deeper maximum level of neuromuscular block could be observed in the elderly (Table 2). However, the study was not primarily designed to detect differences in the depth of neuromuscular block. Moreover, the findings of the present study confirmed previous results reporting a slower onset of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg in the elderly. In the light of these findings one may question whether rocuronium is still a useful compound for RSI in the elderly. In a cohort of elderly patients between 65–92 years Takagi et al. observed an onset time of 187 s after rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg and increasing the dose of rocuronium to 1 mg/kg decreased the onset time to 104 s. Unfortunately, their study design did not allow to draw conclusions on intubating conditions for RSI after rocuronium 1.0 mg/kg. The slower onset on rocuronium neuromuscular block observed in the study by Takagi et al. may be explained by findings from Shiraishi et al. reporting an inverse relationship between cardiac output and rocuronium onset time in the elderly. However, whether doses of rocuronium higher than 1 mg/kg will further decrease its onset time in the elderly is currently unknown, as is the question what level of neuromuscular block is really required in elderly patients to achieve good to excellent intubating conditions after 45–60 s.
