## Question

What are the typical imaging findings of encephalomalacia on CT or MRI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical imaging findings of encephalomalacia on CT or MRI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining encephalomalacia and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the core CT and MRI signal characteristics. Next, I will examine associated features such as volume loss, ventriculomegaly, and calcification. After that, I should consider temporal evolution and special patterns like multicystic encephalomalacia. Finally, I will integrate modality-specific strengths and limitations and synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Encephalomalacia literally means "softening of the brain" and reflects chronic liquefactive necrosis with cystic change and tissue loss following a destructive insult such as infarction, trauma, infection, or hypoxia-ischemia; it is the end-stage of parenchymal injury rather than an acute process, which explains the characteristic chronic imaging features I expect to see [^notfound].

> On CT, I should confirm the classic appearance. Typical encephalomalacia appears as a hypodense cavity or area of low attenuation that follows CSF density, reflecting liquefied tissue and fluid content; this is often accompanied by regional volume loss and ex-vacuo ventricular or sulcal enlargement, and in some etiologies such as congenital infection, calcifications may be present within or adjacent to the malacic cavity, which CT detects readily [^d5c56ea1] [^c794879b].

> On MRI, I need to check the multi-sequence pattern carefully. Encephalomalacia typically shows low T1 signal and high T2/FLAIR signal that mirrors CSF, with FLAIR often highlighting the gliotic rim at the cavity margin; diffusion-weighted imaging is usually not restricted in chronic encephalomalacia, helping distinguish it from acute infarction where DWI restriction is expected; susceptibility sequences may reveal calcification or old hemorrhage depending on etiology, and 3D T1 or volumetric sequences help quantify volume loss and cortical thinning [^d5c56ea1] [^f459f952] [^69289ce3].

> Hold on, I should verify associated features that refine the diagnosis. Adjacent parenchymal volume loss with widened sulci and ex-vacuo ventriculomegaly is common, reflecting tissue destruction and compensatory CSF space expansion; in perinatal or hypoxic-ischemic contexts, multicystic encephalomalacia may develop with multiple cysts replacing white matter and cortex; calcifications, when present, are more conspicuous on CT but can be inferred on MRI with susceptibility techniques, particularly in congenital infections or metabolic disorders [^d5c56ea1] [^0cac1e03] [^c794879b].

> I will now examine temporal evolution, because I need to ensure I'm not mislabeling acute injury as chronic encephalomalacia. In the acute and early subacute phases, cytotoxic edema with DWI restriction predominates; over weeks to months, tissue liquefaction and cavitation evolve, culminating in chronic encephalomalacia with CSF-like signal and volume loss; serial imaging studies in infants and postoperative cohorts document this transition from restricted diffusion to cystic encephalomalacia, reinforcing the chronicity implied by the term [^f459f952] [^b5b0a967] [^4bbebce2].

> But wait, what if the pattern is multicystic or hydranencephalic rather than a solitary cavity. Multicystic encephalomalacia presents as multiple cystic spaces replacing cerebral parenchyma, often peritrigonal and parasagittal, with severe white matter loss, callosal thinning, and ex-vacuo ventriculomegaly; hydranencephaly represents an extreme form with near-complete destruction of cerebral hemispheres replaced by a CSF-filled sac, typically without mass effect, and both patterns reflect extensive prenatal or perinatal destructive injury rather than focal infarction [^d5c56ea1] [^17a12410].

> Next, I should review modality-specific strengths and limitations so I don't overstate either test. CT is fast, widely available, and excellent for detecting calcification and gross cavities, but it is less sensitive to subtle cortical injury, small cysts, and early gliosis; MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast, multiplanar detail, and detection of gliosis, cortical thinning, and associated malformations, and is the modality of choice for chronic parenchymal injury characterization, though it may miss tiny calcifications without susceptibility sequences and is less available emergently than CT [^c794879b] [^7a996766].

> Let me consider special etiologies and mimics so I don't anchor prematurely. In congenital infections such as CMV or Zika, calcifications and cortical malformations often accompany encephalomalacia; in perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, multicystic encephalomalacia and ulegyria are classic; in postoperative or ischemic infarct cavities, a chronic CSF-like cavity with a gliotic rim is expected; conversely, acute infarction shows restricted diffusion and cortical/subcortical T2 hyperintensity without cystic change, which should not be mislabeled as encephalomalacia on early imaging [^c794879b] [^0cac1e03] [^b5b0a967].

> I should double-check that my synthesis is clinically actionable. Typical encephalomalacia on CT appears as a hypodense, CSF-density cavity with regional volume loss and possible calcifications; on MRI, it shows low T1, high T2/FLAIR signal matching CSF, a FLAIR-bright gliotic rim, absent DWI restriction, and adjacent atrophy with ex-vacuo ventriculomegaly; multicystic forms show multiple CSF-like cavities with severe white matter loss, and calcifications, when present, are best confirmed on CT or susceptibility MRI; recognizing these patterns, along with clinical context and timing, helps distinguish encephalomalacia from acute edema, normal CSF spaces, and other cystic lesions [^d5c56ea1] [^f459f952] [^c794879b].

---

Encephalomalacia on CT and MRI appears as **parenchymal volume loss** with **CSF-like signal** replacement, reflecting chronic liquefactive necrosis. On CT, it is a **hypodense cavity** conforming to the involved territory, often with ex vacuo ventriculomegaly and sulcal widening [^d5c56ea1]. On MRI, it shows **low T1 and high T2/FLAIR** signal matching CSF, with a FLAIR rim of gliosis; DWI is typically unrestricted, and susceptibility sequences may show calcification or hemosiderin depending on etiology [^f459f952] [^c794879b]. These findings are most common in vascular territories, after trauma, infection, or hypoxia-ischemia, and help distinguish chronic encephalomalacia from acute edema or other cystic lesions [^4e6760cc] [^3d84360d].

---

## CT imaging findings

- **Hypodensity**: Encephalomalacia appears as a well-defined area of hypodensity that matches CSF density, indicating liquefactive necrosis and cystic change [^d5c56ea1].

- **Volume loss**: There is focal or diffuse parenchymal volume loss with ex vacuo dilatation of adjacent ventricles and sulci, reflecting chronic tissue destruction [^d5c56ea1].

- **Calcification**: Chronic cases may show calcifications at the lesion margins, especially after infection or hemorrhage [^c794879b].

- **Mass effect**: Typically absent or minimal, helping distinguish from acute edema or mass lesions [^notfound].

---

## MRI imaging findings

- **T1-weighted imaging**: Low signal intensity matching CSF, indicating chronic cystic change and tissue loss [^d5c56ea1].

- **T2-weighted imaging**: High signal intensity matching CSF, with a rim of gliosis that may be slightly hyperintense to CSF [^d5c56ea1].

- **FLAIR**: Suppressed CSF-like signal centrally with a peripheral gliotic rim that remains hyperintense, aiding differentiation from other cystic lesions [^notfound].

- **DWI**: Typically no restricted diffusion, indicating chronicity rather than acute infarct or infection [^notfound].

- **Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)**: May show calcification or hemosiderin deposition if prior hemorrhage or infection occurred [^c794879b].

---

## Common locations and etiologies

Encephalomalacia commonly occurs in **vascular territories** (MCA, PCA, ACA) due to infarction, as well as in regions of **traumatic contusion** or surgical injury [^d5c56ea1] [^b5b0a967]. It is also seen after **hypoxic-ischemic injury** (e.g. perinatal HIE, cardiac arrest) and following infections such as herpes encephalitis, CMV, or bacterial meningitis [^0c0b0fa2] [^3d84360d] [^c241a927].

---

## Differentiation from other lesions

| **Lesion** | **Ct findings** | **Mri findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Encephalomalacia | Hypodense, CSF-like cavity with volume loss | - CSF-like T1/T2 signal <br/> - Gliotic rim on FLAIR <br/> - No DWI restriction |
| Porencephalic cyst | - CSF-like cavity <br/> - Communicates with ventricle | - CSF-like signal <br/> - No gliotic rim <br/> - No DWI restriction |
| Arachnoid cyst | - Extra-axial <br/> - CSF-like density <br/> - No volume loss | - Extra-axial <br/> - CSF-like signal <br/> - No gliosis |
| Acute infarct | - Hypodense <br/> - Mass effect | - DWI restriction <br/> - T2 hyperintensity <br/> - No CSF-like change |

---

## Clinical significance

Encephalomalacia reflects **irreversible tissue loss** and is associated with permanent neurological deficits proportional to the involved cortex or white matter. It is a key marker of chronic brain injury on neuroimaging and helps distinguish chronic from acute processes [^0c0b0fa2].

---

Encephalomalacia on CT and MRI shows **CSF-like parenchymal cavities with volume loss** and a gliotic rim, enabling confident diagnosis and differentiation from acute edema or other cystic lesions when combined with clinical context [^d5c56ea1].

Leukodystrophies — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as gold standard and interpretation caveats: An MRI of the brain is the gold standard investigation in a patient with a suspected leukodystrophy or leukoencephalopathy, and MRI is preferable to CT for visualizing abnormal signal and because it involves less radiation exposure; key features on MRI include the presence of contrast enhancement, the presence of cysts, calcifications, or more subtle structural abnormalities, and the predominant location, confluent versus multifocal pattern, and signal changes including hypomyelination versus high T2 signal abnormality and the relative T1 signal hyper- or hypointensity are primary discriminating characteristics; although MRI algorithms are helpful for diagnosis, there are limitations on their sensitivity and specificity, and they require skilled radiologic interpretation and experience; in a child younger than 1 year with possible hypomyelination, a follow-up MRI of the brain after 24 months, or serial MRIs every 6 to 12 months, is recommended to establish the diagnosis of hypomyelination; overall, the MRI findings should be interpreted in concert with the findings of the clinical history and physical examination.

### Huge chronic subdural haematoma formation in an encephalomalacia stroke cavity [^f92b6f02]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A patient suffering from a cerebrovascular ischaemic stroke may present similar symptoms to a patient with a chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH). Head CT imaging of an old extensive hemispheric infarction may appear hypodense in a similar fashion as CSDH. We described a 46-year-old man with a 2-week history of mild headache and worsening right lower extremity hemiparesis. Eight years prior, he suffered a left middle cerebral artery territory infarct. The head CT scan showed a huge, slightly hypodense area on the left brain, causing a significant mass effect. A new stroke was of concern versus a chronic subdural haematoma inside the old encephalomalacia stroke cavity. Only three previously reported cases of CSDH occupying an encephalomalacic cavity had been reported. This rare presentation should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with a history of cerebrovascular stroke. MRI is useful in making a correct diagnosis.

### Magnetic resonance imaging criteria for post-concussion syndrome: a study of 127 post-concussion syndrome patients [^cc4f7919]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of structural lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in a large prospective cohort of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) patients. Conventional 3T MRI was used to evaluate 127 prospectively enrolled PCS patients and 29 controls for non-specific white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and traumatic structural lesions, including encephalomalacia, atrophy, microhemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cortical siderosis. All PCS patients had a clinical diagnosis of one or more concussions based on the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) consensus statements. Patients with recognized intracranial hemorrhage on prior head computed tomography (CT) and MRI were excluded. The differences between the PCS and control groups were analyzed. Four patients in the PCS group (3.1%) had positive findings, which included microhemorrhages in two patients and encephalomalacia in another two patients. None of these lesions was present in the control group, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups (p = 0.5 for microhemorrhage and p = 0.5 for encephalomalacia). In the PCS group, 28 patients (22%) had WMH (15.7% had 1–10 lesions and 6.3% had > 10 lesions), and these results did not differ from the age-matched control (20.6%, all with 1–10 lesions; p = 0.9) The location of the WMH showed no significant difference in the number of juxtacortical WMH between the PCS and control groups (p = 0.5). Structural lesions were rare in PCS in this study, and the presence of such findings suggests a more severe form of traumatic brain injury. Our data support the role for MRI in the diagnosis of PCS by exclusion of atrophy, encephalomalacia, and all forms of intracranial hemorrhage. The presence of WMH irrespective of number is not an exclusion. This is the first description of the MRI criteria for PCS.

### Head ultrasound, CT or MRI? The choice of neuroimaging in the assessment of infants with congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^97020c18]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging and clinical classification

Neuroimaging was performed routinely at the baseline evaluation (at time of diagnosis, in the first 21 days of life) of all infants with cCMV, and the choice was at the discretion of the treating physician. Only patients who underwent sequential US and MRI or CT were included in this analysis. Ultrasound over the anterior fontanel was performed by a pediatric radiologist. Subsequent imaging (CT or MRI) was at the discretion of the treating physician, or at the recommendation of the radiologist following ultrasound findings. Multi-detector scanners were used for computed tomography (CT) without sedation, using non-ionic iodinated contrast agents. Contrast enhanced MRI was performed with sedation (IV Pentobarbital) for all infants. Standard protocols included sagittal and axial T1 weighted images, axial T2, coronal FLAIR and axial diffusion weighted imaging. Non-ionic Gadolinium based contrast agents were used and 3D T1 weighted sequence was acquired after the injection. The neuroimaging results were categorized as normal or abnormal based on the absence or presence of any findings suggestive of cCMV infection, as reported to the treating physician by pediatric radiologists aware of the diagnosis of cCMV infection. The following findings were considered abnormal: intracerebral calcifications, lentriculostriate vasculopathy, periventricular leucomalacia, ventriculomegaly, cortical or cerebellar malformations, migration defects, cystic abnormalities, and white matter abnormalities.

Routine baseline evaluation for all infants included audiology and ophthalmology assessments, blood work (complete blood count, liver function tests, and bilirubin) and detailed physical examination by a pediatrician. Infants were considered symptomatic if they had one or more of the following: persistent thrombocytopenia (more than one platelet count of < 100,000/uL), petechiae, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hepatitis (raised transaminases), conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, systemic signs such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), central nervous system involvement such as microcephaly, radiological abnormalities consistent with CMV central nervous system disease (see above), chorioretinitis, sensineural hearing loss (SNHL), abnormal cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid indices for age, or the detection of CMV DNA in CSF fluid.

### Neuroradiological mimics of periventricular leukomalacia [^6a868bc7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a term reserved to describe white matter injury in the premature brain. In this review article, the authors highlight the common and rare pathologies mimicking the chronic stage of PVL and propose practical clinico-radiological criteria that would aid in diagnosis and management.

Methods and Results

The authors first describe the typical brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) features of PVL. Based on their clinical presentation, pathologic entities and their neuroimaging findings were clustered into distinct categories. Three clinical subgroups were identified: healthy children, children with stable/nonprogressive neurological disorder, and those with progressive neurological disorder. The neuroradiological discriminators are described in each subgroup with relevant differential diagnoses. The mimics were broadly classified into normal variants, acquired, and inherited disorders.

Conclusions

The term "PVL" should be used appropriately as it reflects its pathomechanism. The phrase "white matter injury of prematurity" or "brain injury of prematurity" is more specific. Discrepancies in imaging and clinical presentation must be tread with caution and warrant further investigations to exclude other possibilities.

Pattern 4: T2 hyperintensity in supratentorial white matter

Diffuse or confluent supratentorial white matter T2 hyperintensities, in the absence of DWI changes related to cytotoxic oedema, suggest abnormalities such as gliosis and/or encephalomalacia (as the end-product of prior or longstanding infection). In the neonatal setting, congenital TORCH infections (toxoplasma, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus) come to mind as important differentials with manifestations in supratentorial white matter. The presence of calcification is likewise an indicator of brain parenchymal injury during the early stages of life, arising from parenchymal necrosis in conjunction with an immature immune system and the impaired phagocytic ability of macrophages.

The timing of TORCH infection is central to its imaging manifestations. Early in-utero infection, such as during the early stages of the second trimester of pregnancy, is more likely to result in malformations of cortical development (lissencephaly-pachygyria or polymicrogyria), brain volume loss and diffuse white matter abnormality (pattern 4A — Figs. 10, 11 and 12). Conversely, TORCH infection during late third trimester of pregnancy is seen without neuronal migration abnormality, and any long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae are typically less severe (pattern 4B — Fig. 13). Although post-natal imaging depicts the sequela of infection rather than ongoing infectious encephalitis, being able to differentiate between early and late in utero TORCH infection has important prognostic implications, and establishes the utility of MRI in the work-up of infants and young children with abnormal neurology/development.

CSF analysis was consistent with neurotoxoplasmosis. T2-weighted imaging (a) demonstrated diffuse white matter hyperintensity, widespread abnormal cortical development and hydrocephalus. Lesions were seen throughout the cerebral hemispheres, in the periventricular regions (arrow), basal ganglia and the thalami. Post-contrast T1-weighted imaging (b) demonstrated peripheral enhancement of parenchymal lesions, and ependymal enhancement in the lateral ventricles (reflecting ventriculitis). On a T2✱-weighted sequence (c), foci of susceptibility artefact corresponded to areas of haemorrhage and calcification (secondary to parenchymal necrosis). Non-contrast CT head performed 5 months later (d) better demonstrated regions of periventricular calcification

Neuroimaging findings

The incidence of abnormal head imaging in 918 children was 20.6% (189 cases, 20.6%, 95% CI: 18.0, 23.2) (Table 5). The top two changes of the incidence were subdural fluid collection/empyema and hydrocephalus, (73 cases, 8.0%, 95% CI: 6.2, 9.7), (46 cases, 5.0%, 95% CI: 3.6, 6.4), respectively. Encephalomalacia (36 cases, 3.9%), cerebral hemorrhage (16 cases, 1.7%), ependymitis (11 cases, 1.2%), cerebral infarction (9 cases, 0.98%), brain abscess (8 cases, 0.87%) and other abnormalities (33 cases, 3.6%) (such as cerebral edema, meningeal enhancement, frontal subcortical punctate abnormal signal, etc.) were also observed. The incidence of all brain imaging changes was different among the three groups. Specifically, the incidence of abnormalities was markedly higher in the confirmed and clinical groups (35.8%, 26.2%) than that in the probable group (9.5%). And the incidence of subdural fluid collection/empyema in the confirmed group (16%) was much higher than that in the clinical group (8%) and the probable group (3.9%). There was no significant difference in subdural fluid collection/empyema when gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria appeared (P > 0.05) (Table 6).

### Head ultrasound, CT or MRI? The choice of neuroimaging in the assessment of infants with congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^0a943810]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Although neuroimaging clearly plays an important role in the assessment of affected children, interpretation can be challenging given the wide spectrum of brain abnormalities which are often nonspecific and may be difficult to measure. Ventriculomegaly, diagnosed on US in 2 patients (cases 8 and 9) whose MRIs were subsequently reported as normal, can be difficult to diagnose, with measurements of ventricular diameter that can differ significantly between sonographers, and disagreement with MRI in up to 11% of cases. Moreover, in our study, cystic abnormalities were the most frequent finding, seen in 37% of patients overall, in contrast to cerebral calcifications which are more commonly reported in the literature, occurring in 34–91% of cases and ventriculomegaly, seen up to 45% of cases. Intracranial cysts, though potentially a stigma of cCMV infection, are also reported in the general population, with a prevalence ranging from 0.5–5.2%. Therefore, it is not clear if these findings on HUS represent true sequelae of cCMV infection, or a normal variant. In all 5 discordant cases of abnormal US followed by normal MRI or CT in our study, cystic abnormalities were present on US but in association to other findings (Table 2). Further study is necessary to determine the significance of these mild abnormalities on HUS.

### CT and MR in non-neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: radiological findings with pathophysiological correlations [^4e6760cc]. Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Non-neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a clinical condition often related to cardiopulmonary arrest that demands critical management and treatment decisions. Management depends mainly on the degree of neurological impairment and prognostic considerations. Computed tomography (CT) is often used to exclude associated or mimicking pathology. If any, only nonspecific signs such as cerebral edema, sulci effacement, and decreased gray matter (GM)/white matter (WM) differentiation are evident. Pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage, a GM/WM attenuation ratio < 1.18, and inverted GM attenuation are associated with a poor prognosis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is more sensitive than CT in assessing brain damage in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Some MR findings have similarities to those seen pathologically, based on spatial distribution and time scale, such as lesions distributed in watershed regions and selective injury to GM structures. In the acute phase, lesions are better depicted using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) because of the presence of cytotoxic edema, which, on T2-weighted images, only become apparent later in the early subacute phase. In the late subacute phase, postanoxic leukoencephalopathy and contrast enhancement could be observed. In the chronic phase, atrophic changes predominate over tissue signal changes. MR can be useful for estimating prognosis when other tests are inconclusive. Some findings, such as the extent of lesions on DWI and presence of a lactate peak and depleted N-acetyl aspartate peak on MR spectroscopy, seem to have prognostic value.

### Incidental findings on brain and spine imaging in children… [^f96e7eaf]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Choroidal Fissure Cyst The choroidal fissure can be found on the mesial surface of the temporal lobe between the hippocampus and the diencephalon, and a choroidal fissure cyst is a loculated cavity filled with CSF lying in the fissure. The relationship of the cyst to the fissure is best visualized on coronal brain imaging; on axial imaging, the location of this structure can be misconstrued. 26 Its prevalence among children and adults undergoing MRI for unrelated reasons is 1. 5% to 4%. 27, – 31 The concern is that filum lipoma may be a cause of or marker for spinal cord tethering. 32 Symptoms of tethered cord syndrome include back and lower extremity pain, urologic abnormalities, lower extremity weakness, gait disturbance, and foot and ankle deformities such as pes cavus. Characteristic features are exacerbation by Valsalva-type events and relief with recumbency.

Anatomically consistent radiculopathy indicates neurosurgical referral, and when the nature of the presenting symptoms is obscure, neurosurgical consultation is necessary as well. No imaging surveillance is required in most cases. Incidental Vascular Lesions Four types of vascular malformations are recognized in the central nervous system: arteriovenous malformation, cavernous hemangioma, developmental venous malformation, and telangiectasia. The last of these lesions, telangiectasia, is almost invisible on CT scan. It requires selected MRI sequences, contrast administration, and ideally, high magnet strengths for clear identification. Pineal Cysts Pineal cysts are also frequently discovered on brain MRIs in children. Pineal cysts have a typical appearance on MRI. Cyst contents may be either isointense or slightly hyperintense to CSF on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging.

104, 108, 114, – 116 The cyst rim appears smooth and thin in most cases, but multiple septations within the cyst itself is a common finding. 111, 112, 117 Many benign pineal cysts show evidence of irregular nodular enhancement or ring enhancement on MRI 118, 119 because of surrounding venous structures or the displaced pineal tissue. 101, 103, 120, 121.

### MRI and CT appearances in metabolic encephalopathies due to systemic diseases in adults [^17d80d0c]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The term encephalopathy refers to a clinical scenario of diffuse brain dysfunction, commonly due to a systemic, metabolic, or toxic derangement. Often the clinical evaluation is unsatisfactory in this scenario and imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis, assessment of treatment response, and prognostication of the disorder. Hence, it is important for radiologists to be familiar with the imaging features of some relatively frequently acquired metabolic encephalopathies encountered in the hospital setting. This study reviews the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of a number of metabolic encephalopathies that occur as part of systemic diseases in adults. The following conditions are covered in this review: hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, non-ketotic hyperglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, uraemic encephalopathy, hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. MRI is the imaging method of choice in evaluating these conditions. Due to their high metabolic activity, bilateral basal ganglia changes are evident in the majority of cases. Concurrent imaging abnormalities in other parts of the central nervous system often provide useful diagnostic information about the likely underlying cause of the encephalopathy. Besides this, abnormal signal intensity and diffusion restriction patterns on MRI and MR spectroscopy features may provide important clues as to the diagnosis and guide further management. Frequently, the diagnosis is not straightforward and typical imaging features require correlation with clinical and laboratory data for accurate assessment.

### MR imaging features of middle cranial fossa encephaloceles and their associations with epilepsy [^93b2cff5]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Middle cranial fossa encephaloceles are an increasingly recognized cause of epilepsy; however, they are also often encountered on neuroimaging in patients with no history of seizure. We characterized the MR imaging features of middle cranial fossa encephaloceles in seizure and nonseizure groups with the hope of uncovering features predictive of epileptogenicity.

Materials and Methods

Seventy-seven patients with middle cranial fossa encephaloceles were prospectively identified during routine clinical practice of neuroradiology at a tertiary care hospital during an 18-month period. Thirty-five of 77 (45%) had a history of seizure, 20/77 (26%) had temporal lobe epilepsy, and 42/77 (55%) had no history of seizures. Middle cranial fossa encephalocele features on MR imaging were characterized, including depth, area, number, location, presence of adjacent encephalomalacia, and degree of associated parenchymal morphologic distortion. MR imaging features were compared between the seizure and nonseizure groups.

Results

No significant difference in MR imaging features of middle cranial fossa encephaloceles was seen when comparing the seizure and nonseizure groups. Comparison of just those patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 20) with those with no history of seizure (n = 42) also found no significant difference in MR imaging features.

Conclusions

Anatomic MR imaging features of middle cranial fossa encephaloceles such as size, number, adjacent encephalomalacia, and the degree of adjacent parenchymal morphologic distortion may not be useful in predicting likelihood of epileptogenicity.

Abnormal CNS findings

These are findings that are not encountered under normal conditions and often with a pathological background.
Ventriculomegaly (Figs. 6, 7) This refers to enlargement of the cerebral ventricles, defined as a trans-trigone measurement of ≥ 10 mm at any stage of pregnancy. It is charactered as mild (10–12 mm), moderate (13–15 mm) or severe (> 15 mm). This condition is one of the most commonly detected foetal anomalies at the mid-trimester US study. While foetal ventriculomegaly is a non-specific finding on foetal imaging, it can be associated with multiple aetiologies and a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes. In some cases it may be the only abnormal finding, leading to the term "isolated ventriculomegaly", which has been related to an increased risk of aneuploidy (particularly trisomy 21). Foetal ventriculomegaly can result from hydrocephalus, but it can also be secondary to poor brain development or loss of brain tissue. Certain abnormalities related to foetal ventriculomegaly such as corpus callosum agenesis can be better detected on foetal MRI than US. It is worth mentioning that ventriculomegaly can resolve in 50% of cases between the antenatal and post-mortem imaging period, possibly due to fluid shifts following death.
Periventricular white matter injury This is defined as an increased T2-signal of the periventricular white matter. It is a non-specific finding that can be found in multiple pathological situations, but also as normal post-mortem physiological changes. Among the pathological causes, periventricular leukomalacia occurs as a result of hypoxic-ischaemic lesions resulting from impaired perfusion in the intervascular areas of the brain. The vascular supply to the brain changes with brain maduration. In the immature brain (before 36 weeks), ventriculopetal penetrating arteries extend inward from the surface of the brain to supply the periventricular regions; hence periventricular leukomalacia is the most common pathologic finding in hypoperfusion injury. When evaluated by MRI, the acute phase of periventricular leukomalacia is characterised by areas of focal necrosis in the white matter, typically adjacent to the trigones of the lateral ventricles. Subsequently, these lesions acquire a cystic appearance. In the late stages, ventricular size increases due to loss of brain volume and narrowing of the corpus callosum.
Cystic periventricular lesions (Figs. 8, 9) Many conditions can lead to foetal brain cysts, but the number and location of cysts can help to determine the underlying cause. The presence of small multiple subependymal periventricular and temporal pole cysts are highly suggestive of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Among the "STORCH" infections (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, other infections, rubella, CMV and herpes simplex), CMV is the most common and has the highest mortality rate. Periventricular calcification (difficult to assess by MRI), malformations of cortical development (lissencephaly and polymicrogyria) and ventriculomegaly can also be found in CMV infection. The subacute phase of periventricular leukomalacia of the foetus may also present with periventricular cystic lesions, corresponding to necrosis of the white matter, typically located adjacent to the trigones of the lateral ventricles. Subependymal cystic lesions can also be found as sequelae of intraventricular haemorrhage. Porencephalic cysts are other lesions originating from an insult to the foetal brain (hypoxic-ischaemic injury, intraparenchymal haemorrhage, infection, etc.). These are usually located in the cerebral hemispheres and typically communicate with the ventricular system.
Intracranial haemorrhage (Fig. 10) The majority of intracranial haemorrhages are easily depicted on MRI, but differentiation between ante-mortem and post-mortem haemorrhage can be difficult. As mentioned above, small intraventricular bleeds in early gestation foetuses are likely to be considered a normal post-mortem physiologic MRI finding. On the other hand, large haemorrhages are rare in older foetuses, and therefore tend to be considered as a potential cause of death. These are usually secondary to brain haemorrhagic infarctions. In the context of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, cerebral haemorrhage may be associated with periventricular white matter injury. Haemorrhages may also be found in association with other inflammatory processes or infections such as CMV. When intraventricular haemorrhage is present, clots are visualised within the ventricles and may be accompanied by ventriculomegaly. As mentioned above, intracranial haemorrhages can result in cystic sequelae (subependymal cysts and/or porencephalic cysts).
Hydranencephaly (Fig. 11) This is a rare encephalopathy characterised by the absence/destruction of the cerebral hemispheres, which are replaced by a cavity filled with cerebrospinal fluid and residual brain tissue. It is usually sporadic and its cause remains unknown. On MRI it manifests as extensive areas of cystic encephalomalacia, relatively symmetrical and without mass effect.
Congenital brain tumours Foetal intracranial tumours are rare, and they are most often located in the supratentorial region. Teratomas are the most frequent foetal CNS tumours, accounting for approximately half of all reported cases. They are followed in frequency by neuroepithelial tumours and lipomas. Dysembrioplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNET) (Fig. 12) is a benign tumour (WHO Grade I) of neuroepithelial origin that arises from cortical or deep grey matter, and it is mostly located in the temporal lobe (62%). Although the vast majority of DNET are confined to the cortical grey matter, they can also arise from the caudate nucleus, cerebellum or pons. They are characterised by a mixture of astrocytes and oligodendroglial elements, in association with "floating neurons" and mucinous degeneration.
Neuronal migration disorders (NMD) (Fig. 13) These are also defined as "malformations of cortical development" and comprise a heterogeneous group of situations in which there is an abnormal cortical organisation. These alterations may occur sporadically, be associated with genetic alterations or be linked to an insult during intrauterine neuronal development such as CMV infection. Lissencephaly consists of cortical thickening associated with a variable lack of normal brain circumvolutions, and although it can be diagnosed from the onset of sulcation, it is more obvious in the third trimester. Heterotopia of grey matter refers to ectopic neuronal clusters most often located subependymal in the lateral ventricles, although they can be located anywhere in the cerebrum or cerebellum. Polymicrogyria consists of small supernumerary gyri, which if not extensive can be very difficult to detect. Schizencephaly presents as a cleft demarcated by polymicrogyric grey matter that extends from the cortical surface to the ventricular margin.

### Clinical features and neuroimaging (CT and MRI) findings in presumed zika virus related congenital infection and microcephaly: retrospective case series study [^c794879b]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Several features found in children with presumed Zika virus related infection are similar to those encountered in congenital infections of the central nervous system due to other agents such as Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, rubella, and herpes simplex virus (TORCH), including decreased brain volume, ventriculomegaly, malformations of cortical development, and simplified gyral pattern, delayed myelination, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Table 8compares the major neuroimaging features of TORCH infections, and the characteristics of imaging findings in children with presumed Zika virus related congenital infection.

*Toxoplasma, other viruses, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus.

†Onset at beginning of second trimester.

‡Onset in middle of second trimester.

Intracranial calcifications, present in all the children in our study, are an important feature of congenital central nervous system infection but they are also seen in other genetic and metabolic diseases. The pattern and location of calcifications and other abnormalities can suggest a possible cause. For example, calcifications in periventricular areas is more common in congenital infection related to cytomegalovirus. Another characteristic that may suggest cytomegalovirus as the causal agent in a microcephalic child is the presence of temporal and germinal zone cysts. In our series, calcification was found most often at the junction between cortical and subcortical white matter, and intraparenchymal cysts were not observed in any of the children in our study.

Although CT has been the mainstay of imaging for intracranial calcification for many years and remains superior for identification and delineation, we were able to detect calcifications on MRI. Interestingly, in our series the calcifications were seen as hyperintense on T1 weighted images and hypointense on susceptibility magnetic weighted images. Besides calcifications, these types of signal can also indicate, for example, methaemoglobin, manganese deposition, melanin, and lipid on T1 weighted images; iron deposition, deoxyhaemoglobin, hemosiderin/ferritin on T2✱ weightedand susceptibility magnetic weighted images; and small veins in susceptibility magnetic weighted images. Among all MRI techniques, susceptibility magnetic weighted imaging was found to increase the sensitivity of MRI to intracranial calcifications considerably. Of the eight patients who underwent MRI, seven also underwent CT scan; the punctate images observed on MRI scans corresponded to the calcifications seen on CT scans in all of them. Hyper-hydrated calcium in a brain not yet myelinated can explain the appearance on the T1 weighted scans.

### ⁹ ⁹ mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer cranial single-photon emission computed tomography and serial cranial magnetic resonance imaging in a girl with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency [^e16f21b8]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder, is easily misdiagnosed as the more common hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. A female term infant was diagnosed with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging at ages 13 days, 2 months, and 10 months indicated diffuse edema with posterior predominance, followed by progressive multicystic encephalomalacia and brain atrophy with relatively sparing of the thalami. Single-photon emission computed tomography using (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer at 2 months revealed decreased uptake in the frontal lobes. The characteristic neuroimaging findings in isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency help differentiate it from hypoxic insult. The correct diagnosis is helpful in genetic counseling for parents.

### Clinical and radiographic features of peritumoral infarction following resection of glioblastoma [^fb84bdaa]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Focal areas of restricted diffusion adjacent to high-grade glioma resection cavities were detected in 70% of patients on immediate postoperative MRI studies. Follow-up studies demonstrated cystic encephalomalacia in 91% of these foci, suggesting the presence of infarction, and the infarcted tissue demonstrated enhancement in 43% of cases. New postoperative deficits correlated well with the anatomic region of infarction in six patients. Enhancement in perioperative infarcts can mimic tumor progression on follow-up imaging studies.

### What to see when you are looking at confusion: a review of the neuroimaging of acute encephalopathy [^89cc855f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Acute encephalopathy is a clinical conundrum in neurocritical care facing physicians with diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Encephalopathy arises from several concurrent causes, and delayed diagnosis adds to its grim prognosis. Diagnosis is reached by melding clinical, neurophysiological and biochemical features with various neuroimaging studies. We aimed to compile the pathophysiology of acute encephalopathies in adults, and the contribution of cerebral CT, MRI, MR spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) to early diagnosis, treatment and prognostication. Reports from 1990 to 2013 were identified. Therefore, reference lists were searched to identify additional publications. Encephalopathy syndromes best studied by neuroimaging emerge from hypoxic-ischaemic injury, sepsis, metabolic derangements, autoimmune diseases, infections and rapidly evolving dementias. Typical and pathognomonic neuroimaging patterns are presented. Cerebral imaging constitutes an important component of diagnosis, management and prognosis of acute encephalopathy. Its respective contribution is dominated by rapid exclusion of acute cerebral lesions and further varies greatly depending on the underlying aetiology and the range of possible differential diagnoses. CT has been well studied, but is largely insensitive, while MRI appears to be the most helpful in the evaluation of encephalopathies. MRS may provide supplementary biochemical information and determines spectral changes in the affected brain tissue. The less frequently used PET and SPECT may delineate areas of high or low metabolic activity or cerebral blood flow. However, publications of MRS, PET and SPECT are limited only providing anecdotal evidence of their usefulness and sensitivity.

### Head ultrasound, CT or MRI? The choice of neuroimaging in the assessment of infants with congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^3ffab43f]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that that sequential US and MRI or CT were concordant in the majority (71%) of cases in detecting abnormalities potentially associated with cCMV infection. Among discordant cases, these results had an impact on clinical management, but only among patients who had no other symptoms that met treatment criteria. Specifically, we found that normal US during the postnatal assessment was followed by abnormal MRI or CT in 15% (5/28) of cases who underwent sequential imaging, however these children were all clinically symptomatic and these findings did not influence the decision to treat, given that our threshold for treatment was low. However, this may not be the case across all centers, where strict application of consensus criteria without performing an MRI may miss children who would benefit from treatment. For example in case 2, treatment was initiated due to isolated IUGR, which could be a manifestation of systemic cCMV infection, however, not universally recognized as a criteria for treatment. In this case, adherence to consensus criteria and relying on HUS alone would have missed neurological disease in this child, resulting in a missed opportunity for treatment. These results suggest that in infants suspected neurological involvement or neurological abnormalities by exam, MRI should be performed primarily.

Among discordant cases of abnormal US followed by normal MRI or CT (5/34), in 2 of these cases (8 and 9), the decision to treat was based solely on US findings of cystic formations and lenstriculostriate vasculopathy in the absence of other clinical findings. Treatment, once initiated, was not stopped after MRI results given delays in obtaining MRI, resulting in unnecessary treatment for otherwise asymptomatic newborns in 6% of all cases overall (2/34). Case 6 was asymptomatic with isolated SNHL. While some centers, including our own, recommended treatment for these patients, if applying the consensus criteria (which does not currently recommend treatment for asymptomatic patients with isolated SNHL), this patient would have also been unnecessarily treated if relying solely on HUS findings. In short, in otherwise asymptomatic infants or those with isolated SNHL with mild abnormalities on HUS, early advanced neuroimaging within the first month of life is essential to determining the need for treatment.

### Brain tumour post-treatment imaging and treatment-related complications [^4bbebce2]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Diffusion restriction in the setting of cellular injury has been well described in the literature in the setting of vascular infarction. In the postoperative setting, cellular injury is also very common with one study demonstrating new diffusion restriction surrounding the surgical cavity in 64% of resected gliomas, of which 93% went on to develop encephalomalacia on serial imaging, suggesting cellular injury (Fig. 2). In the postoperative setting, cellular injury is multifactorial, most commonly due to direct surgical trauma, vascular injury, and devascularisation of tumour. In all cases, diffusion restriction occurs because of cellular injury resulting in acute intracellular swelling, which in turn decreases the extracellular space for protons to move about. Like vascular infarction, post-treatment cytotoxic oedema often demonstrates a phase of contrast enhancement in the subacute phase that resolves on follow-up imaging as encephalomalacia forms. It is therefore very important to correlate any new enhancement with the immediate postoperative DWI so as not to erroneously diagnose tumour progression when it is actually postoperative injury.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in children with a first recognized seizure [^442c345a]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

This study characterized structural abnormalities associated with onset of seizures in children, using magnetic resonance imaging and a standardized classification system in a large prospective cohort. Two hundred eighty-one children aged 6–14 years completed magnetic resonance imaging within 6 months of their first recognized seizure. Most examinations were performed with a standardized, dedicated seizure protocol; all were scored using a standard scoring system. At least one magnetic resonance imaging abnormality was identified in 87 of 281 (31%) children with a first recognized seizure. Two or more abnormalities were identified in 34 (12%). The commonest abnormalities were ventricular enlargement (51%), leukomalacia/gliosis (23%), gray-matter lesions such as heterotopias and cortical dysplasia (12%), volume loss (12%), other white-matter lesions (9%), and encephalomalacia (6%). Abnormalities defined as significant, or potentially related to seizures, occurred in 40 (14%). Temporal lobe and hippocampal abnormalities were detected at a higher frequency than in previous studies (13/87). Magnetic resonance imaging and a standardized, reliable, valid scoring system demonstrated a higher rate of abnormal findings than previously reported, including findings formerly considered incidental. Practice parameters may need revision, to expand the definition of significant abnormalities and support wider use of magnetic resonance imaging in children with newly diagnosed seizures.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, part 1: fundamental imaging and clinical features [^fa13e49e]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2008). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurotoxic state coupled with a unique CT or MR imaging appearance. Recognized in the setting of a number of complex conditions (preeclampsia/eclampsia, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, organ transplantation, autoimmune disease and high dose chemotherapy) the imaging, clinical and laboratory features of this toxic state are becoming better elucidated. This review summarizes the basic and advanced imaging features of PRES, along with pertinent features of the clinical and laboratory presentation and available histopathology. Many common imaging/clinical/laboratory observations are present among these patients, despite the perception of widely different associated clinical conditions.

### The child with macrocephaly: differential diagnosis and neuroimaging findings [^b6fab9a4]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to offer a systematic approach to the imaging of children with macrocephaly and to illustrate key neuroimaging features of common and rare but important disorders.

Conclusion

Macrocephaly is a common clinical finding in children. Increased volume of one of the intracranial compartments can enlarge the head either prenatally or postnatally while the cranial sutures are open. Imaging plays a central role in establishing a diagnosis and guiding management.

### Prevention of growing skull fractures: report of 2 cases [^567836e9]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The author describes 2 cases of children with growing skull fractures (GSFs). Surgical exploration of the widened fracture shortly after the head injury failed to reveal a dural tear because the neuroimaging studies (MR images, CT scans, and skull radiographs) had not been accurately interpreted, thereby allowing the development of a GSF at the site of the actual dural injury. In both cases, the dural and bony defect and the leptomeningeal cyst were successfully repaired. To prevent GSFs associated with progressive neurological deficit, seizure, ventricular porencephaly, and encephalomalacia, the author surgically explores wide skull fractures in young children with head injury whose MR images demonstrate brain herniation through the dura mater. The importance of a brief delay in surgical exploration is emphasized to allow cerebral edema to resolve and the patient's condition to become medically stabilized.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^d210c948]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — brain imaging — Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis for patients with unexplained neurological and psychiatric symptoms and frequently reveals findings consistent with Wilson disease, with typical MRI findings including signal changes in the basal ganglia, thalami, pons, and white matter, as well as atrophy; the so-called "face of the giant panda sign", which consists of increased T2 signal in the midbrain, has been considered pathognomonic for Wilson disease, but several other findings are more commonly seen. Patients with extensive changes on brain imaging, such as evidence of tissue cavitation, are less likely to improve with treatment, and in general, repeated MRIs are not useful for determining prognosis or monitoring neurological progression. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain has limited utility for assessing Wilson disease.

The differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute encephalopathy is broad. Imaging can help in narrowing the differential in many cases. We pictorially review the more classic MRI features of several acute toxic and acquired metabolic encephalopathies.

Conclusion

After completing this article, the reader will have knowledge of the more common imaging appearances of toxic and acquired metabolic encephalopathies, which will help in correctly identifying the cause of encephalopathy in some patients.

### Practice parameter: diagnostic assessment of the child with status epilepticus (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice committee of the Child Neurology Society [^b8306963]. Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Pediatric status epilepticus — neuroimaging findings and yield: In class III data, imaging was abnormal in 29% (n = 11), with dysplasia in 4, atrophy, infarction, and infection in 2 each, and calcifications in 1. In a small class III series, MRI was done in 9 of 24 children with SE with imaging findings normal in two and abnormal in seven of the nine children (78%), with two each having atrophy, hydrocephalus, or cerebritis and one infarction. Overall, data from 20 class III studies found lesions likely detectable with neuroimaging in 7.8% of children, based on a denominator of all available subjects; under-representation of cortical dysplasia as an etiology is noted to be likely due to the lower sensitivity of CT scanning in detecting such malformations.

Plain films of the skull are only mandatory if non-accidental trauma is suspected. Head sonography allows demonstration of pericerebral effusion. A widening of the inter-hemispheric fissure greater than 6 mm is abnormal. Echogenicity of this abnormal space, visibility of the arachnoid membrane and vessels in the pericerebral effusion are important. Ultrasound can also assess the size of the ventricular system.

Head CT has to be performed in emergency when neurological signs or trauma are present. CT evaluates location and density of pericerebral spaces, but also brain parenchyma. MRI is indicated when CT is equivocal or discordant with clinical signs, or in order to give more details about pericerebral spaces or parenchymal lesions. The examination should include T1-weighted images (two orthogonal planes), T2-weighted or gradient-echo T2✱ to better detect degradation products of haemoglobin; susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is more sensitive for small haemorrhages and is considered as the best tool to depict a bleeding. FLAIR is useful for demonstrating extra axial, acute bleeding. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is also mandatory to look for hypoxic-ischaemic changes and axonal injuries.

Diagnosis

Multiple aetiologies are associated with an abnormality of meningeal spaces. Elements that will allow more accurate diagnosis are:
The clinical data: trauma, infection, curve of the head circumference, other neurological signs.
The exact topography of the effusion and its nature: pure fluid, hematic, purulent.

Increased head circumference

Benign macrocephaly corresponds to an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid spaces. The exact pathophysiology is poorly understood (transient immaturity of CSF resorption? Another anomaly?). Clinically, the main sign is the increase in head circumference with a wide fontanel. This increase may be present at birth or appears secondarily. Psychomotor development is usually normal or only slightly disturbed, with axial hypotonicity. Imaging shows a bilateral subarachnoid effusion, which predominates in the frontal region. The evolution is usually favourable: head circumference may remain high; in some cases delayed psychomotor development will still be present. Rarely, complications can occur: clinical signs of poor tolerance may be in relation with the occurrence of acute bleeding; tensioning cortical bridging veins by the effusion may be a contributing factor, but this point is discussed. Parents should be warned of this risk of progression to avoid shaking. This requires clinical monitoring and new exploration to further understand the reasons for any changes in clinical status.

### Foetal disruptive brain injuries: diagnosing the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms with cranial ultrasonography [^d2052c18]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Antenatal destructive events affecting the central nervous system of the foetus lead to disruptive brain lesions that are often associated with impaired neurodevelopment. The pathogenesis of these lesions encompasses a range of causes, including haemorrhagic, embolic, or other vascular events; exposure to teratogens, such as drugs or substance abuse; congenital brain infections; genetic conditions; and metabolic disorders. Cranial ultrasonography is the first‐line imaging modality to diagnose these antepartum brain lesions in the newborn infant; it is often complemented by brain magnetic resonance imaging to detect associated neuronal dysmigration and dysplasia. Using a pictorial approach, a differential diagnosis of foetal disruptive brain lesions and common findings related to antenatal brain damage can be made, including antenatal haemorrhagic and ischaemic brain injuries, porencephaly, schizencephaly, multicystic encephalomalacia, and hydranencephaly, as well as germinolytic cysts and lenticulostriate vasculopathy. The main conditions associated with foetal brain disruption, such as genetic cerebral vascular diseases, monochorionic twin pregnancies, congenital heart disease, maternal drug use, congenital infections, and inborn errors of metabolism can be used to illustrate typical imaging patterns that, when combined with clinical presentation, can assist in identifying the underlying mechanisms and causes, thus supporting individualized patient management.

What this paper adds

Teratogens, intrauterine infection, hypoxia‐ischaemia, haemorrhage, and trauma can cause disruptive brain injury in the foetus.
This disruption can interfere with normal cellular organization and differentiation, leading to dysplastic changes.
Disruptive foetal brain injuries are typically sporadic, but some neuroimaging patterns or familial presentation may indicate an underlying genetic disorder.
Integrated neuroimaging findings, clinical manifestations, and genetic testing enhance aetiological diagnosis, and individualized treatment and management strategies.

Disruptive brain abnormalities result from a destructive process affecting the foetal central nervous system (CNS). These destructive processes can disturb typical brain development, often leading to associated developmental disorders, including abnormal cell proliferation, migration, and organization. They may arise from teratogens (including certain medications, illicit drugs, and infectious pathogens) and from vascular or mechanical mechanisms of tissue compromise. Consequently, most cases are sporadic; however, an underlying genetic disorder may sometimes be present, and it is often associated with an increased risk of vascular disruption.

This review covers antenatal haemorrhagic and ischaemic brain injuries, and encephaloclastic anomalies, such as porencephaly, schizencephaly, antenatal multicystic encephalomalacia, and hydranencephaly. It also addresses germinolytic cysts and lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV), common neonatal cranial ultrasonography (CUS) findings that are not intrinsically pathological but may be associated with congenital infections or other teratogenic entities. Additionally, we examine the conditions that increase the risk of foetal disruptive brain injuries, including monochorionic twin pregnancies, congenital heart disease (CHD), maternal drugs, congenital infections, and inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). We also review genetic disorders that predispose to foetal stroke or antenatal brain disruption.

Our aim is to enhance diagnosis using neonatal neuroimaging, with a particular focus on CUS because most patterns of foetal disruptive brain disease have been well categorized using this technique. Our review is intended to help clinicians identify recognizable imaging phenotypes that, when considered alongside clinical presentation, may support an aetiological diagnosis, ultimately facilitating parent counselling, informed treatment decisions, and planning of individualized follow‐up and early intervention programmes.

### Low yield of head CT in cirrhotic patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy [^e53637e2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Methodology

Population

William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak (WBH-RO) is a tertiary care referral centre in Michigan, USA with an active liver transplant programme since 2010. A retrospective cohort of emergency department (ED) and hospitalised adult patient encounters at WBH-RO presenting with HE between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018 was identified using an electronic health record (EHR) query of the following International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes: (1) 572.2 HE (ninth edition) and (2) K72.91 Hepatic failure, unspecified with coma (10th edition). Patients were included if they had a HCT without intravenous contrast on presentation or during the hospitalisation, and a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Both criteria were confirmed by manual chart review. If multiple HCTs were performed, only the initial HCT findings were analysed. Exclusion criteria included patients with prior known HCT abnormalities prior to the encounter such as encephalomalacia, abnormalities secondary to prior strokes or space occupying lesions.

### Loss of symmetric cell division of apical neural progenitors drives DENND5A-related developmental and epileptic encephalopathy [^d227c7f6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Not all MR/CT images were made available, but all available images are presented in Fig. 2. Raw MRI data from five cases and raw CT data from one case were analyzed by a pediatric neuroradiologist. Of these cases, two unrelated individuals (participants 5 and 14), both homozygous for DENND5A frameshift variants, showed the most extensive neuroanatomical phenotypes. These include severe dysgenesis of the basal ganglia with an indistinct and dysplastic thalamic transition, diencephalic-mesencephalic junction dysplasia, and cortical malformations, particularly with pachygyria involving the occipital lobes, a reduced volume of the white matter with associated striatal and periventricular calcifications and ventriculomegaly, agenesis or severe dysplasia/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, thin anterior commissure, and variable degrees of pontocerebellar hypoplasia (Fig. 2a, b). The remaining cohort members with available images heterogeneously show subsets of these anatomical features. MRIs analyzed from two compound heterozygous cases that exhibited severe DEE (participants 2 and 18) showed relatively mild neuroanatomical phenotypes. Both exhibited mild volume loss, ventriculomegaly, dysgenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum, and thin anterior commissure (Fig. 2c, d). Participant 2 showed diffuse gyral simplification (Fig. 2c), and participant 18 presented with basal ganglia dysmorphism and a posterior gradient of gyral simplification with occipital encephalomalacia (Fig. 2d). Raw MRI data from compound heterozygous participants 9 and 30 were not available, but isolated images revealed mild hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (Fig. 2e) and ventriculomegaly (Fig. 2f), respectively. Participant 8 with variants p.K485E/p.R1159W had a normal MRI with only mild inferior cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (Fig. 2g). Finally, CT image analysis of another homozygous individual with severe DEE also revealed ventriculomegaly, a hypoplastic corpus callosum, mild cerebral hypoplasia, and lenticulostriate and periventricular calcifications (Fig. 2h). These imaging studies highlight the heterogenous neuroanatomical manifestations of biallelic DENND5A variants, but certain features including volume loss, ventriculomegaly, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum appear more frequently.

### Intractable epilepsy and craniocerebral trauma: analysis of 163 patients with blunt and penetrating head injuries sustained in war [^8b0eba7d]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic epileptic seizure is a common complication of brain trauma including military injuries. We present clinical characteristics and correlates of post-traumatic epilepsy in 163 head-injured veterans suffering from intractable epilepsy due to blunt or penetrating head injuries sustained during the Iraq-Iran war. The medical records of 163 war veterans who were admitted by the Epilepsy Department of the Shefa Neuroscience Center between 2005 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. The mean follow-up period after developing epilepsy was 17.2 years. The time interval between the trauma and the first seizure was shorter and the seizure frequency was higher in epileptic patients suffering from penetrating head trauma. There was no difference in seizure type between epileptic patients traumatised by blunt or penetrating injury. Patients with seizure frequency of more than 30 per month mostly had simple partial seizure. Frontal and parietal semiologies were observed more frequently in patients with penetrating trauma, whereas patients with blunt trauma showed a higher temporal semiology. The most common brain lesion observed by CT scan was encephalomalacia followed by porencephaly and focal atrophy. There was no association between intracerebral retained fragments and different characteristic features of epilepsy. Patients with military brain injury carry a high risk of intractable post-traumatic epilepsy decades after their injury, and thus require a long-term medical follow-up.

Multiple, symmetrical brain lesions affecting the bilateral thalami and cerebral white matter, which often show a concentric structure on CT and MR images, characterize acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) of childhood. We describe the imaging findings of a 2-year-old child with ANE obtained with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. We discuss the significance of these findings, as well as the pathophysiology of ANE lesions, with reference to the appearance of the disease as revealed by diffusion-weighted MR imaging.

### Molybdenum cofactor deficiency: report of three cases presenting as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^1f95e00d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

We report three infants with the diagnosis of molybdenum cofactor deficiency. The key findings leading to diagnosis were neonatal seizures unresponsive to treatment, craniofacial dysmorphic features, hyperexcitability, low blood uric acid levels, and neuroimaging findings. The parents were consanguineous in two of these patients. The diagnosis was established by the presence of low blood uric acid levels, positive urine sulfite reaction, quantitative aminoacid analysis, and high-voltage electrophoresis of the urine sample showing a typical increase of S-sulfo-L-cysteine. Skin fibroblast cultures confirmed the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were suggestive of encephalomalacia with cystic changes due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. We conclude that molybdenum cofactor deficiency must be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with intractable seizures in the newborn period who have computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings reminiscent of those of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and the urine sulfite dipstick test can be a part of the evaluation of these infants in neonatal intensive care units.

### Reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome [^ea7d6271]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a multietiological condition, the pathophysiology of which lies in the breach of the blood-brain barrier due to increased local cerebral perfusion pressure. Patients present clinically in nonspecific ways; acute computed tomography is often unrevealing, and as such, there should be a low threshold for early magnetic resonance imaging even in the acute setting because misdiagnosis may lead to mismanagement. Although initially described to present with changes depicted on imaging in the "posterior aspects" of the brain, more recent literature has focused attention on the fact that signal changes may occur anywhere in the brain. We present a case demonstrating such prolific changes throughout the brain stressing on the need for early appropriate use of radiodiagnostics.

### The MRI spectrum of congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^b734c991]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Beyond the discussion of what technique is superior, attaining an accurate diagnosis and as much prognostic information as possible is the ultimate goal for each patient. Decision on the need for fetal MRI should be made on a case‐to‐case basis and taking into consideration the objective or subjective need for further information or reassurance of referring physicians and parents.

In terms of MRI findings, anterior temporal lobe lesions are the most specific finding, and an area where MRI may add information to US. Other findings albeit unspecific should raise the suspicion of fetal infection, particularly if found in combination. This highlights the need for a full fetal assessment, as these findings may be outside the SNC.

Some authors have tried to stratify the risk of sequelae in relation to MRI findings. Leruez‐Ville et al stratified imaging findings in two categories (on US): mild brain anomalies (mild ventriculomegaly [< 15 mm], intraventricular adhesions, calcifications, subependimal cysts, choroid plexus cysts) and severe brain anomalies (severe ventriculomegaly [> 15 mm], periventriculitis, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, increased cisterna magna [> 8 mm], porencephaly, lissencephaly, cystic lesions of the WM, and agenesis of the corpus callosum), to be evaluated together with the viral load. 73

### Definitions and classification of malformations of cortical development: practical guidelines [^83afd590]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

How to study malformations of cortical development

Malformations of cortical development due to under- or over-migration are difficult to recognize by foetal ultrasound and MRI before 20 weeks of gestational age (in many countries an important time point for possible termination of pregnancy). Even after that date, identification remains a challenge. Abnormal sulcation patterns can be identified by ultrasound and/or MRI, either in the form of lack of normal sulci (consistent with the lissencephaly spectrum) and/or early, aberrant sulcation (consistent with polymicrogyria). While megalencephaly and microcephaly can be confidently assessed through measurements of the head circumference and — in the case of some megalencephalies — asymmetries in cerebral hemisphere volume, other subtler abnormalities such as grey matter heterotopia often remain altogether invisible. In all cases of suspected MCD on prenatal studies, post-natal confirmation with ultrasound and MRI should be obtained to delineate the abnormalities and their extension.

In the postnatal period, ultrasound can be used to look for calcification, disturbances of gyral architecture, enlarged ventricles, and midline defects, which could be direct or indirect signs of brain malformations. Malformations involving the posterior fossa are more difficult to detect, and should be imaged not only through the anterior fontanel but also through the mastoid fontanel (asterion). For optimal imaging, dedicated neonatal convex and high frequency linear transducers should be used. Proper training is of utmost importance for neonatal ultrasound as the technique is heavily operator dependent.

Although CT scanning can be used to study MCD and will depict most abnormalities with good detail, its routine use is discouraged in view of radioprotection concerns. CT is presently mostly used as a second-line imaging method to confirm calcifications that sometimes accompany brain malformations (such as those found in congenital cytomegalovirus infection), although the latter can often be confidently detected on MRI using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI).

### Temporal encephaloceles and epileptogenicity: does size matter? [^09f2a42c]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Such limitations are not selective to this study. In fact, most of the literature on encephaloceles and epilepsy is derived by case reports, case series or small, retrospective and commonly uncontrolled studies. In a recent review, Ramos-Fresnedo et al amalgamated 267 published cases. Their ascertainment was performed using variable diagnostic criteria (e.g. brain contour abnormality, surrounding CSF signal, and associated parenchymal gliosis), and heterogeneous imaging protocols ranging from skull based computed tomography (CT) to combined higher resolution 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with specialized sequences facilitating their identification. While most papers provided details on location and number, most lacked important characteristics such as size, typical appearance (i.e. meninges and brain as opposed to just arachnoid pits) and additional radiological stigmata of IIH. Their association with epilepsy was mostly identified in hindsight based on clinical semiology and geographic linkage with scalp EEG, with intracranial monitoring being the exception rather than the rule in the published series. Clinical information on related risk factors such as family history, history of trauma, prior surgery, tumor, infection or inflammation that could predispose to skull defects without or with seizures, frequently presenting earlier in life, as well as information on BMI or IIH symptoms that are frequently associated with TEs without or with (typically later onset) epilepsywas frequently absent. When surgical data were available, the majority of patients still underwent generous temporal resections, with lesionectomies or more restricted temporal lobectomies being a less popular course of action. From those who underwent any surgical intervention 61% were seizure free postoperatively, ranging from 44% in the temporal lobectomy cases to 87% in the lesionectomy cases, factoring in the selection and publication bias that this message entails. Histopathological characteristics of the surgical specimens were provided in a minority of cases, ranging from benign brain parenchyma to gliosis, underlying meningioma or meningiomatosis, abnormal neuronal lamination and association with cortical dysplasia locally, versus more extensive, possibly related, developmental abnormalities, such as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors. Aside for limited literature on neuropsychological outcomesdescribing a more "benign" temporal lobe neuropsychological profile on TLE patients due to TEs, most studies lack pre- and post-operative data on that end. The limited available data suggest no significant change in the preoperative profiles with surgical intervention in the qualified cases and positive social repercussions subjectively. Successful lesionectomies seem to portend to fewer neuropsychological deficits, although preoperative anxiety and postoperative adjustment to "normalcy" is shared between all types of interventions.

### Imaging of nontraumatic neuroradiology emergencies [^3e8dc351]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging of acute neurologic disease in the emergency department can be challenging because of the wide range of possible causes and the overlapping imaging appearance of many of these entities on nonenhanced computed tomography (CT). The key to formulating a succinct, pertinent differential diagnosis includes characterizing the pattern of abnormalities on CT and identifying key features that suggest a particular diagnosis. This article divides neurologic emergencies into 5 scenarios based on the CT findings, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, vasogenic edema without and with underlying mass lesion, and acute hydrocephalus. Specific common or important diagnoses in each category are discussed.

### MRI findings in 6 cases of children by inadvertent ingestion of diphenoxylate-atropine [^158abe80]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Compound diphenoxylate (diphenoxylate-atropine) poisoning can cause toxic encephalopathy in children, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in this condition has not been reported. This study is to analyze brain MRI findings and to investigate the relations between MRI features and possible pathophysiological changes in children.

Methods

Six children accidentally swallowed compound diphenoxylate, 4 males, 2 females, aged 20–46 months, average 33 months. Quantity of ingested diphenoxylate-atropine was from 6 to 30 tablets, each tablet contains diphenoxylate 2.5mg and atropine 0.025 mg. These patients were referred to our hospital within 24h after diphenoxylate-atropine ingestion, and underwent brain MRI scan within 24–72 h after emergency treatment. The characteristics of conventional MRI were analyzed.

Results

These pediatric patients had various symptoms of opioid intoxication and atropine toxicity. Brain MRI showed abnormal low signal intensity on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and abnormal high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging in bilateral in all cases; abnormal high signal intensity on T1WI, T2WI and FLAIR in 4 cases. Encephalomalacia was observed in 3 cases during follow-up.

Conclusion

In the early stage of compound diphenoxylate poisoning in children, multiple extensive edema-necrosis and hemorrhagic-necrosis focus were observed in basic nucleus, pallium and cerebellum, these resulted in the corresponding brain dysfunction with encephalomalacia. MRI scan in the early stage in this condition may provide evidences of brain impairment, and is beneficial for the early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis assessment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1bf21264]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) diagnosis: Established clinical diagnostic criteria are focal signs and symptoms on neurologic examination, focal white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) without mass effect, and exclusion of other causes of the clinical and neuroradiologic findings. A confirmed diagnosis requires a compatible clinical syndrome and radiographic findings with brain biopsy demonstrating a characteristic triad of pathologic foci of demyelination, enlarged hyperchromatic oligodendrocytes with enlarged nuclei and basophilic-staining intranuclear material, and enlarged astrocytes with bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei; when only two features are present, JCV can be demonstrated by in situ hybridization or by electron microscopy for definitive diagnosis. Brain biopsy remains the gold standard confirmatory test for diagnosis of PML, but MRI or CT can reveal characteristic lesions.

### Vascular abnormalities within normal appearing tissue in chronic traumatic brain injury [^1e2621d0]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for visualizing traumatic brain injury(TBI)-related lesions. Trauma-induced encephalomalacia is frequently identified by its hyperintense appearance on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. In addition to parenchymal lesions, TBI commonly results in cerebral microvascular injury, but its anatomical relationship to parenchymal encephalomalacia is not well characterized. The current study utilized a multi-modal MRI protocol to assess microstructural tissue integrity (by mean diffusivity [MD] and fractional aniosotropy [FA]) and altered vascular function (by cerebral blood flow [CBF] and cerebral vascular reactivity [CVR]) within regions of visible encephalomalacia and normal appearing tissue in 27 chronic TBI (minimum 6 months post-injury) subjects. Fifteen subjects had visible encephalomalacias whereas 12 did not have evident lesions on MRI. Imaging from 14 age-matched healthy volunteers were used as controls. CBF was assessed by arterial spin labeling (ASL) and CVR by measuring the change in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI during a hypercapnia challenge. There was a significant reduction in FA, CBF, and CVR with a complementary increase in MD within regions of FLAIR-visible encephalomalacia (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In normal-appearing brain regions, only CVR was significantly reduced relative to controls (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that vascular dysfunction represents a TBI endophenotype that is distinct from structural injury detected using conventional MRI, may be present even in the absence of visible structural injury, and persists long after trauma. CVR may serve as a useful diagnostic and pharmacodynamic imaging biomarker of traumatic microvascular injury.

### Clinical features and neuroimaging (CT and MRI) findings in presumed zika virus related congenital infection and microcephaly: retrospective case series study [^99fb426d]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In the children who underwent MRI, the main cortical malformations were a simplified gyral pattern (fig 2C, fig 3B, and fig 4B and C), polymicrogyria (fig 5E), and pachygyria (fig 2D and E). Overall, the malformations were present in the entire brain, especially the simplified gyral pattern (only two of eight children did not present this pattern). However, in all of the children the frontal lobe was among the lobes most affected, especially by polymicrogyria and pachygyria. Other malformations found were hemimegaloencephaly and periventricular heterotopic grey matter.

Other findings were ventriculomegaly (fig 2C, D, and F, and fig 3B-D), an enlarged cisterna magna (fig 2B, fig 3A, fig 4A, and fig 5F), abnormalities of the corpus callosum (hypoplasia or hypogenesis) (fig 2B, fig 3A, fig 4A, and fig 5F), cerebellar and brainstem hypoplasia (fig 2B and fig 3A), and an enlarged supratentorial subarachnoid space (fig 2C and D, and fig 3C). Tables 5 and 6present the results of the descriptive analysis of the qualitative variables found on the CT and MRI scans, respectively. Table 7illustrates the classification and location of malformations found on the MRI scans.

### Brain structure in prenatal stroke: quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis [^545dcaf2]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Neonatal stroke outcome studies demonstrate variable findings of either relatively spared intellectual function or persistent impairments. Volumetric measurement of the brain can provide more precise data on lesion-cognition outcomes. We studied 7 children with unilateral focal lesions from prenatal stroke. Whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed to produce volumes of cortical gray matter, total white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, lesion, and lesion constricted fluid, and we ascertained the relationship of morphometric variables to intellectual and clinical outcome. Children with cystic encephalomalacia plus atrophy had poorer outcomes than children with atrophy or gliosis alone. These children also demonstrated the largest lesion size, smallest gray matter volume, and greatest proportion of hyperintense white matter in the affected hemisphere. Findings suggest that the type and size of the lesion, in addition to the integrity of white matter and residual cortex, may be better predictors of intellectual functioning than either of these indices alone.

### Encephalomalacia in infants… [^b48517fc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cerebral softening in infants, considered by some since the days of Virchow to be a peculiar form of encephalitis, is not uncommon. As extensive studies of recent years have shown, trauma at birth is the important, if not the only, underlying factor, in contrast to vascular lesions, so frequent in cerebral softening in adults. Though marked softening was present in the two cases reported here, no history of trauma at birth was elicited.

### AI-based differential diagnosis of dementia etiologies on multimodal data [^811fe097]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Neuroradiologist 5

The approach to MR exams began with an evaluation of axial T2/FLAIR images, if available. If multiple regions of gliosis were observed alongside areas of encephalomalacia, resulting from prior infarctions in multiple vascular territories, consideration was given to the possibility of multi-infarct dementia. Moreover, when encephalomalacia and gliosis predominantly affected the temporal lobes, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy became a potential inclusion in the diagnostic considerations. Following the FLAIR sequence, assessment of diffusion-weighted images, if accessible, primarily served to rule out more acute conditions like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, herpes encephalitis, or other forms of encephalitis. Subsequently, T1w images were reviewed, preferably in 3D format, to examine ventricle and sulci dimensions. The presence of ventriculomegaly and sulcal crowding at the vertex prompted consideration of NPH as a potential diagnosis. Additionally, gyri were evaluated to identify areas exhibiting volume loss. T2w images were especially helpful in this regard, as they enhanced the visibility of CSF and accentuated regions of atrophy. Once the order of diagnostic differentials was established, a diagnostic rating was assigned. In this rating system, a score of 100 indicated absolute certainty, an exceedingly rare occurrence in radiology. Conversely, a score of less than 20 signified extreme unlikelihood, 25 denoted unlikeliness, 50 implied the possibility of the diagnosis, whereas a range of 50 to 75 indicated a probable diagnosis. Finally, a score exceeding 75 suggested a high likelihood of the diagnosis being accurate.

### Intracranial calcification in early infantile Krabbe disease: nothing new under the sun [^4eb68936]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

We report the cases of three children, one male and two females, with a diagnosis of early infantile Krabbe disease demonstrating intracranial calcification on computed tomography (CT). The pattern of calcification was similar in all individuals and involved the internal capsule and cerebral white matter. The presence of calcification caused some diagnostic confusion in what was otherwise a typical clinical and radiological presentation. This finding is not new and has previously been described in publications from the 1980s and 1990s reporting the CT and magnetic resonance imaging appearances of Krabbe disease. With increasing use of magnetic resonance as the first imaging modality for investigation of neurological disorders, characteristic CT appearances may be forgotten. This report serves as a reminder that Krabbe disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of disorders causing intracranial calcification.

### Primary central white matter hypoplasia of the neocortex [^89e39273]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies, or diseases of the white matter, represent acute or ongoing damage to the oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system. Early childhood white matter disease is most commonly observed after hypoxic ischemic insults, with acute magnetic resonance imaging changes followed by atrophy or periventricular leukomalacia. Dysmyelination occurring in the setting of inborn errors of metabolism is characterized by progressive changes with high signal intensity in white matter on magnetic resonance imaging. This report presents a patient whose magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated hypoplasia of myelin in the telencephalon, without clinical or magnetic resonance imaging evidence of inflammatory dysmyelination. Clinical features included intractable seizures, severe hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features coupled with a static failure to gain developmental milestones. Together, the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings are evidence of a primary failure of myelination in the neocortex.

### Caution: shortcomings of traditional segmentation methods from magnetic resonance imaging brain scans intended for 3-dimensional surface modelling in children with pathology [^bd8e77d2]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of new technical innovation

This study examined 35 abnormal MR brain scans in children with cerebral palsy due to prior perinatal hypoxic ischemic injury, who underwent delayed MRI. Some patterns of hypoxic ischemic injury only involve portions of the cortex, with related increased complexity of a 3-D mapping workflow to convert MR images into 3-D surface reconstructions. This has previously been documented in adults. The utility of 3-D printing for accurate anatomical representation/biomimicry to facilitate medical teaching, communication with laypeople and legal proceedings is being explored. The 3-D printing workflow is dependent on accurate segmentation of MR scan data. We tested and attempted to improve the segmentation workflow from three common segmentation tools as applied to abnormal pediatric MR brain scans.

The included image sets were distributed into four categories based on imaging-identified structural abnormalities: "normal", demonstrating no visible structural brain abnormalities (Fig. 1); "atrophy", demonstrating general or regional watershed cortical volume loss with or without ulegyria (Fig. 2); "cavity", demonstrating expanded cystic structures close to the brain surface (focal or multi-cystic encephalomalacia) or significantly expanded ventricles (whether due to ex vacuo dilation or hydrocephalus) (Fig. 3); and "other", demonstrating non-specific surface brain abnormalities not conforming to the above class descriptions.

### CT of the neonatal head [^341b697f]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is used less often than other techniques on neonatal units. However, in the acute setting, CT can be invaluable in diagnosing or excluding potentially life-threatening conditions and guiding initial management in neonates. Common indications for scanning include trauma, suspected non-accidental injury, infection, or an acute hypoxic or metabolic event. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the normal neonatal head at CT and compare this to the common pathological abnormalities. Several key features of each condition will be highlighted. It is important to note that some pathological conditions can have overlapping features at CT and, therefore, the clinical history and additional investigations are also of key importance in determining the diagnosis.

### Pathological computed tomography features associated with adverse outcomes after mild traumatic brain injury… [^fd9a59bb]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Hierarchical cluster analysis shows clusters of CT abnormalities. A dendrogram shows the distance at which the cluster was formed along the vertical axis. The most common acute CT finding was SAH, followed by brain contusion, SDH, EDH, and petechial hemorrhage. A head computed tomography with positive results for acute intracranial hemorrhage is the gold-standard diagnostic biomarker for acute traumatic brain injury. In moderate to severe TBI, some CT features have been shown to be associated with outcomes. In mild TBI, distribution and co-occurrence of pathological CT features and their prognostic importance are not well understood. A computed tomography with positive results for intracranial hemorrhage is the gold-standard diagnostic biomarker for acute TBI.

Quiz Ref IDMany studies have shown that complicated mild TBI, or mTBI with a positive head CT result, is associated with worse outcomes compared with uncomplicated mTBI. However, positive head CT results include a wide spectrum of intracranial lesions. A more precise understanding of the prognostic importance of CT abnormalities in mTBI, beyond the simple presence vs absence of abnormal findings on CT, is timely. Regarding CT phenotypes derived from HCA or MCA, 3 trends emerged. The contusion, SAH, and/or SDH cluster was significantly associated with both incomplete recovery, and combined SAH, SDH, and/or contusion the second most common.

This distinct radiological and pathological entity is reviewed with a specific focus on aetiology.

### Magnetic resonance imaging patterns of paediatric brain infections: a pictorial review based on the Western Australian experience [^f459f952]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Pattern 1: Restricted diffusion in supratentorial white matter

The presence of restricted diffusion typically indicates cytotoxic oedema, with less common causes including high viscosity and high cellularity (as seen with pyogenic abscesses). The mechanism for restricted diffusion which bilaterally and relatively symmetrically involves deep and periventricular white matter, with a radiating pattern which appears to follow the deep medullary veins, that is not fully understood. Potential mechanisms include neuroaxonal tropism (activation of toll-like receptors and subsequent inflammatory response), perivenular invasion or venous ischaemia. Nevertheless, in neonates, two important pathogens implicated in this pattern are parechovirus and enterovirus infection. The cytotoxic oedema seen on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is the predominant imaging feature, with corresponding signal abnormalities on T1 (hyperintensity)- and T2 (hypointensity)-weighted imaging being relatively subtle. The extent of restricted diffusion can range from florid (pattern 1A — Fig. 2) to mild (pattern 1B — Fig. 3), and cystic encephalomalacia can be seen as a sequelae of severe white matter injury. Rotavirus, adenovirus, Chikungunya and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have also been described in the literature as producing similar appearances on DWI in neonates. As a memory aid, the differential list of parechovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, Chikungunya and HSV conveniently spells the mnemonic P-A-R-E-C-H.

Neurodegenerative diseases

Alzheimer disease

Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia, characterized by cognitive impairment severe enough to interfere with daily living. Bi-temporal involvement is a known feature (Fig. 7), with disproportional volume loss in the mesial temporal structures, especially the entorhinal cortex. This is thought to be the consequence of increased vulnerability of the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex to neuritic plaque deposition and subsequent damage.

Fig. 7

Frontotemporal dementia is the second most common type of presenile dementia, and encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders with preferential temporal and frontal atrophy. Preferential and usually asymmetric temporal lobe atrophy is seen in the semantic variant of this syndrome (Fig. 8); otherwise, atrophy frequently extends beyond the temporal lobe.

Fig. 8
A 63-year-old female who presented with 2 years history of cognitive decline, mainly in semantic and visual recognition functions. On axial FLAIR image, there is asymmetric temporal lobe atrophy without gliosis, right greater than left. Based on cognitive tests, clinical presentation and imaging findings the diagnosis of semantic type of fronto-temporal dementia was made. This pattern of atrophy should be distinguished from post-traumatic encephalomalacia following bilateral temporal contusions, based on clinical history and the absence of gliosis and blood byproducts on imaging

The two diseases are usually differentiated based on clinical assessment and cognitive tests, with structural imaging serving as a supporting and follow-up tool.

### Evaluation of epilepsy lesion visualisation enhancement in low-field MRI using image quality transfer: a preliminary investigation of clinical potential for applications in developing countries [^014554d2]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients' demographic information and the reference diagnosis from HF images is reported in Table 1. Three out of the 12 patients were considered non-lesional at HF, while the remaining 9 had lesions. As only one subtle lesion was found in this cohort and most abnormalities could be seen on all images by all reviewers, we did not perform an accuracy analysis on the number of detected lesions but only evaluated their extension and definition as described above, as well as the GM-WM differentiation.

Study participants characteristics. For each patient the four columns include the progressive number, age at MRI (years), sex (F = Female, M = Male) and the diagnosis made by the most experienced neuroradiologist from HF images

Visually, IQT substantially improved the image appearance in non-axial planes, as shown by the representative examples of coronal and sagittal reformatted images in Fig. 1. It also slightly improved the contrast between healthy brain tissues, especially in T1w images (Fig. 2). Most of the lesions observed at HF were more clearly visible in IQT-enhanced images than in the corresponding LF images, as shown in Fig. 3 for a patient with encephalomalacia and in Fig. 4 for a patient with tuberous sclerosis.

In this case, the 3D visualisation allowed by IQT, even though advantageous compared to the original 2D images, is not completely accurate and may have negative consequences on lesion identification, which stresses the importance of having multiple sequences

The brain ultrasound at 22 days old of the first baby showed bilateral periventricular hyperechogenicity and a grade 1 germinal matrix haemorrhage at right caudothalamic groove. On last follow-up at age 5 years, the child had normal growth and development.

The brain ultrasound at 22 days old of the second baby showed diffuse multiple cystic cavity formations of the cerebrum, predominantly in peritrigonal and parafalcial regions (Fig. 2). The corpus callosum was thin. At 6 months of age, the baby started to have dystonic movements and global delay. On examination, he had small head. His head circumference was 36 cm (< 3rd centile) and hypertonia of four limbs. An electroencephalogram disclosed epileptiform discharge. Metabolic screening was normal. At 1 year of age, the head circumference was 38 cm (< 3rd centile). His neck control was poor. He could not roll over from prone to supine. His four limbs were hypertonic and lower limbs were hyperreflexic. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain confirmed the diagnosis of extensive multicystic encephalomalacia. There were diffuse and severe white matter loss at bilateral cerebrum, severe and diffuse thinning of the corpus callosum and ex-vacuo dilatation of bilateral lateral ventricles (Fig. 3). The child developed epilepsy since 3 years old which was controlled with anti-epileptic medications. On last examination at 6 years of age, he still had severe global developmental delay. He could only vocalize but not yet speak. He could only sit and walk with support. A head computed tomography scan was performed for intractable seizure which revealed hypodense areas over parasagittal regions of bilateral cerebral hemispheres, in keeping with multicystic encephalomalacia (Fig. 4).

Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) in children — neuroimaging guidance states that neuroimaging should be done only after the child is stabilized and the SE has been controlled, and neuroimaging options include CT or MRI, with MRI more sensitive and specific than CT scanning but CT readily available on an emergency basis. Emergent neuroimaging was recommended if there was a focal deficit that did not quickly resolve or if there was no return to baseline mental status after several hours, and nonurgent MRI should be seriously considered in any child with a seizure of partial (focal) onset with or without secondary generalization; a previously published Practice Parameter made no recommendations concerning neuroimaging in SE but suggested emergent neuroimaging when a serious structural lesion was suspected with listed risk features. Evidence across 20 class III studies involving children with SE (328 before the advent of neuroimaging) found structural lesions in 7.8%, including CNS malformation (1.7%), trauma (1.6%), stroke/hemorrhage (0.9%), neurocutaneous disorder (0.9%), tumor (0.8%), infarct/vascular (0.6%), hemorrhage (0.4%), abscess/cerebritis (0.4%), and arteriovenous malformation (AVM), hydrocephalus, or other (0.2% each).

The basic concept of neuroimaging in childhood epilepsy: the MRI protocol

Many pathological processes and brain lesions can cause symptomatic epilepsy in children but the most common lesions causing severe epilepsy are perinatal and postinfective encephalopathy, malformations of cortical development (MCD), phacomatoses and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). HS may coexist with other lesions (tumours, MCDs, ischaemic or postinfectious brain damage, etc.) – the important entity of double pathology.

Computed tomography (CT) should be avoided due to the hazard of the ionising radiation (even more dangerous in children than in adults) and its lack of sensitivity and specificity in these cases, and reserved to the very rare cases where the detection of calcification is important for differential diagnostics (DDG) and not shown by MRI.

The unique neuroimaging tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The proper depiction of the common abnormalities described above and the exclusion of other lesions define the special epilepsy MRI protocol. It depends on the child's age as well: the FLAIR sequence is very useful after 2 years when the cerebral white matter has achieved the adult state of myelination but is rather inaccurate earlier. The 3D gradient echo (GRE) T1 weighted sequence is an important tool, but a T2 weighted sequence with thin slices and high resolution may better delineate small MCDs before the myelination has been completed.

Protocol under 2 years: 1. Axial turbo spin echo or fast spin echo T2 weighted sequence with high resolution (HR) and thin slices — for an overview of the brain; 2. HR 3D GRE T1 weighted sequence — a primary tool to find MCDs; 3. Diffusion weighted sequence and apparent diffusion coefficient map (DWI/ADC) or better diffusion tensor imaging with different parametric maps (DTI) – obligatory in all brain MRIs, a great help in DDG and DTI with tractography important in surgical planning; 4. GRE T2✱ weighted sequence or susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) – obligatory in all brain MRIs to detect haemosiderin or calcifications as explained by Prof. Anne G. Osborn; 5. Coronal T2 weighted sequence with thin slices and high resolution, perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampi and covering the whole brain — for a detailed evaluation of the hippocampi and the whole brain. The administration of a contrast medium and/or perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and MR spectroscopy are reserved for phacomatoses, tumours and metabolic disorders. MR angiography is used in cases of possible vascular disease.

### Nonmicrocephalic infants with congenital zika syndrome suspected only after neuroimaging evaluation compared with those with microcephaly at birth and postnatally: how large is the zika virus "Iceberg"? [^b9a8b8b0]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although microcephaly is the most prominent feature of congenital Zika syndrome, a spectrum with less severe cases is starting to be recognized. Our aim was to review neuroimaging of infants to detect cases without microcephaly and compare them with those with microcephaly.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated all neuroimaging (MR imaging/CT) of infants 1 year of age or younger. Patients with congenital Zika syndrome were divided into those with microcephaly at birth, postnatal microcephaly, and without microcephaly. Neuroimaging was compared among groups.

Results

Among 77 infants, 24.6% had congenital Zika syndrome (11.7% microcephaly at birth, 9.1% postnatal microcephaly, 3.9% without microcephaly). The postnatal microcephaly and without microcephaly groups showed statistically similar imaging findings. The microcephaly at birth compared with the group without microcephaly showed statistically significant differences for the following: reduced brain volume, calcifications outside the cortico-subcortical junctions, corpus callosum abnormalities, moderate-to-severe ventriculomegaly, an enlarged extra-axial space, an enlarged cisterna magna (all absent in those without microcephaly), and polymicrogyria (the only malformation present without microcephaly). There was a trend toward pachygyria (absent in groups without microcephaly). The group with microcephaly at birth compared with the group with postnatal microcephaly showed significant differences for simplified gyral pattern, calcifications outside the cortico-subcortical junctions, corpus callosum abnormalities, moderate-to-severe ventriculomegaly, and an enlarged extra-axial space.

Conclusions

In microcephaly at birth, except for polymicrogyria, all patients showed abnormalities described in the literature. In postnatal microcephaly, the only abnormalities not seen were a simplified gyral pattern and calcifications outside the cortico-subcortical junction. Infants with normocephaly presented with asymmetric frontal polymicrogyria, calcifications in the cortico-subcortical junction, mild ventriculomegaly, and delayed myelination.

### Symmetry in computed tomography of the brain: the pitfalls [^8c231edc]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) studies of the brain are one of the most frequent examinations interpreted by radiologists out of hours. Apparently normal appearances in patients with significant neurological morbidity can be perplexing. As the contents of the cranium are normally remarkably symmetrical on axial CT, disease entities that result in symmetrical appearances are the most difficult to detect. In this review we highlight a spectrum of important acute neurological conditions that result in abnormal but symmetrical appearances on CT.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in the prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects [^a5931ce5]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for encephalocele is based on the size, content and location of the lesion. The main differential diagnosis for encephaloceles located in the occipital region is with cystic hygroma, whereas for those located in the frontal region, the differential diagnosis is with teratoma and haemangioma of the scalp. Both teratomas and haemangiomas of the scalp are shown as slightly heterogeneous but well-defined solid masses with variable signal intensity; haemangiomas may have areas of signal voiding due to their intense vascularisation.

An encephalocele may form part of a syndrome like Meckel-Gruber syndrome and it can be associated with other anomalies like ventriculomegaly, spina bifida (7–15% of all encephaloceles), microcephaly, or cleft lip and/or cleft palate.

The prognosis depends on the size, location and extent of the lesion as well as on whether other anomalies are present.

### MR imaging of the fetal brain [^b6e55e05]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical indications

Fetal MRI is most commonly performed to evaluate a suspected abnormality detected by prenatal sonography. By further characterizing the finding and detecting additional abnormalities not seen on prenatal sonography, fetal MRI can provide information that can assist in prenatal counseling of the current pregnancy as well as counseling of the recurrence risk in future pregnancies. The most common indications for imaging the fetal brain will be briefly discussed below and include mild ventriculomegaly, suspected callosal agenesis, complications of monochorionic twinning, and posterior fossa abnormalities.

Ventriculomegaly

Ventriculomegaly is defined as atrial width equal to or greater than 10 mm, measured at the posterior margin of the glomus of the choroid plexus on an axial image through the thalami. Measurements of the atrial width on axial MR images have been published and can differ by up to 1 mm to 2 mm compared to US. When the ventricular atrium is measured in the coronal plane, US and MRI measurements are highly concordant.

Ventriculomegaly can be the result of developmental, destructive and obstructive processes, or a combination thereof. In cases of sonographically detected ventriculomegaly, fetal MRI is performed to detect any additional abnormalities, which might give insight into the etiology of the ventriculomegaly as well as neurodevelopmental outcome for the fetus. Fetal MR can detect additional abnormalities in up to 50% of cases of sonographically diagnosed ventriculomegaly. These include agenesis of the corpus callosum, cortical malformations, periventricular heterotopia, cerebellar malformations, hemimegalencephaly, periventricular white matter injury, porencephaly, multicystic encephalomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and germinal matrix hemorrhage.

### Differential diagnosis of intracranial lesions with high signal on T1 or low signal on T2-weighted MRI [^2139b0d0]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred technique for examining intracranial pathology in the non-acute setting in most cases. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the imaging appearances on unenhanced spin-echo MRI of lesions that show characteristic, unusual signal changes, which occur due to the presence of fat, cholesterol, paramagnetic substances, rapidly flowing fluids, air, cortical bone or calcification. The nature of the MRI signal, together with the anatomical location of the lesion should allow the provision of a narrow differential diagnosis, before the use of intravenous contrast medium or additional imaging sequences.

2 Patients and Methods

2.1 Patients

We systematically evaluated 35 brain MRI scans and one brain CT scan of 13 patients born at term with confirmed severe MoCD and typical, early‐onset presentation (7 MoCD‐A and 6 MoCD‐B), who underwent brain imaging as part of their clinical care by the authors. Sixteen MRI scans were obtained from 10 patients without specific treatment, including 4 patients with MoCD‐A prior to cPMP treatment (at age 3, 4, 6, and 42 days) and 6 patients with MoCD‐B (at age 1 to 131 days). Another 19 MRI scans (at age 5 to 2264 days) were obtained from 6 patients with MoCD‐A who received treatment with cPMP on a named‐patient basis with parental consent. Table 1 provides an overview of the timing of brain scans in relation to cPMP treatment, and Table S1 shows pertinent clinical characteristics of the patient population. Clinical aspects of some of the included patients have been previously published: Patients A and G, Patient B, Patients D, E, I, Patients K and M.

Overview of brain 35 MRI scans in 13 patients with MoCD in relation to symptom onset and cPMP treatment.

2.2 Stratification of Disease Stages

We stratified MR images according to time after onset of first disease symptoms. Adapted from the classification of HIE, the acute phase was defined as 0–7 days after onset of acute encephalopathy, and the chronic phase as 28 days and longer after onset, with weekly strata in between.

2.3 Imaging and Evaluation

Brain MRI scans were performed according to standard neonatal and pediatric protocols. Standard locations were assessed by two pediatric neuroradiologists for structural abnormalities, signal alterations for vasogenic and cytotoxic edema, brain necrosis (liquefaction), cystic transformation, hemorrhage, and brain atrophy.

Vasogenic edema was evidenced by increased T2 and reduced T1 signal, and increased signal in a diffusion weighted image (DWI) without a decreased Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) signal.

Cytotoxic edema with impending tissue breakdown was evidenced by increased DWI signal and decreased ADC signal. Normal ADC reference intervals are 850–1300 × 10⁻⁶ mm²/s for deep grey structures, 1200–1800 for periventricular white matter (PWM), and 1000–1400 for cerebral cortex. ADC values were not calibrated using a standard phantom, due to variable scanning conditions for individual patients and acquisition of images over the course of over 10 years.

### Head ultrasound and MR imaging in the evaluation of neonatal encephalopathy: competitive or complementary imaging studies? [^fcc5a0ad]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is superior to ultrasonography (US) for the evaluation and prognostication of neonates with neonatal encephalopathy (NE). Nonetheless, US may provide important information early in the course of NE and can be used to document the evolution of lesions. This article provides an overview of useful findings in the US evaluation of infants with NE. Although many of the findings do not appear as conspicuous or as extensively as they do on MR imaging, recognition and familiarity with subtle head US abnormalities may allow head US to play an important complementary role to MR imaging in the evaluation of infants with NE.

6 PROGNOSTIC FACTORS

The main factors affecting prognosis are the severity of the ventricular dilatation, progression during pregnancy or following delivery, a head circumference smaller than expected for the gestational age (not necessarily microcephaly), growth retardation, abnormal genetic or infectious tests, and the presence of associated anomalies. Moreover, a worse prognosis is expected when there is an early onset (first or early second trimester) of severe ventriculomegaly during pregnancy. Further details on postnatal outcomes are discussed below.

### Routine neuroimaging of the preterm brain [^0cac1e03]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Routine neuroimaging of the preterm brain — repeat brain imaging and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) surveillance — emphasizes evolution of early findings and dual screening windows. PVL may initially be observed during the first week of life in the VLBW infant as increased echogenicity of the periventricular white matter; periventricular white matter should be less echogenic than the choroid plexus, and these areas may become cystic on ultrasonography within 2 to 5 weeks and/or lead to ventriculomegaly visible on repeat ultrasonography at term equivalent age (TEA). Reflecting timing variability, the Canadian Pediatric Society recommended screening at 6 weeks of age, whereas the AAN suggested a near term study; because 4- to 6-week screening is sensitive for identifying PVL and term equivalent cranial ultrasound findings are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, we recommend screening during both time periods. Sequential ultrasonography appears to have the best yield for identifying lesions associated with cerebral palsy, and in infants with cerebral palsy, almost one third were found to have PVL on ultrasonography performed after 4 weeks of age. Among 1739 preterm infants screened at 4 weeks of age and again at near TEA, 14% had cystic PVL only on the early imaging and it had resolved by the later study; in those born at < 26 weeks' gestation, 18.5% of PVL cases were missed by a single ultrasonographic examination performed at TEA. Infants who had cystic PVL at any time on ultrasonographic imaging had a significantly higher primary outcome of late death or neurodevelopmental impairment than those who never had such findings; thus, infants with cystic PVL warrant close follow-up observation for neurodevelopmental impairment, and communication regarding neuroimaging results and follow-up plans are recommended between inpatient and outpatient providers.

Neuroradiologist 7

Brain volume loss was assessed based on age-appropriate norms, with T1 and T2/FLAIR sequences aiding in the evaluation of volume loss within each lobe. These sequences were particularly useful for assessing CSF presence near the convexity. Brainstem volume loss was primarily evaluated through mid-sagittal and axial images, which allowed for the examination of the pontine belly and cerebral peduncle size, respectively. Coronal images provided insights into hippocampal volume, determined by the prominence of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricle. Sagittal images were used to assess cerebellar volume loss. FLAIR sequences played a crucial role in detecting encephalomalacia, gliosis, infarcts and white matter changes. Distinct patterns were observed in various dementia types, such as parieto-temporal volume loss favoring AD. Extensive white matter changes with or without microhemorrhages in individuals over 60 years pointed to VD. White matter changes in younger individuals raised consideration of alternative causes like infections or metabolic factors. Alcohol use often correlated with cerebellar volume loss. Traumatic brain injury was suspected in cases with FLAIR signal changes and peripheral volume loss in the anterior temporal and inferior frontal lobes, with or without susceptibility, along with corpus callosum and brainstem findings, suggestive of diffuse axonal injury. Frontal and temporal lobe volume loss indicated FTD. The 'hummingbird' sign on sagittal images led to consideration of PSP, particularly when combined with brainstem volume loss. Asymmetric ventricular prominence relative to cortical volume loss hinted at NPH, with the corpus callosal angle measured on coronal images to confirm the diagnosis. Although no specific findings were linked to psychiatric disorders, the presence of a cavum septum pellucidum was weakly correlated. Multiple findings in a case, such as global volume loss, extensive white matter changes and microhemorrhages, leaned toward VD over AD due to the subjective nature of volume loss assessment. A higher rating was assigned to the diagnosis with more MRI findings supporting it, though no case received a perfect score of 100, with ratings exceeding 80 indicating a dominant diagnosis.

Main MCD types

In this section, we provide an overview of the most common types of MCD and their aetiologies. Different descriptions have been introduced in the literature over the years depending on the study design and the medical background of the research group (for example, neurologists, radiologists, geneticists or pathologists). Table 1 summarizes the consensus definitions that were agreed on by our working group. These definitions are used throughout the text, and brain imaging examples are provided in Fig. 1. The descriptions are specific to each term and do not consider the presence of abnormalities of other brain structures, which often coexist with MCD. Each MCD type can be further classified on the basis of morphology, topography, severity gradient and involvement of other brain structures. A detailed paper on the MCD neuroimaging features has been published separately by representatives from the Neuro-MIG network.

### Progressive multicystic encephalopathy: is there more than hypoxia-ischemia? [^049a46c0]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Progressive multicystic encephalopathy following prenatal or perinatal hypoxia-ischemia is a well-described phenomenon in the literature. The authors report on a term infant with a devastating encephalopathy and severe neuronal dysfunction immediately after delivery without a known antecedent of prenatal or perinatal hypoxia or distress. Clinical and paraclinical findings in the patient are compared with those described in the literature. The authors focus on the specific results guiding to the final diagnosis of progressive multicystic encephalopathy and the timing of morphologic changes. As in this case, if the criteria of an acute hypoxic event sufficient to cause neonatal encephalopathy are not met, then factors other than hypoxia-ischemia may be leading to progressive multicystic encephalopathy.

### Serial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in cases of glioma: distinguishing tumor recurrence from postresection injury [^b5b0a967]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis of acute stroke and other types of brain injury. Abnormalities in and around the resection cavity on diffusion-weighted imaging have been observed following surgery for infiltrating glioma. The purpose of this study was to investigate prospectively the incidence, time course, and ultimate outcome of these abnormalities.

Methods

Forty-four consecutive patients with newly diagnosed gliomas were prospectively observed using serial MR imaging including diffusion-weighted sequences. Clinical and surgical data were also collected. Immediately postoperatively neuroimaging identified 28 patients (64%) in whom areas of reduced diffusion appeared in or around the resection cavity (mean volume 8.2 ± 1.5 cm³). Complete resolution of this reduced diffusion was demonstrated within 90 days in 24 patients (86%). On subsequent neuroimages these areas demonstrated Gd enhancement as early as postoperative Day 15 and as late as Day 198 and ultimately took on the appearance of encephalomalacia in 26 (93%) of 28 cases. Postoperative reduced diffusion was not predicted by the clinical or surgical parameters that were assessed. No clinical deficits were attributable to the reduced diffusion.

Conclusions

An abnormality related to diffusion-weighted sequences on postoperative MR imaging can occur after resection of newly diagnosed gliomas. In this study the abnormality typically resolved and was replaced by contrast enhancement on follow-up imaging, ultimately demonstrating encephalomalacia on long-term follow up. Findings on neuroimaging during the period of enhancement could be confused with recurrent tumor and interpreted as early treatment failure. Based on the findings of this study the authors strongly suggest that the inclusion of diffusion-weighted sequences in postoperative MR imaging is essential, as is MR imaging immediately before radiation therapy to monitor disease progression. A new enhancement observed after glioma surgery should be interpreted in the context of the diffusion-weighted image obtained immediately postoperatively.

### Neuroradiologic findings in Sotos syndrome [^650c1b90]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Sotos syndrome is a well-known anomaly syndrome characterized by overgrowth, characteristic facial gestalt, and developmental delay, and haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene has been revealed as one of the major genetic causes. However, there have been only a few reports on neuroradiologic findings by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional examination of the brain has not been reported. We examined three cases with typical Sotos syndrome, which also were confirmed by genetic analysis with a specific probe for the NSD1 gene. The results of MRI showed the characteristic features that have been reported previously. The findings obtained by using single-photon emission computed tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggested an association between mental delay and behavioral tendency in Sotos syndrome and immaturity in frontal brain function.

### Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: correlation of serial MRI and outcome [^0c0b0fa2]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Twenty-four patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were examined with serial magnetic resonance imaging up to 4 years of age. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed in the neonatal period, at the fourth month and the fourth year of age, and the findings were compared with the patients' neurodevelopmental outcome at the fourth year of age. Periventricular signal alterations and deep gray matter involvement were usually evident in the initial magnetic resonance imaging studies, and encephalomalacia, periventricular leukomalacia, and atrophy were the common findings on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging studies. In the patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, some correlation between magnetic resonance imaging findings and neurodevelopmental outcome was recognized. The patients with deep gray matter involvement on the initial magnetic resonance imaging had a poor prognosis, and the ones with normal magnetic resonance imaging findings had a favorable neurodevelopmental outcome. On the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging findings, encephalomalacia and periventricular leukomalacia were associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome. In predicting the neurologic outcome at 4 years of age, magnetic resonance imaging findings of the neonatal period had the highest negative predictive value, whereas magnetic resonance imaging findings at 4 months of age and 4 years of age had the highest positive predictive value.

### Early diffusion-weighted images in infants with subcortical leukomalacia [^233b6eab]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

We describe two infants with subcortical leukomalacia and decreased water diffusivity in widespread white matter on magnetic resonance imaging. In both infants, diffusion-weighted imaging at age 1 day revealed a widespread increase in signal intensities, predominantly in subcortical areas. The corticospinal tract in the brainstem was not involved. Subsequently, diffusion-weighted imaging produced apparently normal results, and conventional magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse but subcortical-dominant white matter lesions in the subacute phase. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed a volume loss and gliosis of the white matter. In one infant, psychomotor development was mildly delayed, and epilepsy occurred. The other infant experienced normal development and no epilepsy. Neither infant developed spastic cerebral palsy. These infants represent a characteristic group with perinatal brain injury.

Acute or sub-acute infectious context

Ultrasound in the acute phase may show a widening of pericerebral spaces, which may become echogenic. Subdural empyema corresponds to a collection developed within the subdural space. It can be peripheral or insinuate against the falx, the tentorium. Ultrasound shows a subdural collection that can be transonic or more echogenic and heterogeneous. Other arguments in favour of a true empyema rather than an inflammatory reactive collection are the presence of a boundary with a deep echogenic membrane, the existence of a mass effect, hyperechogenicity of the pia mater. CT demonstrates a contrast enhancement at the periphery of the collection. MRI is also useful with DWI, to look for a restricted water diffusion within the purulent collection.

Other conditions with enlargement of pericerebral spaces

An enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces can be observed in cases of dehydration, malnutrition, and treatment with corticosteroids or anti-mitotic chemotherapy. Other conditions that accompany subarachnoid collections also include metabolic diseases (such as glutaric aciduria type 1). Subdural collections may be observed in coagulopathies, Menkes disease.

Finally, the diagnosis of " brain/cortical atrophy " should be used with caution because the prognosis is pejorative: severe neurological history (neonatal distress, severe trauma, other) is normally found. Clinically, there is some psychomotor retardation; head circumference curve shows a growth defect. Imaging demonstrates circumferential pericerebral subarachnoid effusion. There is a widening of cortical sulci over all the convexity, which is best shown by CT and MRI. The ventricular system is enlarged, but with no sign of trans-ependymal absorption. Reduced total or regional brain volume can be assessed with volumetric MRI.

### Expanding virchow robin spaces in the midbrain causing hydrocephalus [^710acc4a]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a patient who showed cystic lesions in the midbrain and obstructive hydrocephalus. MR imaging features corresponded to abnormal dilatation of perivascular spaces. Similar clinical and MR imaging findings were described in previous reports of patients presenting with mesencephalo-thalamic expanding lacunae; the diagnosis of some of those cases was confirmed at postmortem examination This condition is extremely rare but should be part of a differential diagnosis when evaluating cystic abnormalities in this area of the brain.

AESD

AESD (Table 3) is the most common type of acute encephalopathy in Japan and is described globally. It mainly occurs in infants, with an average age at onset of 1 years 8 months.

TABLE 3
Diagnostic criteria of definite AESD.

AESD typically presents with an early and prolonged seizure on the day of, or the day after, the onset of fever associated with infection. Symptoms often improve over the next 2 to 4 days but are commonly aggravated again over the next 3 to 7 days with a cluster of seizures (late seizure) and encephalopathy.

AESD presents with characteristic imaging findings over time: normal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on days 1 and 2, progressing later to diffusion restriction in the subcortical white matter (bright tree appearance) and high signal along the subcortical U‐fibres on T2‐weighted and fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images on days 3 to 9 (Figure 1a–c).

FIGURE 1
Typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in infection‐triggered encephalopathy syndromes. (a–c) MRI on day 4 in acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (from Figure 2 in Takanashi and Uetani). T2‐weighted image shows (a) cortical swelling and T2 prolongation. Diffusion‐weighted image shows symmetrical high‐signal lesions in the bilateral frontoparietal subcortical white matter with (b) sparing around the central sulci with (c) reduced apparent diffusion coefficient. (d–f) MRI on day 4 in acute necrotizing encephalopathy (from Figure 7.6 in Yamanouchi et al.with permission). Bilateral symmetrical thalamic lesion shows (d) low intensity on T1‐weighted image, (e) high intensity on T2‐weighted image, with (f) restricted diffusion. (g, h) MRI in mild encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (from Figure 3 in Takanashi and Uetani). Diffusion‐weighted image shows restricted diffusion in the (g, h) splenium and (h) genu of the corpus callosum.

In some cases, the early and late seizures may merge into a long single phase. Acute leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion is proposed as a subgroup of AESD that includes all cases that exhibit restricted diffusion predominantly in the subcortical white matter, regardless of the temporal progression pattern of seizures. It is reasonable to consider AESD and acute leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion to be part of the same spectrum, although further study is needed in their pathophysiology and outcomes.

### Imaging characteristics of common suprasellar lesions with emphasis on MRI findings [^b2877c6b]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Suprasellar masses are varied in aetiology and can present diagnostic problems for a radiologist. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has largely replaced computed tomography (CT) as a diagnostic tool for these lesions, although CT can provide complementary information in some conditions. In this article, we review imaging features of common suprasellar lesions with emphasis on MRI features.

### Brain magnetic resonance imaging of children with molybdenum cofactor deficiency [^17847768]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients G, H, J, and L already showed imaging signs of cystic encephalomalacia when their first brain MRI scans were performed at ages 18, 42, 23, and 6 days, respectively. Patient G had a clear history of postnatal onset of acute severe encephalopathy; however, the other three patients had no such history, suggesting a late intrauterine acute event.

Parieto‐occipital SWM underwent cystic transformation earlier, while bifrontal SWM cytotoxic edema progressed to a transitional stage of liquefaction and showed cystic transformation somewhat later (D3, E2, I2). The transition from cytotoxic edema, through a transitional phase of liquefaction, to cystic transformation in Patient D is illustrated in Figure 4.

FIGURE 4
Transition from cytotoxic edema through liquefaction to cystic transformation in an infant with MoCD (Patient D). Upper row (A–D): At age 6 days; Middle row (A1–D1): At age 10 days; Bottom row (A2*–D2): At age 21 days. 1st column: (A–A1): Axial DWI, (A2*): Axial T1WI. DWI sequence was not obtained at age 21 days. 2nd column: (B–B2): Axial T2WI of the frontoparietal lobes. 3rd column: (C–C2): (C) Coronal T2 FLAIR; (C1–C2) Coronal T2WI through the frontal lobes. 4th column: (D–D2): (D) Coronal T2 FLAIR; (D1–D2) Coronal T2WI through the parietal, posterior temporal, and occipital lobes. A–A1: High DWI signal/restricted diffusion in the frontoparietal cortex and subcortical white matter reflect cytotoxic edema at age 6 and 10 days (red arrows). Note restricted diffusion persists with posterior gradient, more striking in the posterior frontal and parietal lobes at age 10 days (A1). B–D: Mildly reduced cortico‐subcortical T2 signal (green arrows)/increased T2 FLAIR signal (blue arrows) compared to deep WM in the swollen cerebral hemispheres with loss of cortical ribbon and sulcal effacement at age 6 days. Note increased water content in deep WM reflecting vasogenic edema. B1–D1: Reduced degree of brain swelling with visualization of previously effaced cerebral sulci. Note high T2 signal in the swollen cerebral white matter (red quadrant) compared to lower T2 signal intensity in the cerebellum (green quadrant); (D1). B2–D2: High uniform T2 signal in the anterior frontal lobes compatible with CSF signal along the sulci represents liquefaction (black asterisks) — a pre‐stage before cystic transformation (B2, C2). Simultaneously, cystic transformation occurred earlier in the posterior frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (orange ovals) (B2, D2). Note interval cerebral atrophy with prominent CSF spaces along the sulci and dilated lateral ventricles at age 21 days. A2*: Low T1 signal in the anterior frontal lobes reflects liquefaction (white asterisks), while cystic transformation occurred with posterior gradient in the parietal and posterior frontal lobes (orange oval).

### Magnetic resonance imaging of traumatic brain injury: a pictorial review [^c86e0cbe]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant source of major morbidity and mortality in blunt trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality of choice for patients with potential brain injury in the acute setting, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a role in evaluating equivocal CT findings and may help with determining long-term prognosis and recovery. MRI is being utilized more commonly in the acute and subacute setting of TBI; therefore, radiologists should be familiar with the MRI appearance of the various manifestations of TBI. Here, we review the imaging of common intracranial injuries with illustrative cases comparing CT and MRI.

### Interpretation scheme for nonexpert pediatricians evaluating magnetic resonance images of children with cerebral palsy [^2330caed]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the usability of our MRI interpretation scheme among pediatricians with different skill levels in evaluating MRI of patients with cerebral palsy. We divided MRI findings into three groups: no abnormalities, pre/perinatally acquired lesions, and other abnormalities. Pre/perinatally acquired lesions were divided into six subgroups. Other abnormalities included brain malformations, ventriculomegaly, atrophic changes, and other unclassifiable abnormalities. We compared the interpretations of eight participants, i.e., three nonexpert pediatricians, two junior pediatric neurologists, and three senior pediatric neurologists, in evaluating magnetic resonance images of 73 children with cerebral palsy. The degree of agreement was substantial or near perfect for all participants. When limited to pre/perinatally acquired lesions, the degree of agreement was near perfect for all but one participant. The rate of correct diagnosis did not differ greatly according to participants' experience with pre/perinatally acquired lesions. For patients with basal ganglia thalamic lesions, multicystic encephalomalacia, and posthemorrhagic porencephaly, the rate of correct diagnosis increased according to participants' experience. Pre/perinatally acquired lesions can be appropriately interpreted by nonexpert pediatricians utilizing our interpretation scheme.

### Assessment of the prevalence and associated risk factors of pediatric hydrocephalus in diagnostic centers in addis ababa, Ethiopia [^1785855c]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydrocephalus (HCP) is defined as a pathophysiology with disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. Infants commonly present with progressive macrocephaly whereas children older than 2 years generally present with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. In the developed world, the incidence of congenital HCP has been estimated to be about 0.5 cases per 1000 live births and the overall incidence of neonatal HCP is estimated to be about 3 to 5 cases per 1000 live births. Neither qualitatively nor quantitatively are there any adequate data/literature to determine the prevalence and incidence of HCP in the developing world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where this condition appears to be much more frequent than in developed countries. Taking some very conservative estimates in Uganda, as an example, between 1000 and 2000 new cases of infant HCP occurs every year, with this most likely being an underestimate. Extrapolating this to other regions suggests 6500 new cases per year in East Africa and more than 45,000 new cases per year in sub-Saharan Africa. HCP is a common neurosurgical disorder that can lead to significant disability or death if not promptly identified and treated. Data on the burden of HCP in low-income countries are limited, given a lack of radiologic resources for the diagnosis of this condition. In Ethiopia, the etiology and incidence rates of HCP can be assumed to correspond to what has been reported from other East African countries, where HCP has been estimated to have an infectious origin. Only a minute fraction of children with HCP in Ethiopia – a few hundred each year - are diagnosed and receive proper treatment for their HCP. This probably means a selection bias that makes it difficult or even impossible to determine or estimate the general characteristics of HCP in Ethiopia concerning etiology, type of HCP, gender, or age composition of the patients. If the estimates on new cases of pediatric HCP in Ethiopia are valid, these children represent an enormous challenge for the nation. HCP has many causes. Congenital HCP, most commonly involving aqueduct stenosis, and HCP can also be acquired, mostly from pathological processes that affect subarachnoid space function. Continued research and education are essential if a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality from this disease is to be accomplished. Hence, this study has assessed the prevalence and possible risk factors of pediatric HCP from a large sample of CT and MRI scans of the head performed at selected diagnostic centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a low-income country in Africa. The findings of this study will give focus on the management of HCP, and will create awareness for the importance of prenatal care given to mothers during their pregnancy.

### Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation: imaging findings and clinical outcome [^d9768af4]. Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

We aim to investigate the clinical onset, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings, and follow-up of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-related inflammation, an uncommon but clinically striking presentation of CAA.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical manifestations, CT/MR imaging findings, and outcome of ten consecutive patients with CAA-related inflammation. In each patient, a brain CT study was performed at hospital admission, and brain MR imaging was carried out 2 to 4 days later. Clinical and radiologic follow-up findings were evaluated in all patients.

Results

The most common clinical onset was rapidly progressive cognitive decline, followed by focal neurological signs. Brain CT/MR showed unenhanced expansive subcortical lesions, corresponding to areas of vasogenic edema, associated with chronic lobar, cortical, or cortical-subcortical micro/macrohemorrhages. Clinical symptoms recovered in a few weeks under treatment in eight patients and spontaneously in the remaining two. MRI follow-up at 2 to 12 months after treatment showed resolution of the lesions. Three patients experienced symptomatic disease recurrence, with new lesions on CT/MR.

Conclusion

In the absence of histological data, early recognition of the clinical symptoms and typical radiologic features of CAA-related inflammation is essential to enable timely establishment of proper treatment.

### Intracranial hemorrhage: ultrasound, CT and MRI findings [^d7235a45]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage is one of the most common causes of acute focal neurologic deficit in children and adults. Neuroimaging including ultrasonography (US), computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential in the diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage. Imaging findings should guide treatment. The highly variable appearance of an intracranial hemorrhage can be challenging. A thorough knowledge of hematoma evolution and US, CT and MR hematoma characteristics is mandatory for adequate interpretation of findings. The purpose of this review is (1) to summarize the imaging characteristics of intracranial hemorrhage on various imaging techniques and (2) to review the various types of intracranial hemorrhage, and their causes.

### A practical approach to supratentorial brain malformations: what radiologists should know [^8092fe53]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

For general radiologists, congenital brain malformations pose substantial challenges in terms of recognition, description, and classification. This review describes a practical approach to imaging and classifying the most common supratentorial brain malformations. It begins with a discussion of embryology and optimal imaging technique and then summarizes distinguishing imaging features for several major categories of cerebral malformation, including holoprosencephaly, gray matter heterotopia, lissencephaly/pachygyria, focal cortical dysplasia, polymicrogyria, and cobblestone malformation. The importance of identifying abnormalities in the corpus callosum and basal ganglia is also discussed, both for detection and characterization of cerebral malformations.
