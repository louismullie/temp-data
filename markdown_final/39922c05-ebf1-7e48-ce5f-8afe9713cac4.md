## Question

Nerve block for foot surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nerve blocks for foot surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indications and goals of regional anesthesia in foot surgery. Then, I should verify the relevant anatomy and which nerves must be targeted. Next, I will examine block selection by surgical site and technique, including ultrasound guidance and catheter options. After that, I need to appraise the evidence for analgesic efficacy, opioid-sparing effects, and functional outcomes. I should also review special populations, especially patients with diabetes and neuropathy. Finally, I will assess safety, complications, and practical implementation, and close with a concise, clinically actionable recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why regional anesthesia matters here. Foot and ankle procedures are among the most painful orthopedic surgeries, with calcaneal surgery frequently cited as the most painful, and early mobilization is often desired in ambulatory care. Regional techniques can reduce opioid requirements, facilitate discharge, and improve satisfaction, aligning with multimodal analgesia principles endorsed by surgical societies [^42abbc1d] [^712a327d] [^56e88786].

> I need to check the key nerves that innervate the foot to ensure I target the right distributions. The foot is supplied primarily by terminal branches of the sciatic nerve — tibial, sural, deep peroneal, and superficial peroneal — with the saphenous nerve from the femoral nerve providing medial ankle and foot sensation; tourniquet pain often requires femoral or saphenous coverage, so I should keep that in mind when planning blocks [^c5269804] [^4a402a02].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single "best" block; I should match technique to procedure. For forefoot surgery such as bunionectomy, an ankle block covering the five nerves is effective, but I should confirm whether the saphenous nerve is actually needed; ultrasound mapping shows the saphenous territory often does not reach the typical bunion incision, so omitting it may be reasonable in many cases, though some surgeons still prefer combined popliteal plus ankle blocks for prolonged analgesia [^7723h13c] [^03003e74] [^38fac612]. For hindfoot and calcaneal surgery, a popliteal sciatic block is standard, but wait, let me verify whether selective tibial and sural blocks can match analgesia while preserving motor function; randomized data show comparable analgesia with faster onset and less repositioning when targeting tibial and sural nerves above the ankle, which can facilitate early ambulation and may reduce fall risk [^d21a0788] [^6ac47b0f] [^dbf08fba]. For midfoot and ankle procedures, combining a popliteal sciatic block with a saphenous block improves medial coverage and tourniquet tolerance, and I should consider adding dexamethasone to prolong duration when appropriate [^728731f9] [^2673d42e].

> Next, I should review guidance modalities and catheter strategies. Ultrasound improves success, reduces needle passes, and shortens procedure time compared with nerve stimulation, and it is cost-effective in many settings; I should confirm that these benefits hold in obese patients and trainees as well, which they do in randomized trials and cost analyses [^173ff1f0] [^6973d1ac] [^1278b215] [^e8151f57] [^9aff36f9]. For continuous analgesia, popliteal catheters provide sustained pain control and reduce opioid consumption, with low complication rates in large series; I should double-check that bilateral continuous blocks are feasible without excess complications, which observational data support, though outpatient confirmation is prudent [^671fa3b5] [^e334292e] [^6c1da22e].

> I will now examine the analgesic and opioid-sparing evidence. Systematic review data show that combined peripheral nerve blocks reduce postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores versus single-site blocks or general anesthesia alone over the first 24–48 hours, with high patient satisfaction; continuous techniques further reduce opioid requirements and improve quality of recovery metrics, which reinforces a multimodal strategy anchored by regional anesthesia [^728731f9] [^6c1da22e]. But wait, what if I am overpromising on opioids? Even with excellent blocks, rebound pain can occur as the block wears off, so I need to ensure a plan for transition analgesia and consider adjuncts like dexamethasone or clonidine to prolong block duration when appropriate [^f63845be] [^2673d42e].

> Let me consider functional outcomes and ambulation, because that is often the decisive factor in foot surgery. Selective tibial and sural blocks avoid common peroneal motor blockade and foot drop, enabling earlier unaided walking after calcaneal surgery compared with popliteal sciatic block, which is a meaningful recovery advantage in ambulatory patients; similarly, plantar compartment blocks for hallux valgus surgery improve early walking metrics versus popliteal sciatic block, supporting motor-sparing strategies when feasible [^6ac47b0f] [^6dbaf86f]. I should confirm that these benefits do not come at the expense of analgesia; indeed, pain control remains comparable in randomized comparisons, which strengthens the case for selective approaches when anatomy and surgical exposure allow [^d21a0788].

> Now, I need to address special populations, especially patients with diabetes and preexisting neuropathy. Patients with diabetic foot have higher stimulation thresholds and experience markedly prolonged sensory and motor block durations, with a small but real risk of transient neuropraxia; I should use the lowest effective dose, avoid high-concentration local anesthetics, and employ ultrasound to minimize intraneural injection risk, while counseling on expected prolonged numbness and monitoring for recovery [^98877302] [^3c44d7f3] [^f3608459]. Hold on, I should verify whether ultrasound and neurostimulation together mitigate injury; observational data suggest combined guidance reduces intraneural injection and vascular injury, though prospective confirmation is limited, so I will still prioritize visualization and gentle technique [^f3608459].

> Next, I should review safety and complications to balance benefits and risks. Serious neurologic complications are rare but possible; large surveys of continuous popliteal blocks report high success with low rates of paresthesia, bleeding, or infection, and no permanent neuropathy in those series, though case reports and reviews remind us to remain vigilant for nerve injury, vascular insult, and local anesthetic systemic toxicity, particularly in patients with comorbidities or distorted anatomy [^671fa3b5] [^592ba80d] [^ed44c23c]. I need to ensure local anesthetic dosing respects maximums, consider epinephrine to reduce systemic absorption when appropriate, and monitor for rebound pain and falls as blocks regress, especially in older adults [^30020d25] [^f63845be].

> Let me synthesize practical implementation. Preoperative planning should map the surgical incision, tourniquet location, and patient-specific risks; ultrasound-guided blocks are preferred, with selective tibial and sural blocks for calcaneal surgery, ankle or Mayo blocks for forefoot procedures, and popliteal sciatic plus saphenous blocks for more extensive foot and ankle surgery; adding dexamethasone can extend analgesia, and continuous catheters are reasonable for major surgery or high opioid risk patients, with clear instructions for catheter care and follow-up [^85e15529] [^728731f9] [^2673d42e] [^671fa3b5]. I should double-check that discharge planning accounts for motor block, fall risk, and pain control after block resolution, and that patients know when to seek care for persistent numbness or weakness [^notfound].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise and evidence-aligned. For most foot surgeries, ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia improves analgesia, reduces opioids, and can accelerate functional recovery when matched to procedure and patient factors; selective tibial and sural blocks are a compelling alternative to popliteal sciatic block for calcaneal surgery, ankle blocks suffice for many forefoot procedures, and combined popliteal plus saphenous blocks optimize coverage for more extensive surgery; in patients with diabetes, anticipate prolonged blockade and use dose-sparing, image-guided techniques to mitigate neurotoxicity risk, while maintaining vigilance for rebound pain and complications [^728731f9] [^d21a0788] [^7723h13c] [^98877302] [^f63845be].

Nerve blocks for foot surgery provide **superior analgesia** [^728731f9] and **reduce opioid use** [^6c1da22e] compared with general anesthesia alone, with ultrasound guidance improving success and safety [^173ff1f0] [^6973d1ac]. Popliteal sciatic block is the **most common** for hindfoot and midfoot procedures, while ankle blocks are preferred for forefoot surgery [^7723h13c] [^03003e74]. Continuous catheters can extend analgesia [^6c1da22e], and adjuncts like dexamethasone prolong block duration [^2673d42e]. Risks include nerve injury, infection, and rebound pain [^592ba80d] [^f63845be], but serious complications are rare [^671fa3b5]; careful patient selection and technique minimize these risks [^4a402a02]. Overall, nerve blocks are a **key part of multimodal analgesia** [^712a327d] and enhanced recovery after foot surgery [^6dbaf86f].

## Common nerve block techniques

Several **nerve block techniques** are commonly used for foot surgery:

| **Nerve block technique** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Popliteal sciatic nerve block | Hindfoot and midfoot surgeries | - Wide coverage <br/> - Prolonged analgesia [^6c1da22e] | - Foot drop <br/> - Delayed ambulation [^38fac612] |
| Ankle block (tibial, sural, deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, saphenous) | Forefoot surgeries | - Preserves motor function <br/> - Early ambulation [^6dbaf86f] | - Limited coverage for complex procedures [^notfound] |

| Selective tibial and sural nerve blocks | Calcaneal surgeries | - Preserves motor function <br/> - Early ambulation [^6ac47b0f] | - Limited coverage for complex procedures [^notfound] |

---

## Ultrasound guidance

Ultrasound guidance has become the **gold standard** for nerve blocks, offering several advantages:

- **Improved accuracy**: Higher success rates and fewer complications [^173ff1f0] [^6973d1ac].
- **Reduced procedure time**: Faster block performance compared with landmark-based techniques [^e8151f57].
- **Real-time visualization**: Allows precise needle placement and local anesthetic distribution [^notfound].

---

## Adjuncts and modifications

Adjuncts such as **dexamethasone** [^2673d42e] and **clonidine** [^f2ae5ea4] can prolong block duration and improve analgesia. Continuous catheters provide extended postoperative pain control [^6c1da22e], and **multimodal analgesia** combining nerve blocks with NSAIDs and acetaminophen is recommended [^712a327d].

---

## Potential complications and risks

While generally safe, nerve blocks carry potential risks:

- **Nerve injury**: Rare but possible, especially with improper technique [^592ba80d].
- **Infection**: Minimal risk with sterile technique [^notfound].
- **Rebound pain**: Severe pain upon block resolution, managed with multimodal analgesia [^f63845be].
- **Local anesthetic toxicity**: Rare with appropriate dosing and technique [^notfound].

---

## Patient selection and contraindications

Nerve blocks are suitable for most patients, but **careful selection is essential**. Contraindications include patient refusal, infection at the injection site, and severe coagulopathy. Patients with pre-existing neuropathy, such as those with diabetes, may require adjusted dosing and close monitoring [^98877302].

---

## Conclusion

Nerve blocks are a **cornerstone of modern foot surgery**, providing superior analgesia, reducing opioid use, and enabling faster recovery. Ultrasound guidance and adjuncts have further improved safety and efficacy, making nerve blocks an essential component of multimodal analgesia and enhanced recovery pathways [^728731f9] [^173ff1f0] [^2673d42e].

Postoperative pain is one of the most important factors in regard to patient outcomes. It has been linked with patient satisfaction, length of stay, and overall hospital costs. Peripheral nerve blocks have provided a safe, effective method to control early postoperative pain when symptoms are most severe. Peripheral nerve blocks, whether used intraoperatively or postoperatively, provide an alternative or adjunct to conventional pain management methods for patients who may not tolerate heavy narcotics or general anesthesia, in particular the elderly and those with cardiopulmonary disease.

### The use of a continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block after surgery involving the foot and ankle: does it improve the quality of recovery? [^6c1da22e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Popliteal sciatic nerve block is a commonly used technique for surgery involving the foot and ankle. However, pain can be difficult to control as the local anesthetic block wears off. Therefore, we hypothesized that extending the block by using a continuous infusion of bupivacaine (0.25%) would provide improved pain management and might facilitate the recovery process after foot or ankle surgery. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 24 consenting patients undergoing foot or ankle surgery with a standardized general anesthetic technique were studied. Before surgery, a popliteal sciatic nerve block was performed in all patients with an 18-gauge Tuohy epidural needle and a peripheral nerve stimulator. After injection of bupivacaine 0.25% 30 mL and placement of a 20-gauge catheter, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.9% saline (control) or bupivacaine 0.25% at a constant rate of 5 mL/h for up to 48 h after surgery. An 11-point verbal rating scale (0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable) was used to assess the severity of pain. Opioid analgesic use was recorded at specific time intervals after surgery. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 1 week after surgery to assess pain scores, as well as patient satisfaction with their pain management and quality of recovery, by using a 100-point verbal rating scale (1 = highly dissatisfied to 100 = highly satisfied). In the bupivacaine group, there was a statistically significant reduction in the maximal pain scores (> 50%) and in opioid use (> 60%) during the postoperative period compared with the control group. Patient satisfaction with postoperative pain management (95 ± 3 versus 77 ± 13) and quality of recovery (96 ± 7 versus 83 ± 14) was significantly improved in the bupivacaine group (versus control). In addition, 40% of the patients in the bupivacaine group (versus none in the control group) were able to be discharged home on the day of surgery (P = 0.087). In conclusion, a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% decreased postoperative pain and the need for opioid analgesic rescue medication after orthopedic surgery involving the foot and ankle, leading to improved patient satisfaction and quality of recovery.

Implications

A continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% (versus saline) at the popliteal fossa by using a simple elastomeric pump is an effective method of decreasing postoperative pain, reducing the opioid analgesic requirement, and increasing patient satisfaction with pain management after orthopedic surgery involving the foot and ankle. More importantly, the use of the continuous sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa facilitated an earlier discharge after lower extremity surgery.

### Popliteal sciatic nerve blocks after foot and ankle surgery: an adjunct to postoperative analgesia [^b795013a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The use of sciatic popliteal nerve blocks in conjunction with common peroneal and saphenous nerve blocks can provide prolonged hours of analgesia after foot and ankle surgery. This adjunct to analgesia allows for reduced amounts of postoperative opioids and the undesirable and adverse effects associated with these drugs. The peripheral blocks are technically easy to perform and offer the surgical patient many hours of pain relief. Furthermore, when utilized preoperatively, a lighter depth of anesthesia can be maintained with little demand for opioids so that the postoperative recovery will be accelerated with fewer complications.

### Nerve block extends nerve function recovery in patients with diabetic foot ulcers [^923e6b52]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders globally, affecting both developed and developing countries. Over the past two decades, the global prevalence of diabetes has surged from 150 million in 2000 to 425 million in 2017, with projections estimating it will reach 629 million by 2045. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the annual global expenditure on diabetes is approximately US $760 billion, anticipated to rise to US $825 billion by 2030. Diabetes and its complications have emerged as a global public health emergency due to the high rates of mortality, morbidity, and disability associated with them. Additionally, the prevalence of neuropathy among individuals with diabetes is approximately 30%. Diabetes can harm the peripheral nerves of the lower extremities, causing a distinctive syndrome. Approximately 8% of diabetic patients experience foot ulcers, and around 1.8% require amputation. An ultrasound-guided lower extremity nerve block is a highly effective option that ensures optimal anesthesia and effective postoperative pain relief during foot surgery for patients with diabetes. However, it is crucial to consider that certain local anesthetics can cause neurotoxicity at high concentrations or with prolonged exposure, potentially resulting in irreversible neurological damage. Peripheral neuropathy often exhibit increased sensitivity to local anesthesia and experience longer-duration nerve blocks in patients with diabetes. Some animal studies suggest that longer-duration nerve blocks may not cause neurotoxicity, although there are conflicting reports on whether nerve blocks can cause neurotoxic injury in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

This study was designed to compare the effects of sciatic and femoral nerve blocks in patients with and without diabetes. The objectives are to determine how diabetic neuropathy influences the stimulation currents required to elicit a motor response during these nerve blocks, and to assess whether nerve blocks result in any neurotoxicity or nerve injury, such as prolonged nerve conduction block.

### Peripheral foot blockade versus popliteal fossa nerve block: a prospective randomized trial in 51 patients [^6c010de2]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The majority of foot and ankle operations are performed on an outpatient basis and often under some form of regional anesthesia. In this prospective, randomized study of 51 patients undergoing elective unilateral forefoot procedures, we compared 2 different anesthetic techniques: the peripheral foot blockade and the popliteal sciatic nerve block. Variables assessed included the quality of surgical anesthesia, postoperative analgesia, and the incidence of postoperative complications. The anesthesia was classified as effective if it was the sole anesthetic technique for the forefoot surgery. We found successful results in both groups: 92% in the foot block group and 96% in the popliteal block group. Analysis of time required to perform the anesthetic procedure showed a significant difference between the 2 groups, with foot block being considerably faster (14.3 minutes vs 19.2 minutes for popliteal block) (P = 0.0078). Foot block patients demonstrated 10.96 hours of analgesia, whereas popliteal block patients exhibited 14.32 hours (P = 0.132). With a mean follow-up of 5.7 months, we did not find anesthesia-related complications in any of the patients. Both techniques showed a high level of safety and efficacy, with no significant difference detected between them. Our patients showed a high rate of satisfaction with both procedures (96% for foot block patients and 96.1% for popliteal block patients) and reported a good discharge disposition. These data show that both procedures are safe and effective anesthetic techniques and well suited to forefoot ambulatory surgery.

### Neurological complications related to elective orthopedic surgery: part 3: common foot and ankle procedures [^ed44c23c]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part III of a review series on neurological complications of orthopedic surgery, this article describes the mechanisms and likelihood of peripheral nerve injury associated with some of the most common elective foot and ankle procedures for which anesthesiologists may administer regional anesthesia. Relevant information is broadly organized according to type of surgical procedure to facilitate reference by anesthesiologists and members of the anesthesia care team.

What's New

As the popularity of regional anesthesia continues to increase with the development of ultrasound guidance, anesthesiologists should have a thoughtful understanding of the nerves at risk of surgical injury during elective foot and ankle procedures.

### American College of Foot and Ankle SurgeonsClinical consensus statement: perioperative management [^712a327d]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons — postoperative pain management: Consensus statement: "Foot and ankle surgeons should consider a multimodal approach to postoperative pain management" was appropriate. The document explains that "Traditionally, pain control after surgery has been achieved with the use of opioid analgesics and other narcotics," but "these agents are clearly associated with several negative effects, including respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and physical dependence." In response, "a multimodal approach to postoperative pain management has been widely advocated," with effective approaches including "opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, alpha-2-delta ligands (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks, periarticular injections, and intra-articular infusions." The panel also notes that "narcotic use should be short-term after acute surgical intervention, although no universal definition of 'short term' has been identified," and that decisions "should be made on an individual basis with clear open lines of physician–patient communication."

### Combination lower extremity nerve blocks and their effect on postoperative pain and opioid consumption: a systematic review [^728731f9]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature examining postoperative outcomes following single site and combined peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), including (1) sciatic and femoral nerve, (2) popliteal and saphenous nerve, and (3) popliteal and ankle nerve, during elective foot and ankle surgery. We hypothesized that combination blocks would decrease postoperative narcotic consumption and afford more effective postoperative pain control as compared to general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, or single site PNBs. A review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2009 to October 2019. We identified studies by using synonyms for "foot", "ankle" "pain management", "opioid", and "nerve block". Included articles explicitly focused on elective foot and ankle procedures performed under general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, PNB, or with some combination of these techniques. PNB techniques included femoral, adductor canal, sciatic, popliteal, saphenous, and ankle blocks, as well as blocks that combined multiple anatomic sites. Outcomes measured included postoperative narcotic consumption as well as patient-reported efficacy of pain control. Twenty-eight studies encompassing 6703 patients were included. Of the included studies, 57% were randomized controlled trials, 18% were prospective comparison studies, and 25% were retrospective comparison studies. Postoperative opioid consumption and postoperative pain levels were reduced over the first 24 to 48 hours with the use of combined PNBs when compared with single site PNBs, both when used as primary anesthesia or when used in concert with general anesthesia either alone or combined with systemic/local anesthesia in the first 24 to 48 hours following surgery. Studies demonstrated higher reported patient satisfaction of postoperative pain control in patients who received combined PNB. Nine of 14 (64%) studies reported no neurologic related complications with an overall reported rate among all studies ranging from 0% to 41%. Our study identified substantial improvement in postoperative pain levels, postoperative opioid consumption, and patient satisfaction in patients receiving PNB when compared with patients who did not receive PNB. Published data also demonstrated that combination PNB are more effective than single-site PNB for all data points. Notably, the addition of a femoral nerve block to a popliteal nerve block during use of a thigh tourniquet, as well as addition of either saphenous or ankle blockade to popliteal nerve block during use of calf tourniquet, may increase overall block effectiveness. Serious complications including neurologic damage following PNB administration are rare but do exist.

### Effect of peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia on the hemodynamics and prognosis of diabetic patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery [^278f3798]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus significantly impairs global public health, with over 422 million individuals affected worldwide, according to 2014 statistics. This trend is expected to continue, with an estimated 642 million individuals projected to live with diabetes over the next two decades. The challenging course of therapy, high medical costs, and increased incidence burden patients' financial and mental well-being, particularly for diabetic foot, one of the most severe complications of diabetes. Peripheral neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, and foot ulcers are common ailments among lower-limb diabetics. Research shows that 10–25% of diabetic individuals will develop DFUs at some point, within five years of ulcer onset, 5% of individuals will undergo limb amputation, while 50–70% are expected to experience mortality. The conventional approach for treating this condition entails surgical debridement or amputation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that multiple debridement procedures can significantly enhance wound healing rates and thus represent a valuable therapeutic option. However, most patients with DFUs are older, have had diabetes for an extended period, have at least one comorbid condition, and suffer from multiple organ disorders. Ensuring stable hemodynamics while administering appropriate anesthetic and analgesia is a critical concern. PNB with ultrasound guidance have garnered increased acceptance stemming from their heightened efficacy and capacity to ameliorate systemic complications associated with GEA. In contrast to the adverse impact of the latter on cardiopulmonary function, ultrasound-guided PNB have proved instrumental in not only impeding the activation of inflammatory factors but also in restraining the physiological reaction engendered by surgical trauma, thereby curtailing the accompanying injury. In this retrospective study, we examined the impact of GEA and PNB anesthetic techniques on intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative analgesia, and treatment results for DFUs.

### What is the minimum effective volume of local anesthetic required for sciatic nerve blockade? A prospective, randomized comparison between a popliteal and a subgluteal approach [^3618763d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

For sciatic nerve blockade, no study has defined the optimal volume of local anesthetic required to block the nerve. The current, prospective, randomized investigation was designed to find a minimum volume of 1.5% mepivacaine required to block the sciatic nerve using the subgluteal and posterior popliteal approaches. A total of 56 patients undergoing foot surgery were randomly assigned to receive sciatic nerve block by means of a posterior subgluteal (group subgluteal, n = 28) or a posterior popliteal (group popliteal, n = 28) approaches. All blocks were performed with the use a nerve stimulator (stimulating frequency, 2 Hz, intensity 1.5–0.5 mA) and a perineural stimulating catheter. In all patients, plantar flexion of the foot was elicited at < 0.5 mA, to maintain consistency among groups. The volume of local anesthetic used in each patient was based on the modified Dixon's up-and-down method. Complete anesthesia was defined as complete loss of pinprick sensation in the sciatic nerve distribution with concomitant inability to perform plantar or dorsal flexion of the foot 20 min after injection. The mean volume of local anesthetic required to block the sciatic nerve was 12 ± 3 mL in the subgluteal group and 20 ± 3 mL in the popliteal group (P < 0.05). The ED95 for adequate block of the sciatic nerve was 17 mL in the subgluteal group and 30 mL in the popliteal group. The authors conclude that a larger volume of local anesthetic is necessary to block the sciatic nerve at a more distal site (popliteal approach) as compared with a more proximal level (subgluteal approach).

### Spinal anesthesia with peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia with peripheral nerve block for elective foot and ankle surgeries: a retrospective single-center study [^7dd6f2ee]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral nerve blocks are the regional techniques in orthopedic surgeries to control postoperative pain and have early discharge from hospital. However, anesthesia protocols for foot and ankle surgeries of institutes do not include multimodal analgesics including peripheral nerve blocks. The objective of the study was to compare spinal anesthesia with peripheral nerve block against general anesthesia with peripheral nerve block for elective foot and ankle surgeries. Patients have treated for elective foot and ankle surgery under general anesthesia (using propofol, 0.05 mg/kg dezocine, and 1% sevoflurane; GA cohort, n = 112) or spinal anesthesia (using 0.5% bupivacaine, propofol, and 0.05 mg/kg dezocine; SA cohort, n = 132) or patients have treated for elective for foot and ankle surgery under general anesthesia (GL cohort, n = 115) or spinal anesthesia (SL cohort, n = 160) with the use of peripheral nerve block (the sciatic nerve blocks and adductor canal nerve blocks using 0.25% bupivacaine and 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone). Propofol was administered in fewer amounts if anesthesia was used with the peripheral nerve block. Patients of the GL cohort were transferred to ward 36 minutes (mean) earlier than those of the SL cohort. None of the patients of the GL and the SL cohorts have received intraoperative opioid(s) for the management of pain. Patients of the GL and the SL cohorts have reported postoperative falls within 1 day after surgeries during movement. Patients of the SL cohort experienced more frequently difficulty with sleeping. Patients of the GL and the GA cohorts have reported nausea and vomiting. Only patients of the GL cohort were required usage of vasoactive drugs. The study provides information to anesthesiologists and surgeons regarding anesthesia techniques for elective foot and ankle surgeries for better surgical outcomes (Technical Efficacy Stage: 4).

### Effect of nerve stimulation use on the success rate of ultrasound-guided subsartorial saphenous nerve block: a randomized controlled trial [^7f4e2cb5]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Ultrasound-guided subsartorial saphenous nerve block is commonly used to provide complete surgical anesthesia of the foot and ankle in combination with a popliteal sciatic nerve block. However, in part owing to its small caliber and absence of a prominent vascular landmark in the subsartorial plane distal to the adductor canal, the saphenous nerve is more difficult to reliably block than the sciatic nerve in the popliteal fossa. Although the saphenous nerve is a sensory nerve only, neurostimulation can be used to elicit a "tapping" sensation on the anteromedial aspect of the lower leg extending toward the medial malleolus. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that the addition of nerve stimulation use to an ultrasound (US)-guided technique will increase the success rate of subsartorial saphenous nerve block.

Methods

With institutional human ethics board approval and participants' written informed consent, we enrolled 80 patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery in a randomized, single-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive US-guided subsartorial saphenous nerve block either alone (US group) or with the use of additional nerve stimulation (NS group; time limit, 5 minutes). For saphenous nerve blockade, all patients received 10 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine. The primary end point was complete absence of sensation to pinprick at 30 minutes at two different anatomic areas in the distribution of the saphenous nerve (2 cm proximal to the medial malleolus and 10 cm distal to the medial tibial condyle). Secondary end points included decreased sensation at 30 minutes and block failure (normal sensation) at 30 minutes. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02382744.

Results

All 80 patients completed the trial (40 patients in each group). Twenty-two patients (55%) in the NS group versus 18 (45%) in the US group had complete absence of sensation to pinprick at 30 minutes at both anatomic areas of assessment (Fisher exact test, P = 0.25 [one sided]; 95% confidence interval of difference in proportions, -11.9% to 31.9%). The percentages of patients with any evidence of block (decreased or complete absence of sensation) at both areas at 30 minutes were 92.5% (NS) and 97.5% (US), respectively (P = 0.62 [two sided]); corresponding failure rates (normal sensation) were 7.5% (NS) and 2.5% (US). In the NS group, no response in the saphenous nerve distribution was elicited within 5 minutes of stimulation time limit in 20% of patients (n = 8). All of the patients in the NS group with normal sensation at 30 minutes (n = 3) were among this subcohort.

Conclusions

The addition of the use of nerve stimulation did not improve the success rate of US-guided subsartorial saphenous nerve block. However, in the NS group, an inability to elicit a "tapping" sensation in the saphenous nerve distribution was associated with block failure.

### Nerve block research in diabetic foot ulcers: concerns and suggestions [response to letter] [^77432e47]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Exploring alternate anesthetics and adjuvant therapies to reduce the risk of neurotoxicity is a noble goal that aligns with our mission of improving patient safety and anesthesia quality. In current research and clinical practice, achieving this goal may be challenging. The development of new narcotic drugs or the optimization of existing drugs requires in-depth scientific research, including the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs. New drugs or treatments need to go through rigorous clinical trials to verify their safety and effectiveness, which can take significant time and resources. In addition, developing new drugs or treatments can involve high costs, which may limit the feasibility of some alternatives. Despite these challenges, we remain open to your suggestions and will continue to explore and research new narcotic drugs and treatments to the extent possible. We believe that through continued research and innovation, we can gradually overcome these barriers and provide safer and more effective anesthesia and analgesia regimens for patients.

### Bunionectomy as an acute postoperative pain model: overview of common experimental methods, and insights from past clinical trials [^82f3dd93]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Mayo Block

The Mayo block is a field block around the base of the first metatarsal. Local anesthetic is infiltrated proximal to the surgical site in a ring-type fashion. The block is performed after the patient is sedated but before surgery is initiated. The patient generally experiences dense anesthesia and near-complete numbness of the surgical area. The onset and duration of the block will vary depending on the local anesthetic employed (see Table 2). In bunionectomy trials, all subjects (regardless of the dosing paradigm) will receive a Mayo block. Subjects in Postoperative Dosing, Day 1 studies will also receive a popliteal block.

Table 2
Example Mayo Block Specifications

Popliteal Block

In Postoperative Day 1 studies (Paradigm D), a popliteal sciatic nerve catheter is placed in the popliteal fossa (the diamond-shaped space behind the knee joint) under ultrasound guidance. The catheter is used to infuse an intermediate-duration local anesthetic giving rise to a numb foot in most subjects.

Administration of local anesthetic for the popliteal block involves a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion and optional bolus doses. A variety of local anesthetics can be used. Examples of typical infusion protocols are presented in Table 3.

Table 3
Example Popliteal Block Specifications

Example popliteal block specifications can be found in Table 3. The popliteal block is typically removed early in the morning on the day after surgery (at/around 4am). Numbness in the foot recedes over the next 8 hours. When the patient develops adequate pain (see Postoperative Inclusion Criteria), they are randomized into the study and administered their first dose of study treatment.

### Popliteal blocks for foot and ankle surgery: success rate and contributing factors [^f66e95e2]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the factors contributing to the success of popliteal nerve blocks performed by podiatric surgical residents in various stages of training. A retrospective review was conducted of 143 consecutively performed blocks during a 2-year period. A total of 29 blocks using a lateral approach and 114 blocks using a modified posterior approach were performed. The intrinsic and extrinsic variables contributing to block outcome were analyzed. A total of 109 successful blocks were performed, for an overall success rate of 76.2%. Significant differences (p < .002) were found between the success and failure groups with respect to the patients body mass index and age. No differences were observed between the success and failure groups with respect to the block approach or months of resident training. In conclusion, podiatric surgical residents in all stages of training can safely and effectively perform popliteal nerve blocks for peri- and postoperative analgesia. Surgeons should be aware of the potential influence of patients body mass index and age on the overall block success rates.

### A technique guide in ultrasound guided regional ankle blocks [^85e15529]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of ultrasound guided regional blocks is supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence of the United Kingdom, for its safety and efficacy. This is a technique guide which is a culmination of the experiences gained in administering regional anesthesia under ultrasound guidance for ankle blocks as part of everyday podiatric surgery practice, based on a sound understanding of the principles of ultrasound science and instrumentation. It is in the opinion of the authors that the positioning of the patient is key, combined with an in-plane ultrasound guided technique, to perform a successful block of the selected nerve based on a foundation of knowledge and experience of anatomy and use of ultrasound respectively. This technique guide depicts annotated ultrasound images of the sonoanatomy to include the five nerves which innovate the foot that are required to be anesthetized for a selective or complete regional ankle block offering predictable peri-operative anesthesia, post-operative analgesia and early ambulatory discharge.

### Nerve block research in diabetic foot ulcers: concerns and suggestions [letter] [^2d1a6d6a]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor

We read Wei et al's articleon nerve block in diabetic foot ulcer patients with interest. The study examined nerve stimulation thresholds and block duration. As hand and foot surgeons, we greatly appreciate the clinical relevance of this research, particularly in light of the high incidence of diabetes-related complications among our patients. However, we would like to raise some concerns and offer constructive suggestions to improve the comprehensiveness and impact of the study.

Firstly, we commend the authors for their effort in conducting a prospective cohort study that compares nerve block characteristics between patients with and without diabetes. Their findings of increased stimulation thresholds and prolonged nerve block durations in diabetics offer insights into diabetic neuropathy. However, the analysis could be enhanced by considering additional factors such as glycemic control, diabetes duration, and neuropathy severity (assessed via standardized scales). These factors, known to impact neuropathic pain outcomes in type 1 diabetes, are supported by evidence from studies like Braffett et alwhich reported a high incidence of neuropathic pain in type 1 diabetes patients. Incorporating these factors could lead to a more nuanced understanding and improved clinical strategies for managing neuropathic pain in diabetics.

Secondly, we are concerned about the potential risk of neurotoxicity associated with the prolonged nerve blocks observed in diabetic patients. The study mentions that nerve injury was observed in 4 patients (4.8%) within the diabetes mellitus group, which is a notable finding. However, the specific nature and severity of these injuries are not clearly described. We recommend that the authors provide more detailed information on the type, severity, and clinical course of these nerve injuries. Additionally, further discussion on the potential mechanisms underlying the prolonged nerve block durations and increased risk of neurotoxicity in diabetic patients would strengthen the conclusions of the study.

In terms of constructive suggestions, we recommend that the authors consider including additional outcome measures in future studies. For instance, assessing patient-reported outcomes such as pain levels, functional recovery, and quality of life could provide a more holistic view of the impact of nerve blocks on diabetic foot ulcer patients. Additionally, long-term follow-up studies would be valuable to understand the persistent effects of nerve blocks on nerve function recovery and the development of chronic neuropathic pain. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore the use of alternative anesthetics or adjuvant methods that may have a reduced risk of neurotoxicity while maintaining adequate anesthesia and analgesia.

### Ultrasound-guided subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve block: there is more to it than meets the eyes [^b17d1a43]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The popliteal sciatic nerve block is routinely used for anesthesia and analgesia during foot and ankle surgery. This article reviews our current understanding of the anatomy of the sciatic nerve and discusses how fascial tissue layers associated with the nerve may affect block outcomes. The anatomy of the sciatic nerve is more complex than previously described. The tibial and common peroneal nerves within the sciatic nerve trunk appear to be centrally separated by the Compton-Cruveilhier septum and encompassed by their own paraneural sheaths. This unique internal architecture of the sciatic nerve appears to promote proximal spread of local anesthetic to the internal aspect of the sciatic nerve trunk after a subparaneural injection at or below the divergence of the tibial and common peroneal nerves.

### Effect of peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia on the hemodynamics and prognosis of diabetic patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery [^324f0d2d]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To conclude, our study highlights the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided PNB anesthesia in enhancing clinical safety during the surgical treatment of DFUs. By providing precise localization of nerve blocks, ultrasound guidance notably reduces the total volume of fluid required during surgery. This, in turn, promotes hemodynamic stability, lowers postoperative pain levels (as assessed by NRS scores), and diminishes the reliance on analgesic medications. Although the 5-year mortality rate is 30.5%, no significant difference in mortality rates between the two groups was observed. These findings underscore the clinical significance and practicality of employing ultrasound-guided PNB anesthesia in the surgical management of DFUs.

### Neuro-orthopedic surgery for equinovarus foot deformity in adults: a narrative review [^e4f6a7e9]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Neuro-orthopedic surgery is an alternative to the conservative treatment of spastic equinovarus foot (SEF) in adults. The objective of the present narrative review was to summarize current practice with regard to patient assessment, the choice of treatment, the various neuro-orthopedic procedures, and the latter's outcomes. We searched literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane) for original articles or opinion papers on surgical treatment of spastic equinovarus foot in adults. Neuro-orthopedic approaches require a careful analysis of the patient's and/or his/her caregiver needs and thus relevant treatment goals. Surgical planning requires detailed knowledge of impairments involved in the spastic equinovarus foot deformity based on a careful clinical examination and additional information from diagnostic nerve blocks and/or a quantitative gait analysis. Procedures mainly target nerves (neurotomy) and tendons (lengthening, transfer, tenotomy). These procedures reduce impairments (spasticity, range of motion, and foot position), improve gait and walking function, but their impact on participation and personalized treatment goals remains to be demonstrated. Neuro-orthopedic surgery is an effective treatment option for spastic equinovarus foot in adults. However, practice is still very heterogeneous and there is no consensus on the medical strategies to be applied before, during and after surgery (particularly the type of anesthesia, the need for immobilization, rehabilitation procedures).

### Is circumferential injection advantageous for ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block? a proof-of-concept study [^db9b29b6]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasound (US) guidance, in some instances, can increase the success rate and reduce the onset and procedure times for peripheral nerve blockade compared with traditional nerve localization techniques. The presumptive mechanism for these benefits is the ability to accurately inject local anesthetic circumferentially around the target nerve. We aimed to determine whether ensuring circumferential spread of local anesthetic is advantageous for US-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block.

Methods

Sixty-four adult patients undergoing US-guided popliteal sciatic block for elective foot and ankle surgery were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups, circumferential or single-location injection. Using a short-axis nerve view and out-of-plane needle approach, the needle tip was advanced to the posterior external surface of the sciatic nerve. A 30-mL local anesthetic admixture (1:1 lidocaine 2%/bupivacaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine) was injected either entirely at this location (single location) or incrementally at multiple locations to ensure circumferential spread around the sciatic nerve (circumferential). Sensory and motor functions were assessed by a blinded observer at predetermined intervals. The primary outcome was sensory block defined as loss of sensation to pinprick in the distribution of both tibial and common peroneal nerves at 30 mins after injection.

Results

Sensory block was achieved in 94% of patients in the circumferential injection group compared with 69% in the single-location injection group (P = 0.010). There were no differences detected in block performance time, pain during block performance, or block-related complications between groups.

Conclusions

Ultrasound-guided circumferential injection of local anesthetic around the sciatic nerve at the popliteal fossa can improve the rate of sensory block without an increase in block procedure time or block-related complications compared with a single-location injection technique.

### Ultrasound-guided sural nerve and tibial nerve block provides comparable analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve block following calcaneal surgery: a single center randomized controlled double-blind study [^8b7b5dd5]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The study demonstrates that ultrasound-guided sural and tibial nerve blocks provide comparable postoperative analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve blocks following calcaneal surgery. The findings align closely with our primary objective of evaluating the efficacy of selective nerve blocks and highlight their practical advantages, including reduced procedural time, quicker onset, and improved patient comfort. These results support the use of sural and tibial nerve blocks as a viable alternative to traditional sciatic nerve blocks, particularly in patients with mobility limitations.

Ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block has multiple approaches, including the classical greater trochanter level, subgluteal, and popliteal fossa approaches, which are widely used in lower extremity surgery. Surgery for calcaneal fractures typically requires a lateral ankle incision, making sciatic nerve block the primary choice for both intraoperative anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. Although a new anterior thigh approach for sciatic nerve block has been proposed in recent years, studies and clinical practice have demonstrated that the popliteal fossa approach for sciatic nerve block is the simplest and most reliable technique.

The nerves involved in the calcaneus and its surrounding soft tissues include the saphenous nerve (from the femoral nerve), tibial nerve, and sural nerve. It has been found that the tibial nerve primarily controls the movement and sensation of the plantar region. Ultrasound-guided tibial nerve blocks have been used for procedures such as foreign object removal from the foot and treatment of frostbite injuries. Since calcaneal surgery often utilizes a lateral incision, the main nerves involved in the procedure are the tibial nerve and the sural nerve. Blocking these nerves above the ankle provides anesthesia coverage for the lateral aspect of the calcaneus and the skin of the sole, which aligns perfectly with the surgical site.

Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of combining the sural nerve block with the tibial nerve block for postoperative pain relief in calcaneal surgery. However, the use of combined ultrasound-guided sural and tibial nerve blocks above the ankle for anesthesia and pain management in calcaneal surgery, compared to the classical sciatic nerve block, remains unknown. This study aims to compare the operation time, onset time, analgesic effectiveness, and patient's satisfaction with the classical popliteal sciatic nerve block, while also evaluating the feasibility of performing the nerve blocks without repositioning the patient.

### Nerve blocks: part II. lower extremity [^4a402a02]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Family physicians use anesthesia to provide diagnostic and procedural analgesia for conditions such as neuropathies, fracture reduction, foreign body removals, and complex wound management. Local infiltration of anesthetics is commonly used in this setting because of the ease of use, safety, and effectiveness of the procedure. Nerve blocks are a specific regional anesthesia technique that blocks nerve function distal to the injection site. An understanding of the sensory distribution of the peripheral nervous system is essential in determining the safest and most effective nerve block for the procedure. There are various nerve block techniques, including landmark-guided and ultrasound-guided. Ultrasound guidance increases the effectiveness of the nerve block while decreasing complications when compared with other techniques. Depending on the required area of anesthesia for the procedure, various points throughout the lower extremity can be used to block the lateral femoral cutaneous, common peroneal, saphenous, tibial, deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, and sural nerves.

### Ultrasound-guided single-penetration dual-injection block for leg and foot surgery: a prospective, randomized, double-blind study [^6f0e4ab8]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

We describe a new approach to blocking the sciatic and saphenous nerves in the proximal thigh (level of the lesser trochanter or immediately below) using a single-penetration dual-injection (SPEDI) technique. The popliteal-sciatic approach necessitates repositioning of the leg exposing the popliteal fossa and an extra injection for the saphenous nerve (SAN) block at the midthigh level. We introduce an alternative, effective, and possibly faster method.

Methods

Sixty patients undergoing leg and foot surgery under general anesthesia were included. We deposited 15 mL of ropivacaine 0.75% around the sciatic nerve (SCN) and 5 mL of ropivacaine 0.75% at the SAN. Patients were randomized to the popliteal-sciatic/saphenous technique or the SPEDI technique. The primary outcome measure was performance time. Positioning time, pain assessment, nausea in the postanesthesia care unit, sufentanil demand, dermatomal anesthesia, and degree of motor blockade were also recorded.

Results

Performance time was significantly faster with the SPEDI technique (median time, 110 seconds [range, 57–315 seconds] vs 246 seconds [range, 163–472 seconds]; P < 0.0001). Positioning time was significantly shorter with the SPEDI technique (P < 0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were recorded.

Conclusions

The SPEDI block resulted in significantly faster performance time and reduced positioning time with statistically equal efficacy in relation to pain assessment, nausea, sufentanil demand, dermatomal anesthesia, and motor blockade. The SPEDI block is statistically an equally effective alternative to the traditional popliteal-sciatic/saphenous block combination for leg and foot surgery, but it is faster, requires only 1 skin penetration, and does not require repositioning of the leg.

### Effect of peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia on the hemodynamics and prognosis of diabetic patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery [^ab18f6de]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The preparation time was significantly longer for the PNB group than for the GEA group (30 vs. 15 minutes, P < 0.05). The operative time was also different between the two groups, with the PNB group taking longer (60 (45, 80) vs. 50 (30, 69.25) minutes, P < 0.05). This disparity could be due to patients undergoing nerve blockades being awake and potentially moving their limbs during surgery, which could interfere with the surgeon's work, or they may inquire about the status of the procedure, which could also interfere with the surgeon's work. Moreira et al. investigated the effects of various anesthetic techniques on the postoperative outcomes of elderly patients with partial or complete functional limitations who underwent significant lower limb amputation surgery. Similar to the findings of this study, they found that the different anesthetic techniques did not significantly impact patients' postoperative outcomes. Still, the GEA group had a shorter operation time than PNB group. However, the length of anesthetic maintenance between the two groups was similar.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^38fac612]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus repair can also be performed under a combined saphenous and popliteal sciatic nerve blocks, but no trial specifically investigated this approach with a control group. Noteworthy, one trial compared a sciatic nerve block with another regional technique, a mid-foot block, both combined with sedation; the authors concluded that both techniques provided similar postoperative analgesia after hallux valgus repair, although ambulation was delayed in the sciatic nerve block group. McLeod and colleaguescompared sciatic nerve block with wound infiltration and also found similar postoperative analgesia in both groups when patients had foot surgery under general anesthesia. Finally, a trial published more than 25 years ago showed that sciatic nerve block and ankle block performed with anatomical landmarks after forefoot surgery under general anesthesia resulted in comparable postoperative pain control. Of note, these last two studies showed significantly longer analgesia with sciatic nerve block compared with wound infiltrationor ankle blockwith the same solution (0.5% bupivacaine). Notwithstanding, additional research is needed to properly compare a sciatic nerve block with an ankle block under ultrasound guidance in a contemporary practice. Many trials compared different injection techniques or different concentrations of local anesthetic for sciatic nerve block. But according to our methodology, we do not elaborate recommendations on these items because no comparison is performed against a control group. That said, combining fentanyl or clonidine with local anesthetics for a combined femoral and sciatic nerve block does not reduce pain scores or opioid consumption but prolongs time to first analgesic request in the postoperative period. When considering a sciatic nerve block for an outpatient procedure, the patient's recovery plan and weightbearing status should be considered. For patients whose surgeons do not restrict weightbearing postoperatively, an ankle block avoids foot drop from sciatic nerve block, which may improve safety at home.

### Consensus guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience for the use of 60-day peripheral nerve stimulation therapy. A NEURON living guideline project [^c5269804]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Rationale

Foot and ankle surgery remains among the most common surgical areas in orthopedics and podiatry. Foot and ankle disorders are common reasons for orthopedic surgical intervention and common causes of persistent post-operative pain. These surgical procedures can include hallux valgus repairs (bunionectomy), arthroscopies, foot and ankle fracture repairs, Achilles tendon repairs, ankle arthrodesis, and total ankle replacements.

The nerves that innervate the foot and ankle are predominantly branches of the sciatic nerve (distal branches include common peroneal, deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, sural, and tibial nerves) and, to a lesser degree, the femoral nerve (saphenous nerve). These terminal peripheral nerves are small and course superficially as they run toward the foot and ankle. They are vulnerable to trauma, stretch, and compression injuries.

Historically, the sciatic and femoral/saphenous nerves have been blocked using regional anesthesia in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery. With PNS, these same nerves can be targeted to provide focal, robust relief while preserving motor function and allowing for participation in rehabilitation therapies, including physical therapy, movement, and desensitization.

Anatomic Considerations

When considering PNS for lower extremity nerves, it is crucial to avoid lead placement across large joints, such as the hip or knee, to minimize the risk of lead migration. The ergonomics and wearability of the IPG should also be assessed, with particular attention to avoiding locations like the posterior thigh or pelvic area, which may interfere with sitting and physical activities. In cases of lower extremity amputation surgery, consideration for future prosthetic placement should be part of the PNS lead placement planning. Ideally, the lead should be proximal to the amputation site to avoid mechanical compression or stresses from dressings and/or prosthetic devices.

### Catheter-based distal sciatic nerve block in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^01e10c6a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2500 people. The disease is caused by duplication on chromosome 17p11.2. Demyelination of peripheral nerves cause marked slowing of nerve conduction velocity and a decrease in compound motor and sensory nerve action potentials. Patients suffer from slowly progressive distal muscle wasting, weakness and sensory loss, first affecting the feet and legs. Foot deformities cause gait disturbances and balance problems. To overcome these problems CMT patients often have to undergo foot surgery to improve their walking ability.

Peripheral nerve blocks provide good postoperative analgesia and support postoperative rehabilitation with a high rate of patient satisfaction. Many anesthesiologists fear permanent neurological injury or aggravation of the underlying disease when performing regional anesthesia in patients with pre-existing neuropathy. In contrast, as far as the authors know, there is no case published documenting any adverse outcome following peripheral nerve block in CMT patients. We therefore prospectively studied the efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction of distal sciatic block in CMT patients scheduled for foot surgery. In this article we report on our experience in performing a distal sciatic block in a small series of CMT patients.

### Ultrasound-guided sural nerve and tibial nerve block provides comparable analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve block following calcaneal surgery: a single center randomized controlled double-blind study [^72836a44]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcaneal fractures are frequently encountered in clinical settings, often characterized by marked post-fracture displacement. Conservative management is often less effective, necessitating surgical intervention in many cases. The surgical procedure typically entails an extended "L"-shaped incision along the lateral aspect of the heel, subsequent fracture reduction, and internal fixation using a plate. Placing the plate on the lateral side of the calcaneus is conducive to restoring its anatomical integrity, resulting in precise therapeutic outcomes. After surgical treatment of calcaneus fractures, particularly high pain intensities are observed. This can be attributed to the rich innervation of the calcaneus and the extensive dissection involved in the surgical approach. Appropriate pain management protocols are essential following these procedures to enable early rehabilitation and return to function.

Historically, spinal anesthesia and endotracheal intubation general anesthesia were the preferred anesthetic techniques for this surgery. However, limitations such as specific patient conditions and anticoagulation therapy curtailed the use of these methods. Currently, a more comfortable anesthesia approach is often achieved using a combination of regional nerve blocks with general anesthesia. Consequently, popliteal sciatic nerve blocks have gradually become the preferred choice for anesthesia and analgesia in calcaneal surgery. While effective, conventional preoperative popliteal blocks require patient repositioning, causing discomfort and potential refusal. With ultrasound guidance, popliteal blocks can now be performed without repositioning, through precise nerve localization with the patient supine. This avoids the significant discomfort of traditional popliteal blocks requiring repositioning and better meets the demands for maximizing patient comfort in calcaneal surgery.

The tibial nerve innervates the plantar heel, while the sural nerve supplies the lateral heel and ankle. Targeting these nerves allows precise pain control with minimal anesthesia in other areas, making them critical for effective analgesia in calcaneal surgery. We hypothesize that ultrasound-guided sural and tibial nerve blocks will provide comparable postoperative analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve blocks while improving procedural efficiency and patient comfort.

### Ultrasound guidance improves a continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block when compared with nerve stimulation [^6973d1ac]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Continuous sciatic nerve blockade at the popliteal level effectively alleviates postoperative pain after major foot and ankle surgery. No randomized controlled trials have previously compared the success rate of continuous sciatic nerve sensory blockade between ultrasound and nerve stimulation guidance. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that ultrasound-guided catheter placement improves the success rate of continuous sciatic nerve sensory blockade compared with catheter placement with nerve stimulation guidance.

Methods

After research ethics committee approval and informed consent, 100 patients scheduled for elective major foot and ankle surgery were randomly allocated to popliteal catheter placement either with ultrasound or nerve stimulation guidance. The primary outcome was the success rate of sensory block the first 48 postoperative hours. Successful sensory blockade was defined as sensory loss in both the tibial and common peroneal nerve territories at 1, 6, 24, and 48 hrs postoperatively.

Results

The ultrasound group had significantly higher success rate of sensory block compared with the nerve stimulation group (94% versus 79%, P = 0.03). Ultrasound compared with nerve stimulation guidance also entails reduced morphine consumption (median of 18 mg [range, 0–159 mg] versus 34 mg [range, 0–152 mg], respectively, P = 0.02), fewer needle passes (median of 1 [range, 1–6] versus 2 [range, 1–10], respectively, P = 0.0005), and greater patient satisfaction (median numeric rating scale 9 [range, 5–10] versus 8 [range, 3–10)] respectively, P = 0.0006) during catheter placement.

Conclusion

Ultrasound guidance used for sciatic catheter placement improves the success rate of sensory block, number of needle passes, patient satisfaction during catheter placement, and morphine consumption compared with nerve stimulation guidance.

### Femoral and sciatic nerve block with 0.25% bupivacaine for surgical management of diabetic foot syndrome: an anesthetic technique for high-risk patients with diabetic nephropathy [^5d8cb22f]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

A case series of patients with diabetic nephropathy, who underwent lower limb debridement or amputation below the knee during successful combined sciatic and femoral nerve block with bupivacaine 0.25%, is presented. Because impaired nerve conduction in diabetes mellitus results in lower local anesthetic agent requirement, a dose-sparing, minimal effective concentration for surgical anesthesia for peripheral nerve blockade may be more favorable for patients with diabetes and chronic renal disease.

### Safety and effectiveness of bilateral continuous sciatic nerve block for bilateral orthopaedic foot surgery: a cohort study [^e334292e]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Severe postoperative pain is a major problem after unilateral and bilateral foot surgery. Continuous regional anaesthesia is often used for unilateral surgery. However, for bilateral surgery, the incidence of complications of continuous bilateral compared with unilateral regional anaesthesia is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the incidence of catheter-related complications of bilateral compared with unilateral continuous regional anaesthesia.

Design

A prospective observational study.

Setting

Bellinzona Regional Hospital, a tertiary teaching hospital.

Patients

Patients (n = 130) scheduled for elective bilateral or unilateral hallux valgus repair treated with continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block using a continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.15% at 5mlh for each popliteal catheter by elastomeric pumps.

Interventions

The incidence of catheter-related complications, effectiveness, pain levels at rest and with motion, patient satisfaction for the first three postoperative days and the incidence of ambulatory visits or readmissions after discharge were measured. A follow-up for neurological or other complications related to regional anaesthesia was performed 6 to 8 weeks after surgery.

Main Outcome Measure

The incidence of catheter-related complications comparing bilateral with unilateral continuous sciatic popliteal nerve block.

Results

There were no differences in the incidence of catheter-related complications between the groups. Pain scores at rest and with motion were comparable between the groups. All patients were fit for discharge home 3 days after surgery. Patient satisfaction was similar between the groups. There were no unplanned ambulatory visits or readmissions due to complications in either group. No complications related to regional anaesthesia were reported during the follow-up.

Conclusion

The complication rate, effectiveness and patient satisfaction of bilateral continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block was comparable with unilateral continuous sciatic popliteal nerve block. The follow-up showed that bilateral continuous sciatic popliteal nerve block does not increase the complication rate. However, an outpatient-based study should confirm these data prior to introduction in the ambulatory setting.

### The feasibility and complications of the continuous popliteal nerve block: a 1001-case survey [^671fa3b5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Perineural catheters are increasingly used worldwide for the treatment of postoperative pain in orthopedics. Long-term complications associated with the placement of a perineural catheter remain largely unstudied. We investigated the efficacy and the acute and late complications associated with the continuous popliteal nerve block. One-thousand-one patients undergoing elective surgery of the ankle or foot and scheduled to have a continuous popliteal nerve block were prospectively evaluated. All patients received an initial bolus of 40 mL ropivacaine 0.5% through the catheter. A continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.3% initiated 6 h after the initial bolus was administered for the first 24 h and then decreased to ropivacaine 0.2% until the end of the study period. The success rate and acute complications were recorded. The overall success rate was 97.5%. The highest success rate was associated with foot inversion. Acute complications consisted of paresthesias during nerve localization (0.5%), pain during local anesthetic application (0.8%), and blood aspiration (0.4%). No central nervous system toxicity or cardiotoxicity occurred. Late complications were checked at 10 days and 3 mo after surgery. These included two cases of inflammation at the puncture site. No infection or neuropathy was observed. The use of continuous popliteal nerve block for ankle or foot surgery is associated with frequent success and few acute and late complications.

### Ultrasound-guided popliteal block distal to sciatic nerve bifurcation shortens onset time: a prospective randomized double-blind study [^efcc0ee1]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Popliteal sciatic nerve block (SNB) in combination with saphenous nerve block provides anesthesia and analgesia for foot and ankle surgeries. Landmark-based and image-guided techniques, to date, aim at blocking the sciatic nerve proximal to its bifurcation. Sciatic nerve block is usually associated with a long onset time (30–60 mins). We hypothesized that SNB distal to its bifurcation (blocking its 2 main branches tibial and common peroneal nerves separately) is associated with a shorter onset time than blockade proximal to its bifurcation.

Methods

Fifty patients scheduled for major elective foot or ankle surgery were randomly allocated to receive ultrasound-guided SNB 5 cm proximal to (group P) or 3 cm distal to (group D) its bifurcation in the popliteal fossa. Thirty milliliters of a standardized local anesthetic solution of equal volumes of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was used. Sensory and motor assessments were performed every 5 mins by a blinded observer until complete sensory and motor blockade developed in both tibial and common peroneal nerve territories.

Results

All patients in both groups developed a complete block. Patients in group D presented a 30% shorter onset of both sensory (21.4 [SD, 9.9] vs 31.4 [SD, 13.9] mins) (P = 0.005) and motor block (21.5 [SD, 11.3] vs 32.4 [SD, 14.9] mins) (P = 0.006) than patients in group P. Procedure time, procedure-related discomfort, and patient satisfaction were similar in both groups.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that popliteal SNB distal to the bifurcation has a shorter onset time than SNB proximal to its bifurcation, and therefore, it may be a good option when a fast onset for a surgical block is required.

### Peripheral regional anaesthesia and outcomes: a narrative review of the literature from 2013 to 2023 [^c4846e03]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Sciatic nerve block

Three RCTs (n = 210) and one non-RCT (n = 27)

We detected a decline in the number of publications related to sciatic nerve block, with only four articles published since 2013 in comparison with 27 articles published from 2003 to 2013. One possible explanation for this observation could be the increased emphasis on early postoperative mobilisation. In patients who received a sciatic nerve block for pain treatment during endovascular treatment below the knee, a complete motor block was observed in three (10%) patients.

Previously, research on sciatic nerve blocks was mainly focused on knee surgery. However, a wide range of procedures has been examined in recent years, including endovenous laser ablation, foot and ankle surgery, and traumatic lower limb amputation.

Ultrasound guidance was used in three out of four of the studies, and this was associated with good outcomes regarding perioperative effects. One study used nerve stimulation for continuous sciatic nerve block.

Lower limb amputation

In patients undergoing traumatic limb amputation, single-shot sciatic nerve block did not result in a reduction in the incidence nor the severity of chronic phantom limb pain compared with placebo.

Summary statement

In our prior review, we included 27 studies that investigated the effectiveness of a sciatic nerve block, often combined with a femoral nerve block. A noticeable trend has emerged towards motor-sparing nerve blocks for lower extremity surgery, resulting in a decrease in popularity of the traditional sciatic block. However, despite this decline in the number of studies, positive perioperative analgesic effects were reported in patients who underwent a sciatic nerve block.

Psoas compartment block

One RCT (n = 53)

The lack of interest in the psoas compartment block, also called lumbar plexus block, may be because of its relatively high risks of complications. The main complication was epidural diffusion with a varying incidence of 3–27% in a previously published meta-analysis. Although it produces good analgesic effects, the incidence of epidural spread of local anaesthetics was higher compared with other forms of regional anaesthesia.

Only one RCT has investigated the effectiveness of surgeon-performed psoas compartment block in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The authors reported lower pain scores (without clarifying the scoring method) and a longer time to first analgesia in favour of patients with the block, although no measure of dispersion of the data was reported.

Summary statement

Despite its ability to provide sufficient pain relief, the popularity of psoas compartment block is decreasing. Safer and more peripheral regional anaesthesia alternatives have emerged.

### Nerve block extends nerve function recovery in patients with diabetic foot ulcers [^98877302]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Research has revealed that patients with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy exhibit significantly elevated nerve stimulation thresholds. However, the minimum stimulation thresholds of peripheral nerves in patients with diabetic foot, along with the recovery of nerve function, remain undetermined. The aim of this study is to investigate the minimum stimulation thresholds of the femoral and sciatic nerves, as well as the duration of nerve block, in patients diagnosed with diabetic foot.

Methods

From July 2020 to March 2022, a prospective study was conducted involving patients aged 50–80 scheduled for distal lower limb surgery. The study included 83 patients with diabetic foot and 48 individuals without diabetes. Prior to surgery, an ultrasound-guided approach combined with nerve stimulation was employed to administer a popliteal sciatic nerve block (20 mL of ropivacaine 5 mg/mL) and a femoral nerve block (20 mL of ropivacaine 5 mg/mL). During the ultrasound-guided femoral and popliteal sciatic nerve blocks, the electric current required to elicit motor activity in both the femoral and popliteal sciatic nerves was assessed.

Results

The study revealed that patients with diabetic foot exhibited significantly higher stimulation thresholds for femoral and sciatic nerve blocks, as well as a substantially longer duration of femoral and sciatic sensory and motor blocks (P < 0.01). Additionally, nerve injury was observed in 4 patients (4.8%) within the diabetes mellitus (DM) group.

Conclusion

Patients with diabetic foot exhibit higher minimum stimulus thresholds for the femoral and sciatic nerves and experience delayed recovery from ropivacaine block.

### Fentanyl patches to supplement ultrasound-guided nerve blocks for improving pain control after foot and ankle surgery: a prospective study [^fe0d56ee]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The analgesic effects of preoperative ultrasound-guided nerve blocks wear off after about 12 hours, leaving some patients in substantial pain. Transdermal fentanyl concentrations peak at 12 to 24 hours after application and maintain this concentration for approximately 72 hours. We sought to determine whether combining the use of a transdermal fentanyl patch with either a sciatic or femoral-sciatic nerve block would improve pain control in patients undergoing foot and/or ankle surgery. Consecutive patients in the no-patch control group (n = 104) were enrolled from July 2011 to October 2011, and those in the treatment group (n = 232) were enrolled from November 2011 to May 2012 and received a transdermal patch (4.125 mg/7.5 cm(2) releasing 25 μg of fentanyl per hour) applied to their chest postoperatively. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the number of requests for additional postoperative pain medication. Additional postoperative analgesia was requested by 49 of the 104 control patients (47.1%) and 63 of the 232 treated patients (27.1%; p = .002). The mean pain scores were also lower in the treatment group, with a statistically significant difference (p < .05) at 12, 24, and 48 hours. Thus, patients receiving a fentanyl patch combined with an ultrasound-guided nerve block required less supplemental analgesia to maintain adequate pain control than did those receiving a nerve block alone. In conclusion, a fentanyl patch is a useful adjunct to an ultrasound-guided nerve block in foot and ankle surgery.

### Effect of peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia on the hemodynamics and prognosis of diabetic patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery [^0d1c8a8e]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

In terms of baseline data for both groups of patients. Regarding age, when comparing the GEA group (62.93 ± 11.81) and the PNB group (64.98 ± 13.10), the P-value is 0.190, suggesting no significant difference and thus indicating comparability. There were no significant differences in age, gender, type of diabetes, smoking status, BMI, and the disease history period distribution between the GEA and PNB groups, with P-values all > 0.05 (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of patients receiving PNB or GEA

Values are presented as mean ± SD or the number of patients (%)

To assess the baseline comorbidity burden of the two patient groups, we used the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), a commonly used scoring system to measure chronic disease burden in patients. It is based on a range of known diseases, assigning a certain weight to each disease to calculate the overall disease burden of the patient. These diseases include various conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, malignant tumors, and others. Each disease is assigned a specific weight, and a total score is calculated based on whether the patient has these diseases and their severity. A higher score indicates a heavier disease burden and potentially poorer prognosis. In our study, when comparing the CCI of the GEA group [2.60 (2.00, 4.97)] and the PNB group [3.00 (2.00, 5.00)], the P-value is 0.960, indicating no significant difference and thus indicating comparability.

We also compared the interval between the onset of spontaneous disease and hospital admission for the two groups. Similarly, there was no difference between the GEA group [30 (15, 64)] and the PNB group [30 (14, 62.5)].

In assessing the admission wound, we used the Wagner classification for DFUs. Similarly, there were no differences between the two groups, indicating comparability.

Finally, we compared the preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification for the two groups. The ASA classification system categorizes patients' physical conditions to assess the risk level during surgery and anesthesia, enabling physicians to develop appropriate anesthesia and surgical plans. As observed, there was no difference between the two groups, indicating comparability. In summary, there were no differences in baseline characteristics between the GEA group and the ultrasound-guided PNB group, indicating comparability.

### Nerve block extends nerve function recovery in patients with diabetic foot ulcers [^f3608459]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A significant prolongation of postoperative sensory block in both groups, with 4 cases in the diabetic group and 2 cases in the non-diabetic group, reporting symptoms such as numbness and decreased muscle strength were identified in the study. In the diabetic foot group, all patients with suspected nerve injury returned to their preoperative state 72 hours post-surgery. In the non-diabetic group, one patient achieved complete sensory and motor recovery 36 hours after surgery, while the other experienced neurosensory numbness that persisted for a week. Nerve injuries resulting from nerve blocks can generally be classified into three types: mechanical damage and injection injury (traumatic), vascular injury (ischemic), and chemical injury (neurotoxicity). If a local anesthetic is injected into the nerve bundle or the puncture needle damages the nerve during the procedure, it can lead to nerve rupture, disrupting the neuroprotective environment of the bundle and causing myelin sheath and axonal degeneration. Additionally, some studies suggest that the neurotoxic effects of local anesthetics can cause damage, particularly in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, patients with peripheral nerves in prolonged ischemia are more prone to nerve damage and exhibit increased sensitivity to local anesthetics. Animal studies have also shown that rats with diabetes receiving regional anesthetic nerve blocks exhibit nerve damage, including nerve edema and abnormal myelinated axons.

In our study, nerve injury was observed in both patient groups; however, the use of a nerve stimulator and ultrasound visualization during the nerve block procedure minimized the risk of intraneural injection-induced nerve ischemia and vascular injury. Several mechanisms may account for the prolonged postoperative sensory blocks observed in these patients. It is hypothesized that the administration of higher concentrations of local anesthetics is a primary factor contributing to the extended duration of nerve blocks in susceptible patients. Studies have shown that patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) exhibit significantly reduced vibration perception threshold (VPT), cold perception threshold (CPT), and warm perception threshold (WPT) under various current stimuli. This reduction explains why the minimum stimulation threshold in diabetic patients is significantly higher than in patients without diabetes. The proposed mechanism for prolonged nerve blockade time in diabetic patients suggests that the pathological and physiological changes associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy may affect the pharmacokinetics of local anesthetics. These changes result in reduced nerve blood flow and prolonged retention time of the local anesthetic, ultimately leading to an increased nerve blockade duration.

### Combined dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine as adjuncts to popliteal and saphenous nerve blocks in patients undergoing surgery of the foot or ankle: a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^2673d42e]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Both dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine increase the duration of analgesia of peripheral nerve blocks. The authors hypothesized that combined intravenous dexamethasone and intravenous dexmedetomidine would result in a greater duration of analgesia when compared with intravenous dexamethasone alone and placebo.

Methods

The authors randomly allocated participants undergoing surgery of the foot or ankle under general anesthesia and with a combined popliteal (sciatic) and saphenous nerve block to a combination of 12mg dexamethasone and 1 µg/kg dexmedetomidine, 12mg dexamethasone, or placebo (saline). The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia measured as the time from block performance until the first sensation of pain in the surgical area as reported by the participant. The authors predefined a 33% difference in the duration of analgesia as clinically relevant.

Results

A total of 120 participants from two centers were randomized and 119 analyzed for the primary outcome. The median [interquartile range] duration of analgesia was 1,572min [1,259 to 1,715] with combined dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine, 1,400min [1,133 to 1,750] with dexamethasone alone, and 870min [748 to 1,138] with placebo. Compared with placebo, the duration was greater with combined dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine (difference, 564min; 98.33% CI, 301 to 794; P < 0.001) and with dexamethasone (difference, 489min; 98.33% CI, 265 to 706; P < 0.001). The prolongations exceeded the authors' predefined clinically relevant difference. The duration was similar when combined dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine was compared with dexamethasone alone (difference, 61min; 98.33% CI, -222 to 331; P = 0.614).

Conclusions

Dexamethasone with or without dexmedetomidine increased the duration of analgesia in patients undergoing surgery of the foot or ankle with a popliteal (sciatic) and saphenous nerve block. Combined dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine did not increase the duration of analgesia when compared with dexamethasone.

### Postoperative analgesia with continuous sciatic nerve block after foot surgery: a prospective, randomized comparison between the popliteal and subgluteal approaches [^ccbda6c7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

To compare the posterior popliteal and subgluteal continuous sciatic nerve block for anesthesia and acute postoperative pain management after foot surgery, 60 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing elective orthopedic foot surgery were randomly assigned to either a Subgluteal group (n = 30) or Popliteal group (n = 30). Before surgery and after performing a femoral nerve block with 15 mL of 2% mepivacaine, we performed the sciatic nerve block with 20 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine using either a subgluteal or posterior popliteal approach, and the placement of a catheter came afterward. In the recovery room, the catheter was connected to a patient-controlled analgesia pump to infuse 0.2% ropivacaine (basal infusion rate of 5 mL/h, incremental bolus of 10 mL, and a lockout time of 60 min). There were no technical problems in catheter placement. Intraoperative efficacy of nerve block was similar in the two groups. Postoperative catheter displacement and occlusion were recorded in four patients in the Popliteal group and two patients in the Subgluteal group (P = 0.67). Both approaches provided similar postoperative analgesia. We conclude that the subgluteal approach is as effective and safe as the previously described posterior popliteal approach for continuous sciatic block and can be considered a useful alternative to anesthesia and acute postoperative analgesia after foot procedures.

Implications

Comparing two different approaches for continuous sciatic nerve block after orthopedic foot surgery, this prospective, randomized study demonstrated that the subgluteal approach is as effective and safe as the previously described posterior popliteal approach, and can be considered a useful alternative to anesthesia and acute postoperative analgesia after foot procedures.

### Low-volume ultrasound-guided nerve block provides inferior postoperative analgesia compared to a higher-volume landmark technique [^f9b70dfa]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Ultrasound guidance reduces the required local anesthetic volume for successful peripheral nerve blockade, but it is unclear whether this impacts postoperative analgesia. This prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study tested the hypothesis that a low-volume ultrasound-guided ankle block would provide similar analgesia after foot surgery compared with a conventional-volume surface landmark technique.

Methods

A total of 72 patients presenting for elective foot surgery under general anesthesia were randomized to receive a low-volume ultrasound-guided ankle block (n = 37; ropivacaine 0.5% adjacent the anterior/posterior tibial arteries and short saphenous vein; subcutaneous infiltration around the saphenous and superficial peroneal nerves) or conventional-volume surface landmark guided technique (n = 35; 30 mL of ropivacaine 0.5%). Patients received regular postoperative acetaminophen, diclofenac, and rescue tramadol. Assessment was in the recovery room and at 24 hours for pain and tramadol consumption.

Results

Mean (SD) total local anesthetic volume for the low-volume ultrasound group was 16 (2.1) mL. Block success in the recovery room was similar between groups (low-volume ultrasound 89% versus conventional-volume landmark 80%, P = 0.34; however, during the first 24 hours, numerically rated (0–10) "average pain" (median [10-90th percentiles] = 1 [0–4] versus 0 [0–2], P = 0.01), worst pain at rest (1 [0–6] versus 0 [0–2], P = 0.03), and the proportion of patients requiring rescue tramadol (% [95% confidence interval]: 50 [34–46] versus 20 [10–36], P = 0.01) were higher in the low-volume ultrasound group. Numerically rated numbness, weakness, satisfaction, and procedural time were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Low-volume ultrasound-guided ankle block is associated with a high block success rate after foot surgery; however, compared with a conventional volume (surface landmark) technique, the reduced local anesthetic volume marginally compromises postoperative analgesia during the first 24 hours.

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^30020d25]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 1 — clinical questions guiding evidence review for local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery structures the scope across topical anesthesia, local infiltration anesthesia, nerve block/regional anesthesia, and tumescent anesthesia, asking whether topical anesthesia is safer/more effective than other types to reduce pain and whether adult topical agents are recommended/safe in pregnancy, lactation, and children; for infiltrative anesthesia, it queries dose calculations over extended versus short periods, serum level changes by delivery method, measures to decrease symptoms of systemic toxicity, the safety of adding epinephrine in cardiac and pregnant patients and for use in the digits, nose, and penis, the effectiveness of lower versus higher epinephrine concentrations and whether recommended doses/delivery methods differ with epinephrine, effects of hyaluronidase on diffusion and effectiveness/safety, any benefit of mixing multiple anesthetics versus single agents, whether adding sodium bicarbonate decreases pain with subcutaneous infiltration, and whether particular injection techniques or other commonly used techniques minimize pain; for regional anesthesia, it compares clinical benefit over local infiltrative anesthesia for the head and neck, hands, feet, and genitals and assesses whether injections at optimal entry points increase risks of nerve damage from needle trauma and toxicity; and for tumescent anesthesia, it examines whether lidocaine is safer than other anesthetics for the same procedure, whether volume and dose of lidocaine and epinephrine correlate with patient safety, whether slow infusion rates have less pain or better anesthetic effect than fast rates, and whether measures of care can decrease symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity with the tumescent technique.

### Cost-effectiveness of ultrasound vs nerve stimulation guidance for continuous sciatic nerve block [^1278b215]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound (US) vs nerve stimulation (NS) guidance for continuous sciatic nerve block in Danish elective patients undergoing major foot and ankle surgery.

Methods

> A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial. A total of 100 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to either traditional electrical NS or US technique for catheter insertion guidance. Information on effects and costs were collected prospectively. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the extra cost per extra successful nerve block. The robustness of the ICER was investigated using 4000 non-parametric bias-corrected bootstrap replicates to calculate the likelihood that US leads to better effect and lower costs compared with NS guidance.

Results

The mean ICER was negative, indicating that US was a dominating technology providing both higher quality and lower costs. The likelihood of US being more effective and cheaper than NS was estimated to 84.7%.

Conclusions

In this trial, US was cost-effective. Assuming that the results are fairly generalizable, US should be the preferred catheter insertion technique in larger anaesthesia departments.

### Nerve block extends nerve function recovery in patients with diabetic foot ulcers [^3c44d7f3]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This prospective cohort study evaluated the minimum stimulation intensity and the sensory and motor nerve block duration in patients who received popliteal sciatic and femoral nerve blocks. The findings indicated that the diabetic group required higher stimulation currents, and the duration of both sensory and motor blocks for the sciatic and femoral nerves was significantly prolonged. Keyl conducted a similar prospective parallel cohort study comparing the electrical sciatic nerve stimulation threshold between patients with diabetic foot gangrene and patients without diabetes, revealing that the minimal sciatic nerve stimulation threshold in patients with diabetic foot gangrene was 7.2 times higher than in patients without diabetes. Other studies have also shown a significantly higher minimum current stimulation threshold for the sciatic nerve in patients with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy compared to patients without diabetes.

Patients with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy typically exhibit an increased minimum stimulation threshold of peripheral nerves and an extended duration of nerve blocks when receiving anesthesia. Tang et al compared patients with and without diabetes undergoing lower limb surgery with sciatic nerve blocks guided by ultrasound and neurostimulation, finding that patients with diabetes had a longer duration of sensory nerve block. Additionally, Salviz et al identified a correlation between diabetes and an extended duration of sensory block after axillary brachial plexus block. The results of this study are consistent with the findings of most previous studies, indicating that local anesthetics have a prolonged effect on patients with diabetic foot compared to patients without diabetes.

The underlying mechanism contributing to the prolonged duration of nerve blocks in diabetic patients remains uncertain. Nonetheless, animal models of diabetic neuropathy have demonstrated heightened sensitivity of peripheral nerves to local anesthetics, slower pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, and extended perineural retention, all of which can contribute to longer block durations. Several studies suggest that diabetes-induced microvascular dysfunction, such as endothelial alterations, impacts the absorption and metabolism of local anesthetics, which is a primary factor behind the extended block duration. Elevated HbA1c levels, indicative of chronic poor glycemic control, have also been identified as an independent risk factor for prolonged nerve block duration. Conversely, Emanuel et al proposed that the prolonged nerve block duration in patients with diabetes is primarily due to the neuropathy associated with diabetes. Further research involving larger diabetic populations is required to definitively address this question.

### Levobupivacaine 0.5% provides longer analgesia after sciatic nerve block using the labat approach than the same dose of ropivacaine in foot and ankle surgery [^22bff5fb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Levobupivacaine and ropivacaine are 2 left enantiomeric molecules frequently used for peripheral nerve blocks because of their safe clinical profile. Levobupivacaine is more lipophilic and theoretically more potent than ropivacaine, but clinical studies show conflicting results in terms of anesthetic and analgesic characteristics. We hypothesized that the pure S-enantiomer of bupivacaine provides longer-lasting analgesia than ropivacaine.

Methods

We compared the analgesic characteristics of 20 mL levobupivacaine versus 20 mL ropivacaine 0.5% in a posterior sciatic nerve block (Labat approach) for foot and ankle surgery. In a double-blind, randomized, prospective design, 80 patients received either substance. We assessed the onset, duration, and success of the block, and the need for rescue analgesia and technical or neurologic complications over 24 hours.

Results

The onset of sensory block (minutes) and the success rate were similar in levobupivacaine and ropivacaine groups (onset, 15 minutes [5–40 minutes] vs 15 minutes [5–60 minutes], respectively; success rate, 90% vs 92.5%). The average time for the first request of pain medication provided by 20 mL levobupivacaine 0.5% was significantly longer than with ropivacaine (1605 minutes [575–2400 minutes] vs 1035 minutes [590–1500 minutes], P < 0.001). The need for postoperative rescue analgesia was higher in the ropivacaine group (37 of 40 [92.5%] vs 30 of 40 [75%], P < 0.034). No complications were noted in either group at 24 hours.

Conclusion

Twenty milliliters levobupivacaine 0.5% in posterior gluteal (Labat) sciatic nerve block provided longer-lasting analgesia after foot and ankle surgery compared with the same dose of ropivacaine.

### Ultrasound-guided ankle block for forefoot surgery: the contribution of the saphenous nerve [^7723d13c]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ankle blocks typically include the block of 5 nerves, the 4 branches that trace their origin back to the sciatic nerve plus the saphenous nerve (SaN). The sensory area of the SaN in the foot is variable. Based on our clinical experience, we decided to study the sensory distribution of the SaN in the foot and determine whether the block of this nerve is necessary as a component of an ultrasound-guided ankle block for bunion surgery.

Methods

One hundred patients scheduled for bunion surgery under ankle block were prospectively studied. We performed ultrasound-guided individual blocks of the tibial, deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, and sural nerves. After obtaining complete sensory block of these nerves, we mapped the SaN sensory territory as such area without anesthesia on the medial side of the foot.

Results

Every nerve block was successful within 10 minutes of injection. The saphenous territory extended into the foot to 57 ± 13 mm distal to the medial malleolus. This distal margin was 22 ± 11 mm proximal to the first tarsometatarsal joint. The proximal end of the surgical incision was located 1 cm distal to the first tarsometatarsal joint. In only 3 patients (3%), the area of SaN innervation reached the proximal end of the planned incision.

Conclusions

Ultrasound-guided ankle block is a highly effective technique for bunion surgery. The sensory territory of the SaN in the foot seems to extend only to the midfoot. According to our sample, 97% of the patients undergoing bunion surgery under an ankle block would not benefit from having a SaN block.

### Nerve block research in diabetic foot ulcers: concerns and suggestions [response to letter] [^ebaa4668]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In the patient follow-up, we observed that probable nerve injury was present in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups. In the diabetic foot cohort, all patients with suspected nerve damage reverted to their prior condition 72 hours following surgery. All patients were constantly monitored and recorded. In the non-diabetic group, one patient had complete sensory and motor recovery 36 hours after surgery, whereas the other had neurosensory numbness that lasted a week. All six patients with suspected nerve injury displayed numbness in the limbs after getting nerve block, and lower limb muscle strength of grade 2–3. Fortunately, all of the patients gradually returned to their pre-operation states. According to Hebl et al's retrospective study, patients with peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy or diabetic polyneuropathy prior to surgery had a 0.4% probability of having significant neurological impairment after getting nerve block anesthesia or analgesia. In addition to the patient's clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of nerve injury can also be assessed by the following methods: Electrophysiological assessment of the nerve, nerve conduction studies, magnetic resonance neuroimaging (MRN), neuro ultrasoundand nerve biopsy. Electrophysiological examinations (EDX), including Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction examinations (NCS), are regarded as the gold standard for assessing nerve damage. Electromyography (EMG) catches alterations in nerve resting and active potentials by inserting fine electrode needles into muscles, enabling the differentiation of lesions in nerves or muscles and the categorization of diseases into acute and chronic based on electrical data. TEDX offers valuable insights into neuroanatomical localization, nerve injury severity, and neurophysiology, as the amplitude of NCS is indicative of axon integrity. When the lesion affects nerve axons, the amplitude of the nerve response to electrical stimulation decreases or vanishes. However, nerve electrophysiological testing and nerve biopsy are invasive procedures that may induce distress in patients, as well as a sensation of pain that may result in intolerance in certain patients. We were unable to determine the type and extent of nerve damage since the patient declined to have a neurological function test conducted throughout the follow-up. The exact characteristics of the nerve injury's nature and severity were not elaborated upon; however, the recommendations are really helpful, and we will remain attentive to them in future studies. The potential of neurotoxicity is a major concern for us while executing nerve blocks, especially in diabetic patients. Diabetic patients who have neuropathy may have a lower nerve tolerance to local anesthetics and are more vulnerable to nerve injury. Our study showed that, while there were fewer occurrences of nerve damage, it also reminded us to be more cautious in clinical practice. We will enhance nerve damage monitoring and assessment, record the types, degree, and clinical signs of injury (eg, paresthesia, motor dysfunction), and explore its potential causes and mechanisms. The discussion portion of this article addressed the potential neurotoxicity of local anesthetics in diabetes patients. The mechanism behind the extended length of nerve block and the heightened risk of neurotoxicity in diabetes patients remains ambiguous, and we anticipate future high-quality animal and clinical investigations to clarify this mechanism.

### Ultrasound-guided sural nerve and tibial nerve block provides comparable analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve block following calcaneal surgery: a single center randomized controlled double-blind study [^dbf08fba]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, ultrasound-guided sural nerve and posterior tibial nerve blocks above the ankle provide satisfactory results for operative and postoperative analgesia in calcaneal surgery. The approach is as effective as the classic popliteal sciatic nerve block. It offers immediate postoperative limb mobility, and the potential for early postoperative mobilization. This approach is worthy of study and promotion by clinical practitioners.

### Influence of virtual reality with or without hypnosis on patient-related experience and functional recovery in outpatient foot surgery with regional anesthesia: a randomized controlled trial [^a1c45cc6]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Perioperative psychological stress significantly influences recovery after surgery. Sciatic nerve and ankle blocks are commonly used techniques for achieving postoperative analgesia in outpatient foot surgery. However, these procedures can cause discomfort for patients, potentially affecting their postoperative functional recovery. This study aims to assess the impact of virtual reality with or without hypnosis on patient satisfaction and postoperative functional recovery in patients undergoing peripheral nerve blocks for outpatient foot surgery.

Methods

A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 57 patients scheduled for outpatient foot surgery with combined sciatic popliteal and ankle nerve blocks. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: group C (usual care with intravenous midazolam), group VR (virtual reality immersion through glasses and headsets), or group VRH (virtual reality immersion with prerecorded hypnosis-sedation session). Patient satisfaction with the regional anesthesia experience (evaluated using the EVAN-LR score, Evaluation du Vécu de l'Anesthésie LocoRégionale Score) was assessed 4hours after surgery. The quality of recovery 15-item and perioperative anxiety (Numeric Rate Scale (NRS) and six-item Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6)) were evaluated at fixed time points: 1hour before and after surgery for NRS-anxiety and STAI-6 and 1day before surgery, and at day 1 and day 3 postoperatively for Quality-of-Recovery-15 items.

Results

Postoperative EVAN-LR scores were similar across groups (group C: 91 (86.5, 93.5) vs group VR: 90 (87.5, 93.5) vs group VRH: 91 (89, 93); p = 0.64). There were no significant differences in the evolution of quality of recovery 15-item (p = 0.25) nor perioperative anxiety (NRS and STAI-6: p = 0.18and p = 0.14, respectively) among the groups.

Discussion

Virtual reality with or without hypnosis did not significantly impact satisfaction with regional anesthesia techniques in outpatient foot surgery. Additionally, there were no differences observed among the groups in terms of functional recovery during the first three postoperative days.

### Sciatic lateral popliteal block with clonidine alone or clonidine plus 0.2% ropivacaine: effect on the intra-and postoperative analgesia for lower extremity surgery in children: a randomized prospective controlled study [^f2ae5ea4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical importance of clonidine in peripheral blocks of children and adults for effective intra - and postoperative analgesia is controversial and subjected to an ongoing debate.

In adults, the majority of the studies (reviews and meta-analyses randomized trials) have demonstrated the positive effects of clonidine on intra - and postoperative pain relief, when used as an adjunctive agent to peripheral nerve blocks.

Moreover, clonidine alone may have a potential role to produce analgesia when used for regional techniques in adults.

In the pediatric population, there are only few trials involving clonidine as an adjunct to peripheral blocks, and the analgesic benefits are not definite in this group of patients. The clinical benefits of clonidine in moderate and severe painful surgeries remain questionable or potentially with limited analgesia. However, in a pediatric pilot study, a trend has been demonstrated for better postoperative analgesia following peripheral administration of clonidine compared with central use. Moreover, there are controversies if caudal or systemic administration of clonidine can also enhance regional block in children.

Our hypothesis was that clonidine alone or combined with 0.2% ropivacaine could produce a long lasting block after foot and ankle surgery, adequate for the first postoperative day.

The aim of the present randomized, prospective, controlled study was to determine whether the use of clonidine alone or combined with 0.2% ropivacaine, as single shot, in the sciatic lateral popliteal block (SLPB) plus femoral block, could provide adequate intra-and postoperative analgesia in children undergoing mild to moderate painful foot and ankle surgery.

### Regional anesthesia for office procedures: part II. extremity and inguinal area surgeries [^f01b4894]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The hand can be anesthetized effectively with blocks of the median, ulnar, or radial nerve. Each digit is supplied by four digital nerves, which can be blocked with injections on each side of the digit. Anterior or posterior ankle blocks can be used for regional anesthesia for the foot. The anterior ankle block, which is used for procedures on the dorsum of the foot, involves blocking the saphenous nerve, and superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The posterior ankle block, which is used to anesthetize the sole of the foot, involves blocking the sural and posterior tibial nerves. Paracervical block is used for procedures on the cervix, such as loop electrocauterization or conization. Dorsal penile block has been the most commonly recommended anesthetic technique for neonatal circumcision. A safe and effective alternative is the application of anesthetic cream over the skin to be circumcised.

### Nerve block extends nerve function recovery in patients with diabetic foot ulcers [^81a0db77]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficiency Measurements and Variables

An anesthesiologist assessed the sensory and motor block every minute for a duration of 50 minutes. Following the method prescribed by Baeriswyl et al, the sensory block of the sciatic and femoral nerves was evaluated using the pinprick test. The scoring was based on the patient's response: 1 = normal sensation (no block), 2 = delayed sensation (analgesia), and 3 = no sensation (anesthesia). The patient was asked to perform plantarflexion or dorsiflexion of the foot, as well as hip flexion and knee extension movements to evaluate the motor block of the sciatic and femoral nerves. The results were graded as follows: 1 = normal movement (no blockage); 2 = reduced movement (partial blockage); 3 = no movement (complete blockage). Neurological recovery was defined as the return of sensory and motor function to the preoperative baseline. The resident in charge of the patient conducted hourly tests to monitor the resolution of sensory (using a pinprick test) and motor (using movements) blocks after surgery until complete regression. If sensory or motor blockade persisted beyond 48 hours after local anesthetic injection, acute nerve injury was assessed.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables that approximately follow a normal distribution such as age and nerve block duration were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Group comparisons for these continuous variables were made using an independent sample t -test. Categorical variables, including sex and ASA status, were presented as frequencies and percentages. Group comparisons for categorical variables were conducted using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Potential confounders and effect modifiers were assessed through interaction testing before regression analysis. We used a general linear regression model to compare the minimum nerve stimulation threshold and block duration differences between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. Data analysis was conducted using R version 4.1.2 software.

### Digital nerve blocks: a comprehensive review of techniques [^fb81c4e2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Finger and toe injuries are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department. In order to properly care for these injuries, it is valuable for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the different approaches to anesthetize the digit.

Methods

We searched the literature using PubMed to determine the different techniques and supporting data for digital nerve blockades.

Discussion

The primary digital nerve block techniques include the dorsal web space block, transthecal block, volar subcutaneous block, and the circumferential (three-sided and four-sided) ring block. Success rates range from 60% to 100%. There are unique advantages and limitations of each block that are important to consider.

Conclusions

There are a number of options at the disposal of the emergency medicine clinician for anesthesia of the finger and toe. This article summarizes the key techniques, variations on these techniques, advantages, and disadvantages for each approach.

### Development and internal validation of a multivariable risk prediction model for severe rebound pain after foot and ankle surgery involving single-shot popliteal sciatic nerve block [^f63845be]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Rebound pain occurs after up to 50% of ambulatory surgeries involving regional anaesthesia. To assist with risk stratification, we developed a model to predict severe rebound pain after foot and ankle surgery involving single-shot popliteal sciatic nerve block.

Methods

After ethics approval, we performed a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Patients undergoing lower limb surgery with popliteal sciatic nerve block from January 2016 to November 2019 were included. Exclusion criteria were uncontrolled pain in the PACU, use of a perineural catheter, or loss to follow-up. We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model for severe rebound pain, defined as transition from well-controlled pain in the PACU (numerical rating scale [NRS] 3 or less) to severe pain (NRS ≥ 7) within 48 h. A priori predictors were age, sex, surgery type, planned admission, local anaesthetic type, dexamethasone use, and intraoperative anaesthesia type. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Nagelkerke's R 2, scaled Brier score, and calibration slope.

Results

The cohort included 1365 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 50 [16] yr). The primary outcome was abstracted in 1311 (96%) patients, with severe rebound pain in 652 (50%). Internal validation revealed poor model performance, with AUROC 0.632 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.602–0.661; bootstrap optimisation 0.021), Nagelkerke's R 2 0.063, and scaled Brier score 0.047. Calibration slope was 0.832 (95% CI: 0.623–1.041).

Conclusions

We show that a multivariable risk prediction model developed using routinely collected clinical data had poor predictive performance for severe rebound pain after foot and ankle surgery. Prospective studies involving other patient-related predictors are needed.

### Nerve block research in diabetic foot ulcers: concerns and suggestions [response to letter] [^b2b8c214]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear editor

We would like to thank Yaping Zhu and Weiling Song for their interest in our research and their valuable comments.

As an anesthesiologist, I possess a profound comprehension of the significance and intricacy of nerve block anesthesia in the surgical treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Factors like blood glucose regulation, the progression of diabetes, and the degree of neuropathy, as noted by Doctor Weiling Song, are critical for the efficacy of nerve block procedures. We have conducted a comparison and statistical analysis of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus patients, specifically examining the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, as presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Patient Demographics and Baseline Variables, Data are Mean (SD), Median (25th–75th), or Number (%).*P,0.05 Vs the N-DM Group

Furthermore, in the discussion part, we analyzed the possibility of processes influencing the elongation of nerve blocks in diabetes patients. Research has revealed that the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in diabetic foot patients was as high as 91.3%. The majority of patients were also diagnosed with poor blood glucose control (82.7%), anemia (86.7%), leukocytosis (84.6%), and malnutrition, which was defined by low fat (90.8%), and hypoalbuminemia (83.7%). Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the predominant and devastating consequence of diabetes, significantly contributing to the formation of diabetic foot. Long-term exposure to hyperglycemia can impact the microvascular system, ultimately resulting in various microvascular disorders, including diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and peripheral microvascular sclerosis or occlusion, Furthermore, research has found that higher HbA1c levels resulting from chronic inadequate glycemic control can act as an independent risk factor for extended nerve block duration.

### Nerve blocks for post-surgical pain management: a narrative review of current research [^839e05e9]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Saphenous Nerve Block (SNB)

Utilizing SNB as a supplementary analgesic approach holds promise for effectively managing postoperative pain in patients undergoing knee surgery, particularly those undergoing TKA, with the aid of a continuous nerve catheter. The saphenous nerve is responsible for intense and rapid pain, and blocking this nerve improves the pain relief. These findings indicate that it may be beneficial to routinely include a saphenous nerve block in major ankle surgeries. Researchers suggest utilizing a combination of popliteal and SNB for knee surgeries, especially for high-risk patients with other medical conditions who are unsuitable for general or spinal anesthesia. This minimally invasive method provides effective pain control after surgery and presents a beneficial option for general anesthesia for procedures below the knee. The block can be performed with or without a nerve stimulator, and experience with 60 cases using this technique has demonstrated few adverse effects and positive outcomes. The study found that adding dexamethasone to a single-injection SNB prolonged pain relief in the ankle region and reduced opioid use on the first postoperative day. It suggests that this approach can improve pain management after major ankle surgery. However, Understanding the anatomy can be beneficial in identifying a protected area to avoid motor block during saphenous nerve block procedures. The combination of a Crosswise Approach to Popliteal Sciatic block (CAPSB) with saphenous nerve block may offer comprehensive pain relief for surgeries below the knee. Administering continuous popliteal and SNB in the adductor canal demonstrated decreased opioid requirements and lower pain levels, resulting in increased patient satisfaction upon discharge from the surgery center compared to employing only a continuous popliteal block alongside a single-injection SNB. Considering both popliteal and Saphenous nerve catheters together are crucial for enhancing postoperative pain management and streamlining outpatient procedures.

Sciatic Nerve Block and Popliteal Nerve Block (PSNB)

Ultrasound-guided PSNB is a reliable and efficient technique for managing resting pain and enhancing patient comfort and adherence during endovascular procedures for chronic limb-threatening ischemia. This method is especially beneficial for frail patients with numerous comorbidities who are not suitable candidates for deep sedation or general anesthesia. Research has demonstrated that the addition of an SNB to a sciatic nerve block provides adequate comfort following extensive ankle surgery. Regional anesthesia proved to be a secure and dependable addition to managing perioperative pain, showing great effectiveness in patients undergoing elective orthopedic forefoot procedures (Tables 5). Nonetheless, those who underwent PFB experienced notably improved pain control and reduced need for opioids in the early perioperative period compared with those who were treated with an ankle block.

Techniques Used in Various Surgeries

### Ultrasound-guided sural nerve and tibial nerve block provides comparable analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve block following calcaneal surgery: a single center randomized controlled double-blind study [^6ac47b0f]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared to the popliteal approach for sciatic nerve blockade, selective blockade of the sural and tibial nerves provides comparable analgesia for calcaneal fracture repair while preserving ambulatory capability by sparing the common peroneal nerve. This allows patients to voluntarily mobilize and ambulate postoperatively, potentially mitigating risks of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis formation and subsequent pulmonary thromboembolism. Intact sensation also enables detection of impending compartment syndrome of the leg through pain and pressure, allowing timely medical intervention. Moreover, selective blockade greatly reduces the impact of nerve injury. Should minor nerve trauma occur, sensorimotor deficits would be confined to the corresponding distributions. Ultimately, selective blockade minimizes the extent of anesthesia to the surgical site, retaining autonomous mobility of the operative limb, averting restrictions from extensive blockade, and minimizing patient discomfort. In summary, compared to extensive sciatic nerve block, selective blockade of the sural and tibial nerves adequately fulfills the perioperative analgesic requirements for calcaneal fracture surgery while localizing the blockade, sparing uninvolved areas, preserving voluntary motor function, and reducing patient inconvenience.

This study has three primary limitations. First, there was no long-term postoperative assessment, as the evaluation period only extended to one week postoperatively, lacking an assessment of chronic complications. Second, the sample size in this study was quite small, so the results may require further validation through larger sample sizes. Third, only routine monitoring was applied, and bispectrality index (BIS) monitoring for anesthesia depth was not utilized. Future studies should consider longer-term follow-up to evaluate potential complications such as chronic pain or nerve injury. Additionally, larger multi-center trials are warranted to confirm the safety and long-term benefits of selective nerve blocks in diverse patient populations.

### Continuous sciatic block for leg and foot surgery in 160 children [^a310e6fb]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of continuous sciatic block for lower limb surgery in children.

Methods

A total of 160 pediatric patients aged 4 months to 12 years weighing 3.5–50 kg, were given continuous sciatic block plus single shot 3-in-1 block for leg and foot surgery. After general anesthesia, the sciatic nerve was located by using loss of resistance to saline by the mid-thigh approach. An 18 gauge epidural needle was introduced at the junction of the proximal two-third with the distal one-third of a line extending from the apex of popliteal triangle to the midpoint of the line joining the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity. A 20 g catheter was threaded through the needle for 5–10 cm and 0.25% bupivacaine 0.75 ml.kg(-1) was injected. A single shot 3-in-1 block was also given to facilitate the use of a tourniquet with 0.25% bupivacaine 0.25 ml. In 20 patients a nerve stimulator was used in addition to loss of resistance. The intraoperative sedation comprised propofol and ketamine infusions and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen by LMA.

Results

Eight-two percent of patients showed no response to surgery; 14% patients showed some response to the medial incision over the ankle and needed additional bolus doses of ketamine and propofol. Block was considered to have failed in 4% who required an increase in propofol and ketamine infusions. A total of 154 patients had good postoperative pain relief for 72 h with continuous infusion of 0.05% bupivacaine. The other six were given oral codeine and diclofenac. There were no complications attributable to sciatic block in any patient.

Conclusions

Sciatic block with a single shot 3-in-1 block for tourniquet pain and light general anesthesia provides good intraoperative conditions for leg and foot surgery and adequate postoperative pain relief. Additional sedation to minimize the discomfort of a cast may be a consideration in the first 24 h.

### Lateral approach to the sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa: correlation between evoked motor response and sensory block [^9f36bb52]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to identify which of two motor responses of the foot (plantar flexion versus dorsiflexion) best predicts complete sensory blockade of the sciatic nerve when is used for lateral popliteal sciatic nerve block.

Methods

Thirty American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I or II patients scheduled for foot and ankle surgery under lateral popliteal sciatic nerve block were enrolled in the study. During each block, the needle was placed to evoke one of the following motor responses of the foot: plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Thirty milliliters of 0.75% ropivacaine was injected after the motor response was elicited at < 0.5 mA. The sequence of elicited motor response was randomized. Sensory blockade of the areas of the foot innervated by the deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, posterior tibial, and sural nerves was checked in a blinded manner. Time required for onset of sensory and motor block of the foot was recorded.

Results

The 2 groups were similar with regard to demographic variables and type of surgery. The total of nerves blocked (deep and superficial peroneal, posterior tibial, and sural nerves) after elicited plantar flexion was greater (complete sensory block in 58 of 60 nerve distributions) than after elicited dorsiflexion (34 of 60 nerve distributions) (P < .05). Onset of complete sensory and motor blockade of the foot was faster after elicited plantar flexion (16.6 ± 5.1 minutes, 20.1 ± 5.1 minutes, respectively) than after elicited dorsiflexion (24.3 ± 5.1 minutes, 28.1 ± 5.0 min, P < .05).

Conclusions

After stimulation of the sciatic nerve, plantar flexion better predicts complete sensory blockade of the foot than dorsiflexion when using the lateral approach to the popliteal fossa. The findings of the present study apply to a single injection of 30 mL of ropivacaine 0.75%.

### Ultrasound guidance for lateral midfemoral sciatic nerve block: a prospective, comparative, randomized study [^865c7920]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Block of the sciatic nerve at the midfemoral level is usually performed using nerve stimulation techniques. We investigated the efficacy of ultrasound, combined with nerve stimulation, to locate and block the sciatic nerve at the lateral midfemoral level compared to nerve stimulation alone. Sixty-one patients scheduled for foot and ankle surgery were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Thirty patients underwent a lateral block of the sciatic nerve at the midfemoral level guided by ultrasound (group US) and 31 patients received the block without ultrasound (group ES). Once an adequate motor response was obtained using nerve stimulation, 35 mL of ropivacaine 0.5% was administered. The main end-points of the study were: number of attempts to obtain an adequate motor response, success rate of nerve location at the first attempt, quality and duration of both sensory and motor blocks, and anesthetic distribution. The success of sciatic nerve location at the first attempt was significantly more frequent in the US group than in the ES group (76.6% versus 41.9%; P < 0.001). The quality of the sensory block and the tolerance to the pneumatic tourniquet were also significantly better in the US group (P < 0.01). We conclude that ultrasound combined with nerve stimulation improved the quality of the sensory block and the tolerance to the pneumatic tourniquet, reducing the number of attempts to perform sciatic nerve block at the midfemoral level.

### Catheter-based distal sciatic nerve block in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^37918f87]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

In our hospital all patients scheduled for foot surgery are offered sciatic nerve block for acute postoperative pain control. Patients with CMT are not excluded in principle from this procedure. Between January 2003 and November 2010, 27 consecutive patients, diagnosed with CMT and scheduled to receive anesthesia for elective foot surgery were considered eligible for sciatic nerve block for postoperative analgesia. The catheter-based nerve block was offered to all 27 patients followed by detailed discussion regarding procedure, potential benefits and possible risks. 18 of the 27 CMT patients consented to the offered sciatic nerve block. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. For ethical reasons randomization of the participants was not possible.

### Complications associated with peripheral nerve blocks [^592ba80d]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Outpatient orthopedic surgery is gradually becoming the standard across the country, as it has been found to significantly lower costs without compromising patient care. Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) are largely what have made this transition possible by providing patients excellent pain control in the immediate postoperative period. However, with the increasing use of PNBs, it is important to recognize that they are not without complications. Although rare, these complications can cause patients a significant amount of morbidity. It is important for surgeons to know the risks of peripheral nerve blocks and to inform their patients.

### Starting with ultrasonography decreases popliteal block performance time in inexperienced hands: a prospective randomized study [^9aff36f9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The widespread of hallux valgus surgery in a day care setting enhanced the role of regional anesthesia in the last few years. Among the different peripheral nerve block techniques used for forefoot surgery, sciatic nerve block at popliteal fossa provides safe and effective analgesia reducing the doses of local anaesthetic, opioids and minimizing the risk of complications.

The role of ultrasound in performing nerve block is increasing over the more traditional technique of peripheral nerve stimulator. Compared to neurostimulation, ultrasound has been shown to improve the success rate and to reduce the block performance time. However, the learning curve of ultrasonographic technique may result in a prolonged time to achieve anesthesia, thus impairing the efficiency of the operating room.

The aim of this study was to compare the success rate and performance time of popliteal block during training for regional anaesthesia by using nerve stimulation (NS) or combined nerve stimulation and ultrasound (NS + US), in resident naïve to the use of US while considered experienced in NS guidance.

### A randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of ultrasound guidance versus nerve stimulation for lateral popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks in obese patients [^e8151f57]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ultrasound guidance may decrease the procedural time for many peripheral nerve blocks compared to nerve stimulation, but these studies have generally excluded obese patients. This single-blinded randomized clinical trial was designed to compare procedural times and related outcomes for ultrasound- versus nerve stimulation-guided lateral popliteal-sciatic nerve blockade specifically in obese patients.

Methods

With Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2) who were scheduled for foot/ankle surgery and desiring a peripheral nerve block were offered enrollment. Study patients were randomly assigned to receive a lateral popliteal-sciatic nerve block under either ultrasound or nerve stimulation guidance. The patient and assessor were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was procedural time in seconds. Secondary outcomes included number of needle redirections, procedure-related pain, patient satisfaction with the block, success rate, sensory and motor onset times, block duration, and complication rates.

Results

Twenty-four patients were enrolled and completed the study. All patients had successful nerve blocks. The mean procedural times (SD) were 577 (57) seconds under nerve stimulation and 206 (40) seconds with ultrasound guidance (P < .001; 95% confidence interval for difference, 329–412 seconds). Patients in the ultrasound group had fewer needle redirections and less procedure-related pain, required less opioids, and were more satisfied with their block procedures. There were no statistically significant differences in other outcomes.

Conclusions

The results of this study show that, for obese patients undergoing lateral popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks, ultrasound guidance reduces the procedural time and procedure-related pain and increases patient satisfaction compared to nerve stimulation while providing similar block characteristics.

### Effect of peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia on the hemodynamics and prognosis of diabetic patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery [^2c294d6c]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Prognosis

A comparison between two groups of postoperative complications showed that the incidence of postoperative pneumonia and nausea and vomiting in the PNB group was lower than in the GEA group, resulting in an overall significantly lower incidence in the PNB group (P < 0.05), as presented in Table 6. Of the 262 patients, 151 (57.6%) showed notable improvement, 77 (29.4%) were deemed effective, 26 (9.9%) were ineffective, and 8 (3.1%) died. Although the PNB group had a slightly shorter hospitalization time, the difference was not statistically significant. During hospitalization, there were five deaths in the GEA group and three in the PNB group, although the difference was not statistically significant. Table 5 showed no discernible difference in the treatment effectiveness between the two groups. According to the comparative results of the secondary surgery rates within 30 days of surgery between the two groups, both the GEA group (106 cases, accounting for 90.6% of the total sample) and the PNB group (130 cases, accounting for 89.7% of the total sample) exhibited relatively high rates of secondary surgeries. However, it is noteworthy that no significant differences were observed between the two groups in the statistical analysis. Similarly, in terms of the amputation rates within 30 days of surgery, we found no difference between the two groups regarding amputation and secondary surgery. Still, both groups had higher rates of secondary surgery and amputation. Please refer to Table 5 for specific data.

Table 6
Comparison of postoperative complications between the two groups (n, %)

Values are presented as the number of patients (%)

We followed up with all 262 patients in our study. Among them, 33 patients in the GEA group and 36 patients in the PNB group experienced death, while the remaining patients were classified as censored data. The category of censored data included 121 patients who were still alive, 55 patients who could not attend follow-up visits, and 17 patients who experienced death for reasons other than the condition under study. We conducted survival analysis for the two groups of patients and generated Kaplan-Meier curves. The log-rank test yielded a p-value of 0.666, while the Breslow test yielded a p-value of 0.750, indicating no significant difference in survival rates between the two groups. According to the Kaplan-Meier survival rate analysis, the 5-year mortality rate was calculated to be 32.5%. (Fig. 4)

### Infiltration between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the knee (IPACK) block in knee surgery: a narrative review [^25773b70]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The infiltration between the popliteal artery and the capsule of the knee (IPACK) block has been described as an alternative analgesic strategy for knee pain.

Objective

Our aim was to perform a narrative review to examine the place and value that the IPACK block has in comparison to and in conjunction with other regional anesthesia modalities.

Evidence Review

Following an extensive search of electronic databases, we included anatomical studies, letters, comparative observational studies, and non-randomized and randomized controlled trials that examined the IPACK block in relation to surgery on the knee under general or neuraxial anesthesia.

Findings

In all, 35 articles were included. Cadaveric studies demonstrated the potential for injected dye to spread to the nerves responsible for the innervation of the posterior as well as anteromedial and anterolateral aspects of the knee. Of the comparative observational studies (n = 15) and non-randomized (n = 1) and randomized controlled trials (n = 13), 2 and 27 were conducted in the context of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and knee replacement surgery, respectively. The role of the IPACK block with each different permutation of regional anesthesia techniques was investigated by a small number of studies. Clinical studies, in the setting of knee replacement surgery, revealed variation in the manner in which the IPACK block was performed, and indicated the possible superiority of distal injection at the level of the femoral condyles for the management of posterior knee pain. Evidence suggested the following: the IPACK block in combination with single shot adductor canal block (ACB) may be beneficial for analgesic and functional outcomes; in conjunction with single shot or continuous ACB, the IPACK block might be superior to local infiltration analgesia (LIA); and functional outcomes may be improved with the supplementation of continuous ACB and LIA with the IPACK block. The IPACK block did not commonly result in the occurrence of foot drop. Relative to tibial nerve block (TNB), the IPACK block reduced the occurrence of foot drop and increased the proportion of patients who were able to be discharged on the third postoperative day.

Conclusions

The IPACK block was potentially complementary to the ACB and might be preferable to the TNB as a motor-sparing regional anesthesia technique in knee surgery. Definitive recommendations were not reached in the presence of the heterogeneous and limited evidence base.

### Ultrasound-guided sural nerve and tibial nerve block provides comparable analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve block following calcaneal surgery: a single center randomized controlled double-blind study [^d21a0788]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Popliteal sciatic nerve blocks have gained popularity as an anesthesia choice for calcaneal surgery. While the simpler technique of sural and tibial nerve blocks offers potential, its safety and efficacy require validation through a head-to-head clinical study. This study compared the efficacy of ultrasound-guided sural and tibial nerve blocks (ST) with popliteal sciatic nerve block (PS) for operative and postoperative analgesia.

Methods

A total of 80 patients (40 per group) undergoing calcaneal surgery were randomized to receive either ST or PS nerve blocks. Patients in both groups were provided with an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device containing flurbiprofen. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores were recorded at awakening, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. In addition, block onset time, procedure duration, patient satisfaction, and application of postoperative analgesics were also recorded.

Results

VAS scores were comparable between groups throughout the 24-hour observation period (VAS range 0–3, p > 0.05). ST blocks demonstrated faster onset (8.2 ± 1.5 vs 12.4 ± 2.1 minutes, p < 0.001) and shorter procedure time (11.5 ± 2.1 vs 16.8 ± 2.4 minutes, p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction scores were similar between groups (8.5 ± 0.8 vs 8.3 ± 0.9, p = 0.31).

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided sural and tibial nerve blocks provide effective operative and postoperative analgesia comparable to popliteal sciatic nerve block. The blocks are easy to perform, have a faster onset, and achieve high patient satisfaction, making them a valuable alternative for calcaneal surgery.

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^be4992e3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Local anesthesia for office-based dermatologic surgery — identified research gaps include randomized controlled trials to compare topical anesthetic to infiltrative local anesthetic for minor dermatologic procedures in children and adults; studies on the effect of occlusion and vehicle type on topical anesthetic safety and efficacy; randomized controlled trials comparing pain of administration and anesthetic efficacy of infiltrative anesthesia versus regional nerve block for procedures on the face, hands, feet, and digits; additional data on maximum safe dosage for large, multistage procedures such as Mohs micrographic surgery; trials on techniques to decrease pain of administering infiltrative anesthesia, including auditory and visual distraction in children; studies on the utility of combining different infiltrative anesthetics for the same procedure; and randomized controlled trials on the benefits of adding hyaluronidase to local infiltrative anesthesia.

### Bunionectomy as an acute postoperative pain model: overview of common experimental methods, and insights from past clinical trials [^bcfe6c31]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

D. Postoperative Dosing, Day 1

First dose of study drug is given the morning after the day of surgery.
A popliteal catheter is inserted during surgery to continuously numb the foot (see Popliteal Block). On the morning after surgery, the catheter is removed and the numbness recedes.

Subjects must then report adequate pain for randomization postoperatively (see Postoperative Inclusion Criteria). The qualifying pain score is considered to be the subject's baseline pain. A baseline pain score allows use of SPID as a primary endpoint (see Endpoints).
Speed of onset measures such as the 2-stopwatch technique can be employed.

The Postoperative Day 1 design is by far the most common in bunionectomy clinical trials (see Summary Table of Bunionectomy Acute Pain Clinical Trials). The use of a popliteal catheter on the day of surgery allows pain from the surgical insult to partially recede overnight, such that when the patient is ready for randomization on the day after surgery, their pain trajectory is not as severe as it would have been on the day of surgery. This pain signal is an appropriate match for intermediate potency oral analgesics (investigational agents with potency similar to ibuprofen, hydrocodone, or acetaminophen). See Figure 2 re: matching the experimental pain signal to the study drug.

Figure 3 provides a timeline of key events for each dosing approach.

Timelines for each dosing paradigm.

Sedation and Anesthesia

Anesthetic protocols can vary depending on the needs of a given study. One key asset of the bunionectomy model in clinical trials is the ability to adjust anesthesia and immediate postoperative analgesia to influence the onset and duration of a subject's pain trajectory (see Popliteal Block for one example). From an experimental viewpoint, the ideal anesthetic regimen utilizes short-acting drugs that dissipate quickly and as such do not have carryover effects that would confound the efficacy evaluation period. The following anesthetic protocol is typical of modern bunionectomy studies:
Propofol at approximately 50–150 µg per kilogram per minute is titrated to achieve light sedation appropriate for monitored anesthesia care (MAC).
1–2 mg of midazolam may be given for preoperative sedation.
Muscle relaxants are not used.
Surgical anesthesia is generally achieved with a Mayo block (see Mayo Block below).
50–100 μg of fentanyl is allowed for intraoperative analgesia.

### Continuous subgluteus sciatic nerve block after orthopedic foot and ankle surgery: comparison of two infusion techniques [^257b6309]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

To compare continuous infusion or a patient-controlled technique for postoperative analgesia after foot surgery, using a new subgluteus approach for continuous sciatic nerve block.

Methods

Fifty healthy patients, undergoing orthopedic foot surgery, received a continuous sciatic nerve block using a new subgluteus approach. All blocks were placed with the aid of a nerve stimulator using a 10-cm, 18-gauge insulated Tuohy needle. After either plantar flexion or dorsiflexion of the operated foot was elicited at ≤ 0.5 mA, 20 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine was injected incrementally using repeated aspiration tests, then followed by the introduction of a 20-gauge epidural catheter. Postoperatively, 0.2% ropivacaine was infused with either a 10 mL/h continuous infusion (group Continuous, n = 25) or with a 5 mL/h basal rate with 5 mL bolus every 60 minutes (group patient-controlled analgesia [PCA], n = 25). Intraoperative analgesic supplementation, as well as postoperative pain relief, morphine consumption, incidence of complication, and patient satisfaction were recorded by an observer unaware of group assignment.

Results

The sciatic catheter was successfully placed in all patients. Intravenous fentanyl supplementation (dose range, 50 to 150 microg) was required in 4 patients in each group, but no patient required general anesthesia. Catheter dislocation was reported in 2 patients (4%). The quality of pain relief was good in both groups, and none experienced complications. Nine patients of the Continuous group (37%) and 7 patients of the PCA group (29%) required rescue morphine analgesia because of pain in the femoral dermatomes (P = 0.76). Ropivacaine consumption was 240 mL in the Continuous group (range, 200 to 240 mL) and 140 mL in the PCA group (range, 120 to 290 mL) (P = 0.0005). Patient acceptance was good in both groups.

Conclusions

The continuous subgluteus sciatic nerve block represents an easy and reliable option for postoperative analgesia after foot surgery; using a patient controlled rather than a continuous infusion technique reduces the consumption of local anesthetic solution without affecting the quality of pain relief.

### Ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa using a lateral approach: onset time comparing separate tibial and common peroneal nerve injections versus injecting proximal to the bifurcation [^dbd10400]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

We hypothesized that blocking the tibial and common peroneal nerves individually using ultrasound distal to sciatic bifurcation would decrease time to complete block compared with a block proximal to the bifurcation.

Methods

Seventy-six patients undergoing foot or ankle surgery received a sciatic nerve block either proximal or distal to the point of bifurcation. A mixture of 28 mL 1.5% mepivacaine with 100 microg clonidine and 1 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate for a total of 30 mL was used. Ultrasound was used to guide needle adjustments to achieve circumferential spread. Block success was defined as a loss of sensation to pinprick in both nerve distributions within 46 minutes.

Results

Patients in the tibial-peroneal group had significantly faster time to complete block than the sciatic group (19.2 vs 26.1 minutes; P = 0.006).

Conclusions

Blocking the tibial and common peroneal nerves in the popliteal fossa separately provides for a faster onset than a prebifurcation sciatic block.

### Femoral nerve block with selective tibial nerve block provides effective analgesia without foot drop after total knee arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study [^1f364efb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Sciatic nerve block when combined with femoral nerve block for total knee arthroplasty may provide superior analgesia but can produce footdrop, which may mask surgically induced peroneal nerve injury. In this prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study, we evaluated whether performing a selective tibial nerve block in the popliteal fossa would avoid complete peroneal motor block.

Methods

Eighty patients scheduled for primary total knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive either a tibial nerve block in the popliteal fossa or a sciatic nerve block proximal to its bifurcation in combination with femoral nerve block as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen. Local anesthetic solution of sufficient volume to encircle the target nerve was administered for the block, up to a maximum of 20 mL. General anesthesia was administered for surgery. After emergence from anesthesia, in the recovery room, the presence or absence of peroneal sensory and motor block was noted. Pain scores and opioid consumption were recorded for 24 hours after surgery.

Results

The tibial nerve block and sciatic nerve block were performed 1.7 cm (99% CI, 1.3 to 2.1) and 9.4 cm (99% CI, 8.3 to 10.5) proximal to the popliteal crease, respectively (99% CI for difference between means: 6.4 to 9.0; P < 0.001). A lower volume of ropivacaine 0.5% was used for the tibial nerve block, 8.7 mL (99% CI, 7.9 to 9.4) versus 15.2 mL (99% CI, 14.9 to 15.5), respectively (99% CI for difference between means, 5.6 to 7.3; P < 0.001). No patient receiving a tibial nerve block developed complete peroneal motor block compared to 82.5% of patients with sciatic nerve block (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the pain scores and opioid consumption between the groups.

Conclusions

Tibial nerve block performed in the popliteal fossa in close proximity to the popliteal crease avoided complete peroneal motor block and provided similar postoperative analgesia compared to sciatic nerve block when combined with femoral nerve block for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.

### A comparison of lateral popliteal versus lateral midfemoral sciatic nerve blockade using ropivacaine 0.5% [^73265b81]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The midfemoral approach to the sciatic nerve (MF) is a new technique that has been used for postoperative analgesia after knee surgery. The aim of the present study was to compare efficacy, performance time, and patient acceptance of the midfemoral approach to that of the lateral approach at the level of the popliteal fossa (popliteal block [PB]).

Methods

Sixty-three patients were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Thirty-two patients received a lateral sciatic nerve block (group PB) and 31 patients a midfemoral block (group MF). Ropivacaine 0.5% (30 mL) was used in both groups.

Results

The quality of nerve blockade was comparable in both groups. Onset of sensory block for peroneal and tibial nerves was significantly shorter in group MF than in group PB, 5 (1–20) minutes and 5 (1–20) minutes versus 10 (1–40) minutes and 10 (1–45) minutes, respectively. Onset of motor block in both territories was also shorter in group MF compared with PB, 6 (2–35) minutes and 5 (2–55) minutes versus 15 (2–60) minutes and 15 (2–60) minutes, respectively (P < .05). There was no difference in duration of sensory and motor blockade, 16 (7–32) hours versus 16 (6–43) hours and 16 (8–32) hours versus 16 (6–25) hours. There was no significant difference between both groups with respect to difficulty of nerve block performance. Patient discomfort during needle puncture was also similar.

Conclusions

The midfemoral approach to the sciatic nerve for ankle and foot surgery resulted in a reliable anesthetic, comparable to that of the lateral popliteal approach. This technique is simple, safe, and provides postoperative analgesia as effective as that obtained with the lateral approach.

### Non-inferiority trial of a pedal controlled injection device: a step toward enhancing patient safety and operator independence during neural blockade [^7dff1b7d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and objectives

Limitations in manpower in health care facilities, both in civilian and military settings, can severely affect patient safety as well as overall outcomes. Regional anesthesia via neural blockade is an effective means of managing uncontrolled acute pain, which has been associated with cardiopulmonary, endocrine, immunologic, and hematologic derangement in addition to the development of potentially life-threatening coagulopathy. We have designed a remote-controlled injection device that may expedite the performance of regional nerve blocks in these situations.

Methods

This work examines how the device affects the ability of the operator to act independently with respect to various block component times by statistically comparing device-assisted blockade with usual or clinically relevant techniques. The classic or two-person technique was compared with the foot-controlled technique.

Results

The results validated the hypothesis that the novel mechanism of performing a nerve block is not inferior to the classic technique with regard to the specified endpoints within our experimental design.

Conclusion

This confirmation indicates that the use of this device may be feasible when the use of another technique could be cumbersome, or otherwise untenable.

### Impact of self-coiling catheters for continuous popliteal sciatic block on postoperative pain level and dislocation rate: a randomized controlled trial [^42abbc1d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

With decreasing effect of the initial bolus of 0.5% ropivacaine on the first postoperative day, the average pain level of all participants was the highest compared with the other measurement points. This could be caused by dislocations of indwelling catheters, inadequate lower continuous dose of ropivacaine and pain perception in the medial aspects of the ankle and foot not covered by continuous sciatic nerve block when the effect of saphenous or femoral nerve block had worn off. In particular pain perception in sensory area of the saphenous nerve may have contributed to the convergence of pain intensity scores and the spread of differences between the groups in perineural sciatic nerve catheter performance. The use of an additional saphenous nerve catheter could possibly have reduced pain scores and additional opioid consumption. However, reports on the effects of the continuous or prolonged saphenous nerve blockade on pain after ankle surgery are conflicting.

Among nearly 71,000 patients undergoing 179 different surgeries in all body regions, the calcaneal surgery was found the most painful surgery with a mean postoperative NRS of 6.68 on the first postoperative day. Other surgeries on the foot, forefoot or ankle were among the top 15 of the most painful operations with a mean NRS value of at least 6 on the first postoperative day. This highlights the importance of continuous regional anesthesia of the ankle and foot. In our study almost, all patients were pain-free on POD 0. Subsequently, all mean NRS values in both cohorts remained below 3.5 at all study time points, but only patients with self-coiling catheters were still below the generally accepted intervention threshold of NRS 3 with a mean NRS value of 2.7. The absence of ultrasound-guidance and confirmation of proper catheter location, varying use of local anesthetics and additional analgesics, heterogeneity of surgical procedures and the lack of information on mobilization strategies make comparability with other studies difficult. Similar to our results, most studies show maximum pain intensity of NRS values up to 4 on POD 1 and a decreasing pain intensity int the further course.

### Ultrasound-guided sural nerve and tibial nerve block provides comparable analgesia to popliteal sciatic nerve block following calcaneal surgery: a single center randomized controlled double-blind study [^ebdf3e89]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In comparison to the classic popliteal sciatic nerve block, the sural nerve block and tibial nerve blocks had slightly shorter operation times, mainly due to the reduced repositioning time required for the conventional popliteal sciatic nerve block, particularly for patients with complex injuries who needed more time. The quicker onset of nerve block may be due to its status as a terminal branch of the sciatic nerve, with a smaller nerve diameter facilitating the rapid penetration of local anesthetic into nerve fiber components. Although there was a slight difference in block duration between the two groups, it was clinically insignificant. The duration of nerve block is influenced by various factors, including drug concentration and volume, the distance from the nerve, the degree of vascularization, and metabolism.

During calcaneal surgery, opioid medications are used to control surgical stimuli, such as tourniquet placement, stimulation from the laryngeal mask, or internal fixation and reduction that may extend beyond the blockade area. When comparing popliteal sciatic nerve block with sural and tibial nerve blocks, both groups in this study had sufentanil dosages of less than 10 µg, and the clinical difference was negligible. Nerve blockade serves as the primary line of postoperative analgesia. In this study, the duration of blockade between the two techniques showed no significant difference and had no statistical significance. However, an important complication is rebound pain. Although the mechanism of rebound pain is currently a subject of debate, prolonged nerve blockadeand the use of effective multimodal analgesia can help prevent it. The study utilized anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs, combined with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia pumps and additional intravenous dosages, resulting in satisfactory pain relief in both groups. This multimodal analgesia approach significantly reduces the intraoperative use of opioid medications, with nerve blockade playing a major role in achieving this outcome.

### The effects of adding epinephrine to ropivacaine for popliteal nerve block on the duration of postoperative analgesia: a randomized controlled trial [^3009d9a8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Upon arrival at the recovery room, a PCA-pump (GemStar®, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) was connected to the popliteal catheter set up to deliver bolus doses of 10 mL ropivacaine 0.2%, with a lock-out time of 15 min, no background infusion and a maximum of 30 mL per 4 h. The intensity of postoperative pain was evaluated by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, 0–10 with 0 representing no pain and 10 worst possible pain). Prior to surgery, patients had been instructed to use the PCA device to maintain postoperative pain scores at or below NRS 3. No regular postoperative opioids were provided. If patients still needed pain medication after their first request for ropivacaine through the popliteal catheter (ie after primary endpoint of the study), patients received morphine 0.1–0.15 mg/kg every 4 h subcutaneously.

Clinical assessments

Baseline characteristics of participating patients were recorded (i.e. age, length and weight).

During the first 45 min after performance of the popliteal nerve block, a blinded observer assessed the onset of sensory and motor block every 5 min until complete block of the tibial and peroneal nerve. Sensory block of the tibial and peroneal nerves was assessed by pinprick at the heel of the foot (tibial nerve) and dorsum of the foot between the 1st and 2nd toe (peroneal nerve). Sensory block was scored on a three-point scale as 0 = absent, 1 = partial and 2 = complete. Motor function of the tibial (plantar flexion foot) and peroneal nerve (dorsal flexion of foot) were also assessed on a three-point scale with 0 = no motor block, 1 = partial and 2 = complete motor block. Complete sensory and motor block was defined as a total score of 8. In those patients that did not have a complete block before the beginning of surgery, we assessed block success upon arrival at the recovery room directly postoperatively. In these patients, block success was defined as absence of pain requiring therapy in the distribution of the sciatic nerve distribution area upon arrival at the recovery room, whereas patients requiring pain relief at this time were deemed failures and were excluded from the study. Type and duration of surgery were recorded.

### Comparison of the different approaches to saphenous nerve block [^08f244f9]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The authors compared the efficacy of the different approaches to saphenous nerve block.

Methods

The following approaches to saphenous nerve block were compared in 10 volunteers: perifemoral, transsartorial, block at the medial femoral condyle, below-the-knee field block, and blockade at the level of the medial malleolus. Each volunteer underwent all five blocks, and the interval between blocks was 3–7 days. The sequence of injection was randomized by Latin square design. Sensory blockade at the medial aspects of the leg and foot and the strength of the anterior thigh muscles were noted.

Results

The transsartorial, perifemoral, and below-the-knee field block approaches were more effective than block at the medial femoral condyle in providing sensory anesthesia to the medial aspect of the leg. The transsartorial approach was more effective than block at the medial femoral condyle and below-the-knee field block in providing sensory anesthesia to the medial aspect of the foot. Compared with the perifemoral approach, the transsartorial approach did not cause weakness of the hip flexors and the knee extensors. In volunteers with partial numbness in the medial aspect of the foot, supplemental block of the medial dorsal cutaneous branch of the superficial peroneal nerve resulted in complete sensory blockade.

Conclusions

Sensory blockade in the medial aspects of the leg and foot is best achieved with the transsartorial approach. In some subjects, supplementary block of the medial dorsal cutaneous branch of the superficial peroneal nerve may have to be performed to assure complete numbness of the medial aspect of the foot.

### Plantar compartment block improves enhanced recovery after hallux valgus surgery: a randomized, comparative, double-blind study [^6dbaf86f]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Walking ability is a key factor in enhanced recovery after foot ambulatory surgery. Plantar compartment block offers an analgesic alternative to popliteal sciatic nerve block (PSNB) for hallux valgus surgery. The objective of this study was to compare these two regional anesthesia strategies on patients' ability to recover a painless unaided walk.

Methods

This prospective double-blinded (patient; observing anesthesiologist) randomized study compared patients scheduled for hallux valgus surgery receiving PSNB with 1% mepivacaine, then combined plantar and peroneal nerve blocks (plantar compartment block [PCB] group) with ropivacaine 0.5% and dexamethasone, or PSNB with ropivacaine 0.5% and dexamethasone (control group). The primary outcome was the patient's ability to walk unaided 6h after PSNB. The test was performed on a GAITRite, spatio-temporal gait analysis mat. For 3 days, the number of patient steps, pain levels, rescue analgesics, patient's experience, and adverse events were assessed.

Results

Sixty patients were included and 59 were analyzed. The number of patients walking unaided on the GAITRite mat was significantly higher in the PCB group (21 of 30, 70%) than in the control group (4 of 29, 13.8%; P < 0.001). Gait quality using the Functional Ambulation Profile score was 63 ± 13.6 in the PCB group and 49.5 ± 4.7 in the control group (P < 0.001). Median time to free ambulation at home was significantly lower in the PCB group (9h [8.2 to 11.8]) than in the control group (33.5h [24 to 47]; P < 0.001). Postoperative pain did not differ between the groups (β = -0.41 [-1.78 to 0.95]; P = 0.548). The number of steps on day 3, the time of first rescue analgesic, the number of patients using rescue analgesia, consumption of morphine, and patient's experience did not differ between the groups.

Conclusions

PCB decreased the time to return to unaided walking, with improved gait, compared with PSNB, improving effective analgesia and low consumption of rescue analgesics. This innovative regional anesthesia strategy enhanced recovery after surgery.

### Skin temperature during regional anesthesia of the lower extremity [^b1282555]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Increase in skin temperature (Ts) occurs early during neuraxial blocks. However, the reliability of Ts to predict successful peripheral block is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether an increase in Ts more than 1 degrees C precedes or follows an impairment of sensation after combined femoral and sciatic nerve block as well as after epidural anesthesia. In this prospective, nonrandomized study we determined Ts changes in 33 patients undergoing knee or foot surgery under femoral and sciatic nerve block and 10 patients undergoing epidural anesthesia. Perception and motor function were assessed every 5 min. An increase in Ts (≥ 1 degrees C) at the foot occurred later after sciatic nerve block than after epidural anesthesia (10.3 ± 2.8 versus 5.0 min; P < 0.01). Alterations of Ts at skin innervated by the femoral nerve were < 1 degrees C. Ts increase preceded sensory block after sciatic nerve block in 6.6% of patients but indicated a successful block (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy = 100%). We conclude that an increase of Ts is a reliable, but late, sign of successful sciatic nerve block. Therefore it is of limited clinical value. Ts changes after femoral nerve block are negligible and late.

### Ultrasound improves the success rate of a tibial nerve block at the ankle [^d337d9ba]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The tibial nerve provides the majority of sensation to the foot. Although multiple techniques have been described, there exists little evidence-based medicine evaluating different techniques for blocking the tibial nerve at the ankle. We hypothesized that an ultrasound (US)-guided tibial nerve block at the ankle would prove more successful than a conventional approach based on surface landmarks.

Methods

Eighteen healthy volunteers were prospectively randomized into this controlled and blinded study. Each subject was placed prone, and one ankle was randomly assigned to receive either an US-guided tibial nerve block (group US) or a traditional landmark-based tibial nerve block (group LM). The subject's other ankle then received the alternate approach. All blocks were performed with 5 mL of 3% chloroprocaine. We evaluated sensory and motor blocks. A successful block was defined as complete loss of sensation to both ice and pinprick at 5 cutaneous sites. Secondary outcome variables included performance times, number of needle passes, participant satisfaction, and presence of any complications.

Results

At 30 mins, the block was complete in 72% of participants in group US as compared with 22% in group LM. At all times, the proportion of complete blocks was higher in group US. Ultrasound-guided blocks took longer on average to perform than traditional blocks (159 vs 79 secs; P < 0.001). There were more needle redirects in group US, with 8 subjects requiring 3 or more redirects versus none in group LM. Subjects preferred the US block 78% of the time (95% confidence interval, 52%-95%).

Conclusions

In healthy volunteers, US guidance results in a more successful tibial nerve block at the ankle than does a traditional approach using surface landmarks.

### Ultrasound guidance improves the success of sciatic nerve block at the popliteal fossa [^173ff1f0]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Real time ultrasound guidance is a recent development in the area of peripheral nerve blockade. There are limited data from prospective randomized trials comparing its efficacy to that of traditional nerve localization techniques. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ultrasound guidance improves the success rate of sciatic nerve block at the popliteal fossa when compared with a nerve stimulator-guided technique.

Methods

After Institutional Research Ethics Board approval and informed consent, 74 patients undergoing elective major foot or ankle surgery were randomly assigned to receive a sciatic nerve block at the popliteal fossa guided by either ultrasonography (group US, transverse view, needle in plane approach above the sciatic nerve bifurcation), or nerve stimulation (group NS, single injection, 10 cm proximal to the knee crease). A standardized local anesthetic admixture (15 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and 15 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine) was used. Sensory and motor function was assessed by a blinded observer at predetermined intervals for up to 1 hour. Block success was defined as a loss of sensation to pinprick within 30 minutes in the distribution of both tibial and common peroneal nerves.

Results

Group US had a significantly higher block success rate than group NS (89.2% vs. 60.6%, P = 0.005), while the procedure time was similar.

Conclusions

Ultrasound guidance enhances the quality of popliteal sciatic nerve block compared with single injection, nerve stimulator-guided block using either a tibial or peroneal endpoint. Ultrasound guidance resulted in higher success, faster onset, and progression of sensorimotor block, without an increase in block procedure time, or complications.

### Plantar flexion seems more reliable than dorsiflexion with labat's sciatic nerve block: a prospective, randomized comparison [^474d8603]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Labat's classic approach to the sciatic nerve has not been able to show which motor response of the foot provides a more frequent rate of complete sensory and motor block. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we compared plantar flexion with dorsiflexion with regard to onset time and efficacy of sciatic nerve block using the classic posterior approach. A total of 80 patients undergoing hallux valgus repair were randomly allocated to receive sciatic nerve block after evoked plantar flexion (n = 40) or dorsiflexion (n = 40). Twenty milliliters of 0.75% ropivacaine was injected after the motor response was elicited at < 0.5 mA. Success rate was defined as complete sensory and motor block in all sciatic nerve distributions associated with a pain-free surgery. Time required for onset of sensory and motor block of the foot was recorded. Success was more frequent after elicited plantar flexion (87.5%) than dorsiflexion (55%; P < 0.05). Onset of complete sensory and motor block of the foot was faster after elicited plantar flexion (10 ± 10 min and 13 ± 10 min, respectively) compared with dorsiflexion (20 ± 11 min and 24 ± 12 min; P < 0.05). We conclude that plantar flexion of the foot predicts a shorter onset time and a more frequent success rate than dorsiflexion with Labat's classic posterior sciatic nerve block.

### Tibial nerve block with anesthetics resulting in achilles tendon avulsion [^6fd45ad7]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tibial nerve block with anesthetics is a common and safe procedure for the management of the spastic equinovarus foot. Side effects have been rarely reported. We present the case of a hemiplegic patient with a spastic equinovarus foot who presented with an avulsion fracture of the calcaneum at the insertion of the Achilles tendon consecutive to a diagnostic tibial nerve block with anesthetic agents. Although rare, such a complication should be considered when the Achilles tendon is shortened and when the patient is suspected of bone osteoporosis or dystrophy.

### The efficacy of combined popliteal and ankle blocks in forefoot surgery [^03003e74]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain following forefoot surgery can be difficult to control with oral analgesia. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a combined popliteal and ankle block with that of an ankle block alone in providing postoperative analgesia following forefoot surgery.

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled single-blind study involving sixty-three patients, twenty-six of whom had a combined ankle and popliteal block and thirty-seven of whom had an ankle block alone. All patients underwent an elective osseous surgical procedure on the forefoot. Postoperative pain was evaluated with use of a visual analogue scale and a verbal response form. Patient satisfaction was also recorded.

Results

The patients who had had a combined popliteal and ankle block had significantly less pain at six hours postoperatively (p = 0.011), twenty-four hours postoperatively (p < 0.001), and at discharge (p = 0.014). This group of patients also had higher satisfaction with pain relief.

Conclusions

A popliteal block in conjunction with an ankle block provides significantly better pain relief than does an ankle block alone in patients undergoing forefoot surgery.

### Clinical application of laser speckle flowgraphy to assess changes in blood flow to the foot after a lumbar sympathetic ganglion block: a case report [^1ba95757]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The lumbar sympathetic ganglion block (LSGB) has been used as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for treating pain conditions such as neuropathic and ischemia-related pain, affecting the lower extremities. In general, an increase in skin temperature is useful in confirming the effectiveness of the sympathetic nerve block in clinical settings. However, the assessment of skin temperature in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) occasionally provides false negatives.

Case Presentation

A novel technology, laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) enables noninvasive quantitative and qualitative blood flow assessments. LSFG is a novel neuro-monitor for quantitative blood flow detection in the optic nerve head during cardiac surgery. Herein, we report on measuring foot blood flow using LSFG before and after LSGB in a PAD patient. This research aimed to determine whether LSFG could detect any improvement in the dynamics of foot blood flow after an LSGB in a situation where changes in skin temperature alone could not determine the procedure's outcome.

Conclusion

LSFG can be used to assess blood flow changes in a foot with PAD, following a LSGB.
