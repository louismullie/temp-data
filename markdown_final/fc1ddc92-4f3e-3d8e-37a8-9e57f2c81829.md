## Question

what is the treatment for uti in male?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI) in males. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the UTI syndrome in men. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to obtain cultures. Next, I will consider empiric antibiotic selection and stewardship. After that, I need to determine treatment duration by syndrome and reconcile conflicting evidence. Finally, I should address special populations, follow-up, and when to evaluate for underlying abnormalities, while continuously checking for internal consistency and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because treatment hinges on it. In men, most UTIs are considered complicated by default due to the possibility of prostatic involvement, structural abnormalities, or systemic features, so I should distinguish lower tract symptoms (cystitis/urethritis) from upper tract or systemic disease (pyelonephritis, febrile UTI) and consider whether there is suspected prostatitis, which changes both agent selection and duration [^8144d778] [^38cfbfed].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic steps before jumping to antibiotics. For any symptomatic male UTI, I should obtain a urinalysis and send a urine culture with susceptibilities because empiric therapy in men carries a higher risk of resistance and prostatic involvement; I need to ensure I differentiate from urethritis or STIs and consider rectal exam if prostatitis is suspected, while remembering that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated except in specific procedural contexts [^4f91305f] [^e2e33772] [^8e39dc10].

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic selection, but hold on, I should align with local resistance patterns and stewardship. Fluoroquinolones have good prostatic penetration and are often used for febrile UTI or suspected prostatitis, yet I must avoid them when resistance is high or safer alternatives exist; reasonable empiric options include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin, or nitrofurantoin for lower tract disease without systemic features, with adjustments once culture results return [^8144d778] [^5b3f0c5f] [^4f91305f].

> Let me think about duration next, and I should double-check the conflicting evidence. For afebrile men with lower tract symptoms, a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is noninferior to 14 days for symptom resolution, which supports shorter therapy when prostatitis is not suspected; however, for febrile UTI or suspected acute bacterial prostatitis, 14 days remains standard because shorter courses have shown inferior outcomes in randomized trials, even though some pragmatic studies suggest no long-term recurrence difference, so I need to match duration to syndrome and clinical response [^eae55c88] [^37a3bd2c] [^cd665062] [^fc1d9dae].

> Hold on, I should verify the prostatitis nuance because it changes management. Acute bacterial prostatitis often accompanies febrile UTI in men, and agents with good prostatic penetration such as fluoroquinolones are preferred; if I suspect prostatitis, I should extend therapy to 10–14 days and reassess for clinical improvement, recognizing that evidence for the exact duration is limited and that persistent symptoms may reflect inadequate source control or chronic prostatitis [^e8b20eae] [^37a3bd2c] [^b5d78ea0].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In older men, I need to maintain a high index of suspicion for obstruction or prostatic disease and consider imaging if there is treatment failure or recurrent infection; in men with indwelling catheters, I should treat symptomatic CA-UTI as complicated and replace the catheter when feasible; in those with diabetes or immunocompromise, I should broaden empiric coverage and extend duration based on severity and response, always balancing risks of overtreatment against undertreatment [^6bbfaf89] [^b1396b1e] [^8144d778].

> I should confirm follow-up and test-of-cure strategy. Routine post-treatment cultures are not needed in asymptomatic men after therapy; however, if symptoms persist or recur, I should repeat urinalysis and culture and evaluate for alternative diagnoses or an occult nidus such as prostatic abscess, stone, or obstruction, adjusting therapy accordingly and considering urologic consultation if there are two or more recurrences or any red flags [^14751a20] [^6bbfaf89].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor; does that change management. I need to ensure I counsel on UTI risk and recognize that SGLT2-associated UTIs can progress to urosepsis; this does not alter antibiotic choice per se, but it heightens the importance of prompt recognition, appropriate initial therapy, and close follow-up if systemic features are present [^5ae17dcc].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure internal consistency. Classify the syndrome carefully, obtain cultures in symptomatic men, select empiric therapy guided by local resistance and prostatic considerations, use 7 days for afebrile lower tract disease without prostatitis and 10–14 days for febrile UTI or suspected prostatitis, and escalate evaluation for recurrences or treatment failures; this aligns with contemporary IDSA guidance, EAU perspectives, and randomized data while honoring stewardship principles [^8144d778] [^5165eba0] [^eae55c88] [^37a3bd2c].

---

Treatment of UTI in males depends on **severity and site of infection** [^5165eba0]. For uncomplicated lower UTIs, use **7 days** of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or a fluoroquinolone if resistance is low [^eae55c88] [^4f91305f]. For febrile or complicated UTIs, treat for **10–14 days** with a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside plus a beta-lactam, adjusting to culture results [^e8b20eae] [^37a3bd2c]. If acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected, extend therapy to **2–4 weeks** and ensure agents penetrate the prostate [^e8b20eae] [^b5d78ea0]. Always obtain urine culture before antibiotics when feasible, and tailor therapy to local resistance patterns [^4f91305f] [^5b3f0c5f].

---

## Classification of UTIs in males

UTIs in males are classified as **uncomplicated or complicated** based on clinical presentation, underlying comorbidities, and anatomical or functional abnormalities [^63123109]:

- **Uncomplicated UTI**: Lower tract infection (cystitis) without systemic symptoms, fever, or structural abnormalities [^2be4e0aa].
- **Complicated UTI**: Upper tract infection (pyelonephritis), systemic symptoms, or underlying structural or functional abnormalities (e.g. obstruction, catheterization, immunocompromise) [^63123109].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and classification are essential for **appropriate treatment**:

- **Clinical assessment**: History and physical examination to identify symptoms, risk factors, and comorbidities [^5165eba0].
- **Urinalysis and urine culture**: Essential for confirming infection, identifying causative organisms, and guiding antibiotic selection [^52dde126].
- **Blood cultures**: Recommended for febrile patients or those with suspected systemic infection [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Consider ultrasound or CT if obstruction, abscess, or structural abnormalities are suspected [^6bbfaf89].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic selection should consider **local resistance patterns**, patient allergies, and severity of infection [^5b3f0c5f]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated lower UTI | - Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 7 days [^notfound] <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg PO BID for 7 days [^notfound] <br/> - Fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID) for 7 days if resistance is low [^notfound] |
| Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis | - Fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID or levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily) for 10–14 days [^e8b20eae] <br/> - Aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin) plus beta-lactam (e.g. ceftriaxone) for 10–14 days [^notfound] |
| Acute bacterial prostatitis | - Fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID or levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily) for 2–4 weeks [^notfound] <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg PO BID for 2–4 weeks [^notfound] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **duration of therapy** depends on the clinical scenario:

- **Uncomplicated lower UTI**: 7 days [^eae55c88].
- **Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**: 10–14 days [^e8b20eae].
- **Acute bacterial prostatitis**: 2–4 weeks [^notfound].

---

## Adjustments based on culture results

Once culture and sensitivity results are available, **antibiotic therapy should be adjusted** to the narrowest effective agent based on susceptibilities [^5b3f0c5f].

---

## Management of recurrent UTIs

Recurrent UTIs in males warrant **evaluation for underlying abnormalities** (e.g. structural, functional, or behavioral) and may require prolonged or suppressive antibiotic therapy, as well as urologic consultation [^6bbfaf89].

---

## Special considerations

- **Catheter-associated UTIs**: Treat symptomatic infections only, remove or replace the catheter, and use antibiotics for 7–14 days based on severity [^89e06071].
- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: Emphasize appropriate antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^5b3f0c5f].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Patients should be monitored for **clinical response**, adverse effects, and recurrence. Repeat urine cultures are not routinely required unless symptoms persist or recur [^14751a20].

---

Treatment of UTI in males requires **individualized care** based on infection severity, underlying comorbidities, and local resistance patterns. Empiric therapy should be guided by clinical presentation, with adjustments based on culture results.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^38cfbfed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^5165eba0]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e8b20eae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Guidelines for the management of male urinary tract infections in primary care: a lack of international consensus-a systematic review of the literature [^c5e48507]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of adult male urinary tract infections (mUTIs) in primary care lacks international consensus. The main objective of this study was to describe the different guidelines for the diagnosis and management of mUTIs in primary care, to assess their methodological quality, and to describe their evidence-based strength of recommendation (SoR).

Methods

An international systematic literature review of the electronic databases Medline (PubMed) and EMBASE, and gray-literature guideline-focused databases was performed in 2021. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.

Results

From 1,678 records identified, 1,558 were screened, 134 assessed for eligibility, and 29 updated guidelines met the inclusion criteria (13 from Medline, 0 from EMBASE, and 16 from gray literature). Quality assessment revealed 14 (48%) guidelines with high-quality methodology. A grading system methodology was used in 18 (62%) guidelines. Different classifications of mUTIs are described, underlining a lack of international consensus: an anatomic classification (cystitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis) and a symptomatic classification (approach based on the intensity and tolerance of symptoms). The duration of antibiotic treatment for febrile mUTIs has been gradually reduced over the last 20 years from 28 days to 10–14 days of fluoroquinolones (FQ), which has become the international gold standard. Guidelines from Scandinavian countries propose short courses (3–5 days) of FQ-sparing treatments: pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim. Guidelines from French-speaking countries use a watchful waiting approach and suggest treating mUTIs with FQ, regardless of fever.

Conclusions

This lack of scientific evidence leads to consensus and disagreement: 14 days of FQ for febrile mUTIs is accepted despite a high risk of antimicrobial resistance, but FQ-sparing treatment and/or short treatment for afebrile mUTIs is not. The definition of afebrile UTIs/cystitis is debated and influences the type and duration of antibiotic treatment recommended.

### 5-day versus 10-day course of fluoroquinolones in outpatient males with a urinary tract infection (UTI) [^aa9eff78]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines classify urinary tract infections (UTIs) in males as complicated and recommend longer treatment than for UTIs in females. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that males with UTIs may be successfully treated with an outpatient 5-day course of levofloxacin.

Methods

Data were obtained from a previously conducted clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00210886), a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously/by mouth once daily for 5 days and ciprofloxacin 400/500 mg intravenously/by mouth twice daily for 10 days in complicated UTI (cUTI). The current study was a post hoc, subgroup analysis of male and female subjects with cUTI. Subjects were stratified into groups based on sex and antibiotic received. The subjects were analyzed at the end of therapy (EOT) and post therapy (PT) for clinical success rates, defined as no further need for antimicrobial treatment.

Results

Totals of 427 patients (224 male, 203 female) and 350 patients (189 male, 161 female) were included in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations, respectively. Clinical success rates between males and females were not statistically different between antibiotic groups in either the mITT or ME populations at EOT or PT.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that males with UTI may be treated with a shorter course of antimicrobial therapy for UTI than previously recommended.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^72f58a6d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Antimicrobial for 7 or 14 days for febrile urinary tract infection in men: a multicenter noninferiority double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^37a3bd2c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in men remains controversial.

Methods

To compare 7 days to 14 days of total antibiotic treatment for febrile UTIs in men, this multicenter randomized, double-blind. placebo-controlled noninferiority trial enrolled 282 men from 27 centers in France. Men were eligible if they had a febrile UTI and urine culture showing a single uropathogen. Participants were treated with ofloxacin or a third-generation cephalosporin at day 1, then randomized at day 3–4 to either continue ofloxacin for 14 days total treatment, or for 7 days followed by placebo until day 14. The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as a negative urine culture and the absence of fever and of subsequent antibiotic treatment between the end of treatment and 6 weeks after day 1. Secondary endpoints included recurrent UTI within weeks 6 and 12 after day 1, rectal carriage of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacterales, and drug-related events.

Results

Two hundred forty participants were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic therapy for 7 days (115 participants) or 14 days (125 participants). In the intention-to-treat analysis, treatment success occurred in 64 participants (55.7%) in the 7-day group and in 97 participants (77.6%) in the 14-day group (risk difference, -21.9 [95% confidence interval, -33.3 to -10.1]), demonstrating inferiority. Adverse events during antibiotic therapy were reported in 4 participants in the 7-day arm and 7 in the 14-day arm. Rectal carriage of resistant Enterobacterales did not differ between both groups.

Conclusions

A treatment with ofloxacin for 7 days was inferior to 14 days for febrile UTI in men and should therefore not be recommended.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to duration of treatment, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration of 10–14 days, although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^dffd6966]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^76ea8269]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be the most cost-effective treatment. Three-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, 250 mg twice daily, and ofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily, were recently compared with three-day trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy. 3, 11 The oral fluoroquinolones produced better cure rates with less toxicity, but at a greater overall cost. The initial empiric therapy for these patients should include an agent with a broad spectrum of activity against the expected uropathogens. Treatment most often includes a fluoroquinolone, administered orally if possible. Patients with complicated UTIs require at least a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. Follow-up urine cultures should be performed within 10 to 14 days after treatment to ensure that the uropathogen has been eradicated.

Recent studies have shown that patients initially placed on parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy within 72 hours as long as they are clinically improving and able to tolerate the oral agent, and a regimen is available that covers the identified pathogen. 3 Oral therapy should be considered in women with mild to moderate symptoms who are compliant with therapy and can tolerate oral antibiotics but do not have other significant conditions, including pregnancy and gastrointestinal upset. Since. 23 Men with urinary tract infections should receive a minimum of seven days of antibiotic therapy. However, more extensive courses may be required in, for example, men with associated urinary tract infection and prostatitis. Consensus regarding the need for a urologic work-up in men with urinary tract infections is lacking.

Among young men with acute cystitis who respond to seven days of treatment, diagnostic work-ups beyond cultures are generally unrewarding. 24 Urologic evaluation should be performed routinely in adolescents and men with pyelonephritis or recurrent infections. 11, 25 When bacterial prostatitis is the source of a urinary tract infection, eradication usually requires antibiotic therapy for six to 12 weeks and in rare instances even longer. Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling Foley catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens. Patients with mild to moderate infections may be treated with one of the oral quinolones, usually for 10 to 14 days. Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary in patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^547ce991]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common infections seen by obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care providers. Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to treat and decrease quality of life. This article addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Most notably, increased interest in the urinary microbiome is leading to improved understanding of virulent and commensal bacteria in the genitourinary tract. Understanding the causative factors of recurrent urinary tract infections will lead to improved detection, treatment, and prevention.

### D-mannose for preventing and treating urinary tract infections [^0dec87ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common, affecting more than 7 million people worldwide. Whilst many people may only experience a single episode in their lifetime and are generally responsive to standard antibiotics, a significant proportion of adults and children (approximately 15% to 25%) are chronic symptomatic UTI sufferers. Certain population groups are at greater risk than others, such as immunosuppressed and people with chronic kidney disease. D-mannose is a sugar part of normal human metabolism found within most diets. The mechanism of action is to prevent bacterial adherence to the uroepithelial cells. The D-mannose-based inhibitors can block uropathogenic Escherichia coli adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelial cells. The bacteria are then understood to essentially be eliminated by urination. Early pilot studies on animals and humans have trialled concentrated forms of D-mannose (tablets or sachets) in doses ranging from 200 mg up to 2 to 3 g and found possible efficacy in reducing UTI symptoms or recurrence. Although the anti-adhesive effects of D-mannose have been well-established, only recently have we seen a small number of pilot studies and small clinical trials conducted.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of D-mannose for preventing and treating UTIs in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 22 February 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs measuring and reporting the effect of D-mannose, in any combination and any formulation, to prevent or treat UTIs in adults and children, females and males, in any setting (including perioperative). Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another author. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs (719 participants) in adult females and males who had either acute cystitis or a history of recurrent (at least two episodes in six months or three episodes in 12 months) UTIs (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Two were prevention studies, four were prevention and treatment studies (two perioperative and one in people with multiple sclerosis), and one was a treatment study. Time periods ranged from 15 days to six months. No two studies were comparable (by dose or treatments), and we could not undertake meta-analyses. Individual studies reported no clear evidence to determine whether D-mannose is more or less effective in preventing or treating UTIs. D-mannose (2 g) had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteriuria-confirmed UTIs when compared to no treatment (1 study, 205 participants; very low certainty evidence) and antibiotics (nitrofurantoin 50 mg) (1 study, 206 participants; very low certainty evidence). D-mannose, in combination with herbal supplements, had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteria-confirmed UTI and pain when compared to no treatment (1 study, 40 participants; very low certainty evidence). D-mannose 500 mg plus supplements (N-acetylcysteine and Morinda citrifolia fruit extract) had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteriuria-confirmed UTIs when compared to an antibiotic (prulifloxacin 400 mg) (1 study, 75 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events were very few and poorly reported; none were serious (mostly diarrhoea and vaginal burning). Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor. Most studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias across most domains. Data was sparse and addressed very few outcomes. The GRADE evaluation was rated as very low certainty evidence due to very serious limitations in the study design or execution (high risk of bias across all studies) and sparse data (single study data and small sample sizes).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently little to no evidence to support or refute the use of D-mannose to prevent or treat UTIs in all populations. This review highlights the severe lack of high-quality RCTs testing the efficacy of D-mannose for UTIs in any population. Despite UTIs being one of the most common adult infections (affecting 50% of women at least once in their lifetime) and the growing global antimicrobial resistance, we found very few studies that adequately test this alternative treatment. Future research in this field requires, in the first instance, a single adequately powered RCT comparing D-mannose with placebo.

### The urinary microbiome: improving diagnostics and management of urinary tract infections in adult females [^1ff9b146]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This article discusses the urinary microbiome in relation to urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. It makes biologic sense that the microbiota of different niches (bladder, vagina, and gut) interact with each other in health, as well as during a UTI event; however, these relationships remain poorly understood. Future research should close knowledge gaps regarding the interactions between the urinary microbiota and the host, amongst the microbiota of adjacent niches, and between the microbes within the same microbiota. The new knowledge should result in improved UTI treatment in the age of antibiotic stewardship.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^eae55c88]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; P = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^ebf31aaf]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be successfully treated with antibiotics for 7 days, including those who initially were treated with β-lactams intravenously. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days when looking at short-term clinical cure. During long-term follow-up, even in men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 14 days.

Is should be considered that the primary outcome measures on future trials on antibiotic treatment duration of fUTI in men, should be set at 3 months instead of the traditional 2 weeks.

### Diagnosis and management of male urinary tract infections: a need for new guidelines. study from a French general practice electronic database [^36f6408d]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The definition and the treatment of male urinary tract infections (UTIs) are imprecise. This study aims to determine the frequency of male UTIs in consultations of general practice, the diagnostic approach and the prescribed treatments.

Methods

We extracted the consultations of male patients, aged 18 years or more, during the period 2012–17 with the International Classification of Primary Care, version 2 codes for UTIs or associated symptoms from PRIMEGE/MEDISEPT databases of primary care. For eligible consultations in which all symptoms or codes were consistent with male UTIs, we identified patient history, prescribed treatments, antibiotic duration, clinical conditions, additional examinations and bacteriological results of urine culture.

Results

Our study included 610 consultations with 396 male patients (mean age 62.5 years). Male UTIs accounted for 0.097% of visits and 1.44 visits per physician per year. The UTIs most commonly identified were: undifferentiated (52%), prostatitis (36%), cystitis (8.5%) and pyelonephritis (3.5%). Fever was recorded in 14% of consultations. Urine dipstick test was done in 1.8% of consultations. Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli in 50.4% of bacteriological tests. Fluoroquinolones were the most prescribed antibiotics (64.9%), followed by beta-lactams (17.4%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (11.9%) and nitrofurantoin (2.6%).

Conclusions

Male UTIs are rare in general practice and have different presentations. The definition of male UTIs needs to be specified by prospective studies. Diagnostic evidence of male cystitis may reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy and spare critical antibiotics.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^2be4e0aa]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^52dde126]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^03e88d61]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^cd665062]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In adults with febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI), data on optimal treatment duration in patients other than non-pregnant women without comorbidities are lacking.

Methods

A randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial among 35 primary care centers and 7 emergency departments of regional hospitals in the Netherlands. Women and men aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of fUTI were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 or 14 days (the second week being ciprofloxacin 500 mg or placebo orally twice daily). Patients indicated to receive antimicrobial treatment for at least 14 days were excluded from randomization.

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit with preset subgroup analysis including sex. Secondary endpoints were bacteriologic cure rate at 10–18 days post-treatment and clinical cure at 70–84 days post-treatment.

Results

Of 357 patients included, 200 were eligible for randomization; 97 patients were randomly assigned to 7 days and 103 patients to 14 days of treatment. Overall, short-term clinical cure occurred in 85 (90%) patients treated for 7 days and in 94 (95%) of those treated for 14 days (difference –4.5%; 90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7; P non-inferiority = 0.072, non-inferiority not confirmed). In women, clinical cure was 94% and 93% in those treated for 7 and 14 days, respectively (difference 0.9; 90% CI, –6.9 to 8.7, P non-inferiority = 0.011, non-inferiority confirmed) and, in men, this was 86% versus 98% (difference –11.2; 90% CI –20.6 to –1.8, P superiority = 0.025, inferiority confirmed).

The bacteriologic cure rate was 93% versus 97% (difference –4.3%; 90% CI, –9.7 to 1.2, P non-inferiority = 0.041) and the long-term clinical cure rate was 92% versus 91% (difference 1.6%; 90% CI, –5.3 to 8.4; P non-inferiority = 0.005) for 7 days versus 14 days of treatment, respectively. In the subgroups of men and women, long-term clinical cure rates met the criteria for non-inferiority, indicating there was no difference in the need for antibiotic retreatment for UTI during 70–84 days follow-up post-treatment.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be treated successfully with antibiotics for 7 days. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days during short-term follow-up but it is non-inferior when looking at longer follow-up.

### Urinary tract infections: current and emerging management strategies [^67a67d59]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cystitis is one of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections and is responsible for substantial morbidity and high medical costs in the United States and across the globe. Though generally considered to be self-limiting and easily treated with antibiotics, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often incompletely resolved by antibiotic therapy and frequently recur. This is in part due to the ability of uropathogenic bacteria to invade, replicate, and persist within host epithelial cells. The biological complexity of these infections combined with a dramatic rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens highlight the need for alternative therapies. In this review we examine current management strategies for UTIs, as well as emerging treatments, including novel compounds that block bacterial interactions with the urothelium and vaccines focused on preventing both acute and recurrent infections.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^5311e3c1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Development of quality indicators for the antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections: a first step to measure and improve care [^0a5b3277]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriateness of antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) is important. The aim of this study was to develop a set of valid, reliable, and applicable indicators to assess the quality of antibiotic use in the treatment of hospitalized patients with complicated UTI.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 13 experts reviewed and prioritized recommendations extracted from a recently developed evidence-based national guideline for the treatment of complicated UTI. The content validity was assessed in 2 consecutive rounds with an in-between discussion meeting. Next, we tested the feasibility, interobserver reliability, opportunity for improvement, and case-mix stability of the potential indicators for a data set of 341 inpatients and outpatients with complicated UTIs who were treated at the urology or internal medicine departments at 4 hospitals.

Results

The panel selected and prioritized 13 indicators. Four and 9 indicators were performed satisfactorily in the urology and internal medicine departments, as follows: performance of urine culture, prescription of treatment in accordance with guidelines, tailoring of treatment on the basis of culture results, and a switch to oral treatment when possible in the urology and internal medicine departments; and selective use of fluoroquinolones, administration of treatment for at least 10 days, prescription of treatment for men in accordance with guidelines, replacement of catheters in patients with UTI, and adaptation of the dosage on the basis of renal function in the internal medicine department.

Conclusion

A systemic evidence- and consensus-based approach was used to develop a set of valid quality indicators. Tests of the applicability of these indicators in practice in different settings is essential before they are used in quality-improvement strategies.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^0ac1d230]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Urinary tract infection in male veterans: treatment patterns and outcomes [^598aad53]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Lengthier antimicrobial therapy is associated with increased costs, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse drug events. Therefore, establishing minimum effective antimicrobial treatment durations is an important public health goal. The optimal treatment duration and current treatment patterns for urinary tract infection (UTI) in men are unknown. We used Veterans Affairs administrative data to study male UTI treatment and outcomes.

Methods

Male UTI episodes in the Veterans Affairs system (fiscal year 2009) were identified by combining International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes with UTI-relevant antimicrobial prescriptions. Episodes were categorized as index, early recurrence (< 30 days), or late recurrence (≥ 30 days) cases. Drug name, treatment duration, and outcomes (recurrence and Clostridium difficile infection during 12 months) were recorded for index cases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were assessed for associations with outcomes in univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

Among 4 854 765 outpatient male veterans, 39 149 UTI episodes involving 33 336 unique patients were identified, including 33 336 index cases (85.2%), 1772 early recurrences (4.5%), and 4041 late recurrences (10.3%). Highest-use antimicrobial agents were ciprofloxacin (62.7%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.8%); 35.0% of patients received shorter-duration treatment (≤ 7 days), and 65.0% of patients received longer-duration treatment (> 7 days). Of the index cases, 4.1% were followed by early recurrence and 9.9% by late recurrence. Longer-duration treatment was not associated with a reduction in early or late recurrence but was associated with increased late recurrence compared with shorter-duration treatment (10.8% vs 8.4%, P < .001), including in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10–1.30). In addition, C difficile infection risk was significantly higher with longer-duration vs shorter-duration treatment (0.5% vs 0.3%, P = 0.02) and exhibited a similar suggestive trend in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.97–2.07).

Conclusion

Longer-duration treatment (> 7 days) for male UTI in the outpatient setting was associated with no reduction in early or late recurrence.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^edb6fcbe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^63123109]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment not diagnosis — are defined by clinical presentation suggesting infection extending beyond the bladder with fever, other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or hemodynamic instability), flank pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness. Pyelonephritis is encompassed in complicated UTI. UTI with systemic symptoms associated with transurethral, suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization is encompassed in complicated UTI. Patients with complicated UTIs may have an indwelling urinary catheter, neurogenic bladder, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention as an underlying condition, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^a008a86f]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^646aa282]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b1396b1e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of persons with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^5526d411]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### Urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^b6c5ff5b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^76dd1cc8]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^0efdca17]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings extend recent findings of a highly similar controlled randomized Swedish study performed in women with acute pyelonephritis, showing non-inferiority of 7- to 14-days of antimicrobial treatment. Compared to our study, their patient group was younger, had less comorbidities, and fewer had complicated UTIs.

In men, our results indicate an increase in the rate of clinical and bacteriological treatment failure after the 7-day treatment as compared to 14 days. Likely, though chronic bacterial prostatitis was an exclusion criterion, this is due to prostatic involvement of the infection as this is known to be a cause of recurrent UTI, even after appropriate antimicrobial treatment. There is a lack of studies on optimal treatment duration of fUTI in men. One study directly compared different treatment duration in an open, prospective, and randomized trial in 72 men with community-acquired fUTI, showing similar bacteriological cure rates with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for either 2 or 4 weeks. Similarly, a randomized, double-blind trial in Sweden lent support for the efficacy of 14-day treatment with fluoroquinolones in men. Taken together, the studies confirm that, at present, a 14-day treatment regimen of fluoroquinolones is the minimum period necessary for optimal therapy of fUTI in men. Recently, however, a retrospective analysis of a large database of male veterans indicated that more than 7 days of antibiotic treatment (the vast majority being treated with ciprofloxacin) was not associated with a reduction of UTI recurrence. In addition, this study showed that treatment with β-lactams was associated with a higher risk of recurrence as compared to fluoroquinolone treatment. Furthermore, they showed that UTI recurrence was independently associated with comorbidities and age. As in our study about half of the patients were initially treated with a β-lactam intravenously, implying less penetration into the prostrate, this may have influenced our results and may possibly explain the larger difference in cure rates within the subgroup of men with stepdown treatment. Interestingly, in line with this, we found no significant difference in men who were solely treated with ciprofloxacin, whereas in men aged less than 50 years, there was a similar cure rate with antibiotic treatment for 7 or 14 days.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^9088d3c0]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^45d011bf]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The primary endpoint was analyzed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, including all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug (on the eighth day of UTI treatment), and on the per-protocol (PP) population, including all randomized patients who had been given the study drug for a minimum of 24 hours (in case of treatment failure) or who had taken at least 80% of the study drug (in case of clinical cure).

The study sample size was calculated on the basis of a clinical cure rate of 10 percentage points lower at short-term follow-up in the 7-day treatment arm with the assumption of a 90% clinical cure rate in patients treated for 14 days. We adopted 10% as the margin of non-inferiority as suggested previously. As we were only interested in non-inferiority and not in equivalence, the sample size calculation was based on a one-tailed alpha of 0.05. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 0.10, 1-tailed alpha of 0.05, and a power of 0.90, the required sample size per group was 200. This implies that the 90% confidence interval of a two-tailed χ² test should not cross the predefined risk difference of 10% lower clinical cure rate, or equivalently, the one-sided P value is less than the 0.05 significance level. Interim analyses were done after randomization of 100 and 200 patients. After the second interim analysis, there was no reason to stop the trial for safety reasons. However, the principal investigators, who obviously were still blinded with respect to treatment allocation, noted that the overall cure rate was 92%. This is comparable with the results of a recently published similar trial in women comparing 73 to 83 patients treated over 7 or 14 days, respectively. As we had indeed included a larger sample size of 200 patients, we estimated that our study would likely have already met the criteria for non-inferiority while still having a power of 0.80 with a type 1 error of 0.05. As we were confronted with an almost empty budget and a dropping inclusion rate after almost 5 years of participation, we considered continuation of the trial was no longer realistic and thus we decided to stop the trial at this point.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^9345b820]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The only subtype of potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment that was associated with the composite poor clinical outcome and CDI in our study was potentially suboptimal dose frequency. The risk of CDI was 2.42 times higher among those treated with a suboptimal dose frequency versus optimal treatment. Potentially suboptimal dose frequency was also associated with hospitalization/ED visits and all-cause mortality. In prior work, a dose-dependent increased risk of CDI has been observed, with increasing cumulative defined daily dose of antibiotics resulting in increasing risks of CDI. Our results suggest that dose frequency, in addition to drug choice and antibiotic duration, may also impact risk of CDI and other poor outcomes.

We found no difference in risk for UTI recurrence for residents treated with potentially suboptimal or optimal antibiotic treatment. Previous work has found that among women with UTI, longer courses of antibiotics may be associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI, possibly due to alterations in urogenital flora. However, among males with UTI treated in the outpatient setting, longer treatment duration was not associated with UTI recurrence, nor was antibiotic choice. Interestingly, for unclear reasons, among the subgroup of residents treated with initial beta-lactam therapy, suboptimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of UTI recurrence which requires further investigation.

It is possible that suboptimal initial treatment could lead to clinical failure, the consequences of which could be serious and may include bacteremia, urosepsis, acute care hospitalization, and potentially death. In our study, suboptimal treatment was not associated with mortality. It is possible that despite being suboptimal, an appropriate agent was ultimately used considering the susceptibility of the uropathogen causing the UTI. Three previous studies have similarly demonstrated that inappropriate empiric therapy for UTI was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Excessive treatment duration versus optimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of mortality. The optimal duration of treatment of males with UTI is largely unknown. In females, durations as short as 3 days are recommended for those with uncomplicated infection, but for males longer durations between 7 and 14 days are generally recommended. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal treatment duration in males to decrease the risk of treatment failure.

Table 3
Clinical and bacteriologic outcomes in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol population

Data presented as number (%), unless otherwise indicated. NA: not applicable

a Short-term efficacy: endpoints assessed at 10- to 18-days post-treatment visit

b Clinical cure: being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms through post-treatment visit with no additional antimicrobial therapy for a relapse of UTI prescribed

c Bacteriologic cure: elimination of study entry uropathogen or pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL (women) or < 10³ CFU/mL (men) combined with disappearance of leucocyturia

d Cumulative efficacy: endpoint assessed at 70- to 84-days post-treatment visit

Short-term clinical cure rates were analyzed in preset subgroups of patients. In women, short-term clinical cures for the 7- and 14-day arms were 47 of 50 (94%) versus 54 of 58 (93%), respectively. The difference in cure rate was 0.9% (90% CI, –6.9 to 8.7, P non-inferiority = 0.011, non-inferiority confirmed). In men, clinical cure rates differed significantly between those treated for 7 or 14 days (38 of 44; 86% vs. 40 of 41; 98%) (Fig. 2). The difference in cure rate was –11.2 (90% CI, –20.6 to –1.8, P non-inferiority = 0.417, P superiority 2-sided = 0.050, superiority of 14-days treatment confirmed). The large difference in risk differences for age was predominantly determined by men. Therefore, and for explorative reasons, an additional subgroup analysis was also performed within the group of men and women. The results are presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Figure S2, respectively. For stepdown treatment, bacteremia, and complicated UTI, the risk differences were similar between the subgroups and in all subgroups, non-inferiority was not shown.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^12901a19]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge the limitations of this retrospective cohort study. First, our study was not designed to assess causality, and there are important differences (known and unknown) between residents who received suboptimal and optimal antibiotic treatment. While we did adjust for confounders of suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes, our findings neither confirm nor deny a causal relationship, as our findings may be confounded by unmeasured factors which affect suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes. As such, while we found an association between suboptimal antibiotic treatment and poor clinical outcomes even after adjusting for several resident and CLC characteristics, this association may be impacted by residual confounding. Second, we defined UTI based on a urine culture and antibiotic treatment, per recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. While we excluded patients with other positive cultures and only included those exposed to common antibiotics recommended by national guidance or with reliable urinary concentrations, the antibiotic treatment captured may have been targeting another non-urinary tract infection type or asymptomatic bacteriuria. Additionally, we did not capture UTIs in which a urine culture was not obtained. Urine culturing practices are not standardized across VA CLCs, and some facilities may only recommend obtaining UTI cultures in certain clinical situations, such as recurrent infection. However, our population was mostly a complicated, male population, in which urine cultures would be generally recommended. Third, no established definitions for suboptimal antibiotic treatment of residents with UTI have been developed. There is no IDSA guidance for the treatment of complicated UTIs in males, so we based suboptimal treatment definitions on available guidelines for uncomplicated infection in females and expert opinion. Suboptimal antibiotic treatment is multifactorial and as such we considered three elements of suboptimal treatment (drug choice, dose frequency, and longer duration). However, other elements, such as drug strength and route of administration may also be suboptimal. Insufficient treatment duration is also a clinical problem. We excluded those treated for 2 days or less, but some residents may have still been exposed to insufficient treatment durations. Future research should continue to investigate and operationalize the definition of suboptimal antibiotic treatment among residents with UTI. Additionally, while we conducted analyses by subtype of suboptimal treatment, comparative analyses are warranted to determine which individual aspects of suboptimal antibiotic treatment (the drug choice, dose frequency, or longer than recommended duration) are the most strongly associated with poor outcomes. Forth, we measured all-cause hospitalizations, ED visits, and mortality. Our frail older resident population is already at risk for these events and many of the events observed may have not been related to antibiotic use. Alternatively, we likely underestimated antibiotic-related adverse events, as these events may not have been coded or other codes were used. Adverse events are difficult to identify in large databases as they are often not recorded in health claims and reports. Fifth, while we investigated five potential harms of suboptimal antibiotic use, we did not assess the development of colonization or infection with resistance, which is a well-known harm of antibiotic use. Finally, the generalizability of our findings conducted in a largely older male population may be limited to other non-VA long-term care populations.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^0ac166be]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^da14d4e8]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of older adults is increasing in virtually every country and will continue to grow over the coming decades. According to the 2018 Ageing Report, by 2050 older adults will represent 28% of the European Union citizens with an old-age dependency ratio of 55% of the working-age population. With an ageing and highly dependent society the burden of infectious diseases is expected to increase mainly due to a high prevalence of older people with comorbid conditions, long-term institutionalization, frailty and a weakened immune system. Infections in the older adults have specific characteristics that have to be recognised in order to provide an optimal care such as uncommon clinical presentations, high rates of organ failure and antimicrobial interactions together with an increased severity and risk of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO).

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common bacterial infections affecting geriatric patients and the main source of community acquired bacteremia. After pneumonia, UTI represent the second cause of hospital admission due to an infection in the older adults. Despite their high frequency, UTI are frequently overdiagnosed due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older populations which may lead to an incorrect diagnostic and unnecessary antimicrobial treatment in the presence of non-specific urinary symptoms. This increased exposure to antimicrobials is one of the main factors explaining the high prevalence of UTI due to MDRO in the older adults including those caused by extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae.

Women are more prone to experience UTI although rates tend to equalise in ageing males due to impaired normal voiding mainly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The main consequence of these voiding difficulties is the generation of a retrograde turbulent urine flow, enabling the ascension of uropathogens to the bladder and eventually into the prostate, which explains the high frequency of prostatic involvement in males with UTI. Therefore, most febrile UTI (FUTI) in males should be considered as acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) and treated using antimicrobials with an adequate prostatic diffusion such as fluoroquinolones (FQ). Increasing antimicrobial resistance rates hinder the eradication of the bacteria from the prostate thus becoming the source of recurrent UTI in males.

The majority of the studies that have analysed the characteristics of FUTI in older populations have focused on women. Therefore, we believe there is a knowledge gap regarding the characteristics of FUTI in older males. The objective of this study was to investigate the existence of differences in clinical features, microbiological data and risk of infection by MDRO between older and non-older men with FUTI.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^ed0ec4c3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Lower Limb Amputations: Across four empagliflozin outcome trials, lower limb amputation event rates were 4.3 and 5.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo group and the empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg dose group, respectively, with a HR of 1.05 (95% CI) (0.81, 1.36). In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial with empagliflozin, in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, and empagliflozin 10 mg treatment arms, respectively.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^88a3bce3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are characterized according to several schema and terminologies, which are relevant to their diagnostic work-up. Anatomically, lower UTIs are confined to the bladder (cystitis) and/or urethra, while upper UTIs involve ascension to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The latter are more commonly associated with both bacteremia (a condition defined microbiologically) and urosepsis (defined clinicopathologically), although they may occur with cystitis alone. UTIs may be further defined according to patient risk factors. Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) affects non-pregnant, immunocompetent females without structural/functional urinary tract abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. Notably, an explicit microbiologic diagnosis (i.e. urine culture) is not necessarily indicated for routine cases of uncomplicated cystitis, as empiric antimicrobial therapy is often appropriate. Complicated UTI (cUTI) is an umbrella term for infections arising in the context of risk factor(s) listed above for uUTI. Traditionally, a UTI in a male is inherently considered complicated (although this is controversial). Complicated infections secondary to catheterization are termed catheter associated UTIs. In terms of temporal dynamics, multiple episodes of symptomatic infection (two within 6 months or three within 1 year) with intervening periods of clinical resolution are recurrent UTIs. These may represent persistent infections by the same offending organism or reinfection by a different species/strain. Likewise, the term chronic UTI is applied loosely to either recurrent or unresolving infections. Finally, the concept of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) refers to recovery of a potential uropathogen at high burden (typically > 10⁵ CFU/mL) in the absence of symptomatology. Antimicrobial therapy is typically not indicated for ASB, except in certain populations at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g. renal transplant recipients and pregnant women, especially those undergoing invasive urologic procedures).

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^ed7a287c]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common however the widespread use of antibiotics has led to a rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) amongst uropathogens, rendering a significant proportion of infections resistant to first line treatment. AMR in UTIs may differentially affect men and women, younger and older patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate MDR (multi-drug resistance) and AMR in males and females in an Australian health district.

Methods

There were 85,844 E. coli urinary isolates (2007–2020) analysed from adult patients. An E. coli isolate with MDR was defined as resistant to at least 1 agent in ≥ 3 antimicrobial classes. Chi-square tests and relative risk were calculated by comparing resistance in males and females and by age for antibiotics commonly used to treat UTIs in hospital and community collected samples.

Results

There was a higher proportion of MDR E. coli in males compared to females in both the community (6.4% vs. 5.2%, P < 0.001) and hospital datasets (16.5% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001). The proportions of MDR for both males and females were significantly higher in the hospital setting. Resistance rates were higher in males compared to females for amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalexin and norfloxacin (p < 0.005), though not for trimethoprim. Antibiotic resistance was seen to increase over time.

Conclusions

A higher proportion of MDR E. coli were noted in urine samples from males compared with females, possibly due to the increased likelihood of prior treatment for UTIs in men. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions could be targeted towards this cohort to address increasing rates of AMR.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^4f91305f]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility trends for urinary isolates in the veteran population [^2400c439]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance on empiric treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is lacking for the male population which comprises much of the Veteran population in the United States. This study evaluated susceptibility trends in antimicrobials used for treatment of UTIs in the inpatient and outpatient Veteran population nationwide.

Methods

Urine culture data was retrospectively obtained from Corporate Data Warehouse. All urine cultures from Veteran Health Administration patients 18 years of age or older who were treated at any VA health care center in the years 2009 and 2018 were eligible. Antibiograms were constructed for bacterial isolate susceptibility.

Results

In 2009 and 2018 isolates from 54,788 and 58,983 Veterans were analyzed, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria isolated. For ceftriaxone, E coli susceptibilities were relatively high but trended downward from 2009 to 2018. Common urinary pathogen susceptibilities remained low for fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Discussion

Empiric therapy for Veterans with UTIs should be based on local susceptibility patterns as previously recommended first-line agents have fallen out of favor due to increasing resistance rates.

Conclusions

Both inpatient and outpatient stewardship is needed to ensure appropriate treatment, as viable treatment options for UTIs are becoming increasingly limited.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^3bbce08e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Blood cultures were obtained in 339 patients, of which 80 (24%) had bacteremia with growth of E. coli in the majority of the cases (n = 67, 84%).

Both treatment regimens resulted in a high clinical cure rate at short-term follow-up in the ITT population (90% vs. 95% in patients treated for 7 or 14 days, respectively) (Table 3). The difference in short-term clinical cure rate between both treatment arms was 4.5% (90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7, P non-inferiority = 0.072). Accordingly, the criteria for non-inferiority were not met as the 90% CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The median time to defervescence did not differ between the two groups: 2 (IQR, 1–2) days in 7-day antimicrobial treatment, 2 (IQR, 1–3) days in 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Short-term clinical cure was 85% in non-randomized patients, whereas median time to defervescence amounted to 2 (IQR, 1–3) days. Among all analysis performed, there were no significant differences between ITT and PP analysis. Therefore, within the following, only outcomes of ITT analysis are presented.

There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^3de602e7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7.5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5.3 days [IQR 4.8 to 6.5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10.0 days [10.0 to 10.0]). Median age was 1.5 years (IQR 0.7 to 5.4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5.3 percentage points, one-sided 97.5% CI -∞ to 11.1, p non_inferiority = 0.24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6.0 (IQR 5.3 to 7.5) in the individualised group and 10.0 (10.0 to 10.0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4.0 days [97.5% CI -4.5 to -3.7], p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6.8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11.1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47 to 0.80], p = 0.0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0.9 percentage points [95% CI -4.6 to 6.5], p = 0.79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5.3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^2aca5aa2]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^7674ffaa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### Empagliflozin and linagliptin (Glyxambi) [^a95f8383]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^0845abca]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^bd248e36]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### Research agenda for antibiotic stewardship within the veterans' health administration, 2024–2028 [^17becd41]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic use is the strongest risk factor for the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, a global public health crisis. Mitigating this crisis must include efforts to measure and improve how antibiotics are being used in a variety of healthcare settings as well as in animals and agriculture. These types of improvement efforts are broadly described as antibiotic stewardship.

Approximately one-third of all antibiotic use occurs in human medicine; an estimated 30% of this human use is unnecessary. - Among antibiotic use that is warranted, a substantial proportion has suboptimal antibiotic selection, dosing, or duration. To improve antibiotic prescribing, antibiotic stewardship programs are now mandated for all hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient centers in the United States that are accredited by The Joint Commission or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Before these mandates went into effect, the Veterans' Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, published a directive that required its medical centers to develop antibiotic stewardship programs. The VA National Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force, established in 2011, continues to provide tools and resources that support effective antibiotic stewardship. The VA is a leader in stewardship implementation and stewardship-related research, with inherent advantages that include a motivated and engaged stewardship community, a robust health services research infrastructure, national-level organization of research, and the ability to synthesize and analyze national-level data through a central data repository, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.

Since the publication of our last VA research agenda in 2018, VA researchers have informed the practice of antibiotic stewardship on a wide variety of topics, including the frequency of antibiotic-related harms, novel metrics for evaluating a hospital's antibiotic use, clinical data on the optimal treatment of male urinary tract infections (UTIs), diagnostic stewardship of urine cultures, the diagnostic accuracy of hospital antibiograms in predicting the risk of antibiotic resistance, and approaches for providing more effective feedback to outpatient clinicians on their antibiotic-prescribing. - To encourage further innovative and impactful research within VA and to support the national effort to improve antibiotic prescribing, we herein describe important knowledge gaps about the optimal use of antibiotics and the effective use of antibiotic stewardship strategies. The aim of this expert summary document is to provide a roadmap for the next 5 years of antibiotic stewardship investigations within and outside the VA.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^85c92aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^9e504cdb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; P = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^72c55c45]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^672857be]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions.

Objectives

Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations?Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I(2) = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all-cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^8e39dc10]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults — "Don't use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present". ASB prevalence increases with age: in community women age 65 to 90 it ranges from 6% to 16%, is highest in women age 90 and older at 22% to 43%, and in community men age 65 and older it ranges from 5% to 21%, with the highest prevalence in those age 90 and older; in institutionalized elderly, 25% to 50% of women and 15% to 35% of men have ASB. Antimicrobial therapy for ASB has no short- or long-term benefits for mortality, genitourinary symptoms, or subsequent symptomatic episodes and in acute-care settings causes adverse drug reactions and re-infection with more-resistant organisms; although in long-term-care facilities individuals with bacteriuria are at greater risk of symptomatic infection, this is not attributable to bacteriuria. Identifying symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in frail or cognitively impaired elderly is often challenging, and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America has published proposed criteria for initiation of antibiotics and surveillance definitions for nursing homes. For older adults with ASB undergoing traumatic genitourinary procedures with mucosal bleeding, antimicrobial treatment is supported in men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended before urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated.

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^fe64ff12]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections and reason for urological referral. Women are at a greater risk of UTIs than men and the risk increases with age. In men, UTIs are associated with increasing age and underlying urinary tract disorders such as benign prostatic hypertrophy. In both men and women, the most common uropathogen causing UTIs is Escherichia coli, responsible for over half of urinary tract infections. Antibiotic treatment failure can result in urinary sepsis, renal abscesses and impairment of renal function.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multi-drug resistance (MDR) E. coli are a major threat to public health outcomes due to limited treatment options. Whilst AMR is a naturally occurring phenomenon in bacteria, resistance accelerates when antimicrobials are misused or overused. Almost 50% of prescribed antimicrobials to patients may be unwarranted. It is recognised that the E. coli antimicrobial resistance levels are on the rise. E. coli gain resistance through horizontal gene transfer. The common mechanisms involve genes that code for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), as well as mobile genetic elements such as integrons, transposons and conjugative plasmids. Amoxicillin resistance is common in E. coli and frequently conferred by the TEM-1/TEM-2 β-lactamase; because of the high level of resistance, amoxicillin is not recommended as empiric therapy for UTI. For trimethoprim and fluoroquinolones, resistance through mutations in dfrA and qnr genes respectively are often co-located with ESBLs.

Limited literature exists on the comparisons of AMR between males and females. To the best of our knowledge, no literature exists in Australia. The rising rates of MDR E. coli pose significant risks for treatment failures and complications, necessitating an urgent examination of resistance patterns in different populations. We previously demonstrated increasing rates of resistance in community and hospital settings. Using these databases, we compared urinary E. coli MDR rates between men and women in the region of the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) of New South Wales, Australia. Secondary aims included examining differences in AMR based on age, and on community and hospital laboratory settings.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^16b6bc0f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^5b3f0c5f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^0a782cee]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in the older patient population, and Escherichia coli is the most common uropathogen in community dwelling people older than 65 years. The spectrum of UTI ranges from a mild self limiting illness to severe sepsis, with a mortality rate of 20–40%. The incidence of sepsis and its associated mortality increases disproportionately with age, and UTI in men is more likely to be severe. Both sexes develop UTI in old age, with a female to male ratio of 2:1 in patients older than 70 years, compared with the overwhelming UTI susceptibility of females in younger populations, with a 50:1 ratio. The diagnosis of UTI in older patients can be problematic, as these patients are less likely to present with a typical clinical history and localised urinary symptoms compared with younger patients. The rising incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults is also contributing to further diagnostic difficulty (> 20% of women aged ≥ 65 years compared with < 5% in younger women), which results in probable over-diagnosis of UTI and unnecessary treatment.

UTI is the second most common diagnosis for which empirical antibiotics are prescribed in both primary and secondary care, with more than 50% of the antibiotics prescribed for a suspected UTI in older adults being considered unnecessary. With the spread of antibiotic resistance and its increasing threat to public health (about 30% of urinary isolates of E coli are now resistant to trimethoprim), national guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship programmes have been proposed to combat these challenges.NHS England, for example, released the Quality Premium to incentivise Clinical Commissioning Groups to reduce antibiotic use in primary care. As a result of these new initiatives, a substantial decrease in antibiotic use has been reported for the first time in England across the whole healthcare system between 2013 and 2017. A recent study has also shown a decrease in prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics for UTI in older people in primary care between 2004 and 2014. In the meantime, however, increases in the incidence of Gram negative bloodstream infections have been reported, which has led the UK government to announce a plan to reduce healthcare associated Gram negative bloodstream infections in England by 50% by March 2021.

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^6bbfaf89]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Indications and techniques for imaging urinary tract infections

Uncomplicated UTIs, particularly those commonly occurring in otherwise healthy young women, generally do not require further investigation apart from laboratory and microbiological studies. Conversely, nowadays, imaging is generally warranted in patients with recurrent infections or C-UTI and in those who do not respond to antibiotic therapy. The key aims of imaging in urinary infections and urosepsis are a) confirmation of urological cause, b) detection of obstruction and abscesses requiring interventional or surgical treatment, and c) detection of urolithiasis and retained foreign bodies such as catheters.

Role of ultrasound

Non-invasive, inexpensive and repeatable, ultrasound is the mainstay first-line investigation, providing a rapid overview of the entire urinary tract, with successful detection of urinary obstruction and most abnormal collections. The initial diagnostic assessment of C-UTIs affecting the lower urinary and male genital tract should rely on transabdominal urinary tract sonography. Colour Doppler ultrasound (CD-US) with high-resolution linear probes is warranted when symptoms and physical signs suggest involvement of the scrotum and perineum. Furthermore, if allowed by local pain and tenderness, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) may offer rapid assessment for the presence of abnormal masses or collections in the prostate and seminal vesicles. Finally, sonography often allows for an easier, non-invasive post-treatment follow-up of abnormalities detected at cross-sectional imaging.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^b5d78ea0]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding directed antimicrobial therapy, as prostatic involvement in males with FUTI is common, FQ have been considered the first therapeutic choice due to their high degree of prostatic penetration. The use of FQ is limited due to high resistant rates and the risk of severe adverse events related to its use, including aortic aneurysms. Co-trimoxazol is an alternative but again high resistance rates and the risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia in older adults hampers its use. Fosfomycine has emerged as an additional option for directed therapy as it achieves reasonable intraprostatic concentrations and it is active against most MDRO including ESBL strains. Regarding the duration of antimicrobial treatment in males with FUTI, very few studies have analysed this topic. Ulleryd et al. showed that 14 day was not inferior to 28 day treatment while more recently van Niewkoop et al. demonstrated that 7 days was less efective than 14 day treatment in males with FUTI. In our study, older and non-older patients received slightly more than 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy.

Management of IUC in FUTI is also important, particularly in older patients who are frequently catheterized. IDSA guidelines recommend replacing a long-term IUC to hasten the resolution of symptoms in catheter-associated UTI. This recommendation has recently been questioned in a study by Babich et al. in which the authors found no clinical benefit from replacing a long-term IUC at the onset of a catheter-associated UTI. In a later editorial letter, the authors were questioned about the IDSA guidance to obtain a urine culture from a freshly placed catheter as a sample from a long-term IUC might not reflect the status of the infection in the bladder. The authors replied that in 97% of cases of bacteremia the same species was isolated from the urine while recognizing the need for further research with randomized controlled trials.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for adult urinary tract infections within emergency department and urgent care settings [^40f2f18f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are frequently prescribed for treatment of UTI in the outpatient setting; however, data evaluating prescribing patterns after FDA safety warnings is limited, especially in UC. The study goal was to investigate and compare antimicrobial prescribing for UTIs in a single-site ED and an off-site UC in an urban, academic health system. This retrospective study included patients presenting with a UTI to the ED or UC between January and June 2018. Those 18 years or older with uncomplicated, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis were included. Exclusion criteria were catheter-related UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised, or hospitalization. Primary outcome was FQ prescribing rate for all UTI in the ED and UC. Secondary outcomes were rates of non-FQ prescribing, re-presentation, bug-drug mismatch, and treatment durations. 184 patients were included. FQ prescribing rate was similar in ED and UC (21.2% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.4). Non-FQs prescribed in ED and UC were nitrofurantoin (20.2% vs 53.6%), beta-lactams (46.1% vs 22.6%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5% vs. 5%). A longer than recommended duration was identified in 46.3% UC patients compared to 21.2% ED patients. Thirty-day re-presentation with persistent UTI symptoms occurred more frequently in the ED compared to UC (13.5% vs. 7.5%). Predictors of FQ prescribing on logistic regression were male, recurrent UTI, and malignancy. FQ prescribing rate for UTI treatment was low with no difference between ED and UC. Opportunity exists to improve treatment duration and antimicrobial choice.

### Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in the post-antibiotic era: select non-antibiotic approaches [^7806f6ca]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the high frequency of patients presenting with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and the ensuing high degree of antibiotic prescription, UTI is a critical point of intervention for non-antibiotic treatments to curb the further development of antimicrobial resistance and provide risk-appropriate care for patients.

Objectives

To highlight several select non-antibiotic therapies for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI and relevant indications (prevention and complicated UTI) from recent literature.

Sources

PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for clinical trials published in the English language corresponding to non-antibiotic treatments for UTI.

Content

The focus of this narrative review centres on a limited number of non-antibiotic therapies for the treatment of UTI based on (a) herbal extracts or (b) antibacterial strategies (e.g. bacteriophage therapy and D-mannose). The experience of treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also used to fuel discussion on the risk of developing pyelonephritis without antibiotics-compared with the projected harms of continuing their widespread use.

Implications

Non-antibiotic treatment strategies for UTI have shown varying results in clinical trials, and the current evidence does not yet indicate a clear, better alternative to antibiotics. However, the collective experience with non-antibiotic treatments suggests that there is a need to weigh the actual benefits/risks of unfettered, non-culture-confirmed antibiotic use in uncomplicated UTI. Given the different mechanisms of action of proposed alternatives, more in-depth knowledge on microbiological and pathophysiological factors influencing UTI susceptibility and prognostic indicators are highly needed to stratify patients most likely to benefit. The feasibility of alternatives in clinical practice should also be considered.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^546d4847]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes — In patients with diabetes, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Remarks: The recommendation for nontreatment of men is inferred from observations in studies which have primarily enrolled women. In a randomized trial, antimicrobial treatment of ASB did not lead to a difference in rates of symptomatic UTI (40% vs 42% over the entire study period), and rates of pyelonephritis were not significantly different between antimicrobial and placebo groups (0.13 vs 0.28 per 100 patient-days; RR, 2.13 [95% CI, .81–5.62]); during the 6-week blinded portion, pyelonephritis was numerically higher with antimicrobials (8% vs 2%). Treatment-related adverse effects were more common with antimicrobials (18% vs 6%), and treated subjects received nearly 5 times more days of antimicrobial therapy; in prospective cohorts there were no between-group differences in symptomatic UTI, diabetic complications, or mortality, men with diabetes were included in only 1 cohort study with similar outcomes, and there is high-quality evidence that antimicrobials increase the risk of adverse effects.

Follow-up evaluation — Clinicians should not perform a post-treatment test of cure urinalysis or urine culture in asymptomatic patients (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should repeat urine cultures to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy (Expert Opinion). For patients with persistent UTI symptoms after microbiological cure, clinicians should evaluate for alternative causes to patient symptoms (Expert Opinion).
