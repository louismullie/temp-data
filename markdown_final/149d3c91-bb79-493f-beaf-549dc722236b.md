## Question

What is the appropriate workup for elevated parathyroid hormone with low vitamin D?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate workup for elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the setting of low vitamin D. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical assessment elements and risk factors that frame pretest probability. Then, I should confirm the core laboratory panel that distinguishes secondary from primary hyperparathyroidism and CKD-related mineral bone disorder. Next, I will interpret common result patterns and outline a careful vitamin D repletion strategy with monitoring. After that, I need to plan follow-up decision points and thresholds that trigger a primary hyperparathyroidism workup. Finally, I should consider special populations (CKD, frail/elderly, perioperative), formulation choices (D2 vs D3 vs calcifediol), and safety monitoring, before summarizing the unifying algorithmic principle to replete vitamin D first and re-evaluate PTH dynamics afterward [^114tvLJq] [^1144Ymwq] [^116feLqL] [^113XzAhL] [^111DWHjG].

> Let me first confirm the initial clinical assessment I must perform before ordering tests; I need to review risk factors for vitamin D deficiency (limited sun exposure, darker skin, obesity, malabsorption including post-bariatric states, CKD, liver disease, anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, older age, pregnancy), query bone pain, proximal muscle weakness, fractures, and any nephrolithiasis or polyuria/polydipsia that might suggest hypercalcemia, while also checking the medication list for thiazides, lithium, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and eliciting family history of hyperparathyroidism or MEN, because these features frame whether I am dealing with likely secondary hyperparathyroidism or potentially masked primary disease [^114tvLJq] [^1144Ymwq] [^116feLqL] [^113qUrfH].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline laboratory panel; I need to ensure I am ordering the right tests the first time: serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D as the primary marker of vitamin D status, an intact PTH using a reliable assay, albumin-adjusted total calcium or ionized calcium to anchor the differential, phosphorus, creatinine with eGFR to stage renal function, and magnesium given its role in PTH secretion and action; I should add 24-hour urine calcium if hypercalciuria or FHH is in the differential, alkaline phosphatase to gauge bone turnover, and reserve 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D for select scenarios since it can be high in primary hyperparathyroidism despite low 25(OH)D but is not a screening test, and I will consider thyroid testing only if symptoms point toward hyperthyroidism as an alternate contributor to bone loss or calcium dysregulation; hold on, I almost reflexively ordered 1,25(OH)2D for everyone, but I should not, because 25(OH)D is the correct index of vitamin D stores in this context [^1144Ymwq] [^112bosT7] [^116feLqL] [^114tvLJq] [^114AWxhq] [^111xr5n3] [^112y4k9e].

> I will now examine the likely interpretation patterns; if 25(OH)D is low with elevated PTH and calcium is normal or low-normal, that fits secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency, whereas low 25(OH)D with elevated PTH and hypercalcemia raises concern for primary hyperparathyroidism with coexisting deficiency in which the deficiency can blunt or initially mask the hypercalcemia; I should correct vitamin D cautiously and monitor serum calcium every 2–4 weeks to see if hypercalcemia declares itself, and if eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² with high PTH and low 25(OH)D, then I am likely dealing with CKD-mineral and bone disorder where targets and treatments differ; if 25(OH)D is sufficient yet PTH is elevated with normal calcium, I must consider normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism after excluding secondary causes; but wait, what if PTH is not elevated despite low 25(OH)D in a frail or bedridden older adult — there can be a blunted PTH response, so I should not exclude deficiency on that basis alone [^116feLqL] [^112acwJn] [^117NCNWB] [^112bosT7] [^113QuJQK] [^116k5JF9] [^113hWo3k].

> Next, I should review vitamin D repletion; I need to define deficiency as 25(OH)D below 20 ng/mL and insufficiency as 20–30 ng/mL, then choose a repletion strategy such as 50,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for 8 weeks or approximately 6,000 IU daily followed by maintenance 1,500–2,000 IU daily, with higher initial and maintenance doses in obesity, malabsorption, or accelerated catabolism, because under-dosing will impede PTH normalization; let me confirm formulation preferences — D3 generally raises 25(OH)D more effectively than D2, and calcifediol can be considered if faster repletion or malabsorption is an issue; I should recheck 25(OH)D and PTH after about 8–12 weeks, and monitor serum calcium by 4 weeks and then every 8–12 weeks, especially if I suspected primary hyperparathyroidism; target-wise, at minimum I must get above 20 ng/mL as per IOM consensus, but for PTH suppression a practical clinical target is often above 30–40 ng/mL, recognizing that some data show a plateau and others show continued incremental PTH suppression without a discrete inflection point [^1144Ymwq] [^115rP1Fz] [^116J3h4r] [^112diNkt] [^114dqZii] [^114FEWuH] [^1128upyg] [^111x32aB] [^113XzAhL].

> I need to ensure the follow-up logic is explicit; if PTH normalizes with vitamin D above 30 ng/mL and calcium remains normal, I can conclude secondary hyperparathyroidism has resolved and continue maintenance with periodic reassessment; if PTH decreases but stays above normal despite 25(OH)D at goal, I should first confirm adherence and consider raising 25(OH)D toward the upper sufficiency range before proceeding; if PTH remains essentially unchanged with adequate vitamin D, I should re-evaluate for primary hyperparathyroidism or other causes of autonomous PTH secretion; and if calcium rises during repletion, I must suspect unmasked primary hyperparathyroidism, pause vitamin D, and pivot to a primary hyperparathyroidism workup rather than push supplementation further [^113XzAhL] [^114dqZii] [^112acwJn].

> Hold on, I should verify the thresholds that trigger a deeper workup; persistent PTH elevation above the upper limit of normal for more than three months despite 25(OH)D over 30 ng/mL, any emergence of hypercalcemia during repletion, or clinical clues such as nephrolithiasis or fragility fractures warrant additional evaluation that includes confirming hypercalcemia with both albumin-adjusted and ionized calcium, obtaining a 24-hour urine calcium to help distinguish familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism, assessing bone mineral density — with attention to distal one-third radius for cortical bone — in addition to standard hip and spine sites, and reserving parathyroid imaging until after biochemical confirmation; I should also re-check magnesium and review for hypervitaminosis A or medications that might confound calcium/PTH physiology, and at this point referral to endocrinology or endocrine surgery is appropriate if primary hyperparathyroidism is likely [^113XzAhL] [^117NCNWB] [^116feLqL] [^114AWxhq] [^111xr5n3].

> Let me consider special populations systematically; in CKD stages 3–5, PTH targets differ and therapy often shifts from parent vitamin D to active vitamin D analogs, with careful monitoring of calcium, phosphorus, and the calcium–phosphate product to avoid adynamic bone disease and extraosseous calcification, so I should not apply non-CKD PTH goals here; conversely, in primary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D can usually be repleted safely at the lower end of dosing with close calcium monitoring, and preoperative repletion helps mitigate hungry bone syndrome after parathyroidectomy; I should also remember that frail, immobilized, or institutionalized older adults may have a blunted PTH response to deficiency, in whom empiric repletion is reasonable when risk is high despite a "normal" PTH [^112bosT7] [^114qfj9J] [^116feLqL] [^114FEWuH] [^117NCNWB] [^111xKeoN] [^114N1rPP] [^113hWo3k].

> I should double-check formulation nuances and kinetics because they can affect early decision points; trials suggest D3 is more potent than D2 for raising total and free 25(OH)D, and calcifediol can raise concentrations more rapidly across diverse populations, with early changes in free 25(OH)D correlating with short-term PTH suppression; however, even with higher monthly doses that lower PTH more, we may not see BMD gains over 12 months, so I should avoid overpromising skeletal benefits beyond fracture-informed, calcium-adequate regimens in deficient patients [^116J3h4r] [^112diNkt] [^117JcNCy] [^114dqZii].

> But wait, what about the debated "optimal" 25(OH)D threshold for PTH suppression; some large datasets show a continuum without a clear asymptote, while others suggest plateaus around 30–35 ng/mL depending on exclusions, so practically I aim above 30 ng/mL when using PTH normalization as a therapeutic biomarker, recognizing that individual variability and comorbid CKD can shift the PTH–vitamin D curve, and thus I should contextualize any residual PTH elevation rather than apply a rigid cutoff [^113XzAhL] [^111x32aB] [^1128upyg].

> In summary, I need to ensure the algorithmic principle stays front-and-center: evaluate clinical risk and confounders, obtain a focused biochemical panel anchored by 25(OH)D, calcium, PTH, phosphorus, and renal function, replete vitamin D first to at least sufficiency while monitoring calcium, and then re-evaluate PTH to decide whether I am dealing with remitted secondary hyperparathyroidism or persistent elevation suggesting autonomous parathyroid function that warrants a primary hyperparathyroidism workup; hold on, let me verify that this aligns with consensus — yes, multiple guideline and large-cohort analyses reinforce testing for and correcting vitamin D deficiency before labeling primary disease, with subsequent action driven by the post-repletion biochemical phenotype [^114tvLJq] [^1144Ymwq] [^113XzAhL] [^111DWHjG] [^116feLqL].

---

High PTH with low vitamin D most often reflects **secondary hyperparathyroidism** [^116feLqL] from vitamin D deficiency, with PTH rising as 25(OH)D falls below ~20 ng/mL [^113BKRso] and plateauing near 30 ng/mL [^111x32aB]. This compensatory PTH increase helps maintain normocalcemia but accelerates bone resorption, raising fracture risk [^1165kh6X] [^111BX27M]. Management is to **replete vitamin D to ≥ 30 ng/mL** [^114tvLJq], monitor calcium and PTH, and address causes such as malabsorption, CKD [^114qfj9J], or medications [^1144Ymwq]. Persistent PTH elevation after correction of vitamin D suggests primary hyperparathyroidism [^111xKeoN] or other pathology and warrants further evaluation [^114FEWuH].

---

## Physiological relationship between vitamin D and PTH

- **Vitamin D metabolism**: Vitamin D is converted in the liver to 25(OH)D, then in the kidney to 1,25(OH)2D [^111Mq8q3], which increases intestinal calcium absorption and suppresses PTH [^114qfj9J].

- **PTH regulation**: PTH rises when calcium is low or vitamin D is insufficient [^116feLqL], stimulating bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and 1,25(OH)2D production [^114qfj9J] to restore calcium.

- **Inverse relationship**: PTH rises as 25(OH)D falls [^111x32aB], with a threshold around 20 ng/mL and a plateau near 30 ng/mL.

---

## Clinical significance of high PTH and low vitamin D

The most common cause is **secondary hyperparathyroidism** [^1144Ymwq] from vitamin D deficiency, characterized by elevated PTH despite normal or low-normal calcium [^116feLqL]. Elevated PTH increases bone resorption, lowers BMD, and **increases fracture risk** [^1165kh6X] [^111BX27M]. High PTH is associated with cardiovascular risk, metabolic syndrome [^113s2aEd], and mortality [^111YQd6C], especially in CKD and diabetes.

---

## Common causes of high PTH and low vitamin D

| **Cause** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Vitamin D deficiency | Reduced sun exposure, poor intake, malabsorption, obesity, CKD [^114tvLJq] [^1144Ymwq] |
| Chronic kidney disease | Impaired 1,25(OH)2D synthesis, phosphate retention, secondary hyperparathyroidism [^114qfj9J] [^112bosT7] |
| Malabsorption syndromes | Reduced absorption of vitamin D and calcium (e.g. celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery) [^114tvLJq] |
| Medications | Glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, calcimimetics, vitamin D analogs |
| Primary hyperparathyroidism | Parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia causing elevated PTH; vitamin D deficiency may coexist [^114N1rPP] [^1135x1et] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Laboratory tests**: Measure serum calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH, renal function, and urinary calcium excretion [^114tvLJq].

- **Imaging studies**: Consider DXA for BMD, renal ultrasound for nephrolithiasis, and parathyroid imaging if primary hyperparathyroidism is suspected.

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and underlying conditions (e.g. CKD, malabsorption) [^113qUrfH].

---

## Management strategies

- **Vitamin D supplementation**: Replete to ≥ 30 ng/mL [^1144Ymwq]; typical regimens include 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks, then 1,000–2,000 IU daily [^114tvLJq].

- **Calcium supplementation**: Ensure adequate intake (1,000–1,200 mg/day) to support bone health and reduce PTH [^1128upyg].

- **Address underlying causes**: Treat malabsorption, manage CKD [^114qfj9J], adjust medications, and consider parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^111xKeoN].

- **Monitoring**: Recheck calcium, phosphate, PTH, and 25(OH)D every 3–6 months to guide therapy and prevent complications [^114tvLJq].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Elevated PTH with low vitamin D increases bone resorption, lowers BMD [^1165kh6X], and raises **fracture risk** [^111BX27M]. It is also associated with hypertension, vascular calcification [^112bosT7], and cardiovascular events, and correlates with **higher all-cause mortality**, particularly in CKD and diabetes [^111YQd6C] [^113R4nWd].

---

High PTH with low vitamin D most often reflects secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency; **correcting vitamin D** [^1144Ymwq] and addressing causes usually normalizes PTH and improves bone and metabolic outcomes. Persistent PTH elevation after vitamin D repletion suggests primary hyperparathyroidism or other pathology and **requires further evaluation** [^111xKeoN].

### The relationship between serum 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone levels [^111x32aB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Low 25(OH)D levels are associated with increased parathyroid hormone levels, leading to progressive bone loss. The serum levels of 25(OH)D sufficient to keep the parathyroid hormone level at a range that will prevent bone loss are still unclear. The study aimed to evaluate the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and concomitant parathyroid hormone levels.

- **Methods**: The computerized laboratory database of Clalit Health Services, a not-for-profit health maintenance organization covering more than half of the Israeli population, was searched for all 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone tests performed in 2009. Concomitant tests of parathyroid hormone and 25(OH)D were identified in 19,172 people.

- **Results**: Serum parathyroid hormone levels were inversely correlated with 25(OH)D levels (r = -0.176, P < .001); 25(OH)D levels less than 50 nmol/L were associated with a steep increase in parathyroid hormone levels and hyperparathyroidism, which decreased with increasing 25(OH)D levels and reached a plateau at 25(OH)D levels of 75 to 85 nmol/L. The quadratic fit with plateau model showed that parathyroid hormone stabilizes at 25(OH)D level of 78.9 nmol/L. However, after excluding 5,449 people with hypercalcemia or renal failure, the parathyroid hormone plateau was attained at a significantly lower 25(OH)D cut point of 46.2 nmol/L.

- **Conclusion**: Our data suggest that a 25(OH)D threshold of 50 nmol/L is sufficient for parathyroid hormone suppression and prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in persons with normal renal function.

### Effects of age and serum 25-OH-vitamin D on serum parathyroid hormone levels [^113XzAhL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Several studies define optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels based on serum PTH levels reaching an asymptote; however, results differ widely, ranging from 25-OHD levels of 12–44 ng/ml, and many studies are constrained by small sample sizes.

The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between serum PTH and 25-OHD levels and age in a very large reference laboratory database. This was a detailed cross-sectional analysis of 312,962 paired serum PTH and 25-OHD levels measured from July 2010 to June 2011.

- **Results**: Median PTH levels and the proportion of patients (PTH > 65 pg/ml), from 63 successive 25-OHD frequency classes of 5000 patients, provide smooth, exceptionally well-fitted curves (R² = 0.994 and R² = 0.995, respectively) without discernible inflection points or asymptotes but with striking age dependencies. Serum 25-OHD was below the recent Institute of Medicine sufficiency guidance of 20 ng/ml in 27% (85,000) of the subjects. More importantly, 40% and 51% of subjects had serum 25-OHD levels significantly affecting PTH levels, with serum levels below 65 pg/ml.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis, despite inevitable inherent limitations, introduces several clinical implications. First, median 25-OHD-dependent PTH levels revealed no threshold above which increasing 25-OHD fails to further suppress PTH. Second, the large number of subjects with 25-OHD deficiency and hyperparathyroidism reinforces the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism's recommendations to test for, and replete, vitamin D.

### Parathyroid disorders [^116feLqL]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. Parathyroid hormone, which is released by the parathyroid glands primarily in response to low calcium levels, stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and serum calcium elevation, reduces renal calcium clearance, and stimulates intestinal calcium absorption through the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, in which calcium levels are elevated without appropriate suppression of parathyroid hormone levels, is the most common cause of hypercalcemia and is often managed surgically. Indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism include the presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m², nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by alterations in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D regulation that result in elevated parathyroid hormone levels. It most commonly occurs with chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, and less commonly with gastrointestinal conditions that impair calcium absorption. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be managed with calcium and vitamin D replacement and reduction of high phosphate levels. There is limited evidence for the use of calcimimetics and vitamin D analogues for persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the risk of hip and nonspine fractures in older men [^111BX27M]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Low circulating vitamin D has been shown to affect bone strength. Vitamin D deficiency in milder forms can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism and subsequently faster rates of bone turnover and bone loss. Positive relationships have been observed between serum 25(OH)D and BMD. Adjustment for BMD attenuated the association between total 25(OH)D and hip fracture such that the overall trend was borderline significant. Adjustment for BMD completely attenuated the relationship between vitamin D3 level and hip fracture. This suggests that the association between low vitamin D level and increased hip fracture risk is at least in part due to lower hip BMD among the men with low vitamin D levels.

This result differs from the NHANES III study, where the relationship between 25(OH)D and hip fracture was independent of BMD. Low BMD is associated with an increased risk of all nonspine fractures, and if BMD is the mediator, it is somewhat surprising that there was no relationship between 25(OH)D and nonspine fracture. The relationship between BMD and nonspine fracture is, however, weaker than for hip fracture. Further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism underlying the association of 25(OH)D and hip fracture. In particular, future studies should include markers of bone turnover. In women, we observed that high bone resorption may be an important mechanism for the association between low 25(OH)D and hip fracture.

The optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration needed to maintain bone health has not been established. Optimal concentrations have been defined as those at which serum parathyroid hormone levels are minimized.

### From vitamin D to hormone D: Fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system essential for good health [^111Mq8q3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

New knowledge of the biological and clinical importance of the steroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and its receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has resulted in significant contributions to good bone health. However, worldwide reports have highlighted a variety of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency diseases. Despite many publications and scientific meetings reporting advances in vitamin D science, a disturbing realization is growing that the newer scientific and clinical knowledge is not being translated into better human health.

Over the past several decades, the biological sphere of influence of vitamin D(3), as defined by the tissue distribution of the VDR, has broadened at least nine-fold from the target organs required for calcium homeostasis (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid). Now, research has shown that the pluripotent steroid hormone 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) initiates the physiologic responses of more than 36 cell types that possess the VDR. In addition to the kidney's endocrine production of circulating 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), researchers have found a paracrine production of this steroid hormone in over ten extrarenal organs.

This article identifies the fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system, including its potential for contributions to good health in five physiologic arenas in which investigators have clearly documented new biological actions of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) through the VDR. As a consequence, the nutritional guidelines for vitamin D(3) intake (defined by serum hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations) should be reevaluated.

### Use and indication of vitamin D and vitamin D analogues in patients with renal bone disease [^112bosT7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and treatment of renal bone disease. Vitamin D levels decline in the early phase of renal failure; however, through a compensatory mechanism, parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3), calcitriol) to return it to normal circulating concentrations. Nevertheless, resistance to calcitriol is observed and may be related to the decreased presence of the heterodimeric, DNA-binding partner for the vitamin D receptor protein.

In end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the circulating levels of calcitriol are invariably low. The indications of vitamin D therapy are the replacement of the missing hormone versus suppression of hyperparathyroidism (HPT), requiring daily low-dose oral versus intermittent 'pulse' or oral administration. However, this therapy must be accompanied by careful patient monitoring to avoid hypercalcemia and low bone turnover. Low bone turnover is not merely a histologic entity but a clinical condition associated with a high risk of extraosseous calcifications, particularly in the cardiovascular system, leading to increased morbidity. Thus, the determination of bone turnover in patients with ESKD is essential.

Bone biopsy is the gold standard to assess bone turnover; however, it is not always available, and nephrologists rely on PTH levels. The intact PTH assay measures PTH(1–84) and large C-PTH fragments, which may antagonize the PTH(1–84) effects on bone. An assay that measures exclusively PTH(1–84) has recently become available, and a calculated PTH(1–84)/C-PTH fragment ratio is now possible.

### Relationship between serum parathyroid hormone levels, vitamin D sufficiency, and calcium intake [^113BKRso]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Adequate vitamin D status for optimum bone health has received increased recognition in recent years; however, the ideal intake is not known. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status, but no universal reference level has been reached.

- **Objective**: To investigate the relative importance of high calcium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for calcium homeostasis, as determined by serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A cross-sectional study of 2310 healthy Icelandic adults who were divided equally into three age groups (30–45 years, 50–65 years, or 70–85 years) and recruited from February 2001 to January 2003. They were administered a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which assessed vitamin D and calcium intake. Participants were further divided into groups according to calcium intake (1200 mg/d) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (18 ng/mL).

- **Main outcome measure**: Serum intact PTH as determined by calcium intake and vitamin D.

- **Results**: A total of 944 healthy participants completed all parts of the study. After adjusting for relevant factors, serum PTH was lowest in the group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of more than 18 ng/mL but highest in the group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 10 ng/mL. At the low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (< 10 ng/mL), calcium intake of less than 800 mg/d vs more than 1200 mg/d was significantly associated with higher serum PTH (P = .04).

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1165kh6X]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L.

In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D, enhancing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium levels. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites.

More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults.

The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine: what clinicians need to know [^1128upyg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Serum 25OHD levels and screening**: Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools.

In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113qUrfH]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Testing populations at risk of vitamin D deficiency requires a clinical approach. Measurement of 25(OH)D has been recommended in patients at risk for deficiency. 25(OH)D is widely measured in many of these high-risk groups, such as older adults with decreased endogenous vitamin D production who are prone to develop osteoporosis, patients with parathyroid disorders and liver disease, and individuals with obesity. Patients with class III obesity (BMI > 40) present with low levels of 25(OH)D due to various factors, including nutritional factors, psychological reasons leading to less sun exposure, decreased hepatic expression of CYP2R1, and sequestration of the vitamin in excess adipose tissue.

Class III obesity may be addressed by bariatric surgery, which can lead to malabsorption and a further decrease of 25(OH)D levels, potentially resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism. Other at-risk groups include those who are housebound, individuals working long hours indoors, dark-skinned individuals, patients with chronic diseases, and those taking medications that increase vitamin D catabolism. Paradoxically, the situations where it may be reasonable to measure 25(OH)D encompass most people. This leads to overtesting and high costs for the healthcare system. Rather than testing in situations where it might be reasonable, it is better to test only in situations that warrant it. It ultimately depends on providers' judgment to first recognize these high-risk individuals and then decide on the appropriate course of action.

### Serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of incident heart failure: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [^114ooyVG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

We also did not observe an association of 25(OH)D with LVM. Results of prior investigations are conflicting. A study of 1800 participants from Italy did find an association between low 25(OH)D and elevated LVM. However, similar to our results, the studies from the Cardiovascular Health Study and the Netherlands that demonstrated associations of PTH with LVM found no association between 25(OH)D and LVM. Furthermore, the short-term clinical trials completed at the time of writing have demonstrated no improvement of LVM with vitamin D treatments.

- **One possible explanation**: for the lack of improvement in HF outcomes with vitamin D supplementation may be because vitamin D supplementation may not be very effective in reducing PTH concentrations. For example, some trials of vitamin D supplementation have demonstrated that although there was a significant increase in 25(OH)D levels, PTH does not significantly decrease.

Overall, mixed results of human studies evaluating 25(OH)D, HF, and LVM temper enthusiasm that 25(OH)D may be a powerful intervention to prevent and treat HF.

### Association of serum parathyroid hormone levels with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among U.S. adults [^111YQd6C]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to examine whether parathyroid hormone (PTH) is associated with mortality among U.S. adults.

- **Methods**: This study included 8,286 U.S. adults aged ≥ 20 years with a measurement of serum intact PTH from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2006 linked to national mortality data through 2015. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause and cause-specific (cardiovascular and cancer) mortality according to intact PTH levels (low or low-normal, 74 pg/mL). Analyses were also stratified by serum albumin-adjusted calcium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 10.1 years, the mean age was 49 years, and 48% were men. After adjusting for potential confounders, both the high-normal and high PTH groups showed higher risks of all-cause mortality than the low or low-normal PTH group (high-normal PTH, aHR, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.48; high PTH, aHR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.19–1.69). When stratified by calcium and 25OHD levels, the association between high PTH and mortality was also found among participants with albumin-adjusted calcium levels of ≥ 9.6 mg/dL (aHR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.17–2.01) and those with 25OHD levels of ≥ 20 ng/mL (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.17–1.82). No evidence was found of increased cause-specific mortality risks in the high PTH group.

- **Conclusion**: Higher PTH levels were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, particularly among participants with elevated albumin-adjusted calcium and 25OHD levels.

### A prospective observational study of all-cause mortality in relation to serum 25-OH vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114oMf8b]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

In contrast to earlier reports on relationships between vitamin D and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, our analysis also incorporated data on corrected calcium and serum PTH levels. It is important to also have knowledge about levels of PTH and calcium in conjunction with vitamin D to properly determine the presence of primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, since high PTH levels have been found to be an indicator of risk per se in renal disease and in the general non-diabetic population.

Our new analyses confirmed an independent relationship between low vitamin D levels and all-cause mortality in men with diabetes. This relationship remained statistically significant even when two other well-established risk markers for mortality, PWV and carotid IMT, were included in the analyses. This suggests that vitamin D can serve as a surrogate marker of risk for mortality in male patients with type 2 diabetes. However, it does not prove that vitamin D substitution reduces the risk in the studied cohort.

Results from experimental studies have suggested causality between treatment with vitamin D (for example, through the reduction of inflammatory activity and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system), but we found no relationships between levels of vitamin D and CRP. However, vitamin D levels did show an inverse relationship with systolic ABP levels, which aligns with the lack of suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by vitamin D. Recent studies of the effects of treatment with vitamin D in non-diabetic patients on blood pressure and vascular function have shown similar observations.

### Zemplar [^114qfj9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D2 or D3. Both vitamin D2 and D3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function, as well as calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. It also binds to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium, and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone.

In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been observed in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and the resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy.

- **Mechanism of action**: Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding.

### Association of serum parathyroid hormone within normal range with the prevalence and prognosis among adults with diabetes and prediabetes: Insight from NHANES 2003–2006 data [^113R4nWd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

As this is an observational study, our analysis should be regarded as exploratory in nature. At the time of writing, no empirical evidence has demonstrated the potential clinical benefits of therapy for individuals with PTH levels within the normal range, and it is not possible to state a causal relationship between PTH and the onset of diabetes or death from our study. Overall, significant variations in prognosis among diabetic or prediabetic populations with varying degrees of PTH suggest the potential advantages of maintaining low PTH levels for long-term prognosis. Lowering targeted circulating PTH concentrations may potentially mitigate the unfavorable prognosis in hyperglycemic populations. Therapies that target the modulation of PTH levels, including the use of vitamin D supplementation and calcium intake, are readily available and can be integrated into clinical practice.

As far as we are aware, this research marks the pioneering exploration of the prognostic significance of PTH within a demographic comprising individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. Our approach differs from previous research on PTH and its association with poor prognosis, which often relied on studies that lacked crucial information regarding participants' lifestyle, comorbid conditions, serum calcium levels, serum phosphorus levels, vitamin D status, and PTH levels. In contrast, by employing the NHANES database, we are presented with a unique opportunity to effectively account for a range of confounding variables that were previously unaddressed. The primary limitations of our study are rooted in the cross-sectional nature of the data.

### Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and metabolic syndrome - the PORMETS study [^113s2aEd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The present study showed a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in a sample of the Portuguese population. Compared with other European and worldwide populations, our median level of 25(OH)D (13.8 ng/mL) is relatively low. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was higher in participants with higher BMI and sedentary lifestyles.

The PTH levels showed a significant positive association with BMI, WC, and the WC component of MetS, suggesting a possible role in the pathophysiology of obesity. The 25(OH)D levels were negatively associated with BMI, glucose, and triglycerides levels as well as with MetS and its BP and triglycerides components, indicating that hypovitaminosis D may contribute to the pathophysiology of MetS.

Considering the low levels and inadequate intake of vitamin D, the frequency of overweight, and potentially insufficient solar exposure in the Portuguese population, it is crucial to develop national policies to increase awareness of the importance of vitamin D for health and to develop strategies for the identification of vitamin D deficiency, especially in at-risk groups.

### Associations between change in total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone [^117JcNCy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

The physiologic role of free 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in humans is unclear. This study aimed to assess whether a rise in total vs free 25(OH)D is associated with changes in downstream biomarkers of 25(OH)D entry into target cells in the kidney and parathyroid: 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH)2D] and parathyroid hormone (PTH), respectively.

This research involved a 16-week randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic medical center. Participants included 35 adults aged ≥ 18 years with 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL. The intervention consisted of administering either 60 μg (2400 IU) per day of D3 or 20 μg per day of 25(OH)D3.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes measured were 24,25(OH)2D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], and PTH.

Results indicated that at baseline, the participants (combined D3 and 25(OH)D3 groups) were 35.1 ± 10.6 years old. Mean levels of total 25(OH)D, free 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, and PTH were 16.6 ng/mL, 4.6 pg/mL, 1.3 ng/mL, and 37.2 pg/mL, respectively. From weeks 0 to 4, a rise in only free 25(OH)D was associated with a concurrent increase in 24,25(OH)2D [P = 0.03, adjusted for change in 1,25(OH)2D and supplementation regimen] and a decrease in PTH (P = 0.01, adjusted for change in calcium and supplementation regimen). However, between weeks 4 and 8, and again from weeks 8 to 16, rises in both free and total 25(OH)D were associated with an increase in 24,25(OH)2D; in contrast, neither total nor free 25(OH)D was associated with a PTH decrease during these latter periods.

In conclusion, the early rise in free 25(OH)D during the treatment of vitamin D deficiency was more strongly associated with changes in biomarkers of 25(OH)D entry into target kidney and parathyroid cells, suggesting a physiologic role of free 25(OH)D in humans.

### Vitamin D in primary hyperparathyroidism: Effects on clinical, biochemical, and densitometric presentation [^114AWxhq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD]) deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20–29 ng/mL) are common in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but data regarding their skeletal effects in PHPT are limited.

- **Objective**: The objective was to evaluate the association between 25OHD levels and PHPT severity.

- **Design, settings, and participants**: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 100 PHPT patients with and without 25OHD insufficiency and deficiency from a university hospital setting.

- **Outcome measures**: We measured calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual x-ray absorptiometry.

Results indicated that lower 25OHD was associated with some indicators of PHPT severity (PTH: r = -0.42; P < .0001; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D: r = -0.27; p = 0.008; serum PO4: r = 0.31; p = 0.002) but not all (serum/urine calcium). Lower 25OHD was also associated with younger age, higher body mass index, male gender, better renal function, and lower vitamin D intake. Comparison of those with deficient (< 20 ng/mL; 19%) vs. insufficient (20–29 ng/mL; 35%) vs. replete (≥ 30 ng/mL; 46%) 25OHD demonstrated more severe PHPT as reflected by higher PTH (mean ± SEM, 126 ± 10 vs. 81 ± 7 vs. 72 ± 7 pg/mL; P < .0001) but no difference in nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, fractures, serum or urinary calcium, bone turnover markers, or BMD after adjustment for age and weight. In women, T-scores at the 1/3 radius were lower in those with 25OHD of 20–29 ng/mL, compared to those who were vitamin D replete (P = .048). In multiple regression modeling, 25OHD (but not PTH) was an independent predictor.

### Normocalcaemic, vitamin D-sufficient hyperparathyroidism - high prevalence and low morbidity in the general population: A long-term follow-up study, the WHO MONICA project, Gothenburg, Sweden [^113QuJQK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of hypertension, determined by the use of antihypertensives, was higher, but S‐25(OH)D was lower in nHPT than in subjects with normal S‐PTH. There were no differences between groups regarding:

- **Blood and metabolic measurements**: blood glucose, lipids, thyroid hormones, S‐anti‐TPO, vitamin B12, folic acid, phosphate, iron, creatinine, cystatin C, glucose, insulin
- **Physical characteristics**: body height, weight, change in height or body weight
- **Bone health measurement**: calcaneal QUS during 13 years

Subjects with nHPT had a higher weekly intake (adjusted for age and BMI) of:

- **Higher intake**: fat cheese (P = 0.0028), cream (P = 0.0114)
- **Lower intake**: fatty fish (P = 0.0358), vitamin D-fortified low-fat milk (P = 0.0154)

The calcium intake per day was above the recommended daily intake of 1000 mg/day in both groups. There were no significant differences in:

- **Supplementation and medication**: calcium/vitamin D supplementation (mainly 1000 mg calcium and 800 IU cholecalciferol), thiazide use
- **Physical activity**: physical activity at work or leisure

Data from 1995 for the two groups compared showed a higher prevalence of hypertension and higher S‐PTH and S‐Osteocalcin levels in nHPT than in those with normal S‐PTH in 2008. Notably, the S‐Ca and S‐25(OH)D levels in 1995 did not differ between groups. The S‐Ca levels in 2008 were evenly distributed within the normocalcaemic range in relation to S‐PTH.

Distribution of subjects: n = 410, regarding S‐Ca in relation to vitamin D insufficiency (S‐25D < 50 nmol/l: open circles) and sufficiency (cross in circles).

### Low parathyroid hormone levels in bedridden geriatric patients with vitamin D deficiency [^113hWo3k]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). High credibility.

To identify the clinical conditions associated with low parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with vitamin D deficiency and to evaluate the stability of the blunted PTH response to vitamin D deficiency over six months, a secondary analysis of a randomized double-blind controlled vitamin D supplementation trial was conducted. This study was set in four long-term care hospitals in Helsinki, Finland, involving 218 chronically bedridden patients.

Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), intact PTH, amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), and carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were measured, alongside activities of daily living (ADLs) and body mass index (BMI), at baseline and six months. Patient records were reviewed for demographic data.

Results showed that PTH was within reference values (8–73 ng/L) despite low 25-OHD levels (< 50 nmol/L) in 74.8% (n = 163) of patients, with a mean age of 84.5 ± 7.5. Patients in the lowest PTH quartile (< 38 ng/L) were characterized by a history of hip fractures (OR = 2.9, P = 0.01), low BMI (OR = 0.9, P = 0.02), and high ICTP (OR = 1.1, P = 0.03). PTH remained within reference values even after six months in 76.2% of the patients with persistent vitamin D deficiency in the placebo group.

The absence of secondary hyperparathyroidism seems to be common and persistent in frail, chronically bedridden patients with vitamin D deficiency. Attenuated parathyroid function appears to be associated with immobilization that causes accelerated bone resorption. Further studies addressing the possible adverse effects of low PTH are warranted.

### Plasma vitamin D and parathormone are associated with obesity and atherogenic dyslipidemia: A cross-sectional study [^117CbXVP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity has become a serious health problem in most developed countries. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2008 the global prevalence of overweight and obesity was around 1.5 billion and 500 million adults, respectively. Obesity is also well known to be associated with an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, and total mortality.

Vitamin D deficiency is also an important worldwide public health problem. Although the most-studied and best-known function of vitamin D, together with parathyroid hormone (PTH), is related to bone metabolism, many studies show evidence of the relationship between obesity and low levels of 25(OH)D (the best indicator of clinical levels of vitamin D). Factors known to influence 25(OH)D concentrations include race, vitamin D intake, sun exposure, adiposity, age, and physical activity. In obese people, low levels of 25(OH)D can be attributed mainly to the following reasons:

a) The lower bioavailability of the vitamin, due to its sequestration by adipose tissue.
b) The dilution of ingested or cutaneously synthesized vitamin D in the enlarged fat mass.
c) Low sun exposure, due to mobility limitations or the low sun exposure of large areas of the body.
d) A low intake of calcium and vitamin D.

The frequently observed increases in PTH serum concentrations in obese individuals could be explained by a compensatory mechanism in response to low circulating levels of 25(OH)D. More recently, vitamin D deficiency has been related to the pathogenesis of such comorbidities as insulin resistance.

### Hypovitaminosis D masking hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism: case report [^112acwJn]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The patient was prescribed vitamin D3 200,000 IU ampoules by intramuscular injections every two weeks for two months, and the tests were reevaluated in December 2012. Vitamin D showed some improvement and rose to 18 ng/mL, while calcium rose to 11.8 mg/dL. The patient repeated the same treatment protocol for two more months, and tests were reevaluated once more in March 2013. Vitamin D normalized to 51.4 ng/mL, calcium remained elevated at 11.5 mg/dL, phosphorus was low normal at 2.5 mg/dL, and PTH remained high at 161 ng/L. The decision was to stop vitamin D injections and reevaluate in one month.

In April 2013, calcium showed persistent elevation at 12.7 mg/dL, low normal phosphorus at 3.2 mg/dL, and PTH persistently elevated at 231 ng/L. At this point, the differential diagnosis was primary HPTH versus FHH. A final laboratory assessment was ordered in May 2013 to reach a definite diagnosis. Results showed normal vitamin D at 65.3 ng/mL, high ionized calcium at 6.4 mg/dL (N: 4.6–5.2), low phosphorus at 2.1 mg/dL, high 24-hour urinary calcium excretion at 577 mg/24 h (N: 100–400), and high PTH at 176 ng/L — a combination consistent with primary HPTH that was initially masked by hypovitaminosis D.

### Effects of high-dose vitamin D2 versus D3 on total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D and markers of calcium balance [^116J3h4r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Controversy persists over how best to restore low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels: vitamin D2 (D2) versus vitamin D3 (D3); how best to define vitamin D status: total (protein-bound + free) versus free 25D; and how best to assess the bioactivity of free 25D.

- **Objective**: To assess the effects of D2 versus D3 on serum total and free 25D and to determine whether the change in intact PTH (iPTH) is more strongly associated with a change in total versus free 25D.

- **Design**: Participants previously enrolled in a D2 versus D3 trial were matched for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity. Participants received 50,000 IU of D2 or D3 twice weekly for five weeks, followed by a five-week equilibration period. Biochemical assessment was performed at baseline and at 10 weeks.

- **Setting and participants**: Thirty-eight adults (19 D2 and 19 D3), aged ≥ 18 years with baseline 25D levels < 30 ng/mL, were recruited from an academic ambulatory osteoporosis clinic.

- **Outcome measures**: Serum measures included total 25D, free 25D (directly measured), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium, and iPTH. The urine measure was the fasting calcium-to-creatinine ratio.

- **Results**: Baseline total (22.2 ± 3.3 vs 23.3 ± 7.2 ng/mL; p = 0.5) and free (5.4 ± 0.8 vs 5.3 ± 1.7 pg/mL; p = 0.8) 25D levels were similar between D2 and D3 groups. Increases in total (+27.6 vs +12.2 ng/mL; p = 0.001) and free (+3.6 vs +6.2 pg/mL; p = 0.02) 25D levels were greater with D3 versus D2. Percentage change in iPTH was significantly associated with a change in free (but not total) 25D, with and without adjustment for the supplementation regimen, change in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115rP1Fz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The 2011 Endocrine Society guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of vitamin D deficiency, specifically focusing on vitamin D supplementation. The guidelines suggest considering an initiation of higher doses of vitamin D — 2 to 3 times the usual amount, equating to at least 6,000 to 10,000 IU per day. This is followed by a maintenance therapy of 3,000 to 6,000 IU per day in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, or those on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism. The goal is to achieve and maintain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level greater than 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D metabolites and skeletal consequences in primary hyperparathyroidism [^111xr5n3]. Clinical endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD), mainly at sites rich in cortical bone. Successful parathyroidectomy, however, causes an increase in BMD, especially at sites rich in trabecular bone. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels are typically reduced, while plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D] is slightly increased in PHPT. These variations in vitamin D metabolites may influence variations in BMD and fracture risk.

- **Aim**: To investigate relations between preoperative vitamin D metabolites and skeletal consequences in patients with untreated PHPT, and to appraise the influence of preoperative vitamin D metabolites on postoperative changes in BMD.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional and cohort study.

- **Materials**: Two hundred and forty-six consecutive Caucasian PHPT patients aged 19–91 years (median 63, 87% females).

- **Results**: BMD was reduced at the femoral neck (P < 0.001) and forearm (P < 0.001), but normal at the lumbar spine (P = 0.11). Levels of biochemical bone markers were associated with high plasma PTH, high plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D, and low plasma levels of 25OHD. Moreover, low plasma 25OHD was associated with low levels of BMD at the femoral neck (r(p) = 0.23), the forearm (r(p) = 0.19), and the whole body (r(p) = 0.30), whereas plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D was inversely associated with BMD at all regional sites and the whole body. Plasma PTH only showed an inverse association with BMD at the forearm (r(p) = -0.21). No association was observed between biochemical variables and prevalent spinal fractures or all peripheral fractures.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^113dYKVu]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

There are several prevalent conditions in postmenopausal women associated with low serum 25(OH)D; hence, normalization of 25(OH)D levels may improve those conditions. Despite this, an excessive increase of 25(OH)D levels is not associated with better clinical results. In postmenopausal women, low vitamin D levels are associated with hypersecretion of PTH, and vitamin D supplementation reduces serum PTH and increases 25(OH)D levels. Increased PTH is associated with increased cortical bone porosity. Women who are not vitamin D deficient would not obtain benefit from vitamin D supplementation. However, elderly women that do not receive active bone-forming treatments and have osteoporosis and low serum vitamin D should receive vitamin D supplementation as an anti-fracture agent. Meta-analysis of RCTs indicates that vitamin D and calcium supplementation produce a significant reduction of fracture risk for any fracture and hip fractures.

Insufficient and deficient 25(OH)D levels are associated with an increased risk of MetS in postmenopausal women, and vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces triglyceride, insulin, and HOMA-IR values. BMI is a good predictor of low 25(OH)D status in women, and the vitamin D supplementation dose should be adjusted according to BMI. In addition, concomitant vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce central fat deposits. Obese women may need higher vitamin D supplementation doses to normalize their circulating levels. In women with prediabetes and low 25(OH)D levels, vitamin D supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity.

### Vitamin D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and preeclampsia [^113J527a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism, defined by a high concentration of intact parathyroid hormone when circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is low, is a functional indicator of vitamin D insufficiency and a sign of impaired calcium metabolism. Two large randomized controlled trials examined the effects of calcium supplementation on preeclampsia but did not consider the vitamin D status of mothers.

- **Objective**: We examined the association of secondary hyperparathyroidism with the risk of preeclampsia.

- **Design**: Circulating maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and intact parathyroid hormone were measured at entry to care (mean ± SD: 13.7 ± 5.7 weeks) using prospective data from a cohort of 1,141 low-income and minority gravidae.

- **Results**: Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurred in 6.3% of the cohort, and 18.4% of women whose 25(OH)D concentrations were 20 ng/mL were not at increased risk. Intact parathyroid hormone was related to higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and arterial pressure at week 20 before clinical recognition of preeclampsia. Energy-adjusted intakes of total calcium and lactose and circulating 25(OH)D were inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure or arterial pressure and with parathyroid hormone.

- **Conclusion**: Some women who are vitamin D insufficient demonstrate a unique relationship with hypertension markers.

### Vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism [^117NCNWB]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Temporally associated with the improvement in vitamin D nutrition in many Western countries in the mid-20th century, there was a change in many characteristics of primary hyperparathyroidism. Osteitis fibrosa cystica became a rare manifestation of what is now frequently an asymptomatic disease. At the same time, in patients with the disease, levels of PTH and parathyroid adenoma weights have fallen dramatically. In view of these observations, and others, an association between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of primary hyperparathyroidism has been proposed.

Data support an association on two distinct levels. First, regardless of the clinical severity of primary hyperparathyroidism, the disease seems to be more severe in those with concomitant vitamin D deficiency. Second, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency seem to be more prevalent in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism than in geographically matched populations. The association between vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism has clear implications.

Co-existing vitamin D deficiency may cause the serum calcium level to fall into the normal range, which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. With regard to management, preliminary data on vitamin D repletion in patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism suggest that, in some cases, correction of vitamin D deficiency may be accomplished without worsening the underlying hypercalcemia. Vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing parathyroidectomy are also at increased risk of postoperative hypocalcemia and "hungry bone syndrome", which underscores the importance of…

### A prospective observational study of all-cause mortality in relation to serum 25-OH vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114fwc3g]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to demonstrate a relationship between vitamin D levels and mortality in men with type 2 diabetes. Strengths of our study include registry data on mortality with no patients lost to follow-up. It is the first study of its kind that includes measures of PTH and corrected calcium in conjunction with vitamin D. We could also analyze data with respect to novel markers of atherosclerosis and vascular disease, such as PWV and carotid IMT.

Weaknesses include a rather short follow-up time period and consequent low rates of mortality. However, the short follow-up period suggests clinical relevance insofar that patients were indeed being cared for in a manner that is in accordance with guidelines. This was confirmed by frequent treatment with statins and antihypertensive medication, while mean levels of HbA1c and ambulatory blood pressures were generally acceptable. We were not able to analyze data with regard to significant renal failure, a condition that affects vitamin D metabolism, since no patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m². We also acknowledge that data on estrogen replacement therapy was lacking. However, we assumed that patients were treated according to guidelines in this respect and thus that post-menopausal estrogen replacement therapy was only used for very short periods of time (months) in selected patients.

Although statin treatment has been associated with an increase in vitamin D levels, we found no such interactions between the use of statins and high vitamin D levels.

### Discrepant influence of vitamin D status on parathyroid hormone and bone mass after two years of calcium supplementation [^112wtU2S]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

To investigate the influence of vitamin D status on parathyroid hormone and bone mass following a 2-year supplementation of calcium alone, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in healthy postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. Three hundred and thirty-six subjects, aged 60–97 years, were studied and randomized to receive either elemental calcium 500 mg/day (n = 175) or placebo (n = 161) for 2 years.

- **Measurements**: Changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline and vitamin D status were measured. Values are presented as means ± SD.

- **Results**: After 2 years, subjects with calcium supplementation had a significant decrease in plasma PTH level (4.4 ± 1.7 vs. 4.7 ± 1.9 pmol/l, P < 0.01) and improved lumbar BMD (1.031 ± 0.12 vs. 1.004 ± 0.12 g/cm², P < 0.001) and total hip BMD (0.890 ± 0.10 vs. 0.883 ± 0.10 g/cm², P < 0.001) without change in femoral neck BMD. In the placebo group, PTH levels significantly increased (4.8 ± 1.6 vs. 4.5 ± 1.5 pmol/l, P < 0.001), lumbar BMD slightly increased (1.027 ± 0.14 vs. 1.018 ± 0.14 g/cm², P < 0.001), while total hip and femoral neck BMD decreased (0.876 ± 0.11 vs. 0.887 ± 0.11 g/cm², P < 0.001 and 0.783 ± 0.10 vs. 0.798 ± 0.10 g/cm², P < 0.001, respectively). When subjects were classified according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels into those with 25(OH)D in the lower tertile (lowVitD) and those in the middle and upper tertiles combined (normVitD), the degree of PTH suppression after calcium supplementation was significantly higher in the normVitD group.

### Effects of cholecalciferol vs calcifediol on total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone [^112diNkt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency disproportionately affects nonwhite individuals. Controversy persists over how to best restore low 25D levels and how to best define vitamin D status — whether as total (protein-bound plus free) vs. free 25D.

- **Objective**: To assess the effects of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, or D3) vs. 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol, or 25D3) on total and free 25D in a multiethnic cohort of adults, and whether the change in parathyroid hormone (PTH) is more strongly associated with total vs. free 25D.

- **Design**: Sixteen-week randomized controlled trial with biochemistries assessed at 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks.

- **Setting**: Academic medical center.

- **Participants**: Thirty-five adults, aged 18 years or older, with 25D levels less than 20 ng/mL.

- **Intervention**: Dosage included 60 micrograms (2400 IU) per day of D3 or 20 μg per day of 25D3.

- **Main outcome measures**: Total and free 25D and PTH.

Baseline measurements showed similar total (16.2 ± 3.7 vs. 17.0 ± 2.5 ng/mL; P = 0.4) and free (4.2 ± 0.8 vs. 4.7 ± 1.0 pg/mL; P = 0.2) 25D between D3 and 25D3 groups, respectively. 25D3 increased both total (+25.5 vs. +13.8 ng/mL; P = 0.001) and free (+6.6 vs. +3.5 pg/mL; P = 0.03) 25D more than D3. By four weeks, 87.5% of 25D3 participants had total 25D levels ≥ 30 ng/mL compared to 23.1% of D3 participants (P = 0.001). The change in PTH was associated with both total (P = 0.01) and free 25D (P = 0.04).

25D3 increased total and free 25D levels more rapidly than D3, regardless of race or ethnicity. Free and total 25D were similarly associated with changes in PTH.

### NATPARA (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

What is NATPARA?

NATPARA is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism).
NATPARA is only for people who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, because it may increase the possible risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma).
NATPARA was not studied in people with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations.
NATPARA was not studied in people who get sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

It is not known if NATPARA is safe and effective for children 18 years of age and younger.

NATPARA should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing.

Do not use NATPARA if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the ingredients in NATPARA. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in NATPARA.

Before you start using NATPARA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

### Relationship between vitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone in Cape Town [^116xm7rw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is associated with abnormal levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH).

- **Methods**: Vitamin D requests at a tertiary hospital in South Africa over two years were retrospectively analyzed along with calcium and PTH levels.

- **Results**: Only when the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level dropped below 25 nmol/l was there a significant rise in PTH. A subnormal 25(OH)D level was also not always related to hypocalcemia, as more than half of patients with their 25(OH)D level below 25 nmol/l had calcium levels in the reference range. However, all patients with calcium levels below 1.8 mmol/l were shown to have vitamin D insufficiency.

- **Conclusion**: Hypovitaminosis D may co-exist with a blunted PTH response. Therefore, assumptions about vitamin D status should not be made based on PTH and calcium values. 25(OH)D measurements should be requested when vitamin D deficiency is clinically suspected, irrespective of biochemical results.

### Thyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone competing to maintain calcium levels in the presence of vitamin D deficiency [^112y4k9e]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Weight loss and bone disease in the elderly are very often attributed to malignancy. Rarely, benign treatable conditions may be overlooked. Thyrotoxicosis, a benign treatable condition, needs to be excluded in such patients. The diagnosis may be delayed, since the symptoms are often subtle, and secondary complications, including bone disease (osteoporosis), are therefore more frequent at the time of presentation. This case illustrates this well and also highlights the value of measuring vitamin D levels in such patients. The most interesting aspect of this case was the reciprocal relationship between thyroxine and parathyroid hormone observed in maintaining calcium homeostasis in this thyrotoxic patient with low vitamin D levels.

### Calcitriol [^1165jeuf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Warnings: Since calcitriol is the most potent metabolite of vitamin D available, prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld or used with caution during treatment to avoid the risk of hypercalcemia. A non-aluminum phosphate-binding compound should be used to control serum phosphorous levels in patients undergoing dialysis.

Overdosage of any form of vitamin D is dangerous. Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification, nephrocalcinosis, and other soft tissue calcification. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg^2/dL^2. Radiographic evaluation of suspect anatomical regions may be useful in the early detection of this condition.

### Vitamin D deficiency, bone turnover markers and causative factors among adolescents: A cross-sectional study [^111WoZJo]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Natural dietary sources of 25 (OH) vitamin D are very few, and foods that are fortified with 25 (OH) vitamin D are often inadequate to satisfy either a child's or an adult's 25 (OH) vitamin D requirement. Adolescence is a critical age for skeletal growth and achieving optimal peak bone mass. Adequate intake of calcium and 25 (OH) vitamin D from daily dietary sources, in addition to maintaining normal serum levels of these nutrients, has positive effects on bone health in adolescents. For example, milk consumption positively correlates with bone mineral density of the total body, spine, and radius in adolescent girls.

Considering these factors, increasing vitamin D fortification of dairy products can be recommended as a population-wide public health strategy to combat 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency, especially in adolescents. Our study showed a significant positive correlation between serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels and markers such as osteocalcin, crosslaps, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. Assessments of bone markers and their associations are rare in recent studies.

In adults, an increase in serum 25 (OH) vitamin D suppresses serum PTH, while a decrease in serum 25 (OH) vitamin D increases serum PTH concentrations. However, the effects of PTH fluctuations in children and adolescents are unclear. Our study detected a significant negative correlation between serum 25 (OH) vitamin D and PTH in adolescents.

One factor that could have confounded our results was not excluding students with a positive history of supplement use.

### Incidental pituitary adenoma on MIBI parathyroid imaging [^1147HPqu]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

A 77-year-old man presented with hyperthyroidism, characterized by high parathyroid hormone levels (41 pmol/L), low vitamin D, and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. The SPECT/CT fused images confirmed the presence of a retrotracheal hyperdense mass, approximately 1.0 cm in diameter, located below the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe. This mass exhibited increased uptake, which is highly suggestive of a typical parathyroid adenoma.

The most significant finding was the incidental detection of a high focal uptake in the sellar/suprasellar region. This region corresponded to a heterogeneous soft tissue lesion, raising suspicions for a pituitary adenoma. Previous nuclear medicine scans, CT scans, and MRI confirmed indications of a pituitary adenoma.

### Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in older people to optimize bone health [^114dqZii]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in older people and may lead to increased bone resorption, bone loss, and increased falls and fractures. However, clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) have yielded conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: This study examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD at the hip, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

- **Methods**: A total of 379 adults aged ≥ 70 years (48% women; mean age: 75 years) from the northeast of England were randomly allocated to one of three doses of vitamin D3 (12,000 international units [IU], 24,000 IU, or 48,000 IU) given once a month. The primary outcome was the change in BMD (ΔBMD) at the hip. Secondary endpoints included the dose effects on femoral neck BMD, falls, circulating calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and adverse events.

- **Results**: The mean ± SD baseline plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 40.0 ± 20.1 nmol/L, which increased after 12 months to a mean 25(OH)D of 55.9, 64.6, or 79.0 nmol/L for participants receiving a monthly dose of 12,000, 24,000, or 48,000 IU, respectively (P < 0.01 for difference). There was no between-group difference in ΔBMD. However, parathyroid hormone concentrations decreased in all three groups, with a significantly greater decrease in the 48,000-IU group compared with the 12,000-IU group (P < 0.01). There were no differences in any adverse events between groups, with three cases of hypercalcemia, none of nephrolithiasis, and 249 falls observed.

- **Conclusions**: There was no difference in change in BMD over 12 months.

### Paradoxical response of parathyroid hormone to vitamin D-calcium supplementation in Indian children [^111F3J9h]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

To investigate the effect of oral vitamin D-calcium supplementation on serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P) concentrations in children with habitually low calcium intakes, a follow-up study was conducted. This study followed a randomized controlled trial that aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D-calcium supplementation on immunity. Data related to dietary intake, anthropometry, and biochemistry, including serum 25(OH)D and bone profile, were collected from 178 children — 79 in the vitamin D group and 99 in the non-vitamin D group.

Dietary calcium to phosphorus intake ratio was 0.4:1. Baseline serum 25(OH)D concentration was 58.2 ± 10.9 nmol/L, with 66% of children being vitamin D sufficient and none deficient. After supplementation, the vitamin D group, compared with the non-vitamin D group, had significantly greater 25(OH)D (83.9 ± 30.1 nmol/L vs. 58.3 ± 15.7 nmol/L) and significantly greater PTH (6.7 ± 3.6 pmol/L vs. 5.5 ± 3.2 pmol/L). There was a positive correlation (r s = 0.24) between serum 25(OH)D and PTH (versus a negative correlation [r s = -0.1] in the non-vitamin D group). Mean concentrations of serum bone measures in the vitamin D group after supplementation were calcium (2.2 ± 0.1 mmol/L), phosphorus (1.7 ± 0.2 mmol/L), and ALK-P (178.7 ± 40.7 IU/L).

At the follow-up, one year post-supplementation, PTH concentrations in the vitamin D group continued to remain high (though not significantly different from levels at six months), with low normal serum calcium, high normal phosphate, and ALK-P within reference range.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? A cross-sectional study [^111SMwSw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrated a clear association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and total bone mineral density among the adult U.S. population. We also revealed a significant U-shaped relationship, indicating that the serum 25(OH)D concentration associated with the highest bone mineral density was 81.1 nmol/L. The optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level for adult males is 84.8 nmol/L. For adult females, setting the threshold for vitamin D deficiency above 31.4 nmol/L is crucial, as lower 25(OH)D levels are not conducive to BMD. Moreover, they provide clinicians and researchers with a critical reference point for designing and implementing targeted interventions to optimize bone health outcomes in this population. Our study advances our understanding of the interplay between vitamin D status and bone health, paving the way for more effective strategies to combat osteoporosis and related conditions.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^116kCnCk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

At randomization, active forms of vitamin D were reduced by 50%, and patients were randomized to receive NATPARA 50 mcg daily or a placebo. Randomization was followed by a 12-week NATPARA titration phase and a 12-week dose maintenance phase. During the titration phase, NATPARA was increased by 25 mcg increments every four weeks, up to a maximum of 100 mcg. Titration was indicated for patients who could not achieve independence from active vitamin D and could not reduce oral calcium to 500 mg or less per day. At the end of the treatment, 56% of subjects randomized to NATPARA were receiving 100 mcg per day, 26% were receiving 75 mcg per day, and 18% were receiving 50 mcg per day. Doses of co-administered active forms of vitamin D and calcium were adjusted to maintain albumin-corrected serum calcium within a desired target range throughout the trial in both arms.

For the efficacy analysis, subjects who fulfilled all three components of a three-part response criterion were considered responders. A responder was defined as an individual who had: at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of active vitamin D, at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of oral calcium supplementation, and an albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration between 7.5 mg/dL and 10.6 mg/dL.

At the end of treatment, significantly more subjects treated with NATPARA [46/84 (54.8%)] compared to placebo [1/40 (2.5%)] met the response criterion (p-value < 0.001). Forty-two percent (35/84) of subjects randomized to NATPARA were independent of active vitamin D at the end of the trial.

### Appropriate goal level for 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cystic fibrosis [^115nRxb7]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and guidelines recommend 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels of ≥ 30 ng/mL. This threshold was selected because serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) rises in healthy individuals when the 25OHD level falls below 30 ng/mL. PTH levels > 50 pg/mL are associated with an increased risk of bone loss. However, the relationship between 25OHD and PTH has not been studied in CF. We sought to determine the appropriate goal 25OHD level in patients with CF by identifying the level below which the risk of PTH > 50 pg/mL begins to increase.

- **Methods**: Levels of 25OHD and PTH in 216 individuals with CF were collected prospectively. Individuals with 25OHD > 30 ng/mL had lower median PTH levels than those with levels < 30 ng/mL. The level of 25OHD below which the median PTH level began to exceed 50 pg/mL was identified.

### Normocalcaemic, vitamin D-sufficient hyperparathyroidism - high prevalence and low morbidity in the general population: A long-term follow-up study, the WHO MONICA project, Gothenburg, Sweden [^116k5JF9]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

The serum intact parathyroid hormone (S‐PTH) assay was introduced in the early 1990s and facilitated the diagnosis of primary hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). In the past, patients with pHPT were commonly severely symptomatic at the time of diagnosis due to bone loss and kidney stones. Today, the high availability of serum calcium (S‐Ca) and S‐PTH analyses facilitates earlier diagnosis, and patients are often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. In our clinical experience, the analyses of S‐PTH have increased in recent years — irrespective of calcium aberrations — in the evaluation of patients with, for example, metabolic bone disease. A new group of patients has thereby been discovered, characterized by normal S‐Ca and elevated S‐PTH levels in the absence of vitamin D deficiency, renal disease, or medications, which elevate S‐PTH. This diagnostic entity has been named normocalcaemic primary HPT (nHPT). No official recommendations for the follow‐up and treatment of nHPT have been established due to the scarcity of data on the prevalence, natural history, and outcome of medical or surgical management. Specialists in the field monitor patients with nHPT similarly to how they monitor patients with asymptomatic mild pHPT.

The natural history of long‐standing nHPT and the rate of progression into pHPT are poorly known. Most studies including S‐PTH have been performed on referral groups of patients, mostly to bone and metabolic units. In addition, it is uncertain which S‐Ca level could be considered safe in patients with mild pHPT.

### Normocalcaemic, vitamin D-sufficient hyperparathyroidism - high prevalence and low morbidity in the general population: A long-term follow-up study, the WHO MONICA project, Gothenburg, Sweden [^114gQnE3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Subjects with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism (nHPT), indicated by serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels ≥ 60 ng/l, were compared with subjects having normal serum PTH levels. Both groups had serum 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/l, assessed in 2008. The data is presented as means ± standard deviation (SD), with P-values adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI) provided in the far-right column. Key abbreviations include alkaline phosphatase (ALP), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Serum-free T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) Modular immunometric method (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Thyroperoxidase antibodies (S-anti-TPO), vitamin B12, serum calcium (S-Ca), creatinine, cystatin C, lipids, alkaline phosphatase (S-ALP), phosphate, iron, and cortisol, all derived from serum, along with glucose and homocysteine from plasma, were analyzed by routine methods. These methods were consistently used at the study's inception and during follow-up.

A serum PTH level ≥ 60 ng/l was classified as hyperparathyroidism (HPT), and a serum calcium level of 2.15–2.49 mmol/l was considered normocalcaemia. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l. Normocalcaemic HPT was defined as normocalcaemia and elevated serum PTH and 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/l. Primary HPT (pHPT) was characterized by hypercalcaemia combined with elevated serum PTH, whereas secondary HPT (sHPT) was marked by hypocalcaemia (S-Ca < 2.15 mmol/l) and elevated serum PTH.

- **Pharmacological treatment and nutrition**: Ongoing pharmacological treatment was surveyed using questionnaires in 1995 and 2008, coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System. Similar questionnaires were employed in 1995 and 2008 to assess the intake of dairy products and the degree of physical activity, classified on a scale from 1 to 4 (low to high) for both work and leisure activities.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: Review and recommendations on evaluation, diagnosis, and management. A Canadian and international consensus [^111DWHjG]. Osteoporosis International (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically concerning vitamin D and calcium supplementation, the CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend correcting any vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency to lower serum PTH without further elevating serum calcium. It is advised to correct serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to greater than 50 nmol/L.

### High doses of cholecalciferol alleviate the progression of hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD stages 3–4: results of a 12-week double-blind, randomized, controlled study [^115rqo8W]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the effect of CKD stage on outcomes. In the CKD Stage 3 subgroup, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels did not change in either treatment group. In the cholecalciferol group, PTH was 8.6 ± 2.0 pmol/L at baseline and 9.1 ± 3.9 pmol/L after 12 weeks. The corresponding values in the placebo group were 8.8 ± 3.0 pmol/L at baseline and 8.7 ± 3.3 pmol/L after 12 weeks. There were no differences in mean change between groups (P = 0.95).

In CKD Stage 4, the mean PTH levels changed from 12.5 ± 6.6 pmol/L to 11.5 ± 5.8 pmol/L in the treatment group and from 16.4 ± 11.0 pmol/L to 19.1 ± 12.4 pmol/L in the placebo group. The mean (confidence interval) difference in change between groups was −3.8 (−6.5; −1.1) (P = 0.006).

Of the subjects, 50% had baseline 25(OH)D levels at 57 nmol/L; it was −1.5 (−3.2; 0.2) (P = 0.09).

A further analysis found a correlation between 25(OH)D levels and intact PTH (iPTH) in the treatment group, indicating that even when vitamin D is sufficient, it is possible to suppress iPTH with native vitamin D. The linear correlation line could be expressed as [iPTH (pmol/L) = 17.05–0.0407 × [25(OH)D (nmol/L)]. This suggests that a mean iPTH of 12 pmol/L corresponds to 25(OH)D of 120 nmol/L, and a 'normal' level < 6.9 pmol/L correlates with 25(OH)D of approximately 250 nmol/L.

### The effect of cigarette smoke exposure on vitamin D level and biochemical parameters of mothers and neonates [^111cENvv]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

In the results of some other studies, reduced serum levels of vitamin D were associated with decreased parathyroid hormone levels and a subsequent increase in serum phosphorus. Nicotine receptors in the parathyroid glands, which inhibited the gland, were stated as a probable mechanism. These findings are in contrast to the findings of the present study. These controversies could be due to vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women in the present study and low vitamin D in their diets. This deficiency was higher in the exposed group. Several studies have reported severe vitamin D deficiency in the general population and pregnant women in Iran. There are numerous confounding factors that affect vitamin D reduction. In our study, vitamin D deficiency was seen in both groups, so the effect of smoke on vitamin D levels could not be evaluated.

Neonatal vitamin D status is highly related to the amount of transfused vitamin D through the placenta and its levels at birth, and maternal vitamin D deficiency causes vitamin D deficiency in infants. The findings of the present study also confirm this relationship; serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in mothers and infants had a significant correlation within both exposed and non-exposed groups. According to findings, no significant difference was found in 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, phosphorus, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels of the umbilical cord between the two groups. Gomez and colleagues reported a significant difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and phosphorus levels of umbilical cords.

### Seasonal variability in vitamin D levels no longer detectable in primary hyperparathyroidism [^113eHqQo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Seasonal variability in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and PTH levels in the general population has been associated with differences in bone turnover markers, bone density, and fracture risk. This variability has also been reported in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Given the widespread use of vitamin D supplements, this study aimed to determine whether patients with PHPT still demonstrated seasonal variation in 25(OH)D levels. This cross-sectional study was conducted at a university medical center in New York, NY, with 100 patients with PHPT participating.

- **Outcome measures**: We assessed vitamin D supplement use and seasonal variation in serum 25(OH)D.

Patients had PHPT with calcium levels of 10.8 ± 1.0 mg/dL and PTH levels of 85 ± 48 pg/mL. The mean 25(OH)D level was 29 ± 10 ng/mL. Although only 19% of participants had vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/mL), more than half were either deficient or insufficient (54% < 30 ng/mL). Despite seasonal changes in sun exposure, there were no seasonal differences in 25(OH)D, PTH, bone markers, bone mineral density, or in the prevalence of 25(OH)D levels below 20 or 30 ng/mL.

Most participants (65%) took supplemental vitamin D. Among supplement users, the dose was (mean, 1643 ± 1496 IU; median, 1000 IU daily). Supplement users had significantly better vitamin D status compared to non-users (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL: 8% vs. 40%; P < .0001; < 30 ng/mL: 40% vs. 80%; p = 0.0001; ≥ 30 ng/mL: 60% vs. 20%; p = 0.0001).

In conclusion, vitamin D supplements contribute to reducing seasonal variability in vitamin D levels among patients with PHPT.

### Parathyroid hormone, vitamin D levels and urine albumin excretion in older persons: the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) [^11496U2D]. Clinical endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of urinary albumin excretion (UAE), even within the normal range, is an independent predictor for cardiovascular disease. Accumulating research suggests that low levels of vitamin D and high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) also increase cardiovascular disease risk. This study is intended to investigate the relationship between PTH, vitamin D levels, and UAE.

- **Methods**: We examined 2,897 adults aged 50 and above, participating in the second year of the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V-2). Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were performed. Elevated UAE was defined as a spot urinary albumin creatinine ratio equal to or above 10.

- **Results**: The proportion of elevated UAE (21.8%, 23.2%, 23.2%, 31.8%; P for trend = 0.002) rose with increasing quartiles of PTH. The odds ratio for elevated UAE in the highest quartile of PTH was 72% higher than the lowest quartile group. There was no relationship between vitamin D and elevated UAE.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated PTH levels are associated with elevated UAE in Korean adults aged 50 and above. Additional studies are needed to clarify this relationship.
