## Question

clinical significance of lactate dehydrogenase in a patient presenting with pancreatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical significance of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a patient presenting with pancreatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about LDH's biology and why it is inherently nonspecific. Then, I should verify what role, if any, LDH plays in diagnosing acute pancreatitis versus predicting its severity. Next, I will examine how LDH integrates into validated scoring systems and whether thresholds or kinetics matter. After that, I should consider pediatric nuances, and finally, I need to outline a pragmatic clinical approach that avoids overinterpreting LDH while leveraging stronger tools and risk factors [^11554ccX].

> Let me first confirm the broad clinical meaning of an elevated LDH. LDH is a ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme released with cellular injury; elevations are highly nonspecific and span hematologic, infectious, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, oncologic, hepatopancreatic, and other etiologies, and can be medication-associated, which immediately cautions me against overattributing a high LDH to one organ without corroboration [^113qSTBZ]. Wait, let me verify the overall utility in contemporary practice: large series show that even markedly elevated LDH rarely narrows the diagnosis or changes management, underscoring its limited standalone value and need for clinical context [^11554ccX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pancreatitis. At first glance I was going to say LDH might help diagnose acute pancreatitis, but that would be a mistake; diagnosis relies on two of three criteria: characteristic abdominal pain, serum lipase and/or amylase ≥ 3× ULN, or characteristic imaging, with lipase preferred over amylase for laboratory confirmation, and LDH is not part of the diagnostic triad [^111wfzKF] [^115ffP9f] [^1168pqk1] [^113qnK58]. I should confirm that when lipase is not ≥ 3× ULN, imaging becomes crucial to avoid underdiagnosis, which again does not implicate LDH in the diagnostic pathway [^115XRxDE].

> Next, I should review severity prediction where LDH does appear. LDH is included in established severity scores such as the Glasgow-Imrie criteria and the admission BALI model, reflecting its correlation with systemic inflammation and tissue injury; however, guideline statements emphasize that no single laboratory test reliably predicts severe acute pancreatitis, so LDH cannot be used in isolation to triage or prognosticate [^114pBMrn] [^115yKEXs] [^113Hw8Vt]. Let me verify competing or complementary markers: CRP at 48–72 hours is commonly used as a severity triage marker, but even that is imperfect, reinforcing that composite clinical assessment and scores like BISAP or APACHE II remain more practical than any single analyte, including LDH [^113wAAUU] [^115d2Swf] [^116mXfA9].

> I will now examine thresholds, timing, and kinetics. The BALI admission model used LDH ≥ 300 IU/L alongside BUN and IL-6, showing prognostic discrimination comparable to classic scores, while other models and studies often assess LDH at 24–48 hours, aligning with the broader principle that dynamic changes over the first 48–72 hours better inform risk than an isolated admission value; still, these tools supplement rather than replace bedside judgment and validated clinical scores [^115yKEXs] [^114XKkBS] [^113wAAUU]. I should double-check that LDH as a triage test for necrosis is insufficient on its own; systematic reviews raise concerns about accuracy and standardization, arguing against using LDH alone to decide on advanced imaging or invasive strategies [^11431Lov].

> But wait, what about pediatrics where biomarker data can differ? Let me consider that pediatric acute pancreatitis uses INSPPIRE/NASPGHAN diagnostic criteria paralleling adult frameworks, without LDH in the diagnostic set, and inpatient monitoring focuses on BUN, creatinine, and urine output to guide fluid management; pediatric severity literature highlights BUN trends rather than LDH as independent predictors, so LDH again remains ancillary at best [^114CFYBK] [^113ut6mU] [^111tMqAu] [^1178UUkC]. Hold on, I should verify fluid guidance implications: management emphasizes supportive care and careful hydration rather than LDH-guided interventions, consistent with broader pancreatitis principles [^111xwKmv].

> I need to ensure I am not overfitting LDH to pancreatitis when systemic illness may be the true driver. Elevated LDH is a recognized severity correlate in COVID-19 cohorts for both deterioration and mortality, and is frequently elevated in malignancy and extensive tissue injury states; thus, in a pancreatitis evaluation, a high LDH might reflect concurrent sepsis, viral pneumonia, or tumor burden rather than pancreatic pathology per se, which mandates parallel evaluation of alternative sources and medications [^114sscBx] [^112hbMuZ] [^113qSTBZ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also consider that extreme LDH elevations in the differential can signal hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis, so checking hemolysis indices, CK, and a medication review becomes important before attributing prognostic meaning in pancreatitis [^113qSTBZ].

> Next, I should review how LDH fits into day-to-day decision-making. For suspected acute pancreatitis, I should diagnose with clinical criteria plus lipase, not LDH; to risk-stratify, I should use BISAP or APACHE II and track objective signs of organ dysfunction, and reserve LDH as a supportive, nonspecific signal rather than a trigger for CT or ICU transfer; imaging is indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected, while risk factors such as hemoconcentration and elevated BUN confer stronger, guideline-endorsed prognostic weight than LDH alone, and creatinine trends should be interpreted cautiously regarding necrosis risk [^116X1AVn] [^112hfCU3] [^111wjYvU]. Let me double-check follow-up labs: serial lipase does not guide management and, by extension, serial LDH lacks evidence to drive decisions; supportive care with appropriate fluids and early enteral feeding remains the cornerstone irrespective of LDH fluctuations [^114NFxw1] [^111xwKmv].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that LDH is a broad injury marker with low specificity; it appears in some pancreatitis severity frameworks, but no guideline supports using LDH alone to diagnose, triage, or predict necrosis, and its elevation should always prompt a search for alternative or concomitant causes and medication effects alongside validated pancreatitis tools and clinical assessment [^113Hw8Vt] [^114pBMrn] [^115yKEXs]. I should confirm that, in practice, LDH can modestly complement a composite picture but should not anchor decisions; when in doubt, favor established criteria, risk scores, organ failure assessment, and appropriate imaging, keeping LDH in perspective and verifying competing etiologies before assigning prognostic significance [^113qSTBZ] [^11554ccX].

Elevated LDH in pancreatitis reflects **tissue injury and necrosis** and is a **nonspecific marker** [^113qSTBZ] of disease severity. LDH is included in the **Glasgow-Imrie score** [^114pBMrn] and is associated with higher risk of severe disease, organ failure, and mortality [^115yKEXs], but it is **not specific to pancreatitis** and should be interpreted with other clinical and laboratory data [^11554ccX]. LDH is **not part of the diagnostic criteria** for acute pancreatitis [^111wfzKF] and is not recommended for routine monitoring; its main value is in **early risk stratification** and identifying patients who may need intensive care or intervention.

---

## Pathophysiological basis of LDH elevation in pancreatitis

LDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme present in most tissues, including the pancreas, and is released into the bloodstream with cellular injury or necrosis [^113qSTBZ]. In acute pancreatitis, **pancreatic acinar cell injury and necrosis** release LDH into the circulation. Elevated LDH levels therefore reflect the extent of pancreatic tissue damage and necrosis, which are hallmarks of severe acute pancreatitis [^114WFsDK].

---

## Clinical significance of LDH in pancreatitis

### Diagnostic utility

LDH elevation is **nonspecific** and can occur in various conditions, including pancreatitis, liver disease, hemolysis, malignancies, and infections [^113qSTBZ] [^11554ccX]. It is **not part of the diagnostic criteria** for acute pancreatitis [^111wfzKF], which rely on clinical presentation, elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase or lipase), and imaging findings [^115ffP9f] [^1168pqk1].

---

### Prognostic utility

- **Severity assessment**: Elevated LDH levels are associated with increased severity of pancreatitis, including higher risk of pancreatic necrosis, organ failure, and mortality [^115Uf6cb] [^114XKkBS].

- **Glasgow-Imrie score**: LDH is a component of the Glasgow-Imrie scoring system [^114pBMrn], which predicts severe acute pancreatitis. An LDH level > 600 IU/L within 48 hours of admission is considered a significant predictor of severe disease.

- **Organ failure prediction**: Elevated LDH levels correlate with the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and persistent organ failure, all of which are associated with poor outcomes in pancreatitis.

---

### Monitoring disease progression

LDH is **not routinely used** to monitor disease progression or response to therapy in pancreatitis because of its nonspecific nature [^11554ccX]. Serial measurements may provide **adjunctive information** regarding ongoing tissue injury or necrosis, but they should not be relied upon solely for clinical decision-making [^113Hw8Vt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the use of **established scoring systems** (e.g. BISAP [^115d2Swf], APACHE II [^116mXfA9], Glasgow-Imrie) and specific laboratory markers (e.g. CRP, procalcitonin, BUN, hematocrit) [^112hfCU3] for risk stratification and management of acute pancreatitis [^1155pwXc] [^113wAAUU]. LDH is included in the **Glasgow-Imrie score** [^114pBMrn] but is not highlighted as a standalone marker in recent guidelines.

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Nonspecificity**: LDH elevation is nonspecific [^113qSTBZ] and can be influenced by various conditions unrelated to pancreatitis, such as hemolysis, liver disease, malignancies, and infections [^114sscBx].

- **Assay variability**: Variability in laboratory assays and lack of standardized cut-off values may limit the clinical utility of LDH measurements [^112ttvYy].

- **Limited predictive accuracy**: LDH alone has limited predictive accuracy for severe pancreatitis and should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory parameters [^113Hw8Vt].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Early risk stratification**: Elevated LDH levels on admission may prompt early aggressive management, including intensive monitoring, fluid resuscitation [^111xwKmv], and consideration of ICU admission.

- **Adjunctive marker**: LDH can be used as an adjunctive marker to identify patients at higher risk of severe disease, pancreatic necrosis, and organ failure.

- **Not for routine monitoring**: LDH is not recommended for routine monitoring of disease progression or response to therapy due to its nonspecific nature [^11554ccX].

---

Elevated LDH in pancreatitis reflects tissue injury and necrosis, serving as a **nonspecific marker of disease severity** [^113qSTBZ]. It is included in the Glasgow-Imrie score [^114pBMrn] and is associated with increased risk of severe disease, organ failure, and mortality. However, LDH is not specific to pancreatitis and should be interpreted alongside other clinical and laboratory findings. Its primary clinical utility lies in early risk stratification and identifying patients who may require intensive monitoring and intervention.

### Comparison of existing clinical scoring systems to predict persistent organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis [^114pBMrn]. Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

The Glasgow-Imrie Criteria, also known as the Imrie Scoring System or Glasgow Score, is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis. This scoring system is applicable to patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and is used to predict the prognosis and potential complications of the disease. The Glasgow-Imrie Criteria evaluates eight parameters within 48 hours of admission: age, white blood cell count, blood glucose, serum lactate dehydrogenase, serum aspartate transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and albumin. Each parameter is scored as 0 or 1, and a total score of 3 or more indicates severe pancreatitis with a higher risk of complications and mortality.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Glasgow-Imrie Criteria. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to guide treatment decisions in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tests.

To determine the total severity score using the Glasgow-Imrie criteria, assess each of the following indicators, adding 1 point for each that is met:

- **Age greater than 55 years**
- **White blood cell count exceeding 15×10^3/mcL or 10^9/L**
- **Blood glucose level over 180 mg/dL or 10 mmol/L**:

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^114CFYBK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). High credibility.

The INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure) diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in pediatric patients. This scoring system identifies children who are likely to have acute pancreatitis based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The INSPPIRE criteria include abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in children, which can help guide treatment decisions and predict prognosis. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or be used in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate the likelihood of pediatric acute pancreatitis by assessing three specific clinical factors. These factors are:

- **Characterization of abdominal pain**: Whether abdominal pain suggestive of or compatible with acute pancreatitis is present, characterized by acute onset especially in the epigastric region.
- **Evaluation of enzyme activity**: Whether there is serum amylase and/or lipase activity at least more than three times the upper limit of normal.

### Utility of serum pancreatic enzyme levels in diagnosing blunt trauma to the pancreas: a prospective study with systematic review [^114FoFym]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

The reliability of serum pancreatic enzyme levels in predicting pancreatic injuries has been a parameter of interest, and the present recommendations on its utility are based primarily on anecdotal observations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum pancreatic enzyme assessment in predicting blunt pancreatic injury with imaging and surgical correlation and compare our results with a systematic review of the literature to date.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort study was conducted over four years in a tertiary care referral center with 164 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department with a history of blunt abdominal trauma and had serum pancreatic enzyme assessment, USG, and subsequent diagnostic CECT. The CT findings and AAST grade of pancreatic injury, various intra-abdominal injuries, time elapsed since injury, and other associated factors were correlated with serum pancreatic enzyme levels. For the systematic review of literature, the MEDLINE database was searched between 1940 and 2012. Related citations and bibliographies of relevant articles were analyzed, and 40 articles were included for review. We compared our results with the systematic critique of the literature to formulate recommendations.

- **Results**: Thirty-three (21%) patients had pancreatic injury documented on CT and were graded according to AAST. Statistically significant elevated serum amylase levels were observed in patients with pancreatic and bowel injuries. However, elevated serum lipase was observed specifically in patients with pancreatic injury.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^113Hw8Vt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Numerous biomarkers have been studied as potential early predictors of the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) so that treatment can be optimally tailored to prevent complications. At this moment, no laboratory test is practically available or consistently accurate to predict severity in patients with AP.

In the absence of gallstones or significant history of alcohol use, serum triglyceride should be measured and considered to be the etiology if the value is greater than 11.3 mmol/l (> 1000 mg/dl).

Many textbooks consider C-reactive protein (CRP) as the gold standard for disease severity assessment. Using a cut-off value from 110 to 150 mg/l, the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 38 to 61%, and 89 to 90%, respectively, at the time of hospital admission. The major drawback of CRP is that peak levels are reached only after 48 to 72 hours.

In a prospective study of 175 patients divided into mild and non-mild acute pancreatitis according to the Atlanta classification, CRP and IL-6 combined demonstrated good discriminative capacity with an area under the curve of 0.803.

Resistin is a newly identified peptide hormone, secreted specifically by adipocytes that can cause obesity and hypertriglyceridemia due to its association with insulin resistance. Studies have revealed that resistin is also an important cytokine in inflammatory reactions and in the regulation of other cytokines. In a prospective observational study, resistin levels were better for predicting severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) than CRP or white blood cell (WBC) levels on day 3, and better than CRP levels for predicting the development of necrosis.

### Serum C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis [^11431Lov]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of people with pancreatic necrosis differs from that of people with oedematous pancreatitis. It is important to understand the diagnostic accuracy of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum procalcitonin, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a triage test for detecting pancreatic necrosis in people with acute pancreatitis. An informed decision can then be made regarding whether the person with pancreatic necrosis needs further investigations, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and whether treatment for pancreatic necrosis should be initiated.

There is currently no standard clinical practice, although CRP, particularly an increasing trend of CRP, is often used as a triage test to determine whether a person requires further imaging. Additionally, there is no systematic review of the diagnostic test accuracy of CRP, procalcitonin, and LDH for diagnosing pancreatic necrosis in people with acute pancreatitis.

- **Objectives**: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, procalcitonin, or LDH (index test), either alone or in combination, in diagnosing necrotising pancreatitis in people with acute pancreatitis, without organ failure.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), among other databases, until March 2017. We examined the references of included studies to identify additional studies and did not restrict studies based on language, publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

### Faster discharge with lactated ringers than normal saline in first 72 h of acute pancreatitis: A multicenter randomized trial [^11654Z9c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Data-driven strategies for acute pancreatitis (AP) in pediatrics are limited; adult data suggests lactated ringers (LR) compared to normal saline (NS) resulted in favorable outcomes, but has not been studied in pediatrics. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of LR during the first 48 hours of an AP episode compared with NS.

A multisite randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from 2015 to 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03242473). Patients were randomized to exclusively receive LR or NS for the first 48 hours. The primary outcomes measured were serial C-reactive protein (CRP) values. Secondary outcomes included other lab values, time to feeds, length of stay (LOS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) development, and progression to severe AP (SAP).

We studied 76 patients (38 LR, 38 NS). CRP at 24 and 48 hours were not significantly different between the LR or NS group. Additionally, there were no differences in trends of BUN, amylase, lipase, SIRS status, or SAP development between the LR and NS group at 24 and 48 hours. A higher proportion of LR patients (32%, 12/38) were discharged before 48 hours compared to NS (13%, 5/38). The LR group had a significantly higher rate of discharge within the first 72 hours compared to the NS group (p = 0.02).

Use of LR was associated with a faster rate of discharge during the intervention period and in the first 72 hours, but no other differences were observed compared to NS. This reduction in the length of hospitalization has significant implications for patients and healthcare costs.

### The pancreatitis outcome prediction (POP) score: a new prognostic index for patients with severe acute pancreatitis [^115Qa1pH]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis, defined as pancreatitis with distant organ dysfunction, is a condition carrying high mortality and morbidity. Outcome prediction scores are often based on small populations, usually from single specialist centers, and some scores cannot be applied until several days into hospital admission. We aimed to develop a new and more sensitive outcome prediction score — the Pancreatitis Outcome Prediction (POP) Score — for these high-risk patients.

The study was a retrospective cohort study using a large multicenter intensive care database, set in 159 U.K. intensive care units, with participants comprising 2,462 patients admitted with severe acute pancreatitis. There were no interventions.

Demographic, physiological, and biochemical data collected within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit admission were used to develop a risk prediction score using logistic regression. The six variables with the strongest relationship to hospital outcomes — arterial pH, age, serum urea, mean arterial pressure, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and total serum calcium (in order of decreasing impact) — produced a model with a prognostic discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.838) superior to other models. These six factors were used to develop an objectively weighted multivariate prognostic score ranging from 0 to 40 points.

Prognostic stratification of patients with severe acute pancreatitis requiring intensive care offers a useful audit tool to gauge unit performance.

### Assessment of the prognostic value of certain acute-phase proteins and procalcitonin in the prognosis of acute pancreatitis [^115Uf6cb]. Pancreas (2008). Low credibility.

Of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), 20% develop severe attacks that need early and intensive therapy. To administer such treatment, it is crucial to classify early the patients with mild and severe pancreatitis. This study aimed to evaluate the role of serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and routinely measured parameters in the early prediction of the course of AP.

A total of 40 consecutive patients with AP, confirmed by computed tomography, were prospectively enrolled in the study. Among them, 29 were graded as mild, and 11 were graded as severe. Blood samples were obtained on admission and 24 hours thereafter.

Procalcitonin concentration in both measurements was significantly higher in patients with severe pancreatitis, with the cutoff level estimated at 0.5 ng/mL. Although serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels rose significantly during the period of observation, they did not differentiate between the groups. Among the routinely measured parameters, prognostic value was found for total calcium concentration, lactic dehydrogenase activity, and glucose concentration.

The best efficiency in the early prediction of severe AP would be achieved with the measurement of procalcitonin, total calcium level, and lactic acid dehydrogenase activity immediately after admission to the ward.

### New prognostic markers for outcome of acute pancreatitis: Overview of reporting in 184 studies [^112ttvYy]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the reporting of studies on new prognostic markers of outcomes in acute pancreatitis. We used MEDLINE searches complemented with a review of references from relevant articles to identify eligible English-language studies. Included studies evaluated nonroutine markers for acute pancreatitis. Eligible outcomes included Atlanta criteria, Japanese criteria for severity, multiple/single organ failure, complications, interventional treatment, hospitalization length, and death.

We generated a 47-item checklist on acute pancreatitis prognosis by adapting a previously constructed reporting guidance instrument for prognostic tumor markers, REMARK (Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies). The checklist addresses the reporting of essential information in prognostic studies.

The 184 identified eligible studies reported on 196 different prognostic markers. One hundred forty-four studies (78.3%) found at least one prognostic marker to be nominally statistically significant. Significant improvements over time were seen in the reporting for 17 items, but major deficiencies were noted even in studies from 2004–2009. Particularly, 12 items were reported in less than 10% of studies overall, including those conducted most recently.

Despite some improvements over time, the reporting of important aspects of prognostic studies in acute pancreatitis remains suboptimal. The proposed REMARK-based checklist may help improve the quality and reporting of research in this field.

### The harmless acute pancreatitis score: A clinical algorithm for rapid initial stratification of nonsevere disease [^111k8wNy]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

The clinical calculator, "Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS)", is instrumental in managing patients with acute pancreatitis. Specifically designed to predict the likelihood of a benign course of acute pancreatitis within the first 24 hours of admission, the HAPS is calculated based on five parameters: hematocrit, age, pleural effusion, sex, and serum calcium levels.

The clinical utility of HAPS assists clinicians in identifying patients likely to have a mild course of acute pancreatitis, aiding decision-making regarding hospital admission, level of care, and resource allocation.

HAPS should not be used in patients with chronic pancreatitis or a known history of severe acute pancreatitis, as it is not designed to predict severity in these populations. Additionally, it may not be accurate in patients with conditions that can affect the parameters used in the score, such as chronic kidney disease (affecting serum calcium levels) or lung disease (causing pleural effusion).

The Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS) is a tool used to evaluate the severity of acute pancreatitis based on three clinical criteria. Each criterion can contribute one point to a total score ranging from 0 to 3. The inputs evaluated are binary, with each input being true (affirmative) or false:

- **Peritonitis**: Rebound tenderness or guarding
- **Elevated creatinine levels**: Greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL (177 mcmol/L)

### Association between time in range 70–180 mg/dl in early stage and severity with in patients acute pancreatitis [^116zVvfE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

AP was diagnosed if two of the following three criteria were met clinically: (1) acute, sudden, continuous, and severe upper abdominal pain, which can radiate to the back; (2) serum amylase and/or lipase activities were at least three times higher than the upper limit of normal; (3) enhanced CT/MRI showed typical imaging changes of AP (pancreatic edema or peripancreatic effusion).

Individuals were divided into two groups according to the severity of pancreatitis at discharge diagnosis: (1) mild group: patients who met the diagnostic criteria for AP without organ failure and local or systemic complications during hospitalization; (2) severe group, including MSAP and SAP, accompanied by transient organ failure (which can be recovered within 48 h), or accompanied by single or multiple organ failure continuously (> 48 h duration).

### High serum creatinine in acute pancreatitis: A marker for pancreatic necrosis [^111wjYvU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

High serum creatinine is a well-known unfavorable prognostic parameter in acute pancreatitis. Elevated creatinine at 48 hours after admission was recently described as a marker for pancreatic necrosis. As pancreatic necrosis is a serious complication of acute pancreatitis, and its identification through a simple laboratory test would be very helpful, the aim of this study was to test that statement.

In a prospective multicenter study of 462 patients with a first attack of acute pancreatitis, serum creatinine was determined on admission and at 24 and 48 hours thereafter. It was compared with the findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) performed within 96 hours of admission.

Pancreatic necrosis was present in 62 (13%) of the patients. Serum creatinine levels (abnormal ≥ 2 mg/dl) on admission and after 24 and 48 hours were evaluated versus the presence or absence of pancreatic necrosis. Sensitivity rates varied between 14 and 23%, specificity between 95 and 97%, positive predictive values between 41 and 50%, and negative predictive values between 87 and 89%. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed an area under the curve of between 0.604 and 0.669.

An elevated serum creatinine concentration at any time during the first 48 hours of admission is not a marker for pancreatic necrosis in a first attack of acute pancreatitis. If serum creatinine is normal, necrotizing pancreatitis is unlikely, and contrast-enhanced CT need not be performed unless complications occur or the patient's condition deteriorates.

### Classification of acute pancreatitis — 2012: revision of the Atlanta classification and definitions by international consensus [^111wfLbS]. Gut (2013). High credibility.

The Revised Atlanta Classification for Acute Pancreatitis is a clinical scoring system used to classify the severity of acute pancreatitis. This classification system is applicable to patients who present with symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood.

The Revised Atlanta Classification provides a standardized approach to stratify patients into different severity levels based on clinical and imaging findings. It categorizes acute pancreatitis into two phases: early (first week) and late (after the first week), and further classifies the disease into mild, moderately severe, and severe. This classification helps in predicting the clinical course, management, and prognosis of the disease.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to guide clinicians in making decisions about the appropriate level of care, potential need for interventions, and to predict patient outcomes. It also aids in communication between healthcare providers and in research settings.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Revised Atlanta Classification. However, it should be noted that it is not designed to diagnose acute pancreatitis, but rather to classify the severity of the disease in patients in whom a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis has already been established based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

### A critical evaluation of laboratory tests in acute pancreatitis [^113qnK58]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

An ideal laboratory test in the evaluation of a patient with acute pancreatitis (AP) should, in addition to accurately establishing the diagnosis of AP, provide early assessment of its severity and identify the etiology. None of the tests available today meet all these criteria, and presently there is no biochemical test that can be considered the "gold standard" for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of AP. In the diagnosis of AP, serum amylase and lipase remain important tests.

- **Advantages of amylase estimation**: It is technically simple, easily available, and has high sensitivity. However, its greatest disadvantage is its low specificity. A normal amylase level would usually exclude the diagnosis of AP, with exceptions such as AP secondary to hyperlipidemia, acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis, and when the estimation of amylase is delayed in the disease course.

- **Advantages of lipase estimation**: Lipase offers increased sensitivity in acute alcoholic pancreatitis and for patients presenting to the emergency room days after disease onset, as lipase remains elevated longer than amylase. Although once considered specific for AP, nonspecific elevations of lipase have been reported in almost as many disorders as amylase, thus decreasing its specificity.

Simultaneous estimation of amylase and lipase does not improve diagnostic accuracy. Other enzymes used for diagnosing AP — such as pancreatic isoamylase, immunoreactive trypsin, and elastase — are more cumbersome, expensive, and have no clear role in the diagnosis of AP. No enzyme assay has a predictive role in determining the severity of the condition.

### Diagnosing acute pancreatitis-clinical and radiological characterisation of patients without threefold increase of serum lipase [^115XRxDE]. European Journal of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosing acute pancreatitis (AP) can be challenging in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain but lacking the threefold increase in serum lipase levels (Lip-). This study aims to characterize these patients using clinical, radiological, and mortality data, and to assess which patients require contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).

In this retrospective, IRB-approved study, 234 consecutive patients with AP were investigated. Inclusion criteria encompassed single attacks (SAP) and recurrent attacks (RAP) of AP, along with CECT performed ≥ 72 hours after symptom onset. The severity of AP was assessed using C-reactive protein levels at 48 hours post-hospital admission and three CT-based scores (CTSI, mCTSI, EPIC) evaluated by two observers. Mortality rates from pancreatic and non-pancreatic causes were analyzed with respect to lipase increase. Results were compared using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

Among the patients, 64 out of 234 (27%) belonged to the Lip- group, while 170 out of 234 (73%) were allocated to the Lip+ group. There were significantly more male patients in the Lip- group (78% compared to 63% in Lip+, p < 0.05) and a higher occurrence of RAP (63% in Lip- compared to 21% in Lip+, p < 0.001). The EPIC score was significantly lower in the Lip- group compared to the Lip+ group (3 [IQR 2–5] vs. 2 [IQR 1–3], p < 0.001). Mortality from pancreatic and non-pancreatic causes was comparable between the Lip- and Lip+ groups (pancreatic causes: 9% vs. 6%, p = 0.60; non-pancreatic causes: 8% vs. 5%, p = 0.58).

In conclusion, 27% of all patients with AP presented without a threefold increase in lipase levels. Therefore, these patients would be underdiagnosed without the confirming CECT, which revealed significant diagnostic insights.

### Predictive factors for severe evolution in acute pancreatitis and a new score for predicting a severe outcome [^115TVgoZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The study was retrospective and included 712 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP) and admitted to our department over a nearly 6-year period (January 2006 - December 2011). AP was defined as the sudden onset of pain in the upper abdomen, associated with increased serum lipase (more than three times the upper normal value). A total of 183 cases were excluded due to incomplete data, so 529 patients were included in the final analysis.

The 529 patients were divided into two categories:

- **Initial group**: Consisted of 334 patients admitted between 2006 and 2009, used to develop the new algorithm for predicting severe outcomes in AP.
- **Validation group**: Consisted of 195 patients admitted in 2010 and 2011, used to validate the new score.

AP was classified as mild or severe according to the Atlanta criteria. Criteria for severity included organ failure (shock with systolic pressure < 90 mmHg, acute renal failure with creatinine > 2.0 mg/L after rehydration, or gastrointestinal bleeding > 500 cc/24 h) and/or local complications (especially pancreatic necrosis, but also including abscess and pseudocyst). Early predictors of severity within 48 hours of initial hospitalization included a Ranson score ≥ 3 and/or an APACHE-II score ≥ 8. To classify patients according to the Atlanta criteria, biological tests and imaging investigations, such as ultrasound examination, CT scans, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, were performed.

According to etiology, AP was classified as alcoholic, biliary, and non-alcoholic, non-biliary - nonA-nonB.

### Comparison of various scoring systems and biochemical markers in predicting the outcome in acute pancreatitis [^1146y3n3]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Early risk assessment is important in acute pancreatitis (AP). The primary objective of this study was to compare various scores and biochemical markers performed on the day of admission in predicting the outcome.

- **Methods**: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients presenting within two weeks of onset were collected. Various scores were calculated, and biochemical markers were measured on the day of admission. Optimum cutoffs were identified through receiver operating curve analysis. Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of outcome.

- **Results**: Of 343 patients included, 202 (59%) were male; mean (SD) age was 38.7 (15.5) years. Acute pancreatitis was severe in 170 (49.6%) patients. Twenty-eight percent of the patients developed infected pancreatic necrosis, and 18% died. An Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score of at least 7, bedside index for severity of AP (BISAP) of at least 2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome score of at least 3, and C-reactive protein of at least 82 ng/mL predicted severity. Predictors of infected pancreatic necrosis were as follows: PANC 3 score of at least 1, BISAP score of at least 2, and Marshall score of at least 2, whereas C-reactive protein of greater than 98, BISAP score of at least 2, APACHE score of at least 10, and blood urea nitrogen of at least 17 predicted mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Both BISAP and APACHE II are comparable in predicting outcomes, but BISAP predicted all three outcomes with the same cutoff and hence is a robust scoring system.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^114WFsDK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

The WSES 2019 guidelines address classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, with a focus on risk assessment. Key recommendations include recognizing that:

- **There are no gold standard prognostic scores** for predicting severe acute pancreatitis.

- **Severe acute pancreatitis is associated** with persistent cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal failure, and high mortality.

- **Patients having persistent organ failure** with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death.

### Early prediction of organ failure by combined markers in patients with acute pancreatitis [^115paDQa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). High credibility.

Several biological markers and clinical scoring systems have been used to predict the course of acute pancreatitis, as organ failure is the most severe complication of the disease. Prognostic markers and their combinations that would predict organ failure upon hospital admission were investigated.

- **Methods**: Some 351 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis were studied, with blood samples taken within 12 hours of admission. This case-control study included all 33 patients with organ failure and 99 matched controls without organ failure. Measurements included 19 prognostic markers and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score.

- **Results**: Plasma interleukin 10, serum glucose, and serum calcium were identified as independent predictors of organ failure by logistic regression analysis. Calcium level correlated with the clinical onset of organ failure. The combination of interleukin 10 (more than 50 pg/ml) or calcium (less than 1.65 mmol/l) was significantly better as a predictor than any single marker or APACHE II score, with a sensitivity of 88 percent, specificity of 93 percent, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 94.

- **Conclusion**: Organ failure in acute pancreatitis can be predicted with high accuracy at hospital admission using a combination of plasma interleukin 10 and serum calcium measurements.

### Significant increase of serum high-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 levels in patients with severe acute pancreatitis [^117MD59U]. Pancreas (2006). High credibility.

Multiple organ failure caused by systemic inflammatory response in the early phase and sepsis in the late phase is a major contributor to high mortality in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). High-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) has been identified as a potent proinflammatory mediator, which increases in various pathological conditions such as sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the contributions of HMGB1 in SAP.

Methods: Serum HMGB1 concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 45 patients with SAP at the time of admission. The relationship between their serum HMGB1 levels and clinical factors was also analyzed.

Results: The mean serum HMGB1 level was significantly higher in patients with SAP (5.4 ± 1.3 ng/mL) compared to healthy volunteers (1.7 ± 0.3 ng/mL). Serum HMGB1 levels were positively correlated with the Japanese severity score and Glasgow score. Furthermore, serum HMGB1 levels showed significant positive correlation with lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and total bilirubin. Higher HMGB1 levels were observed in patients with organ dysfunction and infection during their clinical course. Additionally, nonsurvivors exhibited higher HMGB1 levels than survivors, although serum HMGB1 levels gradually declined after admission.

Conclusions: Serum HMGB1 levels are significantly increased in patients with SAP and correlate with disease severity. These findings suggest that HMGB1 may serve as a key mediator for inflammation and organ failure in SAP.

### Factors predicting the development of necrosis in patients presenting with edematous acute pancreatitis [^114XKkBS]. Pancreas (2023). Low credibility.

There is no marker that can accurately predict the development of pancreatic necrosis in edematous acute pancreatitis (AP). This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with necrosis development in cases of edematous AP and to create an easy-to-use scoring system.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with edematous AP between 2010 and 2021. Among the patients, those who were found to have developed necrosis during follow-up were categorized as the necrotizing group, whereas the others constituted the edematous group.

- **Results**: With multivariate analysis, white blood cell, hematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels at the 48th hour were revealed to be independent risk factors for necrosis. Using these four independent predictors, the Necrosis Development Score 48 (NDS-48) was derived. While the cutoff value was 2.5, the sensitivity and specificity of the NDS-48 for necrosis were 92.5% and 85.9% respectively. The area under the curve value of the NDS-48 for necrosis was 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.920–0.977).

- **Conclusions**: White blood cell, hematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels at the 48th hour are independent predictors of necrosis development. The NDS-48, a new scoring system created with these four predictors, satisfactorily predicted the development of necrosis.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- **Hematocrit > 44%**: Represents an independent risk factor of pancreatic necrosis.

- **Urea > 20 mg/dL**: Represents an independent predictor of mortality.

- **Procalcitonin**: Is the most sensitive laboratory test for detection of pancreatic infection, and low serum values are strong negative predictors of infected pancreatic necrosis.

### HR-MAS MRS of the pancreas reveals reduced lipid and elevated lactate and taurine associated with early pancreatic cancer [^111vTdWz]. NMR in Biomedicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer is extremely poor, as evidenced by the disease's five-year survival rate of approximately 5%. New approaches are therefore urgently needed to improve detection, treatment, and monitoring of pancreatic cancer. MRS-detectable metabolic changes provide useful biomarkers for tumor detection and response-monitoring in other cancers. The goal of this study was to identify MRS-detectable biomarkers of pancreatic cancer that could enhance currently available imaging approaches.

We used (1) H high-resolution magic angle spinning MRS to probe metabolite levels in pancreatic tissue samples from mouse models and patients. In mice, the levels of lipids dropped significantly in pancreata with lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, in pancreata with pre-cancerous metaplasia (4-week-old p48-Cre; LSL-Kras(G12D) mice), and in pancreata with pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, which precedes invasive pancreatic cancer (8-week-old p48-Cre LSL-Kras(G12D) mice), to 26 ± 19% (p = 0.03), 19 ± 16% (p = 0.04), and 26 ± 10% (p = 0.05) of controls, respectively.

Lactate and taurine remained unchanged in inflammation and in pre-cancerous metaplasia but increased significantly in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to 266 ± 61% (p = 0.0001) and 999 ± 174% (p < 0.00001) of controls, respectively. Importantly, analysis of patient biopsies was consistent with the mouse findings. Lipids dropped in pancreatitis and in invasive cancer biopsies to 29 ± 15% (p = 0.01) and 26 ± 38% (p = 0.02) of normal tissue.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^114sscBx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The study examines the increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as an indicator of tissue damage or inflammation in relation to COVID-19.

- **Mortality**: For mortality, the LDH cut-off values ranged from 5 to 629.50 U/L across 10 studies. Excluding the study with a 5 U/L cut-off, the values ranged from 225 to 629.50 U/L. One study had gender-specific cut-offs: 225 U/L for females and 241 U/L for males. Sensitivity ranged from 55% to 95%, and specificity from 0% to 89%. A study with a 5 U/L cut-off reported 0% specificity. The meta-analysis found sensitivity at fixed specificity levels of 19% (Q1), 60% (median), and 80% (Q3) to be 91% (95% CI, 80% to 96%), 82% (95% CI, 66% to 91%), and 74% (95% CI, 53% to 88%), respectively.

- **Deterioration**: For deterioration, the cut-off values ranged from 190 to 285 U/L over 12 studies. Sensitivity varied from 53% to 97%, and specificity from 5% to 82%. At fixed specificity of 51% (Q1), 66% (median), and 78% (Q3), meta-analysis indicated sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 76% to 83%), 79% (95% CI, 76% to 82%), and 79% (95% CI, 75% to 81%), respectively.

- **Combined outcome**: For the combined outcome (4 studies), cut-off values ranged from 250 to 400 U/L. Sensitivity ranged from 54% to 79%, and specificity from 45% to 82%. The meta-analysis provided sensitivity at fixed specificity levels of 57% (Q1), 62% (median), and 68% (Q3) as follows: 72% (95% CI, 52% to 86%), 69% (95% CI, 51% to 82%), and 64% (95% CI, 45% to 80%), respectively.

### Abdominal pain and hyperamylasaemia — not always pancreatitis [^1168XaEd]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A raised serum amylase concentration, at least four times the upper limit of normal (ULN), is used to support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in a patient presenting with abdominal pain. The authors report a case of toxic shock syndrome complicated by a raised serum amylase concentration that peaked at 50 times the ULN in a patient with recurrent abdominal pain. The most common cause of hyperamylasaemia is pancreatic; however, further investigation of serum lipase and amylase isoenzyme studies found this to be of salivary origin and attributable to soft tissue inflammation of the salivary gland. This case highlights the need to consider non-pancreatic causes of hyperamylasaemia.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, the WSES 2019 guidelines recommend considering the use of the BISAP. It is probably one of the most accurate and applicable in everyday clinical practice because of its simplicity and capability to predict severity, death, and organ failure. Additionally, the guidelines suggest using the APACHE-II, although it is very complex, and other scores for predicting severe acute pancreatitis.

### Elevated serum creatinine as a marker of pancreatic necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^115VvhUc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Pancreatic necrosis is a serious complication of acute pancreatitis. Identifying simple laboratory tests to detect subjects at risk of pancreatic necrosis may direct management and improve outcomes. This study focuses on the association between routine laboratory tests and the development of pancreatic necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: In a cohort of 185 patients with acute pancreatitis prospectively enrolled in the Severity of Acute Pancreatitis Study, patients with contrast-enhanced computerized tomography performed were selected (n = 129). Serum hematocrit, creatinine, and urea nitrogen on admission and peak values within 48 hours of admission were analyzed. The volume of intravenous fluid resuscitation was calculated for each patient.

- **Results**: Of 129 patients, 35 (27%) had evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Receiver operating characteristic curves for pancreatic necrosis revealed an area under the curve of 0.79 for admission hematocrit, 0.77 for peak creatinine, and 0.72 for peak urea nitrogen. Binary logistic regression indicated that all three tests were significantly associated with pancreatic necrosis. Peak serum creatinine level greater than 1.8 mg/dl within 48 hours yielded a positive predictive value of 93%.

- **Conclusions**: We confirm that a low admission hematocrit indicates a low risk of pancreatic necrosis.

### Lactate dehydrogenase levels predict coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality: A pooled analysis [^112hbMuZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has reached a pandemic state, affecting more than a million patients worldwide. Predictors of disease outcomes urgently need to be assessed to decrease morbidity and societal burden. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is associated with worse outcomes in patients with viral infections. In this pooled analysis of nine published studies (n = 1532 COVID-19 patients), we evaluated the association between elevated LDH levels measured at the earliest time point in hospitalization and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Elevated LDH levels were associated with an approximately six-fold increase in the odds of developing severe disease and a sixteen-fold increase in the odds of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Interpretation of serum pancreatic enzymes in pancreatic and nonpancreatic conditions [^114UnGxW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate serum levels of amylase and lipase, which can be elevated in nonpancreatic conditions that may or may not be associated with abdominal pain. This misleads many patients to be incorrectly diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The review aims to summarize existing evidence on pancreatic enzyme elevation across various pancreatic and nonpancreatic conditions, highlighting its practical implications in clinical practice and healthcare.

Recent findings suggest that serum amylase and lipase levels are not specific for diagnosing pancreatitis. Efforts have been made to validate newer biomarkers such as pancreatic elastase, serum trypsin, urinary trypsinogen-activated peptide, phospholipase A2, carboxypeptidase B, activated peptide of carboxypeptidase B, the trypsin 2 alpha 1 activation complex, and circulating cell-free DNA for identifying acute pancreatitis.

In summary, serum lipase levels can be elevated in numerous intra-abdominal inflammatory conditions. Although more sensitive and specific than amylase, serum lipase levels alone are insufficient for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain. There is a need to increase reliance on radiological evidence and raise enzyme elevation cut-off levels for a more precise diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1112MVtk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis**: The criteria for establishing the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis include assessing the presence of specific symptoms and using appropriate imaging and laboratory evaluations. The use of MRI, CT scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests plays a significant role. Important laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process, while varying etiologies might impact the diagnostic workup. Furthermore, the appropriate scores for risk assessment must be identified to aid in the diagnosis. Timing and selection of suitable tests are critical for early follow-up imaging.

- **Statements on severity grading**: Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal) and high mortality. The Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity are both effective in diagnosing and determining the severity of acute pancreatitis. Patients with persistent organ failure combined with infected necrosis are at the greatest risk of mortality. Ideally, patients experiencing organ failures should be admitted to an intensive care unit if available.

- **Discussion**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as a condition marked by acute inflammation of the pancreas, characterized histologically by acinar cell destruction. Diagnosis of AP necessitates at least two of the following three criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis with serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit.

### Laboratory diagnostic tests in acute pancreatitis [^111aMxBD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis depends on a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory testing. Although serum amylase is the cornerstone laboratory test used in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, there are limitations in sensitivity and specificity that may be important for the clinician to recognize. The serum lipase level may be especially useful in patients with alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis. A new urinary test strip that uses trypsinogen-2 may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In addition, several new laboratory tests and new interpretations of old laboratory tests may assist in establishing the etiology and severity of acute pancreatitis. This review summarizes important aspects of standard laboratory tests and novel laboratory approaches in establishing the diagnosis, etiology, and severity of acute pancreatitis.

### Lysine-5 acetylation negatively regulates lactate dehydrogenase A and is decreased in pancreatic cancer [^116TUVkp]. Cancer Cell (2013). Low credibility.

Tumor cells commonly have increased glucose uptake and lactate accumulation. Lactate is produced from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), which is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and is important for cell growth. Elevated transcription by c-Myc or HIF1α may contribute to increased LDH-A in some cancer types. Here, we show that LDH-A is acetylated at lysine 5 (K5) and that this acetylation inhibits LDH-A activity. Furthermore, the K5-acetylated LDH-A is recognized by the HSC70 chaperone and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Replacement of endogenous LDH-A with an acetylation mimetic mutant decreases cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, K5 acetylation of LDH-A is reduced in human pancreatic cancers. Our study reveals a mechanism of LDH-A upregulation in pancreatic cancers.

### Risk assessment in acute pancreatitis [^115xyXTy]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis has a variable natural history and, in a proportion of patients, is associated with severe complications and a significant risk of death. The various tools available for risk assessment in acute pancreatitis are reviewed.

- **Methods**: Relevant medical literature from PubMed, Ovid, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library websites up to May 2008 was reviewed.

- **Results and conclusion**: Over the past 30 years, several scoring systems have been developed to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis in the first 48–72 hours. Biochemical and immunological markers, imaging modalities, and novel predictive models may help identify patients at high risk of complications or death. Recently, there has been a recognition of the importance of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and organ dysfunction.

### Correlation of serum and ascitic fluid soluble form urokinase plasminogen activator receptor levels with patient complications, disease severity, inflammatory markers, and prognosis in patients with severe acute pancreatitis [^113j6DC7]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

As for the value of blood suPAR as a marker for disease severity in monitoring critical diseases, a previous study illuminates that a high level of suPAR (defined as > 11 ng/mL) is correlated with a higher possibility of hypotension and elevated SOFA score in patients with bacteremia. Another study exhibits that serum suPAR concentration on admission is closely and independently associated with levels of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein), as well as hepatic and renal dysfunction in sepsis patients.

In a previous study from our research team, we observed that plasma suPAR level on the first therapeutic day was associated with a higher risk of MODS in patients with SIRS. Another previous study from our research team found that plasma suPAR level was positively correlated with disease severity, serum PCT level, APACHE II score, and SOFA score in patients with ARDS. These indicated that suPAR could serve as a marker for disease severity in critical diseases, especially inflammation-involved diseases. However, little is known about the role of suPAR in monitoring disease severity in patients with SAP.

In this present study, we discovered that serum suPAR level was positively correlated with APACHE II score, Balthazar index, and SOFA score in patients with SAP. Additionally, suPAR level was raised in patients with the presence of pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic infection, and MODS — severe complications related to SAP. The possible explanations are as follows: suPAR expression reflects coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, and immune responses.

### Origin, presentation, and clinical course of nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia [^112DCcDD]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as a constellation of abnormal pancreatic enzymes, imaging, and characteristic pain. The origin and clinical significance of isolated hyperlipasemia is unclear.

- **Methods**: We prospectively evaluated patients with serum lipase level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) admitted to Los Angeles County Hospital from October 2014 to April 2015. Patients were identified by a daily laboratory query used to support an ongoing randomized trial of goal-directed therapy for AP (NCT 01761539). Nonpancreatic hyperlipasemia (NPHL) was defined as a serum lipase level greater than 3 times the ULN without characteristic pain or imaging.

- **Results**: Among 221 patients with lipase level greater than 3 times the ULN, 170 met criterion for AP, and 51 did not. The leading etiologies for NPHL were decompensated cirrhosis and renal failure. Patients with NPHL were significantly older and had more comorbidities and lower serum lipase levels (360 ± 36 vs. 1453 ± 135 IU/L, P < 0.001). There were no differences in length of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated serum lipase level has many nonpancreatic origins, with liver and renal failure being the most frequent. Distinct clinical features can help to differentiate between AP and NPHL.

### Factors associated with serial lipase measurement in hospitalized patients with acute pancreatitis [^114NFxw1]. Pancreas (2023). High credibility.

To determine the factors associated with serial lipase measurement in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), a study was conducted. Patients admitted to Johns Hopkins Health System between September 2019 and August 2020 with lipase levels ≥ 3 times the upper limit normal were prospectively identified. Acute pancreatitis was defined using revised Atlanta criteria. Serial lipase measurement was defined as more than two lipase measurements on consecutive days within seven days of presentation.

The study involved 294 patients with AP, with a mean age of 52.4 ± 16 years. Of these, 155 (52.7%) were male, and 227 (77.2%) were admitted to a medical service. A total of 111 (37.7%) underwent serial lipase measurements. Additionally, 89 (30.8%) exhibited systemic inflammatory response syndrome at the time of initial lipase measurement, 36 (12.2%) had persistent organ failure, 6 (1%) had necrosis on admission, and 40 (13.6%) required intensive care unit admission. Serial lipase measurements were more likely in patients admitted to surgical services (odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–13.2; P = 0.01) and nontertiary hospitals (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.9; P = 0.04).

In conclusion, more than one-third of AP patients undergo serial lipase measurements, a practice more prevalent on surgical services and in nontertiary hospitals.

### The ratio of red blood cell distribution width to serum calcium predicts severity of patients with acute pancreatitis [^1154v7gT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Illness severity in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) at an early stage is crucial because identifying moderate and severe cases necessitates early intensive care to reduce the risk of serious complications, such as multi-organ failure. Although red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and serum calcium (Ca) alone can be used as predictors of AP severity, they have low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the value of the ratio of RDW to serum calcium, which can all be acquired on admission, in predicting the severity of AP.

- **Methods**: This study was based on a retrospective cohort study of patients with AP at the emergency department (ED) of West China Hospital from January 2016 to June 2016. We divided the patients with AP into two groups: mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) and moderate-severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) + severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of the ratio of RDW to serum calcium for the severity of AP patients. The cut-off value for the ratio of RDW to serum calcium was calculated with sensitivity and specificity. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

- **Results**: A total of 666 AP patients were enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into MAP (n = 518) and MSAP + SAP (n = 148) groups. The AUC of RDW/Ca was 0.912 (95% CI 0.887 to 0.937, P < 0.001), which is larger than the AUCs of RDW (AUC = 0.768, 95% CI 0.723 to 0.812, P < 0.001) and Ca (AUC = 0.875, 95% CI 0.844 to 0.906, P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off value was determined, but it was not included in the provided text.

### Causal evaluation of acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis in children: Consensus from the INSPPIRE group [^112YTtJf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pediatric pancreatitis, specifically concerning laboratory testing, the INSPPIRE 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyltransferase, TBIL (with fractionation if total is elevated), fasting lipids, and total serum calcium in the initial evaluation of patients with recurrent pancreatitis.

### Apache II: a severity of disease classification system [^116mXfA9]. Critical Care Medicine (1985). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "APACHE II" is essential for evaluating critical illnesses such as mechanical ventilation, thyroid storm, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, acute diverticulitis, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, intra-abdominal abscess, community-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock.

The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) is a severity-of-disease classification system specifically designed for critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). It is a composite score incorporating 12 physiological variables, including vital signs, arterial blood gas measurements, and serum biochemical parameters, along with age and chronic health status. The score ranges from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of illness and a higher risk of mortality.

The APACHE II score is primarily used to predict ICU mortality and can also provide an estimate of ICU length of stay. It is a valuable tool for risk stratification, enabling clinicians to identify patients who may require more intensive monitoring and intervention, and facilitating communication about patient prognosis.

However, the APACHE II score should not be used in isolation to guide clinical decision-making, as it does not account for all individual patient factors. It is also not applicable to pediatric patients or patients admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery, as it was not validated in these populations.

### The utility of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase in current clinical practice [^11554ccX]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Because of its wide tissue distribution, elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LD) is a nonspecific finding. Although serum LD is still included in the prognosis and staging of metastatic melanoma and germ cell tumors, its nonspecificity has led to decreased usefulness.

- **Methods**: In this study, we analyzed the serum LD assays performed in a 726-bed hospital during a 1-year period and reviewed charts of patients with serum LD of > 3 standard deviations (SD).

- **Results**: Of 312 patients with elevated serum LD, only 9 were patients with melanoma and germ cell tumors. The other 303 patients had other malignancies, chronic conditions, and sepsis.

- **Conclusion**: Elevated serum LD (even > 3 SD) is an extremely nonspecific finding that does not contribute to clinical management in a majority of patients. As such, serum LD testing should be retired from routine clinical order sets and restricted in use.

### WSES project on decision support systems based on artificial neural networks in emergency surgery [^111cuZva]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The first attempt to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis using an ANN was undertaken by Kazmierczak et al. by analyzing the serum concentration of pancreatic enzymes in blood serum. Pancreatic lipase was the best predictor of the severity of acute pancreatitis, with an accuracy of 82% (95% confidence interval: 77–87). In contrast, using the serum amylase value, the prediction accuracy was quite low at 76% (71–81). Meanwhile, the combination of indicators such as lipase and amylase did not significantly increase the accuracy of the created ANN, with a predictive accuracy of 84% (79–89).

Pofahl et al. used ANN to predict the hospital length of stay of patients with acute pancreatitis. They compared ANNs with the Ranson and APACHE II scoring systems in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy. The authors provided information on the high sensitivity (75%), specificity (81%), and accuracy (79%) of ANN in identifying the severity of acute pancreatitis as measured by length of stay.

In research by Keogan et al, a neural network model was used to predict a prolonged treatment duration for a patient with acute pancreatitis, longer than the average of 8.4 days. The ANN showed the best predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.83 ± 0.05) compared to the Ranson (AUC = 0.68 ± 0.06; P < 0.02) and Balthazar (AUC = 0.62 ± 0.06; P < 0.003) scales. However, there were no significant differences in predicting the duration of treatment for acute pancreatitis (AUC = 0.82 ± 0.05; P = 0.53) in comparison with the linear discriminant function.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, with respect to risk assessment, the BPIGS 2016 guidelines recommend diagnosing severe acute pancreatitis in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- **CRP levels**: CRP ≥ 14,286 nmol/L (150 mg/dL) at baseline or within the first 72 hours.

- **APACHE II score**: APACHE II score ≥ 8 at baseline or within the first 72 hours.

- **Organ failure**: Signs of persistent organ failure for more than 48 hours, despite adequate IV fluid resuscitation.

### Hemoconcentration and pancreatic necrosis: Further defining the relationship [^111o88Rs]. Pancreas (2006). Low credibility.

In the setting of acute pancreatitis, an admission hematocrit greater than or equal to 44%, and/or a failure of hematocrit to drop at 24 hours, have been reported as useful markers to predict subsequent necrosis. We aimed to validate the use of hemoconcentration as a marker to predict necrosis in adult patients presenting with acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to our medical center from 1990 to 2003 with a first presentation of acute pancreatitis were identified. Charts were abstracted for baseline demographic and clinical information, including admission and 24-hour hematocrit, and subsequent hospital course. Necrosis was determined based on computed tomography scan. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (NPV) for different admissions, and 24-hour hematocrit levels in predicting the subsequent development of necrosis.

- **Results**: Two hundred thirty patients were identified. Admission hematocrit (≥ 44%) was a poor predictor of subsequent necrosis with a sensitivity of 52.9%. The absence of hemoconcentration at admission or a drop in 24-hour hematocrit level was reliable in predicting that patients would not develop necrosis (NPV of 94.7% for hematocrit ≥ 44%). Results were similar when we compared a range of admission and 24-hour hematocrit values.

- **Conclusions**: In a community setting with low rates of necrosis, admission and 24-hour hematocrit levels were not helpful in predicting subsequent necrosis. The absence of admission hemoconcentration had strong NPV for necrosis.

### Applying Ockham's razor to pancreatitis prognostication: A four-variable predictive model [^115yKEXs]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

We sought to develop a simple yet accurate prognostic scoring system to determine the severity of acute pancreatitis at admission. Because acute pancreatitis has a variable and frequently unpredictable course, identifying individuals at greatest risk for significant, life-threatening complications and stratifying their care appropriately remains a concern. Previous prognostic scoring systems predict severity reasonably well but are limited by time constraints, are unwieldy to use, or both.

Data from the international phase III trial of the platelet-activating factor receptor-antagonist Lexipafant were used to develop a 4-variable prognostic model. We then compared the model's ability to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis with the Ranson, Glasgow, and APACHE II systems. The model (BALI), which included BUN ≥ 25 mg/dL, age ≥ 65 years, LDH ≥ 300 IU/L, and IL-6 ≥ 300 pg/mL, measured at admission, was similar to the Ranson, Glasgow, and APACHE II systems in its ability to identify increased mortality from acute pancreatitis. The receiver operating characteristic curve area for the BALI model was ≥ 0.82 ± 0.03 (mean ± SD) versus 0.75 ± 0.04 (Ranson), 0.80 ± 0.03 (Glasgow), and 0.79 ± 0.03 (APACHE II). Furthermore, at a prevalence of 15%, the positive and negative predictive values for increased mortality were similar for all systems.

The prognostic ability of the BALI 4-variable model was similar to the Ranson, Glasgow, and APACHE II systems but is unique in its simplicity and ability.

### Low frequency of acute pancreatitis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^112EK2Kj]. Pancreas (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of increased serum pancreatic enzymes (PEs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has not yet been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the frequency and the impact on clinical outcomes of PE elevation and acute pancreatitis in these patients.

Clinical data, laboratory tests, and cross-sectional images were analyzed from COVID-19 patients admitted to the Tor Vergata Hospital in Rome. Variables associated with PE abnormalities, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses and the Cox proportional hazard model.

Pancreatic enzymes were available in 254 of 282 COVID-19 patients. Among these, 66 patients (26%) showed mild elevation of PE, and 11 patients (4.3%) had severe elevation (> 3 times the upper limit of normal). Overall, 2 patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Hepatic and renal involvements were associated with PE elevation. Multivariate analysis revealed that mild and severe PE elevations were significantly associated with ICU admission, with odds ratios of 5.51 (95% confidence interval, 2.36–12.89; P < 0.0001) and 26.2 (95% confidence interval, 4.82–142.39; P < 0.0001), respectively.

In conclusion, an increase in serum PE, but not acute pancreatitis, is frequent in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is associated with ICU admission.

### Who's at risk? A prognostic model for severity prediction in pediatric acute pancreatitis [^1178UUkC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Several adult studies have linked elevated BUN levels to increased severity in acute pancreatitis (AP), whether as part of the bedside index for severity of AP scoring or as a stand-alone predictor of severity. The proposed mechanism is that the elevated BUN reflects intravascular volume depletion as opposed to renal involvement, given the lack of observed change in the creatinine between the two groups. There is also adult data to suggest that decreased albumin on admission is an independent predictor of disease severity in AP as a marker of persistent organ failure, both at admission and then again at 48 hours after admission, likely reflecting the underlying inflammatory state, although the precise mechanism remains unclear.

Persistent BUN elevation in our population was also predictive of severity, and BUN elevation at 24–48 hours was an independent predictor of severity in this population. This is a novel finding not previously reported in the pediatric literature. Although it showed similar trends from the adult literature, previous studies did not address the management effects on the BUN change. We have shown that persistent elevation of BUN was a predictor of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) independent from rates and types of fluids the patient had received.

Multiple attempts have been made to develop prognostic models for severity in pediatric AP. DeBanto et al. developed the Pediatric Acute Pancreatitis Score, which was modeled after adult scoring metrics and involves demographic and biochemical data at admission and then again at 48 hours to calculate the score.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the first 72 hours [^116Rxvou]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a common condition that affects patients with varying degrees of severity and may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the paradigm in acute pancreatitis management within the first 72 hours of diagnosis.

- **Purpose of review**: Patients presenting with acute pancreatitis should be clinically evaluated for signs and symptoms of organ failure to appropriately triage them. Initial management should focus on fluid resuscitation, with some data supporting Ringer's lactate over physiological saline.

- **Recent findings**: Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in acute pancreatitis is not recommended, nor is urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of concomitant acute cholangitis. Early oral feeding should be encouraged and not avoided, while the use of parenteral nutrition is discouraged. Cholecystectomy should be performed during the same admission for biliary pancreatitis to prevent future episodes. Patients with acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol should receive alcohol counseling. There is ongoing interest in developing prognostic laboratory tests and pharmacological therapies to reduce inflammation in acute pancreatitis.

- **Summary**: Acute pancreatitis is a common and heterogeneous condition with the potential for significant morbidity. Best practices in acute pancreatitis management focus on triage, hydration, and enteral feeding.

### A role for von Hippel-Lindau protein in pancreatic beta-cell function [^115y87a1]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Gene expression assessment by quantitative PCR revealed a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDHa, Fig. 5 C) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK, Fig. 5 C). LDHa catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and is maintained at low levels in islets during homeostasis, presumably to ensure maximal amounts of pyruvate being shunted toward oxidative phosphorylation. PDK is an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which normally catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Upregulation of PDK leads to a decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, consequently decreasing oxidation of pyruvate in the mitochondria and increasing the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion in the cytosol.

Indeed, VHL mutant islets show a drastic increase in the expression of MCT4 (Fig. 5 C), a monocarboxylate transporter that mediates efflux of lactate from glycolytically active cells. Quantitative PCR analysis indicates that loss of Vhlh in β-cells results in increased glycolytic metabolism. In agreement with these results, we detected increased lactate in the growth medium upon culturing mutant islets (Fig. 5 D). Thus, given that LDHa, PDK, and MCT4 are all downstream targets of HIFα proteins, the concerted increased activity of these genes points to a modification of intracellular respiration that may lead to a block in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

### Therapeutic strategies toward lactate dehydrogenase within the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer [^112o8Ywc]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a key metabolic role within the tumor microenvironment (stroma) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), being glycolytic and associated with protumorigenic acidification from excess lactate. This study investigates the clinical significance of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and determines the efficacy of the novel pan-LDH inhibitor Galloflavin. An in vitro Transwell system was adopted for coculture of PSCs and three PDAC cell lines: MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, and BxPC-3. Cells were treated with Galloflavin, and outcomes were analyzed regarding proliferation, apoptosis, lactate production, and glycolytic enzyme protein expression. Immunohistochemical staining for lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) was performed on 59 resected PDAC tumors annotated for clinical outcomes.

Galloflavin reduced PDAC proliferation in monoculture (P < 0.01); however, in coculture with PSCs, an antiproliferative effect was only evident in PANC-1 (P = 0.001). An apoptotic effect was observed in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 in coculture (P < 0.05). A reduction in media lactate was observed in coculture (P < 0.01) with PSCs. Immunohistochemistry revealed that stromal and tumoral LDHB expression had no impact on survival.

Galloflavin has the potential to neutralize the acidic PDAC microenvironment, thereby reducing tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Patients with lower LDHB expression are more likely to be beneficial responders.

### Metabolomics approaches in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: Tumor metabolism profiling predicts clinical outcome of patients [^112JpPaY]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our results about pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) metabolome show a higher level of lactate in patients who did not receive any neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Elevated expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is highlighted in breast and colorectal cancers and has been recently identified in pancreatic cancers. Some studies have already shown the different steps where LDHA is involved, including tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression.

Given the elevated glycolysis in PA, leading to increased lactate production, the ability to utilize lactate could provide an additional advantage to PA cells. Indeed, the inhibition of glycolysis through suppressing LDHA expression by RNA interference decreased the growth of PA cells. Our study may provide new targets to treat PA. When patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and patients who did not were compared, neoadjuvant chemotherapy seemed to have an inhibiting effect on LDHA expression.

A higher level of lactate in patients who did not receive any neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that survival of PA was highly dependent on LDHA activity in a hypoxic environment. This higher level of lactate could be linked to improved responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Indeed, lactate might be a predictive marker for assessing the response of tumor cells to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, lactate could be correlated with tumor neoadjuvant chemotherapy in predicting responses to this therapy. Elevated levels of lactate are prognostic biomarkers for poor survival in several cancers. Our findings suggest that lactate could be an important marker for screening.
