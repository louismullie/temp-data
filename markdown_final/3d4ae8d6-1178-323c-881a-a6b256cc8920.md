## Question

A 68-year-old man with a 3-year history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presents to clinic with worsening exertional dyspnoea and lower limb oedema. He is on long-term oxygen therapy and his pulmonary function tests show a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 55% predicted. Recent echocardiography reveals a systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) of 60 mmHg. The extent of his interstitial lung disease on high-resolution CT is moderate and stable compared to previous imaging. His symptoms appear to have worsened disproportionately to the radiological progression of his IPF.

Based on current BTS guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's pulmonary hypertension?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing suspected pulmonary hypertension in a 68-year-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, worsening dyspnea, and an echocardiographic systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 60 mmHg, with symptoms disproportionate to stable ILD on HRCT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the clinical picture meets criteria for suspected pulmonary hypertension and whether it is disproportionate to the extent of ILD. Then, I should verify what the BTS guideline specifically recommends for ILD-associated PH that is severe or disproportionate. Next, I will consider the role of echocardiography versus right heart catheterization and whether RHC is indicated now. Finally, I will synthesize the recommendation and note any caveats or alternatives, anchoring to BTS and contemporary PH guidance to ensure alignment with best practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical suspicion of PH and its severity. An estimated sPAP around 60 mmHg on echocardiography is high and, in the context of ILD, raises concern for lung disease–associated PH, particularly when symptoms are disproportionate to the degree of parenchymal disease on HRCT, which is exactly the scenario the BTS guideline flags for further evaluation and referral [^2df79d72] [^ea76c0df].

> Wait, let me verify the BTS recommendation language so I don't overstate it. The BTS/ITS/TSANZ guideline advises that patients with ILD and PH judged to be contributing to symptoms and disproportionate to the extent of ILD, or with severe PH defined as sPAP greater than 50 mmHg, should be referred to a regional specialist PH center for assessment and recruitment to high-quality clinical trials, which fits this case precisely given the sPAP of 60 mmHg and the disproportionate symptom burden relative to stable imaging [^ea76c0df] [^405e4dd4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting therapy yet. I initially thought, "Should I escalate antifibrotics or add a PAH-specific vasodilator now?" But wait, I should double-check the diagnostic pathway. Echocardiography is a screening tool and cannot confirm PH or distinguish pre- from post-capillary physiology; definitive diagnosis and hemodynamic profiling require right heart catheterization in experienced centers, and contemporary ESC/ERS guidance reinforces that RHC is indicated when the results will aid management decisions, which they clearly would here to confirm PH, quantify severity, and classify the hemodynamic phenotype before any PAH-directed therapy is considered [^a63b7e31] [^67f602dd].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning with the broader consensus on PH in lung disease. The ESC/ERS guidance emphasizes that in patients with lung disease and suspected PH, RHC is appropriate when results will change management, and it cautions against empiric PAH-specific therapy in Group 3 PH without careful hemodynamic confirmation and multidisciplinary input, reinforcing the need for specialist referral and structured evaluation rather than immediate pharmacologic escalation [^67f602dd] [^63b13739].

> Let me synthesize the next step clearly. Based on BTS guidance and contemporary PH standards, the most appropriate next step is urgent referral to a regional specialist pulmonary hypertension center for comprehensive evaluation, including right heart catheterization to confirm the diagnosis, characterize hemodynamics, and assess suitability for clinical trials or guideline-concordant management pathways, given the severe echocardiographic PH and disproportionate symptoms in the setting of stable ILD [^ea76c0df] [^a63b7e31].

> But wait, what if access to a PH center is delayed? I should confirm that in the interim we continue optimized ILD care, ensure oxygenation targets are maintained, and monitor for signs of right heart failure, while avoiding initiation of PAH-specific vasodilators outside a PH center because misclassification and inappropriate therapy can cause harm; this conservative approach is consistent with both BTS and ESC/ERS positions on not starting PAH drugs empirically in lung disease–associated PH without confirmed hemodynamics and expert oversight [^ea76c0df] [^63b13739].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **refer to a specialist pulmonary hypertension center** for comprehensive evaluation and consideration of clinical trials, as per BTS guidance for ILD-associated PH that is severe (sPAP> 50 mmHg) or disproportionate to the extent of ILD [^ea76c0df] [^405e4dd4]. This referral should occur **before initiating any PAH-specific therapy**, because evidence for benefit in ILD-associated PH is limited and management is best coordinated by experts [^b0365daf] [^63b13739]. Immediate actions should include optimizing IPF care, continuing oxygen, and arranging urgent PH center referral; right heart catheterization will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide any trial enrollment or targeted therapy [^a63b7e31].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnostic confirmation

- **Confirm PH severity and hemodynamics**: Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard to confirm PH, quantify severity, and distinguish pre- vs post-capillary disease; it is essential before PAH-specific therapy in ILD-associated PH [^a63b7e31] [^67f602dd].

- **Evaluate disproportionate PH**: The BTS guideline advises suspecting PH in ILD when breathlessness or desaturation is disproportionate to the extent of parenchymal disease, warranting specialist referral and RHC [^2df79d72] [^ea76c0df].

- **Assess for alternative or contributing causes**: Exclude chronic thromboembolic disease (V/Q scan/CTPA) and left heart disease (echo/BNP), as these alter management and trial eligibility [^d5fc7361] [^09b96ceb].

---

## BTS guideline recommendations

The BTS guideline explicitly recommends referring patients with ILD and PH that is **severe (sPAP> 50 mmHg)** or **disproportionate to the extent of ILD** to a regional specialist PH center for assessment and recruitment to high-quality clinical trials [^ea76c0df] [^405e4dd4]. It also advises against routine use of PAH-specific therapies in ILD-associated PH outside trials, given limited evidence of benefit and potential harm [^b0365daf].

---

## Role of specialist pulmonary hypertension centers

Specialist centers provide:

- **Multidisciplinary expertise**: Cardiology, pulmonology, radiology, and transplant evaluation to optimize care and trial selection [^92c44054].

- **Access to clinical trials**: Essential for ILD-associated PH, where evidence for PAH therapies remains limited [^b0365daf].

- **Advanced diagnostics**: Standardized RHC, advanced imaging, and hemodynamic phenotyping to guide management [^a63b7e31].

---

## Current evidence and clinical trials

Evidence for PAH therapies in ILD-associated PH is limited; **RCTs are ongoing** to test agents such as riociguat, inhaled treprostinil, and others. Early referral enables timely enrollment and access to potentially beneficial therapies under expert supervision [^ea76c0df].

---

## Practical management steps

- **Optimize IPF care**: Continue antifibrotic therapy and supportive care, including oxygen and vaccinations [^notfound].

- **Urgent PH center referral**: Arrange within weeks given the severity and symptom burden [^ce9ec1c0].

- **Avoid empiric PAH therapy**: Do not start PAH-specific drugs until PH center evaluation and RHC are completed [^a63b7e31].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm PH severity and hemodynamics with RHC | Gold standard; essential before PAH therapy [^a63b7e31] |
| 2 | Refer to specialist PH center | BTS recommendation for severe/disproportionate PH in ILD [^ea76c0df] |
| 3 | Exclude CTEPH and left heart disease | Alternative causes alter management [^d5fc7361] [^09b96ceb] |
| 4 | Consider clinical trial enrollment | Access to evidence-based therapies and expert care [^ea76c0df] |
| 5 | Avoid empiric PAH therapy | Limited evidence; potential harm in ILD-associated PH [^b0365daf] |

---

The next step is to **refer to a specialist PH center** for comprehensive evaluation and trial consideration, with RHC to confirm the diagnosis and guide management, while optimizing IPF care and avoiding empiric PAH therapy [^ea76c0df] [^a63b7e31].

### Elevated pulmonary pressure noted on echocardiogram: a simplified approach to next steps [^469bd0d7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

An elevated right ventricular/pulmonary artery systolic pressure suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common finding noted on echocardiography and is considered a marker for poor clinical outcomes, regardless of the cause. Even mild elevation of pulmonary pressure can be considered a modifiable risk factor, informing the trajectory of patients' clinical outcome. Although guidelines have been published detailing diagnostic and management algorithms, this echocardiographic finding is often underappreciated or not acted upon. Hence, patients with PH are often diagnosed in clinical practice when hemodynamic abnormalities are already moderate or severe. This results in delayed initiation of potentially effective therapies, referral to PH centers, and greater patient morbidity and mortality. This mini-review presents a succinct, simplified case-based approach to the "next steps" in the work-up of PH, once elevated pulmonary pressures have been noted on an echocardiogram. Our goal is for clinicians to develop a good overview of diagnostic approach to PH and recognition of high-risk features that may require early referral.

### Diagnosis: pulmonary hypertension. next steps [^0228960a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease that is generally first encountered by primary care physicians. Usually, patients present with dyspnea on exertion and a loss of exercise tolerance, although they can have symptoms of chest discomfort, syncope, or edema. Most patients are diagnosed with 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography although echo is not 100% sensitive or specific in making this diagnosis. Note that the diagnostic criteria for this disease have changed recently. Most patients develop PH secondary to left heart failure, or to pulmonary disease with or without hypoxemia. Ultimately, many patients require right heart catheterization for diagnosis and for proper treatment. This is best performed by those that specialize in management of this disease. It is important to diagnose patients who have PH due to pulmonary artery hypertension and patients with chronic thromboembolic PH as these patients require specialized treatment that is most effective if started early in the disease course. This review discusses issues related to diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with PH.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^775d5b62]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, over 69 064 hospital episodes of pulmonary embolism (PE) were reported between 2021 and 2022, resulting in 36 757 admissions.Up to 50% of patients with PE will have residual symptoms,with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a serious but uncommon complication, occurring in approximately 2% of patients.The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guideline recommends that all hospitals should have local protocols and pathways in place for follow-up of all patients with PE and follow-up should be performed by clinicians with a special interest in venous thromboembolism (VTE).The BTS audit of outpatient PE management found that structured follow-up of patients presenting with PE is suboptimal: 87% of UK centres performed follow-up at 3 months, with this occurring in a dedicated PE clinic in 36% of the centres.In addition, a survey of UK physicians found that only 46% of respondents reported that ≥75% of patients were offered a 3-month to 6-month follow-up,and a retrospective, single-centre UK study found that 32% of intermediate-high risk and 37% of patients with intermediate-low risk PE were not followed up.To address the gap in practical advice for follow-up of PE, a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist identified sixteen key questions that they are often asked by physicians assessing patients following an acute PE. Authors conducted a non-systematic literature search for each question and drafted a suggested approach for coauthor review and round-table discussion to achieve consensus.

### Elevated pulmonary pressure noted on echocardiogram: a simplified approach to next steps [^9561016e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is a common noninvasive screening tool used to assess patients with shortness of breath. 1 Pulmonary hypertension (PH), often noted on TTE as elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), is caused by a heterogeneous group of disorders and is well recognized to be associated with higher morbidity and mortality, regardless of cause. 2 It is particularly important to identify patients who may have World Health Organization (WHO) group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or WHO Group 4 chronic thromboembolic PH, since it has significant implications for their prognosis and management strategies. Unfortunately, in spite of published guidelines, there has been no meaningful decrease in the time from symptom onset to diagnosis of PAH in the past 20 years. 1 On the other hand, there is a rising tendency to the misuse of PAH‐specific therapies in patients with left heart disease (LHD) or lung disease associated PH. 3 This results in misdiagnosis/ incorrect categorization of PH subgroups, inappropriate prescription of pulmonary vasodilator medications, and delays in referral to PH centers in clinical practice. Hence, there is an unmet need for increased awareness to more appropriately diagnose, manage, and/or refer patients with PH.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) carries a poor prognosis if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated. The development and approval of 14 medications over the last several decades have led to a rapidly evolving approach to therapy, and have necessitated periodic updating of evidence-based treatment guidelines. This guideline statement, which now includes a visual algorithm to enhance its clinical utility, represents the fourth iteration of the American College of Chest Physicians Guideline and Expert Panel Report on Pharmacotherapy for PAH.

Methods

The guideline panel conducted an updated systematic review to identify studies published after those included in the 2014 guideline. A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were developed and voted on using a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus.

Results

Two new recommendations on combination therapy and two ungraded consensus-based statements on palliative care were developed. An evidence-based and consensus-driven treatment algorithm was created to guide the clinician through an organized approach to management, and to direct readers to the appropriate area of the document for more detailed information.

Conclusions

Therapeutic options for the patient with PAH continue to expand through basic discovery, translational science, and clinical trials. Optimal use of new treatment options requires prompt evaluation at an expert center, utilization of current evidence-based guidelines, and collaborative care using sound clinical judgment.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^bc1bcede]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

2022 ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension—what is new: The new definitions of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are endorsed and expanded, including “a revised cut-off level for pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and a definition of exercise PH.” The PH classification “has been updated.” For diagnosis, “a new algorithm has been developed aiming at earlier detection of PH in the community,” and “expedited referral is recommended for high-risk or complex patients,” with “screening strategies” proposed. Risk assessment changes include that “The risk-stratification table has been expanded to include additional echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) prognostic indicators,” initial therapy recommendations “have been simplified, building on this revised, three-strata, multiparametric risk model,” and “At follow-up, a four-strata risk-assessment tool is now proposed… categorizing patients as low, intermediate-low, intermediate-high, or high risk.” The pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatment algorithm “has been modified, highlighting the importance of cardiopulmonary comorbidities, risk assessment both at diagnosis and follow-up, and the importance of combination therapies.”

### Medical therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^b1053e8d]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is often difficult to diagnose and challenging to treat. Untreated, it is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right ventricular failure and death. The past decade has seen remarkable improvements in therapy, driven largely by the conduct of randomized controlled trials. Still, the selection of most appropriate therapy is complex, and requires familiarity with the disease process, evidence from treatment trials, complicated drug delivery systems, dosing regimens, side effects, and complications. This chapter will provide evidence-based treatment recommendations for physicians involved in the care of these complex patients. Due to the complexity of the diagnostic evaluation required, and the treatment options available, it is strongly recommended that consideration be given to referral of patients with PAH to a specialized center.

ISHLT members have recognized the importance of a consensus statement on the evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The creation of this document required multiple steps, including the engagement of the ISHLT councils, approval by the Standards and Guidelines Committee, identification and selection of experts in the field, and the development of 6 working groups. Each working group provided a separate section based on an extensive literature search. These sections were then coalesced into a single document that was circulated to all members of the working groups. Key points were summarized at the end of each section. Due to the limited number of comparative trials in this field, the document was written as a literature review with expert opinion rather than based on level of evidence.

For ‘PH possible’ without symptoms and without associated conditions or risk factors, echocardiographic follow-up is recommended; if symptomatic with associated conditions or risk factors, right heart catheterization (RHC) may be considered. For ‘PH likely’, when symptomatic regardless of associated conditions or risk factors, RHC is recommended; when without symptoms, RHC should be considered.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^d67aeebd]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension combination therapy decision considerations—The guideline notes that “the addition of therapies to existing treatments or the use of multiple therapies as initial treatment remains a complicated issue,” and that adding new therapies “requires that the clinician assess whether the patient has received an adequate trial of the initial therapy to assess efficacy and clinical status.” This assessment “includes evaluation of the duration of therapy, the expected response to the therapy, the observed response to the therapy, and the patient’s severity of illness and pace of decline,” and “symptomatic limitation of desired physical activities usually guides these decisions.”

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) diagnosis—The diagnosis of PH requires a clinical suspicion based on symptoms and physical examination and review of a comprehensive set of investigations to confirm that haemodynamic criteria are met and to describe the aetiology and the functional and haemodynamic severity of the condition. The interpretation of these investigations requires, at the very least, expertise in cardiology, imaging and respiratory medicine and may best be discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting; this is particularly important for identifying patients who may have more than one cause of PH. The main cause of PH should be identified according to the clinical classification in Table 4, and an algorithm for reaching a diagnosis is shown in Figure 1.

### Updated treatment algorithm of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^74bdfcb1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The demands on a pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatment algorithm are multiple and in some ways conflicting. The treatment algorithm usually includes different types of recommendations with varying degrees of scientific evidence. In addition, the algorithm is required to be comprehensive but not too complex, informative yet simple and straightforward. The type of information in the treatment algorithm are heterogeneous including clinical, hemodynamic, medical, interventional, pharmacological and regulatory recommendations. Stakeholders (or users) including physicians from various specialties and with variable expertise in PAH, nurses, patients and patients' associations, healthcare providers, regulatory agencies and industry are often interested in the PAH treatment algorithm for different reasons. These are the considerable challenges faced when proposing appropriate updates to the current evidence-based treatment algorithm.The current treatment algorithm may be divided into 3 main areas: 1) general measures, supportive therapy, referral strategy, acute vasoreactivity testing and chronic treatment with calcium channel blockers; 2) initial therapy with approved PAH drugs; and 3) clinical response to the initial therapy, combination therapy, balloon atrial septostomy, and lung transplantation. All three sections will be revisited highlighting information newly available in the past 5 years and proposing updates where appropriate. The European Society of Cardiology grades of recommendation and levels of evidence will be adopted to rank the proposed treatments.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^3f1c9232]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST grading system for recommendations in pulmonary arterial hypertension defines category descriptors and implications: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence—“Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa,” with “We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect,” and “Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.” Weak (conditional) recommendation, high-quality evidence—“Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden,” with “We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect,” and “The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients’ or societal values. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.” Ungraded consensus-based suggestions reflect an “Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement” where there is “Uncertainty because of lack of evidence but expert opinion that benefits outweigh risk and burdens or vice versa” and “Insufficient evidence for a graded recommendation.”

Purpose Of Review

To understand the rational of establishing a goal-oriented therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension management.

Recent Findings

During the last decades, the development of targeted therapies and the recognition of prognostic markers represented a major step for improving pulmonary arterial hypertension survival. Now, changing the strategy on using these compounds therapies might represent the best way to optimize treatment response.

Summary

Prespecified goals with regular reassessment should be incorporated as the routine practice for pulmonary arterial hypertension management to provide the best available treatment, aiming to improve or maintain every patient in a clinical and functional status that reflects better long-term survival.

### Rehabilitation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [^fc7c5305]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Rehabilitation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis PatientsClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The incidence and prevalence of IPF increase exponentially with age, and IPF occurs more often in older males. Cigarette smoking and environmental dust exposures are known risk factors for developing IPF. For example, the recently deployed military population, as it ages, is at especially increased risk of IPF. No effective therapies exist, although lung transplantation is used to extend survival of selected patients. Defining specific therapy to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea in IPF patients is thus an urgent priority of veteran-oriented research programs. Chronic lung disease is common in the veteran population. While chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is most prominent, fibrotic lung diseases, typified by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are clearly increasing.

We have developed extensive experience with a VA idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis population in the context of a randomized, controlled clinical trial of vasodilator therapy. Based on the current literature and our preliminary experience with exercise testing in IPF patients, we hypothesize that: Formal pulmonary rehabilitation will result in improved outcomes for IPF patients, demonstrable as an:
- Increase in exercise tolerance as quantified by 6-minute walk test distance;
- Decrease in post-exercise dyspnea as quantified by the Borg dyspnea scale; and an
- Overall subjective improvement in quality of life as quantified by Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire.

Metabolic and physiologic mechanisms of improved exercise tolerance and decreased dyspnea will include:
- More efficient oxygen metabolism demonstrated by maximum O2 uptake;
- Decreased post-exercise oxidant stress demonstrated by post-exercise isoprostanes and plasma total antioxidant capacity; and,
- Maintenance of maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Our Specific Objectives are: To investigate formal pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise tolerance in IPF patients The following important endpoints will be assessed to test the working hypothesis that pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity and lessens dyspnea:
- 6-MWT distance;
- Dyspnea index; and,
- Quality of life.
- To assess changes in oxygen uptake, markers of oxidant stress and pulmonary function resulting from pulmonary rehabilitation.

To test the working hypothesis that improved outcomes are associated with more efficient O2 utilization, decreased markers of oxidant stress and maintained effort dependent pulmonary function, the following variables will be measured:
- Peak oxygen uptake during constant load exercise;
- Markers of oxidant stress, including plasma and urine isoprostanes; and, .
- Maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Completion of these Specific Objectives will position our research group to conduct future studies of 1) mechanisms of exercise limitation and 2) antioxidant therapies, both in this defined population and those who are at risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis. The long term impact of this application is thus to develop effective pulmonary rehabilitation strategies for IPF patients, based on knowledge of underlying changes in oxygen metabolism and oxidant stress.

### Interventional strategies for children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^c7c4be8b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Pulmonary hypertension in children is progressive with wide variability in prognosis. This document provides an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel identified pertinent questions regarding the management of children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy, conducted systematic reviews of the relevant literature, and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to develop clinical recommendations. Results: After reviewing the research evidence, the panel considered the balance of desirable (benefits) and undesirable (harms and burdens) effects of the interventions in each proposed question. Valuation of our main outcomes was also considered, together with resources required, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Recommendations were developed for or against interventional strategies specific to children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy. Conclusions: Although there is a growing population of children with pulmonary hypertension, there is a striking lack of empirical evidence regarding management of those whose disease has progressed despite optimal pharmacotherapy. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for clinical recommendations for or against interventional strategies on the basis of this limited empirical evidence, coupled with expert opinion, to aid clinicians in the management of these complex pediatric patients. In addition, we identified important areas for future research.

Literature Search

With the assistance of a medical librarian, we searched multiple electronic databases, including Embase via Elsevier (1947 to the present), PubMed including both MEDLINE and PubMed Central articles (1946 to the present), CINAHL Complete via EBSCO (1937 to the present), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via John Wiley (from inception). We also identified additional studies by searching the reference lists of the articles eligible for full-text review. Search results were deduplicated and screened using Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation). Complete details of the literature search, by PICO, are available in the data supplement.

Given the expectation that literature on this topic would be sparse, we were liberal in our inclusion of study types, excluding only the following: narrative reviews, consensus statements, clinical practice guidelines, opinion pieces, editorials, workshop proceedings, protocols, unpublished trial data, and dissertations, and theses. Using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria, two members of the methodology team screened titles and abstracts independently, and then, for potentially relevant studies, full texts were obtained and independently reviewed. Once a final group of studies was selected for each PICO question, the methodology team then determined which studies would be included in GRADE evaluations, using the traditional hierarchy of scientific evidence to focus on the highest tier evidence available for each question. Because some studies contained a mixture of adults and children, we developed criteria to facilitate selection of the most direct evidence possible. For studies with both adults and children but no child-specific data, a population including ≥50% children and/or a mean or median population age <18 years was considered acceptable. All conflicts in study selection were resolved via discussion. When indicated, the lead methodologist contacted experts outside the panel for additional data related to selected studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagrams for numbers of records removed at each step are available in the data supplement.

### Interventional strategies for children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^393658f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension in children is progressive with wide variability in prognosis. This document provides an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel identified pertinent questions regarding the management of children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy, conducted systematic reviews of the relevant literature, and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

After reviewing the research evidence, the panel considered the balance of desirable (benefits) and undesirable (harms and burdens) effects of the interventions in each proposed question. Valuation of our main outcomes was also considered, together with resources required, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Recommendations were developed for or against interventional strategies specific to children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy.

Conclusions

Although there is a growing population of children with pulmonary hypertension, there is a striking lack of empirical evidence regarding management of those whose disease has progressed despite optimal pharmacotherapy. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for clinical recommendations for or against interventional strategies on the basis of this limited empirical evidence, coupled with expert opinion, to aid clinicians in the management of these complex pediatric patients. In addition, we identified important areas for future research.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH)—psychosocial support and adherence: PH is a disease with a significant impact on the psychological, social (including financial), emotional and spiritual functioning of patients and their families, and teams managing these patients should have the skills and expertise to assess and manage these issues, with patient support groups playing an important role and patients advised to join such groups. PH is a disease that may be severely life-limiting, and in addition to psychological and social support there should be proactive advance care planning with referral to specialist palliative care services when appropriate. Adherence to medical treatments needs to be checked periodically due to the complexity of PAH therapy and possible regimen changes by patients or non-expert physicians.

The main diagnostic algorithm for PH is simplified to a three-step approach (suspicion by first-line physicians, echocardiographic detection, and confirmation with right heart catheterization [RHC] in PH centres), and warning signs linked to worse outcomes justify immediate referral and management in PH centres.

Use of the Guideline

These recommendations are intended to aid clinicians in the management of infants, children, and adolescents with PH who have progressive disease despite optimal therapy. This group of clinicians aided by this document include adult and pediatric pulmonologists, adult and pediatric cardiologists, neonatologists, pediatric cardiac intensivists, pediatric cardiac interventionalists, adult and pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons, primary care providers, other health care professionals, and policy makers. Clinicians, patients, third-party payers, stakeholders, and courts should not view the recommendations contained in this guideline as standards of care. Although evidence-based guidelines can summarize the best available evidence regarding the effects of an intervention in a given patient population, they cannot take into account all of the unique clinical circumstances that may arise when managing a patient. As such, their implementation is at the discretion of each treating physician who must work in concert with the patient and their family through a process of shared decision making.

### Pulmonary hypertension care delivery in the United States: is It time to get with the guidelines? [^9bc9ac4d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We applaud Leary and colleagues for highlighting the discordance between guideline recommendations and the current state of PH care delivery. However, it is important to emphasize that identification of patients with PAH through claims data is notoriously difficult. A minority (5%) of the patients studied were on triple therapy, with a high burden of comorbidities among patients on monotherapy, suggesting that this study included those without PAH for whom guidelines currently lack recommendations regarding management by expert centers. With the emerging complexity of PH phenotyping beyond the World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension groups as well as consideration for pulmonary vasodilator therapy in groups 2 and 3 PH (those due to heart and lung disease) based on certain hemodynamic thresholds, this work highlights the need to explore specific care delivery recommendations for patients without PAH with disease prevalence that far surpasses those with PAH. In addition, established delays in PH diagnosis and subsequent referrals to expert centers may limit the ability to fully explore receipt of PH center–based treatment patterns within a single-year time frame.

A consensus panel convened by the American College of Chest Physicians developed guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that were published in 2004. Subsequently, several important clinical trials have been published, and new treatments have received regulatory approval. In addition, add-on and combination therapy are being explored, which promise to open new therapeutic avenues. This article, taking into consideration studies published prior to September 1, 2006, provides an update to the previously published guidelines. The original guidelines have been summarized, a discussion of new studies has been added, and the treatment algorithm has been revised to take into account recent developments in therapy. This update provides evidence-based treatment recommendations for physicians involved in the care of patients with PAH. Due to the complexity of the diagnostic evaluation required and the treatment options available, referral of patients with PAH to a specialized center continues to be strongly recommended.

Echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension (PH)—algorithm using tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) with additional echocardiographic signs and risk factors—classifies PH probability and links to next steps. Peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (m/s) is combined with the presence of other echo PH signs (see Table 10) and risk factors or associated conditions for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to designate PH PROBABILITY LOW, PH PROBABILITY INTERMEDIATE, or PH PROBABILITY HIGH and direct Alternative diagnosis (Class IIa), Echo follow-up (Class IIa), or Further intervention†/ RHC (if indicated) (Class I). Signs from at least two categories in Table 10 must be present to alter the level of echocardiographic probability of PH, and the TRV threshold of 2.8 m/s was not changed according to the updated haemodynamic definition of PH; RHC should be performed if useful information/therapeutic consequence is anticipated and may not be indicated in patients without risk factors or associated conditions for PAH or CTEPH.

### Uncertainties in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^a347d808]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

The availability of new treatments for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension has increased awareness and interest in the medical community for pulmonary vascular diseases in general. Many uncertainties exist, however, regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension that are particularly pertinent for the management of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with underlying diseases. This review highlights controversial issues around the definition and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, the interpretation of hemodynamic variables, and the interpretation of clinical responsiveness to chronic therapies. In addition, we propose guidelines applicable to the conduct of new therapeutic trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension, which aim to provide greater confidence in the efficacy and safety of new treatments currently under development.

### Interventional strategies for children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^8fc90f99]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient Population

The patient population for this guideline is children younger than 18 years with progressive PH despite optimal therapy. Because of the variable clinical presentations of children with PH, the characteristics of the patients this guideline targets include progressive deterioration in New York Heart Association or World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III or IV during escalating therapy, progressive hemodynamic deterioration on serial cardiac catheterizations independent of functional class, inability to tolerate maximal medical therapy with WHO functional class IIIa or IIIb, worsening RV function (moderate or greater dysfunction), life-threatening complications (e.g. recurrent hemoptysis or recurrent syncope) that progresses despite medical therapy or creation of a right-to-left shunt, secondary liver or kidney dysfunction due to progressive PH, and worsening quality of life as determined by the family, among other potential characteristics. In certain circumstances, some of these children will have suprasystemic pressures, which we define as RV or pulmonary artery systolic pressures greater than left ventricular (LV) or aortic systolic pressures.

Given the complexity of management decisions for many children with PH, we acknowledge that optimal therapy cannot be absolutely defined. Additional complexity is introduced by the fact that for some, optimal therapy may ultimately be surgical and not medical (e.g. pulmonary endarterectomy [PEA] in chronic thromboembolic PH [CTEPH]). This document is focused largely on children with Group 1 PH (i.e. pulmonary arterial hypertension) who experience disease progression, manifesting as worsening symptoms, hospitalization, or some other measure of severity, despite the use of PH-specific pharmacotherapies. However, under the correct circumstances, the interventions addressed in this guideline may be appropriate for children with other forms of progressive PH. Last, variability in the determination of what constitutes optimal therapy, as well as what constitutes disease progression, can influence referral practices related to the interventions described in our patient, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format questions. In instances in which studies specified criteria for the receipt of an intervention, we have detailed those criteria to serve as parameters that may guide referral for suggested interventions.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management? [^7c08cb3c]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Evidence-based guidelines summarize the available evidence using a comprehensive literature research approach and provide unbiased recommendations reflecting this evidence. However, this emphasis on methodology eventually results in a lack of practicability and guidance in areas with a dearth of evidence. The empirical approach based on expert advice can provide guidance, especially in areas with little or no formal evidence, but is vulnerable to biased recommendations. Thus, both approaches may adversely affect patients. A synthesis of these potentially complementary approaches seems appropriate to provide optimal guidance in the treatment of all patients.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^d9f20bd1]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy for PAH in adults—treatment selection and risk assessment: Lacking head-to-head comparisons and differing benefit–risk profiles, we recommend that drug therapy be chosen based on a methodic evaluation of disease severity, the risk for further short-term deterioration, and the preferences and values of the patient. Previous guidelines have suggested that WHO FC, echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular function, 6MWD, plasma brain natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, hemodynamic measurements, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing in addition to patient symptoms and clinical findings can be useful indicators of disease severity and response to treatment. Specific parameters for each of these variables have been proposed to identify patients at low, intermediate, or high risk of 1-year mortality, and predictive equations for survival in PAH have been developed; however, none of these tools have been prospectively validated, and we provide recommendations that are based on the WHO FC of the patients enrolled in the clinical studies we evaluated.

### Revised definition of pulmonary hypertension and approach to management: a clinical primer [^1d08a6c0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The definition of pulmonary hypertension (PH) has changed recently based, in part, on contemporary outcome data and to focus on early disease detection. Now, PH includes patients with mean pulmonary artery pressure >20mmHg measured by right heart catheterization. In contrast to the classical era, pulmonary vascular resistance >2.0 Wood units is also used for diagnosis and prognostication. These lowered thresholds aim to identify patients early in the disease course, which is important because delay to diagnosis of PH is common and linked to elevated morbidity and shortened lifespan. This clinical primer highlights key changes in diagnosis and approach to PH management, focusing on concepts that are likely to be encountered frequently in general practice. Specifically, this includes hemodynamic assessment of at-risk patients, pharmacotherapeutic management of pulmonary arterial hypertension, approach to PH in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and newly established indications for early referral to PH centers to prompt comanagement of patients with pulmonary vascular disease experts.

Limitations and Future Research

Because of the limitations of the identified evidence, we chose not to make strong recommendations. Most studies were single-center experiences with small cohorts that did not expand on long-term outcomes, which limits their applicability and suggests that much is still to be learned from how we approach the management of children with progressive disease despite optimal therapy. To address the limitations of currently available data, multicenter studies are needed to investigate each of our recommendations more comprehensively. Specific areas of focus should include the best approach and timing for ASD intervention or pulmonary-to-systemic shunt, the timing of referral for lung transplantation, and optimal management strategies for ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation. For children with progressive and suprasystemic PH receiving ECMO who are not candidates for lung transplantation, it will be imperative to acquire more data from the select centers capable of performing pulmonary-to-systemic shunt placement to determine if it is a viable treatment option for this very high-risk group. Finally, there is an increasing role of early whole-genome sequencing in evaluating children with PH of all age groups, so these data will play a key role in both clinical care and research in the future.

### Management of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [^efe37f95]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a severe and progressive disease. Three treatment modalities are available: pulmonary endarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) medical therapy. Both mechanical therapies may also be considered in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease without PH. Patients should be referred to expert centers, as full surgical evaluation is the primary target and further evaluation for additional or alternative treatment strategies by an experienced multidisciplinary team is mandatory. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for CTEPH. PH medical therapies are available for inoperable patients, or those with residual PH postprocedure. Furthermore, interventional therapy is recommended in inoperable patients with appropriate target lesions. Multimodal treatment strategies are common in inoperable patients. In recent years, there is a growing expertise in combining all 3 modalities in carefully selected patients. In the current era, the peri-interventional mortality risks are low (<3% for pulmonary endarterectomy and <1% for balloon pulmonary angioplasty in expert centers), and outcomes are excellent for the vast majority of patients with CTEPH.

Persistent symptoms after valve intervention—Persistent symptoms occur in many patients after valve intervention, and the first step in evaluation is to assess valve function to ensure symptoms are not caused by persistent or recurrent stenosis, regurgitation, or a valve complication. The next step is to evaluate and treat any concurrent cardiac disease and noncardiac conditions that may be the cause of symptoms, and symptoms also may be attributable to irreversible consequences of valve disease, including LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and RV dysfunction. Treatment of symptoms for these patients is based on GDMT for HF and/or pulmonary hypertension.

The concept of chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) with or without PH has been introduced to enable research on natural history and management without PH, and the CTEPH treatment algorithm has been modified to include multimodal therapy with surgery, PH drugs, and BPA.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) diagnosis—evaluation and referral: Any patient with unexplained pulmonary hypertension (PH) should be evaluated for CTEPH, and survivors of acute pulmonary embolism should be followed. In unexplained PH, a ventilation/perfusion lung scan is recommended to exclude CTEPH; a normal scan rules out CTEPH, and multislice CT angiography is indicated when the scan is indeterminate or shows defects. If imaging is compatible with CTEPH, the patient should be referred to a centre with expertise, with invasive tools including right heart catheterization (RHC) and traditional pulmonary angiography usually required to define strategy. For acute pulmonary embolism with in-hospital PH or RV dysfunction, follow-up echocardiography after discharge is advised (usually after 3–6 months). The final diagnosis is based on pre-capillary PH thresholds and the presence of chronic/organized occlusive thrombi/emboli in elastic pulmonary arteries: mean PAP ≥ 25 mmHg, PWP ≤ 15 mmHg, and PVR > 2 Wood units in main, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental arteries.

### Diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (...) [^f149e028]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by thickening of alveolar walls and the presence of large mononuclear cells in the alveolar space. Although idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is believed to be underdiagnosed, the prevalence in the United States has been estimated to be 29 per 100, 000 men and 26 per 100, 000 women. A recent review by Chan-Yeung and Müller provides diagnostic and treatment guidelines. The typical patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is 40 to 70 years of age and presents with a one- to three-year history of nonproductive cough and increasing breathlessness. Physical examination usually reveals bilateral basilar crackles and clubbed fingers. Approximately one third of patients have an autoimmune condition, such as polyarthritis. Although chest radiographs typically show a diffuse reticular pattern predominately in the lower zones, in up to 16 percent of patients the chest radiograph may appear normal.

High-resolution computed tomographic scan shows linear opacities and honeycombing with areas of ground-glass attenuation. Tests of lung function show restrictive results such as low lung volumes and impaired gas transfer. The diagnosis is based on exclusion of other causes of fibrosing alveolitis. A thorough occupational and environmental exposure history is particularly important. High-resolution CT scan is crucial in confirming the diagnosis. Since patients with ground-glass attenuation are more likely to respond to corticosteroids, the CT scan also guides choice of therapy. Transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lung lavage do not contribute directly to the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but are useful in identifying other potential diagnoses such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and malignancy.

Lung biopsy using either open or transbronchial routes confirms the diagnosis; samples should be obtained from at least two sites. The treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is controversial and is hampered by a lack of understanding of the natural history of the disease. Only 10 to 15 percent of patients improve with corticosteroid therapy, and 26 percent of patients develop serious complications from the steroid therapy. Indicators of good response to steroid therapy include young age, female sex, ground-glass lesions on CT scan and active inflammation on lung biopsy samples. Azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic drugs have been used either as second-line agents or in combination with steroids as first-line therapy. Although the general prognosis was poor, combined treatment improved three-year survival rates. Selected patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have been treated with lung transplantation.

Methods

This guideline was developed in accordance with policies and procedures of the ATS, using the GRADE approach to formulate clinical questions, identify and summarize relevant evidence, and develop recommendations for clinical practice. To report the systematic reviews, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The guideline underwent anonymous peer review by five content experts and a methodologist. After multiple cycles of review and revision, the guideline was reviewed and approved by a multidisciplinary board of directors of the ATS. The guideline will be reviewed by the ATS three years after publication, and it will be determined if updating is necessary.

Panel Composition

The co-chairs (D.H. and D.L.S.M.) submitted a proposal that was reviewed and approved by the ATS Assembly of Pediatrics, Program Review Subcommittee, and Board of Directors. A multidisciplinary panel of international specialists with expertise in children with advanced PH and guideline development methodology was formed. Disciplines represented included pediatric cardiology, pediatric pulmonology, pediatric cardiac intensive care, interventional pediatric cardiology, pediatric cardiothoracic surgery, and adult cardiothoracic surgery. A parent of a child with PH who required lung transplantation was also included as a patient advocate (M.F.L.). Potential conflicts of interest were disclosed and managed in accordance with the policies and procedures of the ATS. A senior methodologist (A.L.J.) with expertise in evidence synthesis and guideline development was assigned to assist the panel, together with three ATS methodology scholars (E.A. S.M.H. H.L.) and a medical librarian (T.J.).

Meetings

All meetings were held via video conference. Our first meeting was in July 2022, at which time we reviewed the guideline development process and GRADE approach, and our final video conference was in December 2023.

Clinical Questions and Outcomes of Interest

The committee identified five specific questions addressing the clinical management of children with progression of PH despite optimal therapy. The PICO format was used to formulate each question. Potential outcomes for each PICO question were generated by the panel members using an online survey developed by the methodology team. Panel members were then asked to rate a curated list of outcomes, using a scale of 1–9, and ratings were used to categorize outcomes as critical, important, or not important (scores of 7–9 were considered critical, 4–6 important, and 1–3 not important). For GRADE assessments, only critical and important outcomes were considered.

### Pulmonary hypertension and pregnancy [^91833b9c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a term used to describe a complex multifactorial group of conditions diagnosed by an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure of 20 mm Hg or higher on right heart catheterization. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy is important, as it is associated with high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, even with modern management. Diagnostic testing is important for establishing the diagnosis, type, and severity of pulmonary hypertension, which in turn, dictates treatment options. Echocardiographic assessment is the first step in diagnosis and the gold standard for monitoring right heart function in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Supportive therapy for pulmonary hypertension includes monitored exercise, vaccination, and avoidance of certain activities. Therapies for pulmonary hypertension are considered conventional or targeted. Conventional therapy includes preventative care, anticoagulation, and calcium channel blockers for appropriate patients. Targeted therapy is usually reserved for patients with World Health Organization group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced or associated with congenital heart disease) and involves different types of direct pulmonary vasodilators. Right heart failure is the end result of pulmonary hypertension and the options for management include medical optimization, support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and combined heart-lung transplantation. With pregnancy, management must be individualized, and patients should be cared for as part of an experienced multidisciplinary team. There are few studies addressing, timing and mode of delivery, including anesthetic considerations. In this review, the natural history of pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy and outcomes are summarized and current evidence-based management is discussed.
