## Question

is there a guideline i can follow?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a guideline they can follow. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a trustworthy clinical practice guideline and how to identify one. Then, I should verify how to appraise a guideline's validity and applicability to a specific patient. Next, I will consider how to integrate guideline recommendations with clinical judgment and patient preferences. Finally, I should confirm how to handle situations where evidence is weak or conflicting, and outline a practical decision framework for use at the bedside.

> Let me first confirm what a clinical practice guideline is and why it matters. A clinical practice guideline is a systematically developed statement that includes recommendations intended to optimize patient care, typically accompanied by a summary of evidence and justification of the panel's decisions; trustworthy guidelines are transparent, methodologically rigorous, and grounded in systematic reviews of the best available evidence, with explicit grading of the strength of recommendations and certainty of evidence [^c036f094] [^d970059d].

> Wait, let me verify the hallmarks of a high-quality guideline so I don't jump to conclusions. I should look for multidisciplinary authorship, conflict-of-interest policies, use of GRADE or a comparable evidence-grading system, external peer review, and a plan for updates; the AGREE instrument and G-I-N standards operationalize these domains, and major societies like ACP, NICE, and KDIGO embed these practices into their methods, which helps me distinguish trustworthy guidance from lower-quality or biased documents [^bbb7abfc] [^f506eea7] [^d970059d] [^e6498189] [^151c3bc9].

> Hold on, I should verify how to appraise a specific guideline before applying it. A practical three-step approach is to ask whether the recommendations are valid, what the recommendations actually say, and whether they will help this particular patient; I need to check that all important options and outcomes were considered, that evidence quality was graded, and that the strength of recommendations is explicit, because this frames how much weight to give each statement in shared decision-making [^80866dfa] [^c036f094].

> I need to ensure the guideline fits the clinical context and the patient in front of me. Applicability depends on matching the target population, interventions, and settings to my patient, and I should double-check for differences in comorbidities, values, or resource constraints that might modify the balance of benefits and harms; guidelines often include disclaimers emphasizing that they are not mandates and must be individualized, which reinforces the need to tailor recommendations rather than apply them rigidly [^c036f094] [^a691d9b4] [^3bc35890].

> Next, I should review how to integrate recommendations with clinical judgment and patient preferences. Strong recommendations generally reflect high-certainty evidence and a clear net benefit and are appropriate for most patients, whereas conditional recommendations reflect uncertainty or value-dependent trade-offs and require shared decision-making; I should confirm the certainty ratings and explicitly discuss options, benefits, harms, and costs with the patient to align care with their goals [^e807bcaf] [^66b63d23].

> But wait, what if the evidence is sparse or conflicting? I should confirm whether the guideline acknowledges this and how it handles it. Many high-quality guidelines include ungraded practice points or consensus statements when evidence is limited; these are expert-informed and useful, yet I should communicate the uncertainty transparently and consider local context, patient preferences, and the potential for shared decision-making or watchful waiting when the balance is unclear [^beb02c75] [^b1e0d52e] [^c07d405c].

> I will now examine a practical decision framework to keep this clinically actionable. First, identify the clinical question and whether a relevant, trustworthy guideline exists. Second, appraise the guideline's validity and applicability. Third, extract the graded recommendations and their certainty. Fourth, individualize to the patient's comorbidities, values, and resources. Fifth, implement and monitor, adjusting as needed and documenting the rationale when deviating from guidance. This aligns with best-practice approaches to using guidelines at the point of care [^c036f094] [^80866dfa].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Yes, there are guidelines you can follow, but you should follow those that are trustworthy, methodologically rigorous, and applicable to your patient, and you should apply them thoughtfully alongside clinical judgment and patient preferences; when evidence is weak, prioritize shared decision-making and document the rationale for your approach, recognizing that guidelines are tools to support — not replace — individualized care [^c036f094] [^5bf30116] [^e807bcaf].

There is **no single universal guideline** for all medical decisions; instead, use **evidence-based guidelines** from reputable organizations (e.g. ACP, AHA/ACC, KDIGO, NCCN, VA/DoD) tailored to the specific condition, population, and context [^d970059d] [^d257ca65] [^d014604a] [^d37b4246] [^54c39a78]. Always **apply clinical judgment**, consider patient preferences, and adapt to local resources and comorbidities [^c036f094] [^5bf30116]. For the most reliable guidance, prioritize guidelines that use GRADE, disclose conflicts, and are regularly updated [^d970059d] [^5bf30116].

## Characteristics of high-quality clinical practice guidelines

High-quality guidelines share **common features** that enhance their reliability and applicability:

- **Systematic evidence review**: Base recommendations on comprehensive, up-to-date systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^c036f094] [^5bf30116].
- **Transparent methodology**: Clearly describe the development process, including evidence appraisal, consensus methods, and grading of recommendations [^d970059d] [^e6498189].
- **Conflict of interest management**: Disclose and manage conflicts of interest to minimize bias [^d970059d] [^5bf30116].
- **Multidisciplinary involvement**: Include experts from relevant clinical, methodological, and patient perspectives [^052fa590] [^bbb7abfc].
- **Regular updates**: Revise periodically to incorporate new evidence and changing practice [^5c43c7ec] [^b914e06d].

## Examples of authoritative guideline organizations and their scope

Several organizations consistently produce **high-quality guidelines** across diverse clinical areas:

| **Organization** | **Scope** | **Notable guidelines** |
|-|-|-|
| American College of Physicians (ACP) | Internal medicine | - Chronic pain <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Screening [^d970059d] |
| American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) | Cardiovascular disease | - Hypertension <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Atrial fibrillation [^d257ca65] |
| Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) | Nephrology | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Glomerular diseases [^d014604a] |

## Limitations and challenges of clinical practice guidelines

Despite their utility, guidelines have **important limitations**:

- **Variability in quality**: Not all guidelines meet rigorous standards, leading to potential bias and unreliable recommendations [^037947cc] [^5bf30116].
- **Evidence gaps**: Many recommendations rely on limited or low-certainty evidence, necessitating expert opinion and consensus [^c07d405c] [^ccb99c2c].
- **Applicability**: Guidelines may not fully address complex, multimorbid patients or diverse clinical contexts [^037947cc] [^357508f1].
- **Implementation barriers**: Clinicians face time constraints, resource limitations, and lack of awareness, hindering adherence [^a06ec887] [^65227fdd].

---

## How to critically appraise and apply guidelines

To effectively use guidelines, **clinicians should**:

- **Assess trustworthiness**: Evaluate the guideline's methodology, evidence base, and conflict-of-interest management [^5bf30116] [^80866dfa].
- **Consider applicability**: Determine whether the recommendations align with the patient's clinical context, values, and preferences [^c036f094] [^5bf30116].
- **Integrate clinical judgment**: Balance guideline recommendations with individual patient factors and local resources [^c036f094] [^5bf30116].
- **Monitor outcomes**: Adjust care based on patient response and evolving evidence [^notfound].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

Guideline development is evolving toward **greater standardization**, international collaboration, and integration of patient-centered care [^f506eea7] [^7be9a3a1]. Living guidelines, digital tools, and artificial intelligence are poised to enhance timeliness, accessibility, and personalization of recommendations [^notfound].

---

There is **no single guideline** for all medical decisions; clinicians should use **evidence-based guidelines** from reputable organizations, tailored to the specific condition, population, and context. Always apply clinical judgment, consider patient preferences, and adapt to local resources and comorbidities. For the most reliable guidance, prioritize guidelines that use GRADE, disclose conflicts, and are regularly updated [^d970059d] [^5bf30116].

## References

### How to interpret and use a clinical practice guideline or recommendation: users' guides to the medical literature [^c036f094]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Clinicians may rely on recommendations from clinical practice guidelines for management of patients.

Observations

A clinical practice guideline is a published statement that includes recommendations that are intended to optimize patient care. In the guideline development process, a panel of experts formulates recommendation questions that guide the retrieval of evidence that is used to inform the recommendations. Typically, methods of guideline development, a summary of the supporting evidence, and a justification of the panel's decisions accompany the recommendations. To use such guidelines optimally, clinicians must understand the implications of the recommendations, assess the trustworthiness of the development process, and evaluate the extent to which the recommendations are applicable to patients in their practice settings. Helpful recommendations are clear and actionable, and explicitly specify whether they are strong or weak, are appropriate for all patients, or depend on individual patients' circumstances and values. Rigorous guidelines and recommendations are informed by appropriately conducted, up-to-date systematic reviews that consider outcomes important to patients. Because judgments are involved in the interpretation of the evidence and the process of moving from evidence to recommendations, useful guidelines consider all relevant factors that have a bearing in a clinical decision and are not influenced by conflicts of interest.

Conclusions and Relevance

In considering a guideline's recommendations, clinicians must decide whether there are important differences between the factors the guideline panel has considered in making recommendations and their own practice setting.

### A review of clinical guidelines [^340239d0]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines are increasingly used in patient management but few clinicians are familiar with their origin or appropriate application.

Methods

A Medline search using the terms 'clinical guidelines' and 'practice guidelines' was conducted. Additional references were sourced by manual searching from the bibliographies of articles located.

Results and Conclusion

Clinical guidelines originated in the USA in the early 1980s, initially as a cost containment exercise. Significant improvements in the process and outcomes of care have been demonstrated following their introduction, although the extent of improvement varies considerably. The principles for the development of guidelines are well established but many published guidelines fall short of these basic quality criteria. Guidelines are only one aspect of improving quality and should be used within a wider framework of promoting clinical effectiveness. Understanding their limitations as well as their potential benefits should enable clinicians to have a clearer view of their place in everyday practice.

### Evidence-based guidelines – an introduction [^13b4ad34]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Recommendations in the form of clinical practice guidelines are increasingly common. Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help administrators, practitioners and patients make decisions about appropriate health care for specific circumstances. In North America, guidelines developed by professional societies, government panels and cooperative groups are frequently used to measure quality, to allocate resources and to determine how health care dollars are spent. For clinicians, guidelines provide a summary of the relevant medical literature and offer assistance in deciding which diagnostic tests to order, which treatments to use for specific conditions, when to discharge patients from the hospital, and many other aspects of clinical practice.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^78f3f08d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) methods — topic selection and scope state that ACP clinical guidelines and guidance statements address prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of various diseases relevant to internal medicine, with topic ideas coming from ACP members, CGC members, and other ACP committees and governance, and selection based on characteristics of a condition including effect on morbidity and mortality, prevalence and impact, availability of effective health care alternatives, areas of clinical uncertainty, evidence that current performance does not meet best practices, cost and resource implications, available management options, likelihood that evidence is available to develop recommendations, and relevance to internal medicine and its subspecialties; for guidance statements, it is also necessary to ensure the availability of guidelines produced by other organizations.

### Consistent definitions of clinical practice guidelines, consensus statements, position statements, and practice alerts [^a0825806]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

An evidence-based approach to clinical decision-making for optimizing patient care is desirable because it promotes quality of care, improves patient safety, decreases medical errors, and reduces health care costs. Clinical practice recommendations are systematically developed documents regarding best practice for specific clinical management issues, which can assist care providers in their clinical decision-making. However, there is currently wide variation in the terminology used for such clinical practice recommendations. The aim of this article is to provide guidance to authors, reviewers, and editors on the definitions of terms commonly used for clinical practice recommendations. This is intended to improve transparency and clarity regarding the definitions of these terminologies.

### The need to systematically evaluate clinical practice guidelines [^5043fbf5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines abound. The recommendations contained in these guidelines are used not only to make decisions about the care of individual patients but also as practice standards to rate physician "quality". Physicians' confidence in guidelines is based on the supposition that there is a rigorous, objective process for developing recommendations based on the best available evidence. Though voluntary standards for the development of guidelines exist, the process of guideline development is unregulated and the quality of many guidelines is low. In addition, the few tools available to assess the quality of guidelines are time consuming and designed for researchers, not clinicians. Few guidelines are evaluated, either before or after their dissemination, for their impact on patient outcomes. Just as with pharmaceuticals and other products that can affect patients for better or worse, perhaps it is time to develop more standardized ways to evaluate the development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines to ensure a similar balance between risk and benefit.

### The challenge of guideline development when evidence is sparse [^0e96164b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Although best-practice standards for clinical guidelines have been released by the Institute of Medicine and Guidelines International Network, a great challenge remains for guideline development for patients afflicted with rare diseases. This article reviews the challenge of guideline development under these circumstances with an emphasis on strategies to overcome these challenges. Guideline development and use in practice have become integral components in the contemporary care of patients to optimize outcome results. The guidelines are developed through an objective, evidence-based process conducted by experts and stakeholders for a given disease process.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a06ec887]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Is the guideline process replicable and, if not, what does this mean? [^6c7a23c3]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Increasingly, guidelines determine how medical care will be provided. However there has been limited study of the determinants of the reliability of the guideline process. Guidelines translate evidence into recommendations. If only the evidence determines the recommendations, given the same evidence, different panels of experts should make the same recommendations. That is, the process should be replicable, an essential characteristic of a valid scientific process. The multiple recent cholesterol guidelines, which have considered the same evidence, offer an opportunity to examine guidelines from this perspective. Considerable discordance among the guideline recommendations is evident pointing to an important role for the participants, in addition to the evidence, in the development of guideline recommendations. Guideline recommendations, therefore, appear to be based on both evidence and expert opinion.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^a691d9b4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Disclaimer for guideline use — the document clarifies scope and limits by stating that "The clinical practice guideline is not intended as the sole source of guidance in managing patients with AR. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies", and that "The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care". It further notes that guidance is conditional, not prescriptive: "As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute", "Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care", "Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation", and "The AAO-HNSF emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results".

### Guiding principles, attributes, and process to review medical management guidelines [^454397e4]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Few issues are more central to the ongoing debate about health care in the United States than concerns about cost and quality of medical care. The recent development and implementation of medical management guidelines that include recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, hospital length of stay, intensity of service, home care, and access to specialists have often focused this debate on the potential trade-off between cost reductions and quality of care. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes that cost and quality are integrally related and that it is possible to reduce costs while maintaining and improving quality. The purpose of this statement is to help pediatricians and other health care providers interpret, evaluate, and improve medical management guidelines.

### Individualized clinical practice guidelines: the next step in the evidence-based health care evolution? [^dea9a26c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are playing an increasing role in the evolution of evidence-based health care. CPGs involve a process in which the best evidence in translated into best practice principles that are then applied on a wide range of patients. Although there are clear benefits in terms of simplicity, applying broad recommendations on a diverse group of patients can lead to wide variations in outcomes on an individual patient level. The individualized guideline (IG) is an approach that builds on the concept of the CPG by specifying treatment recommendation based on important individual baseline characteristics. The IG approach could potentially lead to superior outcomes but necessitates a substantial increase in complexity to the CPG development process.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management, part I: introduction and general considerations [^e88b376d]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines are part of modern interventional pain management. As in other specialties in the United States, evidence-based medicine appears to motivate the search for answers to numerous questions related to costs and quality of health care as well as access to care. Scientific, relevant evidence is essential in clinical care, policy-making, dispute resolution, and law. Consequently, evidence based practice brings together pertinent, trustworthy information by systematically acquiring, analyzing, and transferring research findings into clinical, management, and policy arenas. In the United States, researchers, clinicians, professional organizations, and government are looking for a sensible approach to health care with practical evidence-based medicine. All modes of evidence-based practice, either in the form of evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, or guidelines, evolve through a methodological, rational accumulation, analysis, and understanding of the evidentiary knowledge that can be applied in clinical settings. Historically, evidence-based medicine is traceable to the 1700s, even though it was not explicitly defined and advanced until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Evidence-based medicine was initially called "critical appraisal" to describe the application of basic rules of evidence as they evolve into application in daily practices. Evidence-based medicine is defined as a conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Evidence-based practice is defined based on 4 basic and important contingencies, which include recognition of the patient's problem and construction of a structured clinical question, thorough search of medical literature to retrieve the best available evidence to answer the question, critical appraisal of all available evidence, and integration of the evidence with all aspects and contexts of the clinical circumstances. Systematic reviews provide the application of scientific strategies that limit bias by the systematic assembly, critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies on a specific topic. While systematic reviews are close to meta-analysis, they are vastly different from narrative reviews and health technology assessments. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements that aim to help physicians and patients reach the best health care decisions. Appropriately developed guidelines incorporate validity, reliability, reproducibility, clinical applicability and flexibility, clarity, development through a multidisciplinary process, scheduled reviews, and documentation. Thus, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines represent statements developed to improve the quality of care, patient access, treatment outcomes, appropriateness of care, efficiency and effectiveness and achieve cost containment by improving the cost benefit ratio. Part 1 of this series in evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management provides an introduction and general considerations of these 3 aspects in interventional pain management.

### Primary care guidelines for the management of persons infected with HIV: 2013 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^e17fb303]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were prepared by an expert panel of the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace those published in 2009. The guidelines are intended for use by healthcare providers who care for HIV-infected patients. Since 2009, new antiretroviral drugs and classes have become available, and the prognosis of persons with HIV infection continues to improve. However, with fewer complications and increased survival, HIV-infected persons are increasingly developing common health problems that also affect the general population. Some of these conditions may be related to HIV infection itself or its treatment. HIV-infected persons should be managed and monitored for all relevant age- and sex-specific health problems. New information based on publications from the period 2009–2013 has been incorporated into this document.

### A fine balance: developing clinical practice guidelines in areas where evidence is lacking [^c07d405c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Over the last 15 years, numerous clinical practice guidelines have been developed by clinicians driven by national societies and funders of healthcare services. Writing and publication of guidelines have been refined such that a transparent and robust process has evolved. The main purpose of clinical practice guidelines is to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations to assist clinical decision-making and reduce variability in clinical practice: this benefits patients and the healthcare system. When evidence is abundant and robust, guideline development is relatively straightforward. However, in areas where evidence is lacking, there is a tension between providing advice based on expert opinion while maintaining a clinical equipoise that will facilitate the design and execution of clinical trials, so that new information is gained, and that will ultimately inform care. In this commentary, we explore these problems and suggest an alternative approach to the development of clinical guidance in areas where evidence is lacking.

### Updating clinical practice guidelines: how Do we stay current? [^5c43c7ec]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are created to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in patient care. Tremendous resources are invested in creating CPGs we can trust. Once a guideline is created, however, how is it maintained to reflect the most up-to-date clinical evidence? This article reviews protocols for reviewing and maintaining CPGs with particular attention to the protocols established by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.

PROBLEMS WITH GUIDELINES

Various problems with guidelines and their development that can impede their maximal use and profit have been reported:

Lack of quality: There are currently too many low-quality guidelines. There seems to be a 'guideline industry' emerging in many Western countries with a considerable variation in guidelines from different sources. Physicians and other professionals are probably overwhelmed by all these guidelines, particularly since guidelines on the same topic sometimes present different recommendations for practice. Many of the current guidelines have not been developed in a rigorous and systematic way, and are not based on the best evidence or present the vested interests of specific parties, including health-care industries. A series of recent studies assessing the quality of clinical guidelines show that many guidelines do not meet important quality criteria. The unsystematic development of guidelines can contribute to this low quality (Burgers et al, 2003a).

Lack of evidence: A second problem is that despite a rigorous search and analysis of the scientific literature, clear evidence is available for only part of the practical actions and decisions recommended in the guidelines. There is a large grey area where expert opinions, practitioners' and patients' preferences as well as societal priorities are more important in the development of guidelines than research results. When evidence is missing, reliable procedures for including expert opinions and stakeholders' preferences are required; such procedures are not present in many guideline development programmes.

Translation of evidence into recommendations for practice: Even when evidence has been summarised, it is often difficult to translate it into recommendations for practice. Guideline users deal with a more heterogeneous population of patients and more complex health-care processes than those covered in the original research. Most cancer clinical research deals with separate diagnostic or treatment decisions in selected samples of patients, while the practice of cancer care usually involves dealing with complex multidisciplinary care processes in a variety of patient groups. There has been very little research into the best way to manage such processes and chains of related actions and decisions by different care providers. Also, it is not easy to translate guideline recommendations into decisions in practice, since guidelines can never cover all the relevant clinical details necessary for individual patients. Most guidelines fail to take these issues into account.

### The development of clinical practice guidelines and guidance statements of the American College of Physicians: summary of methods [^230bd27b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) established its evidence-based clinical practice guidelines program in 1981. The ACP's Guidelines Committee and the staff of the Clinical Programs and Quality of Care Department develop the clinical recommendations. The ACP develops 2 different types of clinical recommendations: clinical practice guidelines and clinical guidance statements. The ACP clinical practice guidelines and guidance statements follow a multistep development process that includes a systematic review of the evidence, deliberation of the evidence by the committee, summary recommendations, and evidence and recommendation grading. All ACP clinical practice guidelines and clinical guidance statements, if not updated, are considered automatically withdrawn or invalid 5 years after publication or once an update has been issued.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^e807bcaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^54c39a78]. DoD/VA (2021). High credibility.

Appendix G — clinical symptom management after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) serves as a reference guide for common post-mTBI symptoms and emphasizes that symptom treatment is not based on the underlying mechanism of injury but on standardized clinical practice for the diagnosed disorder, and that due to a lack of randomized controlled trials providers must use clinical judgment and refer to other VA/DoD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). For behavioral symptoms, emergence can depend on pre-injury, injury, and post-injury factors, and the nature and severity of symptoms, as ascertained in a thorough medical history, should be determined to optimally choose appropriate treatments. A comprehensive treatment plan that integrates psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions is recommended, and it is clinically reasonable to expect that alleviating and improving one symptom may lead to an improvement in other symptoms and symptom clusters. Co-occurring mental health problems should be comprehensively managed, there are no specific FDA-approved pharmaceutical agents for post-concussive neurological or behavioral symptoms, and management of behavioral and mental health conditions following mTBI should be guided by behavioral CPGs and guidance from the mental health field.

### How to use a clinical practice guideline [^80866dfa]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Leading organizations increasingly recognize clinical practice guidelines as an important approach in promoting an evidence-based clinical practice of urology. In light of their considerable clinical, economic and medicolegal impact, guideline users should be confident that the guidelines were rigorously developed and address relevant patient questions. In this article we outline a practical approach for critically appraising a clinical practice guideline.

Materials and Methods

We outline a 3-step approach to the assessment of a clinical practice guideline that answers the questions of whether the recommendations are valid, what the recommendations are and whether they will help in the treatment of an individual patient.

Results

To determine the adequacy of a clinical practice guideline, urologists should carefully review the rigor of the development process and its content. Important questions that relate to the validity of a guideline are whether, for specific questions, all important management options and outcomes were considered, and whether there was an explicit and sensible process to identify, select and combine all relevant evidence. Clinical practice guidelines should formally grade the quality of the available evidence for a given clinical question and outline a formal process of how the recommendations were derived. Value judgments made in the guideline development process about the relative importance of the potential benefits and harms of a given health care intervention should be made transparent to the reader. The recommendations made should be practical and should address important clinical issues. Furthermore, their strength should be graded to reflect the underlying uncertainty about the evidence and the values applied in the guideline development process.

Conclusions

The systematic approach presented in this article will allow urologists to critically appraise clinical practice guidelines. Determining the validity of the recommendations, understanding the recommendations and assessing their applicability to patients are 3 fundamental steps toward an evidence-based approach to using clinical practice guidelines.

### The need for rigour in consensus statements and guidelines [^8148f0be]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines and consensus statements are an essential aid to clinical practice. However, they bring with them risks. Amongst these are the exclusion of key stakeholders, the creation of mutual self-citation networks, and a lack of rigour in implementing and documenting the consensus process. This editorial explores the challenges of producing robust consensus statements and guidelines that have impact, and identifies current frameworks for addressing these. It is important to conduct clinical consensus exercises using recognised and accepted methodologies.

There are a wide variety of diseases that affect the thyroid gland ranging from hyperplastic to neoplastic, autoimmune, or inflammatory. They can present with functional abnormality or a palpable structural change. Imaging has a key role in diagnosing and characterizing the thyroid finding for management. Imaging is also essential in the management of thyroid cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria radiologic management of hepatic malignancy [^31e95ab5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Management of hepatic malignancy is a challenging clinical problem involving several different medical and surgical disciplines. Because of the wide variety of potential therapies, treatment protocols for various malignancies continue to evolve. Consequently, development of appropriate therapeutic algorithms necessitates consideration of medical options, such as systemic chemotherapy; surgical options, such as resection or transplantation; and locoregional therapies, such as thermal ablation and transarterial embolization. The authors discuss treatment strategies for the 3 most common subtypes of hepatic malignancy treated with locoregional therapies: hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroendocrine metastases, and colorectal metastases. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Key standards and principles for developing evidence-based clinical guidelines: balancing health professional, patient, funder, and government needs [^630dca46]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are critical tools to inform healthcare decision-making, yet development faces significant challenges in ensuring rigorous, reliable, and globally applicable recommendations. This review examines the essential standards and evolving approaches for creating high-quality, evidence-based guidelines that can effectively support clinical practice across diverse healthcare settings. Key standards for high-quality clinical practice guideline development emerge from leading global health organizations, emphasizing several critical components-establishing a multidisciplinary development group, defining a clear and relevant scope, conducting systematic evidence reviews and meta-analyses, and ensuring transparency throughout the development process. Innovative principles address emerging challenges such as research integrity assessment, incorporation of patient-centered methodologies, promotion of global collaborative approaches, and development of strategic implementation strategies. These evolving principles recognize the complex landscape of modern healthcare, where guidelines should adhere to rigorous standards to genuinely improve patient outcomes and encourage best practice care across diverse healthcare settings.

### Improving clinical practice guidelines for practicing cardiologists [^cfad252c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac-related clinical practice guidelines have become an integral part of the practice of cardiology. Unfortunately, these guidelines are often long, complex, and difficult for practicing cardiologists to use. Guidelines should be condensed and their format upgraded, so that the key messages are easier to comprehend and can be applied more readily by those involved in patient care. After presenting the historical background and describing the guideline structure, we make several recommendations to make clinical practice guidelines more user-friendly for clinical cardiologists. Our most important recommendations are that the clinical cardiology guidelines should focus exclusively on (1) class I recommendations with established benefits that are supported by randomized clinical trials and (2) class III recommendations for diagnostic or therapeutic approaches in which quality studies show no benefit or possible harm. Class II recommendations are not evidence based but reflect expert opinions related to published clinical studies, with potential for personal bias by members of the guideline committee. Class II recommendations should be published separately as "Expert Consensus Statements" or "Task Force Committee Opinions", so that both majority and minority expert opinions can be presented in a less dogmatic form than the way these recommendations currently appear in clinical practice guidelines.

### Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations [^66b63d23]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Users of clinical practice guidelines and other recommendations need to know how much confidence they can place in the recommendations. Systematic and explicit methods of making judgments can reduce errors and improve communication. We have developed a system for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts. In this article we present a summary of our approach from the perspective of a guideline user. Judgments about the strength of a recommendation require consideration of the balance between benefits and harms, the quality of the evidence, translation of the evidence into specific circumstances, and the certainty of the baseline risk. It is also important to consider costs (resource utilisation) before making a recommendation. Inconsistencies among systems for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations reduce their potential to facilitate critical appraisal and improve communication of these judgments. Our system for guiding these complex judgments balances the need for simplicity with the need for full and transparent consideration of all important issues.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management? [^cbf9acb9]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines and evidence-based medicine: the downfall of the Holy Grail

Over 20 years ago, evidence-based medicine began to replace medical practices based on tradition, anecdotes, and theoretical reasoning through empirical evidence from clinical trials. The foundations of evidence-based medicine rely on the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. Ideally, the knowledge obtained from high-quality clinical trials should translate directly into patient management in daily practice, thus improving patient care and replacing unproven clinical approaches. Unfortunately, this courageous concept has several inherent problems. Given the extremely high cost of good-quality clinical trials, these are mostly performed under the direction of the pharmaceutical industry, thus targeting their needs for the approval of new therapies rather than the often differing needs of clinical practice. Consequently, many challenges faced in daily patient care have never been nor will ever be addressed through an evidence-based approach. Moreover, guidelines based solely on evidence from clinical trials are prone to overestimated, standardized diagnostic procedures in accordance with clinical trial needs, thus leading to a management-centered rather than a patient-centered approach. Inflexible rules from evidence-based guidelines also exclude a significant proportion of the patient population from an appropriate clinical diagnosis and potentially disenfranchise them from available therapies, leaving patients and physicians in a diagnostic and therapeutic void and increasing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty. Finally, complex diseases and multimorbidity are difficult to address with evidence-based guidelines, since clinical trials tend to exclude complexity for evident reasons. Linked to this is the challenge of the methodology of guideline development. Experience with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology reveals that the recommendations are sometimes insufficient to allow an appropriate differentiation. Moreover, the wording is often awkward, using formulas which make it difficult for physicians to fully understand the meaning of a recommendation. Conversely, expert opinion based on clinical experience may be able to provide clear guidance even in the absence of formal evidence. Regrettably, in the past, opinion hegemony of powerful personalities or groups, as well as supposed "evidence-based medicine", were the source of mis- or over-interpretation of the available evidence eventually leading to biased, potentially harmful recommendations. The above issues are of particular importance in a rare disease such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where individual physicians often have limited experience and rely on the available guidance.

### Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management [^7847e721]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The past decade has been marked by unprecedented interest in evidence-based medicine and various types of avenues that can provide valid and reliable information about healthcare, including clinical practice guidelines. Thus, healthcare decisions are purportedly and increasingly being made on research-based evidence rather than on expert opinion or clinical experience alone. The methods describing evidence synthesis or development of guidelines in interventional pain management are scarce.

Objective

To describe the methods of evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management in practical terms.

Description

This review sought to provide an understanding of evidence-based medicine, the importance and synthesis of clinical practice guidelines, and the variety of issues related to rating the quality of individual articles, understanding narrative and systematic reviews, grading the strength of the body of evidence, searching for evidence, and finally, the analytical preparation of guidelines, with a focus on interventional pain management.

Conclusion

Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management is a complex and difficult task. It is emphasized that practice guidelines are not intended as standards or absolute requirements. Consequently, practice guidelines may be adapted, modified, or rejected, according to the clinical needs and constraints of each practitioner and patient.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of infected fluid collections [^db0e6018]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infected fluid collections are common and occur in a variety of clinical scenarios throughout the body. Minimally invasive image-guided management strategies for infected fluid collections are often preferred over more invasive options, given their low rate of complications and high rates of success. However, specific clinical scenarios, anatomic considerations, and prior or ongoing treatments must be considered when determining the optimal management strategy. As such, several common scenarios relating to infected fluid collections were developed using evidence-based guidelines for management. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with neoplastic vertebral fractures [^6880b672]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Grades of recommendation for summaries or reviews of studies as adopted by the North American Spine Society define A: Good evidence (Level I studies with consistent findings) for or against recommending intervention; B: Fair evidence (Level II or III studies with consistent findings) for or against recommending intervention; C: Poor quality evidence (Level IV or V studies) for or against recommending intervention; and I: Insufficient or conflicting evidence not allowing a recommendation for or against intervention. The guideline specifies standard wording and strength: Guideline recommendations are written utilizing a standard language that indicates the strength of the recommendation. "A" recommendations indicate a test or intervention is "recommended"; "B" recommendations "suggest" a test or intervention and "C" recommendations indicate a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option". "I" or "Insufficient Evidence" statements clearly indicate that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against" a test or intervention. Methodology is described such that In evaluating studies as to levels of evidence for this guideline, the study design was interpreted as establishing only a potential level of evidence, for example a therapeutic study designed as a randomized controlled trial would be considered a potential Level I study, after which The study would then be further analyzed as to how well the study design was implemented and significant shortcomings in the execution of the study would be used to downgrade the levels of evidence assigned to the study's conclusions, including possibilities such as an underpowered study (patient sample too small, variance too high), inadequate randomization or masking of the group assignments and lack of validated outcome measures.

Evaluation of cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) — practice points: Establish the cause of CKD using clinical context, personal and family history, social and environmental factors, medications, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic and pathologic diagnosis, and use tests to establish a cause based on resources available. Identification of cause is often achieved by standard clinical methods together with specialized investigations, not all evaluations of cause are required in all people, and clinicians should tailor the evaluation to local resource constraints, including when people may not be able to pay for some tests.

### Status of practice guidelines in the United States: CDC guidelines as an example [^cc1cf4d2]. Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines have proliferated in the past several decades, starting with only a handful in the 1980s to over 1000 approved through The National Guideline Clearinghouse in 2002.

Methods

The purposes of this article to review research related to guideline adoption and impact and to make recommendations for assessing the outcomes of guidelines, using the CDC guideline process as an example.

Results

Despite the national movement toward standardization of evidence-based practice, few studies have been conducted to assess the costs of guideline development and implementation, and some practice guidelines have been implemented without concomitant assessment on patient outcomes and costs and benefits of changes in care.

Conclusions

An immediate mandate is to ensure that when guidelines are promulgated, they include an evaluation plan, developed by the implementer of the guideline, which takes advantage of existing qualitative and quantitative data and programs (e.g., patient-centered care, quality assurance, risk management) not limited to expensive and sophisticated clinical trials.

### Clinical practice guidelines: towards better quality guidelines and increased international collaboration [^7be9a3a1]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GUIDELINE DEVELOPERS

To ensure that guidelines are of high quality, they should be preferably developed within a structured and coordinated guidelines programme (Table 2

Table 2
Key criteria for good clinical guideline programmes). A recent French 'before–after' controlled study confirmed the positive impact of the newly established SOR guidelines programme on medical practice for cancer management. Sufficient budget and resources are also needed. However, substantial savings could be made by active cooperation between national and international guideline organisations. This could include the exchange of existing cancer guidelines and evidence reports, collaboration for literature searches for revision of those guidelines, and organising joint peer review of draft guidelines. However, effective and efficient collaboration requires that the methodological principles are common. The development of the AGREE instrument, which involved the participation of leaders from various guideline development organizations, revealed an increased international consensus and willingness to work together. Recent programmes may benefit from the methodology created by more established programmes. However, it must also be kept in mind that each country has its own norms and values that influence the content and presentation of guidelines. Therefore, the aim should not be to develop international guidelines, but to reach international agreement about the requirements for methodology and reporting of guidelines. The AGREE instrument is an excellent aid for improving the reporting of guidelines. For instance, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) provides a guide with examples derived from SIGN guidelines, adjacent to each item, on how information can be made available. Uniform reporting gives a certain guarantee of quality. Moreover, it simplifies the comparison of guidelines for the same clinical conditions. For the development (or revision) of guidelines, the use of existing high-quality guidelines (for instance, guidelines included in the US National Guideline Clearing house) can save a lot of time and effort. For example, the literature search and review could be used when similar questions are being examined. Above all, it is useful to see how other guideline development groups have collected and interpreted the evidence and how they have translated the evidence into recommendations. After publication, guidelines must be disseminated and implemented effectively. Guideline developers should be aware of the potential facilitators for and barriers to implementation when they are formulating the recommendations. If substantial changes in practice are necessary to apply the recommendations, additional information should be added with practical suggestions, for example, about improved organisation of the care processes. They should also pay particular attention to the format and presentation of the guideline, for example, by providing short summaries that can be easily used during contacts with patients. Furthermore, application tools should be developed, such as indicators for performance assessment, teaching materials, patient information pamphlets, or computer decision-aids. It is important to involve the end users in the development process to ensure local acceptance and relevance to local practice.

### A scoping review of evidence-based guidance and guidelines published by general practice professional organizations [^65227fdd]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

General practitioners (GPs) practice medicine in the setting of the community and the family, and are responsible for providing comprehensive and ongoing care to every individual seeking medical support irrespective of their illness, sex, or age. Internationally there are variations in healthcare structures and the cultural settings that GPs practice in, but there are also similar components. For example in many countries GPs act as gatekeepers, facilitating access to hospital and speciality care and certain diagnostic tests.

GPs endeavour to use a patient centred approach to achieve shared decision making, through the integration of clinical evidence, clinical judgement, and patient priorities. In this setting, accessible, succinct, evidence-based guidance is required by GPs to support patient care. Clinical practice guidelines, being systematically developed statements, based on a comprehensive evaluation of evidence, aim to address this need and support practitioners' to make healthcare decisions. However, a review of 45 UK clinical practice guidelines reported a significant number of guideline recommendations were based on studies with little relevance to primary care. With up to 80% of GP consultations involving the management of patients with multiple chronic medical conditions, GPs require adequate decision support to deliver such complex care in the primary care setting. High workload and time pressure are significant barriers to utilization of clinical guidelines, however, despite these barriers, GPs are more likely to use guidelines that involved GP contributors during the development stage and where the evidence is applicable to primary care.

### Contemporary treatment principles for early rheumatoid arthritis: a consensus statement [^bf78e0a8]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

RA has a substantial impact on both patients and healthcare systems. Our objective is to advance the understanding of modern management principles in light of recent evidence concerning the condition's diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

A group of practicing UK rheumatologists formulated contemporary management principles and clinical practice recommendations concerning both diagnosis and treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty were documented, leading to research recommendations.

Results

A fundamental concept governing treatment of RA is minimization of cumulative inflammation, referred to as the inflammation-time area under the curve (AUC). To achieve this, four core principles of management were identified: (i) detect and refer patients early, even if the diagnosis is uncertain: patients should be referred at the first suspicion of persistent inflammatory polyarthritis and rheumatology departments should provide rapid access to a diagnostic and prognostic service; (ii) treat RA immediately: optimizing outcomes with conventional DMARDs and biologics requires that effective treatment be started early-ideally within 3 months of symptom onset; (iii) tight control of inflammation in RA improves outcome: frequent assessments and an objective protocol should be used to make treatment changes that maintain low-disease activity/remission at an agreed target; (iv) consider the risk-benefit ratio and tailor treatment to each patient: differing patient, disease and drug characteristics require long-term monitoring of risks and benefits with adaptations of treatments to suit individual circumstances.

Conclusion

These principles focus on effective control of the inflammatory process in RA, but optimal uptake may require changes in service provision to accommodate appropriate care pathways.

Performance measurement and payment are increasingly linked to goals established by practice guidelines. The best guidelines are based on systematic reviews and patient-oriented evidence, use an evidence-rating system such as the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, and are prospectively validated. The guidelines also should have a transparent development process, identify potential conflicts of interest, and offer flexibility in various clinical situations.

Level 2 "we suggest": for patients, "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not"; for clinicians, "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences"; and for policy, "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined".

### Recommendations following a modified UK-Delphi consensus study on best practice for referral and management of severe asthma [^fc698c66]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Severe asthma affects an estimated 3%–5% of people with asthma, and is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite adherence to maximal inhaled therapy, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Data from the UK Severe Asthma Registry highlights that these patients have poor asthma control, impaired lung function, high exacerbation rates and frequent exposure to oral corticosteroids (OCS). Severe asthma is associated with very high healthcare costs due to medication use, unscheduled healthcare utilisation and management of OCS-related adverse events. These costs have been shown to be four times higher for uncontrolled severe asthma patients than the general asthma population.

While the majority of patients with asthma have inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-responsive, mild-to-moderate disease, which can be routinely managed in the primary care setting, patients with severe disease require systematic assessment including accurate phenotyping within a specialist multidisciplinary secondary or tertiary care setting in which advanced therapies such as biological treatments can be initiated if appropriate.

Despite the introduction of specialist asthma services in many parts of the UK and the increased availability of advanced therapeutic options to manage severe asthma, multiple challenges still remain.

The 2014 National Report into Asthma Deathsidentified a number of areas of practice where improved care could reduce asthma mortality. Among the most frequently cited factors were the failure to:

Recognise the risk status of the patient.
Provide the right level of asthma expertise.
Perform adequate asthma reviews.
Refer to an asthma specialist when indicated.

Despite this, according to the Office of National Statistics, there were 1392 deaths from asthma exacerbations in England and Wales in 2018, an increase of 6% since 2017 and a rise of 26% over the previous 5 years.

According to an Asthma UK survey of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs), patient referrals to a specialist service for diagnosis and management of severe asthma can be delayed by many years. Inconsistent thresholds used to trigger referrals by primary and secondary care as well as a lack of clarity on referral criteria are cited as key reasons for this. The report highlights capacity and resource challenges (ie, current healthcare provision may be insufficient to support patient numbers) faced by specialist services to manage patients in the most effective way.

### Development of a novel algorithm to determine adherence to chronic pain treatment guidelines using administrative claims [^680fc7e9]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In recent decades, the focus of patient care has been shifting toward disease management and quality improvement. Clinical practice guidelines, according to the 2011 definition developed by the Institute of Medicine, are disease management recommendations intended to optimize patient care, "informed by systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options". Objectives common to numerous clinical practice guidelines available from the US National Guideline Clearinghouse (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Humans Services) include improving the quality of care, treatment outcomes, appropriateness and effectiveness of care, and providing an optimal ratio of costs to benefits. While most physicians are aware of their practice's relevant guidelines, numerous studies have found gaps in clinician adherence to guidelines, leading to suboptimal outcomes of morbidity and mortality and significant financial costs estimated at $100 billion annually in the US.–

Guidelines should help physicians prescribe the best treatment management pathway for most patients. Some disease-specific guidelines are very clear and straightforward with their recommendations, such as Hypertension Guidelines linked to metrics (eg, blood pressure) to help guide when to incorporate adjunctive therapy. Other conditions are more complex, with many different treatment pathways one could prescribe, and one gold standard for guidelines may not exist, such as with chronic pain conditions. Guidelines for chronic pain conditions vary for FL treatments and adjunctive therapy based on the nature and level of pain. Measuring the level of pain is typically a subject matter that may vary for different patients and pain etiologies, making management even more complex. Furthermore, most patients have multiple pain comorbidities, making it hard to pinpoint the pain condition to be treated. Another challenge with pain conditions is the option for treatment with opioids, for which there is currently considerable controversy surrounding opioid use and abuse. Chronic pain guidelines typically layer treatment recommendations to deal with these factors, with treatment choices that may be complex and/or confusing.–

### Commentary on the role of expert opinion in developing evidence-based guidelines [^ccb99c2c]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) help guide busy practitioners in clinical decision making. CPGs are evidence-based in that recommendations are based on available knowledge derived from published clinical trials. The challenges presented by the tasks of finding, assessing, interpreting, and assembling the information in these reports are herculean. Missing or imperfect evidence may lead to the publication of suboptimal guidelines, even when the other components of the development process have been flawlessly performed. This commentary highlights the requirement that expert opinion must be explicitly recognized by CPG authoring groups when the published evidence is missing or inadequate.

### Guidelines and algorithms: strategies for standardization of referral criteria in diagnostic radiology [^e741d268]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines can be regarded as special forms of algorithms and have been shown to be useful tools for supporting medical decision making. With the Council Directive 97/43/Euratom recommendations concerning referral criteria for medical exposure have to be implemented into national law of all EU member states. The time- and cost-consuming efforts of developing, implementing, and updating such guidelines are balanced by the acceptance in clinical practice and eventual better health outcomes. Clearly defined objectives with special attention drawn on national and regional differences among potential users, support from organisations with expertise in evidence-based medicine, separated development of the evidence component and the recommendations component, and large-scale strategies for distribution and implementation are necessary. Editors as well as users of guidelines for referral criteria have to be aware which expectations can be met and which cannot be fulfilled with this instrument; thus, dealing with guidelines requires a new form of "diagnostic reasoning" based on medical ethics.

Patients with acute nonspecific chest pain and low probability for coronary disease remain an important clinical management dilemma. We focus on evidence for imaging, in an integrated decision-making setting. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Clinical practice guidelines: towards better quality guidelines and increased international collaboration [^bbb7abfc]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The final AGREE instrument consists of 23 key items (Table 1

Table 1
The AGREE instrument) categorised into six domains (see:). Each domain is intended to measure a separate dimension of guideline quality.

Scope and purpose (items 1–3): These items are concerned with the overall aim of the guideline, the specific clinical questions and the target patient population.

Stakeholder involvement (items 4–7): These items focus on the extent to which the guideline represents the views of its intended users. Guideline development needs to be carried out by a multidisciplinary group involving all stakeholders whose clinical activities are likely to be covered in the proposed guideline. This also includes patient groups.

Rigour of development (items 8–14): These items relate to the process used to gather and synthesise the evidence, and the methods used to formulate the recommendations and to update them. The recommendations should be explicitly linked to the supporting evidence. However, because most current guidelines use a mixture of 'expert' judgement and literature review, disclosure of disagreement or uncertainties encountered during the development may help to clarify the process. Guidelines should be reviewed externally before publication, and the process used clearly described. They should also always include a date of publication, and because guidelines need to reflect current research, they should contain a clear statement about the updating procedures.

Clarity and presentation (items 15–18): These items deal with the language and format of the guidelines. Since the main role of guidelines is to help clinicians and patients make better decisions, busy clinicians need simple, patient-specific, user-friendly guidelines that are easy to understand. Good guidelines present clear information about the management options available and the likely consequences of each. This information can be presented in a variety of formats to suit the needs of the user.

Applicability (items 19–21): These items cover the likely organisational, behavioural and cost implications of applying the guidelines. Guidelines should be feasible to use in the current organisation of care and must fit into routine practice and the time constraints present. In addition, review criteria should be developed that link the guideline use to audits and other quality improvement initiatives.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^e6498189]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^9dcc34f9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

ASAM guideline document types — Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG), Clinical Consensus Statement, and Clinical Consideration — are differentiated by definition, scope, and methodology. Clinical Practice Guideline is "The most rigorous clinical and scientific document ASAM develops informed by a formal systematic review" that "addresses prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions within the scope of Addiction Medicine", and CPGs "include Full CPG Updates and Focused CPG Updates". Clinical Consensus Statement "While remaining informed by evidence, these statements are more relevant to topics with observational evidence, case studies, and consensus agreement", and "may also provide consensus agreement when several conflicting clinical guidelines are available", with these statements "meant to have high clinical relevance". Clinical Consideration is described as "Expert consensus-based clinical documents that discuss existing evidence for a focused topic. This document is based on less rigorous methods of development than a Clinical Practice Guideline or Clinical Consensus Statement", and "This document is meant to have high clinical relevance and address real-practice complexities of care". Regarding scope, CPGs cover "High priority, far reaching topics", Clinical Consensus Statement aims to "Reconcile clinical guidelines", and Clinical Consideration "Tackles issues that emerge as being clinically relevant at a given point in time". Methodologically, CPG recommendations follow a "Formal process. Recommendations follow a formal process with systematic review of evidence as outlined by the new 2023 ASAM methodology", Clinical Consensus Statement uses a "Rigorous review of available evidence and/or existing CPGs and their evidence base is used to develop consensus statements based on reported benefits, harms, costs, patient preferences, and values", and Clinical Consideration "Incorporates some evaluation of evidence but can be a narrative review and involve consensus opinion".

### Distinguishing ASH clinical practice guidelines from other forms of ASH clinical advice [^674ddb23]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) produces a wide range of resources that provide guidance to clinicians on the diagnosis and management of blood diseases. These resources include clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and CPG-derived products (eg, pocket guides, patient versions of guidelines, and teaching slide sets) as well as other forms of clinical advice (eg, How I Treat articles, webinars, frequently asked questions [FAQs], ASH annual meeting education sessions, the ASH Self-Assessment Program, and the Hematology Review Series).

It may not be clear to all users how these resources differ, particularly with respect to the methods underpinning their development and the recommendations they provide.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^1b014182]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The importance of sex and gender in the diagnosis and management of health conditions is well established, but the extent to which sex and gender disaggregated evidence is integrated into UK clinical practice guidelines remains unknown. Recent reviews of clinical guidelines in Canada and Europe identified that limited and inconsistent attention was paid to sex and gender dimensions of health and illness. This study aimed to determine how the UK's National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines account for sex and gender.

Methods

The study reviewed all NICE guidelines categorised as 'clinical guidelines' by NICE (223), excluding those solely linked to single-sex conditions (26). Reviewers evaluated whether they included information on sex and/or gender dimensions of disease risk, presentation, investigations and management. They also examined if sex and/or gender dimensions were considered outside of pregnancy, and how the gender of guideline committee chairs and members corresponded to how well sex and/or gender were accounted for.

Results

Of 197 guidelines reviewed, 120 (61%) referenced sex and/or gender dimensions, with 81 (41%) referencing these dimensions outside of pregnancy and childbearing. A minority of guidelines mentioned sex and/or gender dimensions related to disease pathophysiology (2%), clinical presentation (9%), investigations (15%) and epidemiology (19%). 162 guidelines published details of their committee chairs, and 126 (76%) were men. Committees chaired by women tended to produce guidelines, which scored better for consideration of sex and gender.

Conclusion

This study highlights key gaps in NICE guidelines which must be addressed through systematic, whole-sector progress to integrate sex and gender disaggregated research into clinical guidelines. As the single focal point responsible for guideline development in England and Wales, NICE has a unique opportunity to establish robust mechanisms to routinely embed this important evidence in guidelines. Multiple initiatives are recommended to identify relevant existing evidence across all clinical specialties.

### Trustworthy evidence-based versus untrustworthy guidelines: detecting the difference [^5bf30116]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In making decisions, patients and clinicians must trade off the benefits against the downsides of alternative strategies. Formal guidelines are essential tools in healthcare decision-making which, when optimally developed, provide health professionals with trustworthy evidence-based recommendations to guide their practice when confronting such trade-offs.

In producing trustworthy guidelines, developers must consider, in addition to the best estimates of effect size for both harms and benefits, their confidence in these estimates (the certainty or quality of the evidence). Trustworthy guidelines should, therefore, inform clinicians not only on the direction (against or in favour) and strength (strong or weak/conditional) of recommendations but also on the certainty of underlying evidence. To obtain the best estimates of intervention benefits, harms and burdens and assess the credibility of the evidence, guidelines require rigorously conducted systematic reviews.

Once guideline panels have such reviews available, they must interpret results, which requires both clinical and methodological expertise, and consider patients' values and preferences. When panels have conducted the process optimally, healthcare professionals can confidently consider recommendations to help make decisions in complex clinical circumstances, evaluate different treatment options and through shared decision-making facilitate patients' choice of clinical management.

This usefulness of guidelines presupposes that they have been rigorously developed and, thus, meet standards of trustworthiness. Historically, very few if any guidelines adhered to these standards; we sometimes refer to this traditional approach as GOBSAT — good old boys sitting around a table. Many guidelines still fail to adhere to trustworthiness standards, still looking more like GOBSAT.

It is, therefore, essential that healthcare professionals — and, for system-level guidelines, policymakers — are able to distinguish guidelines that are trustworthy from those that are not. The aim of this paper is to inform clinicians and policymakers on how to determine guideline trustworthiness. To do so, we offer eight domains (see table 1) in which a lack of rigour can compromise guideline trustworthiness.

### Recommendations following a modified UK-Delphi consensus study on best practice for referral and management of severe asthma [^d3844fb7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Key messages

What opinions exist (through patient and healthcare professional consensus) to help define standards of care in areas (referral and management of severe asthma) where the evidence base is lacking.
Based on areas of consensus, 10 key recommendations were derived and focus on referrals from primary and secondary care, accessing specialist asthma services, homecare provision for severe asthma patients and outcome measures.
Implementation of these 10 recommendations across the severe asthma pathway in the UK has the potential to improve outcomes for patients by reducing delays to assessment and initiation of advanced phenotype-specific therapies.

### Assessing guideline-concordant care for patients with multimorbidity treated in a care management setting [^357508f1]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Disease-specific guidelines are not aligned with multimorbidity care complexity. Meeting all guideline-recommended care for multimorbid patients has been estimated but not demonstrated across multiple guidelines.

Objective

Measure guideline-concordant care for patients with multimorbidity; assess in what types of care and by whom (clinician or patient) deviation from guidelines occurs and evaluate whether patient characteristics are associated with concordance.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of care received over 1 year, conducted across 11 primary care clinics within the context of multimorbidity-focused care management program. Patients were aged 45+ years with more than two common chronic conditions and were sampled based on either being new (≤ 6 months) or veteran to the program (≥ 1 year).

Measures

Three guideline concordance measures were calculated for each patient out of 44 potential guideline-recommended care processes for nine chronic conditions: overall score; referral score (proportion of guideline-recommended care referred) and patient-only score (proportion of referred care completed by patients). Guideline concordance was stratified by care type.

Results

4386 care processes evaluated among 204 patients, mean age = 72.3 years (standard deviation = 9.7). Overall, 79.2% of care was guideline concordant, 87.6% was referred according to guidelines and patients followed 91.4% of referred care. Guideline-concordant care varied across care types. Age, morbidity burden and whether patients were new or veteran to the program were associated with guideline concordance.

Conclusions

Patients with multimorbidity do not receive ~20% of guideline recommendations, mostly due to clinicians not referring care. Determining the types of care for which the greatest deviation from guidelines exists can inform the tailoring of care for multimorbidity patients.

### Canadian guideline for parkinson disease [^b1c22bf3]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to general principles, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to ensure that patients with PD have regular access to the following:

- clinical monitoring and medication adjustment

- continuing point of contact for support, including home visits, when appropriate

- reliable source of information about clinical and social matters of concern to patients with PD and their caregivers, which may be provided by a PD nurse specialist.

### Guidelines international network: toward international standards for clinical practice guidelines [^f506eea7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Guideline development processes vary substantially, and many guidelines do not meet basic quality criteria. Standards for guideline development can help organizations ensure that recommendations are evidence-based and can help users identify high-quality guidelines. Such organizations as the U.S. Institute of Medicine and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have developed recommendations to define trustworthy guidelines within their locales. Many groups charged with guideline development find the lengthy list of standards developed by such organizations to be aspirational but infeasible to follow in entirety. Founded in 2002, the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) is a network of guideline developers that includes 93 organizations and 89 individual members representing 46 countries. The G-I-N board of trustees recognized the importance of guideline development processes that are both rigorous and feasible even for modestly funded groups to implement and initiated an effort toward consensus about minimum standards for high-quality guidelines. In contrast to other existing standards for guideline development at national or local levels, the key components proposed by G-I-N will represent the consensus of an international, multidisciplinary group of active guideline developers. This article presents G-I-N's proposed set of key components for guideline development. These key components address panel composition, decision-making process, conflicts of interest, guideline objective, development methods, evidence review, basis of recommendations, ratings of evidence and recommendations, guideline review, updating processes, and funding. It is hoped that this article promotes discussion and eventual agreement on a set of international standards for guideline development.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^43d7cf9c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Patients with co-occurring conditions in major depressive disorder (MDD) — co-occurring conditions (medical and psychiatric) can modify the degree of risk, impact diagnosis, influence patient and provider treatment priorities and clinical decisions, and affect the overall approach to the management of MDD; many Veterans, Service Members, and their families have one or more co-occurring conditions; because MDD is sometimes accompanied by co-occurring conditions, it is often best to manage MDD collaboratively with other care providers; some co-occurring conditions may require early specialist consultation to determine any necessary changes in treatment or to establish a common understanding of how care will be coordinated, and this may entail reference to other VA/DoD CPGs (e.g., for PTSD, substance use disorders [SUD], suicide, stroke, and mild traumatic brain injury [mTBI]).

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^224f7c35]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of urinary tract obstruction [^a166eb11]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute obstructive uropathy is a medical emergency, which often is accompanied by acute renal failure or sepsis. Treatment options to resolve the acute obstructive process include conservative medical management, retrograde ureteral stenting, or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy or nephroureteral catheters. It is important to understand the various treatment options in differing clinical scenarios in order to guide appropriate consultation. Prompt attention to the underlying obstructive process is often imperative to avoid further deterioration of the patient's clinical status. A summary of the data and most up-to-date clinical trials regarding treatment options for urinary tract obstruction is outlined in this publication. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^6f911c2f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Dermatology adult atopic dermatitis (AD) comorbidity guideline — this document provides an evidence-based synthesis on comorbidities associated with AD in adults, using systematic reviews with meta-analyses and applying the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation for prognosis approach to assess certainty of evidence, and a multidisciplinary consensus process to finalize and approve 32 evidence-based statements. The guideline states there is clear evidence of an association between AD in adults and atopic and immune-mediated conditions, and the presence of atopic comorbidities can help establish the diagnosis of AD. Although the guideline does not make specific recommendations for the management of AD, it notes that comorbid inflammatory conditions may be considered when selecting AD treatments for individual patients, and that medications with multiple indications have the potential to simultaneously treat 2 or more diseases for individual patients.
