## Question

Can CPT code 99345 be used for outpatient medication management visits?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CPT code 99345 can be used for outpatient medication management visits. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what CPT 99345 actually represents and where it is intended to be used. Then, I should verify the correct code family for outpatient office visits and how medication management fits within those codes. Next, I will check whether any exceptions or modifiers would allow 99345 in an outpatient office setting. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, reference-backed conclusion and suggest the appropriate coding approach for outpatient medication management.

> Let me first confirm the code definition and setting for 99345. CPT 99345 is a home or residence evaluation and management code for a new patient, requiring high-level medical decision-making or at least 75 minutes of total time on the date of service, and it is intended for services provided in a private residence or similar non-facility setting, not in outpatient office or clinic settings [^5c7ea00e].

> Wait, let me verify the outpatient office visit code family. Outpatient office or clinic E/M services for new patients are coded with 99202–99205, and for established patients with 99211–99215, with level selection based on medical decision-making or total time on the date of service under the 2021 guidelines, which removed reliance on history and exam elements for code selection [^047f1ce3] [^ff6d29b6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether medication management changes the coding choice. Medication management is a component of medical decision-making and contributes to the complexity of an outpatient E/M visit, but it does not transform the visit into a home visit; therefore, it still maps to office/outpatient codes 99202–99205 or 99211–99215 depending on patient status and MDM/time, not to 99345 [^047f1ce3] [^ff6d29b6].

> I need to check for any exceptions or modifiers that might allow 99345 in an outpatient office. I should double-check, but there are no modifiers or special circumstances that convert an outpatient office visit into a home visit for coding purposes; 99345 is specifically for services rendered in the patient's home or residence and is not appropriate for clinic-based encounters, even if the clinical content is medication management [^5c7ea00e].

> Let me reconsider the practical implication. If a clinician is managing medications in the office and the visit meets criteria for high complexity or prolonged time, the correct approach is to use the highest appropriate office/outpatient code (for example, 99205 for a new patient with high MDM or 60–74 minutes, or 99215 for an established patient with high MDM or 40–54 minutes), and if total time exceeds the threshold for the highest-level code by at least 15 minutes, add the prolonged services code 99417 (or G0318 for Medicare home visits when applicable in the home setting) rather than substituting a home-visit code [^047f1ce3] [^5c7ea00e].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. No, CPT 99345 cannot be used for outpatient medication management visits that occur in an office or clinic setting; it is a home-visit code, and outpatient medication management should be coded using standard office/outpatient E/M codes 99202–99205 or 99211–99215 based on MDM or time, with prolonged services added only when criteria are met and in the correct setting [^5c7ea00e] [^047f1ce3] [^ff6d29b6].

---

CPT 99345 is **not appropriate** for routine outpatient medication management visits because it is a home visit code for new patients requiring high-complexity MDM or at least 75 minutes of total time [^5c7ea00e]. For outpatient medication management, use standard office/outpatient E/M codes (99202–99205 for new patients; 99212–99215 for established patients) [^047f1ce3] based on MDM or time, and consider add-on codes for prolonged services when applicable [^ff6d29b6]. Using 99345 for outpatient office visits will result in **claim denials** and coding errors.

---

## CPT code 99345: definition and appropriate use

CPT 99345 is defined as a home or residence evaluation and management (E/M) service for a new patient, requiring **high-complexity medical decision-making (MDM)** or a **minimum of 75 minutes of total time** on the date of the encounter [^5c7ea00e]. This code is specifically intended for services provided in the patient's home or residence, not in outpatient office or clinic settings.

---

## Outpatient medication management visits: appropriate CPT codes

For outpatient medication management visits conducted in office or clinic settings, the appropriate CPT codes are the standard office/outpatient E/M codes:

| **Patient status** | **Cpt codes** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| New patient | 99202–99205 | Office or other outpatient visit for the evaluation and management of a new patient, based on MDM or total time [^047f1ce3] |
| Established patient | 99212–99215 | Office or other outpatient visit for the evaluation and management of an established patient, based on MDM or total time [^047f1ce3] |

---

These codes should be selected based on the complexity of medical decision-making or the total time spent on the date of the encounter, in accordance with the 2021 CPT E/M guideline changes [^047f1ce3].

---

## Why CPT 99345 is inappropriate for outpatient medication management

Using CPT 99345 for outpatient medication management visits is inappropriate for the following reasons:

- **Setting mismatch**: CPT 99345 is specifically designated for home or residence visits, not outpatient office or clinic settings [^5c7ea00e].
- **Patient status mismatch**: CPT 99345 is intended for new patients, whereas many medication management visits involve established patients.
- **Documentation and billing errors**: Using CPT 99345 in outpatient settings can lead to claim denials, incorrect billing, and potential compliance issues.

---

## Consequences of incorrect CPT code usage

Incorrectly using CPT 99345 for outpatient medication management visits can result in:

- **Claim denials**: Insurance payers, including Medicare, will likely deny claims submitted with inappropriate CPT codes.
- **Revenue loss**: Denied claims result in lost revenue and increased administrative burden for healthcare providers.
- **Compliance issues**: Incorrect coding practices can lead to audits, penalties, and legal ramifications.

---

## Correct coding practices for outpatient medication management

To ensure accurate coding and billing for outpatient medication management visits, healthcare providers should:

- **Use appropriate CPT codes**: Utilize CPT codes 99202–99205 for new patients and 99212–99215 for established patients, based on MDM or total time [^047f1ce3].
- **Document thoroughly**: Clearly document the complexity of medical decision-making, the number and complexity of problems addressed, and the total time spent on the date of the encounter [^ff6d29b6].
- **Stay updated**: Keep abreast of current CPT coding guidelines and changes to ensure compliance and accurate billing [^5afe8801].

---

## Conclusion

CPT 99345 is **not appropriate** for outpatient medication management visits because it is a home visit code for new patients requiring high-complexity MDM or at least 75 minutes of total time [^5c7ea00e]. For outpatient medication management, use standard office/outpatient E/M codes (99202–99205 for new patients; 99212–99215 for established patients) based on MDM or time, and consider add-on codes for prolonged services when applicable [^047f1ce3]. Using 99345 for outpatient office visits will result in claim denials and coding errors.

### Consultations after elimination of payments for evaluation and management consultation codes [^0889799c]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

A consultation service provides expert opinion or advice at the request of another provider. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) eliminated reimbursement for the outpatient and inpatient consultation codes traditionally used to report these services (CPT 99241–99245 and 99251–99255, respectively), and private payers are likely to follow suit. CMS has instead mandated that these services are mapped to new or established visit codes for outpatients (99201–99205 or 99212–99215) and to initial or subsequent hospital services codes for inpatients (99221–99223 or 99231–99233). This article reviews appropriate medical consultation and provides specific guidance for the reporting of these services to CMS and other payers not reimbursing consultation codes.

### Differences in the complexity of office visits by physician specialty: NAMCS 2013–2016 [^bfa282af]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Specialty-to-specialty variation in use of outpatient evaluation and management service codes could lead to important differences in reimbursement among specialties.

Objective

To compare the complexity of visits to physicians whose incomes are largely dependent on evaluation and management services to the complexity of visits to physicians whose incomes are largely dependent on procedures.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We analyzed 53,670 established patient outpatient visits reported by physicians in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) from 2013 to 2016. We defined high complexity visits as those with an above average number of diagnoses (> 2) and/or medications (> 3) listed We based our comparison on time intervals corresponding to typical outpatient evaluation and management times as defined by the Current Procedural Terminology Manual and specialty utilization of evaluation and management codes based on 2015 Medicare payments.

Main Outcome and Measures

Proportion of complex visits by specialty category.

Key Results

We found significant differences in the content of similar-length office visits provided by different specialties. For level 4 established outpatient visits (99214), the percentage involving high diagnostic complexity ranged from 62% for internal medicine, 52% for family medicine/general practice, and 41% for neurology (specialties whose incomes are largely dependent on evaluation and management codes), to 34% for dermatology, 42% for ophthalmology, and 25% for orthopedic surgery (specialties whose incomes are more dependent on procedure codes) (p value of the difference < 0.001). High medication complexity was found in the following proportions of visits: internal medicine 56%, family medicine/general practice 49%, and neurology 43%, as compared with dermatology 33%, ophthalmology 30%, and orthopedic surgery 30% (p value of the difference < 0.001).

Conclusion

Within the same duration visits, specialties whose incomes depend more on evaluation and management codes on average addressed more clinical issues and managed more medications than specialties whose incomes are more dependent on procedures.

### The full scope of family physicians' work is not reflected by current procedural terminology codes [^9193c9b6]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to characterize the content of family physician (FP) clinic encounters, and to count the number of visits in which the FPs addressed issues not explicitly reportable by 99211 to 99215 and 99354 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes with current reimbursement methods and based on examples provided in the CPT manual.

Methods

The data collection instrument was modeled on the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Trained assistants directly observed every other FP-patient encounter and recorded every patient concern, issue addressed by the physician (including care barriers related to health care systems and social determinants), and treatment ordered in clinics affiliated with 10 residencies of the Residency Research Network of Texas. A visit was deemed to include physician work that was not explicitly reportable if the number or nature of issues addressed exceeded the definitions or examples for 99205/99215 or 99214 + 99354 or a preventive service code, included the physician addressing health care system or social determinant issues, or included the care of a family member.

Results

In 982 physician-patient encounters, patients raised 517 different reasons for visit (total, 5278; mean, 5.4 per visit; range, 1 to 16) and the FPs addressed 509 different issues (total issues, 3587; mean, 3.7 per visit; range, 1 to 10). FPs managed 425 different medications, 18 supplements, and 11 devices. A mean of 3.9 chronic medications were continued per visit (range, 0 to 21) and 4.6 total medications were managed (range, 0 to 22). In 592 (60.3%) of the visits the FPs did work that was not explicitly reportable with available CPT codes: 582 (59.3%) addressed more numerous issues than explicitly reportable, 64 (6.5%) addressed system barriers, and 13 (1.3%) addressed concerns for other family members.

Conclusions and Relevance

FPs perform cognitive work in a majority of their patient encounters that are not explicitly reportable, either by being higher than the CPT example number of diagnoses per code or the type of problems addressed, which has implications for the care of complex multi-morbid patients and the growth of the primary care workforce. To address these limitations, either the CPT codes and their associated rules should be updated to reflect the realities of family physicians' practices or new billing and coding approaches should be developed.

Medical decision making (MDM) levels and E/M service selection are defined as follows: Documentation of the complexity of MDM involves 4 types of engagement with options of Straightforward (CPT 99202, 99212), Low (CPT 99203, 99213), Moderate (CPT 99204, 99214), and High (CPT 99205, 99215); MDM has always been part of the algorithm for choosing a level of service but will now be the sole determinant of level of service (unless the provider intends to bill based on time), and from 2021 MDM is based on number and complexity of problem(s) addressed, amount and/or complexity of data reviewed and analyzed, and risk of complications and/or morbidity or mortality; effective January 1, 2021, the appropriate level of service for office or other outpatient E/M services is based on the level of the MDM as defined for each service.

Documenting to achieve the highest level of service

The chart below (table 3) summarizes the documentation necessary to garner the highest level of reimbursement for E/M services using either the 1995 or 1997 rules for a new patient H&P (History and Physical) in the hospital or office. These will not apply to ED visits for patients who are not admitted.

Table 3
Minimum requirements for highest-level billing in a new patient (inpatient/outpatient)

A new patient is one who has not received any professional services from the physician/qualified healthcare professional or another physician/qualified healthcare professional of the exact same specialty who belongs to the same group practice, within the past 3 years See table 4.

Table 4
Current codes for office encounters

An established patient is one who has received professional services from the physician/qualified healthcare professional or another physician/qualified healthcare professional of the exact same specialty and subspecialty who belongs to the same group practice, within the past 3 years. See Table 4.

Initial hospital care (99221 to 99223)

These codes are used to bill for initial hospital services otherwise known to physicians as H&Ps (see table 5). When admitting a patient to the hospital as an inpatient, these are the codes that should be used. More detailed information about use and documentation regarding these and many other CPT codes can be found at

Table 5
Initial hospital service codes

Hospital progress notes

There are three levels of inpatient services that are analyzed by information in the progress note. These range from 99231 to 99293 with increasing complexity (see table 6).

Inpatient hospital service codes (daily visits)

Claims require only two of the three components be documented to justify level of service

### Older adults who persistently present to the emergency department with severe, non-severe, and indeterminate episode patterns [^fbcbfc70]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Data Collection and Processing

Two CMS Medicare standard analytic files contain data on the provision of care in the ED — outpatient claims files and carrier claims files. ED services provided by physicians employed as hospital staff are submitted by the hospital as outpatient claims, and these claims reflect both professional (i.e. physician effort) and technical (i.e. lab testing) components of ED care. Physicians who are either self-employed or part of a larger, hospital affiliated physician group submit their ED claims to a designated Medicare carrier. In both cases claims submitted for procedures completed during an ED visit are identified with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) evaluation and management codes 99281–99285. (CPTs refer to the numeric coding system developed by the American Medical Association and used by healthcare providers to document clinical tasks performed during a particular procedure.) This approach to identifying ED claims has previously been used by the Institute of Medicine, and it accounts for over 80% of all Medicare ED expenditures.

In our previous study, we delineated a process for bundling these individual Medicare claims into a single episode of ED care consistent with Medicare guidelines. In particular, we bundled outpatient claims for which the "from" and "through" dates overlapped or were within 3 days, consistent with Medicare policy requiring outpatient claims files to be bundled if they occur within 72 hours. For the carrier files, we bundled claims with overlapping dates or those that were within 1 day of each other. This was necessary because Medicare claims have date but not time stamps, and therefore it is possible for a late-night ED encounter to carry over into the next calendar day. We then bundled the outpatient and carrier claims with overlapping dates and defined them as belonging to the same ED episode. We recognized that bundling claims over a consecutive three-day period may underestimate the actual number of episodes given that some individuals may enter and complete an ED episode on one day and then return to the ED on the next day. Therefore, we identified the number of episodes in which all claims were filed in a one day period from those in which claims spanned a two or three day period. This approach represented a significant methodological advancement because we eliminated the over-counting bias that otherwise occurs when ED use is constructed as a discrete visit measured by an individual claim. We used this same bundling approach to define the ED episodes in this study, extending our observation period through 2007.

### New billing rules for outpatient office visit codes [^fe13276e]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for clinical documentation of evaluation and management face-to-face services were developed > 20 years ago. Recently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have addressed office and other outpatient services and the corresponding reimbursement, intending to reduce the amount of required documentation and to alleviate clerical burden. A CMS final rule for 2021 will eliminate the history and physical examination as criteria for level of service, allow time or medical decision-making to be used as coding criteria, and will recognize a code for prolonged service. The net effect of these changes may be some decrease in documentation burden, a change in the composition of clinical notes, and greater recognition by CMS of primary care and those who see highly complex patients requiring prolonged services.

### Association of time-based billing with evaluation and management revenue for outpatient visits [^8b953139]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has some strengths. The findings are generalizable to different specialties and clinics. The study reported yearly E/M revenue for a full-time physician, but the relative difference between MDM-based billing revenue and time-based billing revenue was unchanged for physicians not working a 40-hour work week. By incorporating data on after-hours documentation, we also accounted for the much longer work hours actually spent by many physicians who are scheduled to be in clinic for 40 hours a week. Although the base-case scenario used PCP billing data, the analysis can be readily repeated for specialty or even clinic-specific data. For example, we used previously published work to estimate the mean time spent on unreimbursed tasks per patient, but physicians can substitute individual data to obtain a personalized estimate.

This study also has some key limitations. First, we used Medicare data to identify the distribution of CPT codes for MDM-based billing. If Medicare beneficiaries required more MDM than patients without Medicare coverage, then use of Medicare data artificially increased the MDM-based billing revenues. We also were unable to account for the implications of recent changes to simplify MDM-billing guidelines because the MDM billing distribution in the model used 2019 data.

Second, we assumed that physicians used either MDM-based billing or time-based billing for all of their patient encounters. In actual practice, a physician can choose whichever billing method can generate a higher reimbursement. Similarly, in the model, the calculations held constant the E/M billing distribution for MDM across different lengths of visits. In practice, short patient visits are more likely to be coded at lower E/M levels, potentially contributing to MDM-based revenue being artificially high at shorter visits. Furthermore, longer visits are more likely to be coded at higher E/M levels, which could be associated with MDM-based revenue calculations being lower for longer visits.

### Association of time-based billing with evaluation and management revenue for outpatient visits [^d93daa3a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, physicians still receive most of their reimbursement for outpatient visits through the fee-for-service model. Within the fee-for-service model, evaluation and management (E/M) services guidelines have been used for decades to establish the level at which physicians can bill patient encounters. Under this system, a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code can be selected to ascertain reimbursement for a given encounter according to medical decision-making (MDM) levels. Levels of MDM, in turn, are based on the number and complexity of problems addressed at the encounter. However, studies show that physicians spend substantial time doing work that is not explicitly reportable by the E/M system of MDM-based billing, including medical record review, documentation, and coordination of care. As a result, many physicians report averaging 1 to 2 hours of unreimbursed, after-hours work daily. After-hours work is especially common for primary care physicians (PCPs) and has frequently been associated with increased rates of burnout.

In addition to MDM-based billing, physicians can bill on the basis of visit length. Historically, time-based billing has counted only time spent face-to-face with patients. However, substantial changes to time-based billing occurred in the 2021 E/M guidelines. The 2021 guidelines allow physicians to bill for face-to-face time and for previously unreimbursed time spent on medical record review, documentation, and coordination of care on the day of the patient encounter. Because time-based billing monetizes previously unreimbursed services, it offers physicians an opportunity to increase revenue, compared with MDM-based billing, which still does not reimburse for these services. However, variations in patient panels and clinic schedules may be factors in different lengths of an average patient visit. In turn, individual physicians are likely to see different outcomes associated with these changes in billing. Changes to the economic incentives for different visit lengths could have downstream implications for clinic scheduling and patient access.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^7cab3215]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Performance measures applicable to the addiction specialist physician — withdrawal management follow-up, initiation, exclusions, and continuity are defined: A validated VA measure supports detox follow-up within 7 days, and the panel chose this number for initiation. Outpatient detoxification or induction onto buprenorphine or methadone will not be included in the measure due to inability to currently track these services. Initiation of treatment is generally defined as a provider encounter resulting in service billing or receipt of a filled prescription; outpatient withdrawal management may not be coded separately and may require use of pharmacy claims in combination with medical claims. The 90-day period for continuity was determined by consensus and may require re-consideration after pilot testing. Patients who are started on agonist medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) without withdrawal management are excluded; however, the measure will identify when patients do go through opioid withdrawal and are then started on an agonist medication. As rationale, lack of treatment after withdrawal management results in relapse, re-admission and death. The future development of a CPT code for outpatient detoxification/withdrawal management would aide in the "capture rate" of this measure.

### AGA clinical practice update on telemedicine in gastroenterology: commentary [^e6949b43]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Telemedicine in gastroenterology — billing, visit setup, and trainee participation are described as follows: In general, billing elements should include the same Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code used for in-person visits (eg, 99202–5 or 99211–15) with a specific Place of Service code and a telehealth CPT modifier (eg, 95, GQ or GT) based on payer specifications; billing based on time requires that the total face-to-face time with the patient is included in visit documentation; and the 2021 coding changes eliminated the requirement to document physical examination findings to support coding levels. Best-practice visit setup includes verifying that the patient is in a private setting, conducting the visit in a private office with a closed door, ensuring quality audiovisual connection, establishing a backup method to conclude the visit if the initial method fails, and documenting the quality of the visit. Integration of trainees depends on whether the trainee is physically in the same location as the provider, with distant participation possible using a separate platform (eg, FaceTime) before entering the virtual room with the patient. Office staff should connect with patients ahead of the visit to troubleshoot technical issues, arrange assistive services such as an interpreter, and complete standard tasks such as medication review to enable uninterrupted and focused time with the patient.

### Fiscal analysis of emergency admissions for chronic back pain: a pilot study from a Maine hospital [^e4fe835b]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Our study was designed to document fiscal data for emergency department admissions for acute exacerbation of chronic back pain.

Design

This was a 12-month retrospective, descriptive study.

Setting

The two emergency facilities operated by the Maine General Medical Center in central Maine provided the study data.

Patients

We collected fiscal data for patients with emergency admissions for acute exacerbation of chronic nonmalignant back pain (International Classification of Disease code 724.1). Data were limited to patients with the top three of five Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes visits (99283–99285) for emergency department, indicating problems of moderate to high complexity. Records with event codes (E codes) for trauma and/or malignant disease were excluded.

Outcome Measures

We totaled charges for physician and provider services, laboratory tests, imaging studies, medications, and other billable items.

Results

Of 1,397 emergency department visits for acute exacerbation of chronic back pain logged over the 12-month study for all five CPT codes, 1,039 visits were tagged with the three highest codes; 30% were multiple visits. Mean charges per visit ranged from $399 for CPT code 99283 to $1,943 for code 99285. While only 3% of the patients (N = 46) were seen three or more times, they accounted for 12.4% of the total charges.

Conclusions

Emergency department care may be a costly venue for the management of chronic back pain. Because most patients obtain only short-term relief, they are likely to continue seeking urgent care intermittently until effective long-term pain management is widely available and reimbursable on an outpatient basis.

### Reviewing the advances in remote therapeutic and physiological monitoring and applicability for chronic pain management [^c865d26c]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Billing

While RTM and RPM are currently separate entities in terms of billing and reimbursement and cannot be billed together by the same provider, there is potential for both forms of RM to be used in tandem or by separate providers to achieve more holistic, patient-centered care. Currently, RTM and RPM can be billed concurrently with several care management services/providers, if time and effort are not double counted, including chronic care management, transitional care management, behavioral health integration, principal care management, and chronic pain management, allowing these services to integrate with other longitudinal care models. Reimbursement is not without its limitations. Though some payors may mirror the requirements of Medicare, others may not cover or only cover RM for specific chronic conditions and restrict it to specific specialists. Moreover, Medicaid only reimburses RM in roughly half of the states and has restrictions. If not already overburden, proper documentation and following the specific set of requirements are needed to ensure reimbursement.

Initially, patients will be set up with their devices, trained, and educated on the software and physical instruments, which must be defined by the FDA as medical devices and ordered by a qualified healthcare practitioner (Table 1). This initial setup and patient education are covered by CPT 98975 for RTM, which applies to only the respiratory and musculoskeletal systems. The initial setup and patient education for RPM are covered by 99453. These two programs offer distinct advantages; however, in general, for both forms of monitoring, it should be noted that their CPT codes require at least sixteen (16) days of data transmitted in a 30-day period. This pertains to at least one medical device, billed only once per provider, and per patient. Both are one-billable services per episode of care as defined by the initiation of the service and ending with completion of the targeted treatment goals.

### Procedural coding for interventional pain management [^4635a258]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventional radiologists' involvement in pain service lines continues to increase. While clinical and technical acumen is an obvious prerequisite, understanding the coding related to these procedures is also a must. The pain specialist's practice is largely outpatient based, therefore, the coding and subsequent billing for outpatient clinic visits may be an important revenue generator. A brief review of the evaluation and management (E&M) coding, as well as review of procedural CPT coding for pain interventions is discussed herein. While not overly difficult, there are certain nuances regarding the coding and reporting of these procedures. Developing an understanding of the proper use of CPT coding involved in pain procedures will allow the interventionalist to accurately capture the work performed and further support a pain service line.

### Acute care surgery billing, coding and documentation series part 1: basic evaluation and management (E / M), emergency department E / M, prolonged services, adult critical care documentation and coding [^81098aa9]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple billing providers within the same specialty and practice documentation for critical care time on the same date

Critical care time becomes additive for care billed under one National Provider Identifier (NPI) number.

According to CMS guidelines, when two or more physicians of the same specialty in a group practice provide critical care services to the same patient on the same date of service, only one physician in the specialty group may report CPT code 99291 with or without CPT code 99292, and the other physician(s) must report their critical care services with CPT code 99292.

Example: Physician A writes a critical care note for 57 minutes. Physician B documents critical care services at a later time on the same date for a separate 35 minutes. The total critical care time is 92 minutes and is billed under one physician's NPI number as 99291 and 99292 for that date.

For the provider of a like specialty, 99291 should be used only once on a single calendar date. The 99291 code must be submitted before the 99292 code can be used for each subsequent block of 30 minutes. Thus, code 99292 could be used for multiple blocks, as appropriate.

The 99291 code can be submitted for the same calendar date by a provider of a different specialty (NPI) as long as it is for a separate block of time or management of a different critical care issue.

### Coding for E / M home visits changed this year. here's what you need… [^5c7ea00e]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

CPT has revised codes for at-home evaluation and management services as of Jan. 1, 2023. Services to patients in a private residence or temporary lodgings are now combined with services in facilities where only minimal health care is provided in these code families: Home or residence E/M services, new patient
- 99341, straightforward medical decision making or at least 15 minutes total time,
- 99342, low level MDM or at least 30 minutes total time,
- 99344, moderate level MDM or at least 60 minutes total time.
- 99345, high level MDM or at least 75 minutes total time. Home or residence services, established patient
- 99347, straightforward MDM or at least 20 minutes total time,
- 99348, low level MDM or at least 30 minutes total time,
- 99349, moderate level MDM or at least 40 minutes total time.

- 99350, high level MDM or at least 60 minutes total time. Select these codes based on either your level of medical decision making or total time on the date of the encounter, similar to selecting codes for office visits. The E/M codes specific to domiciliary, rest home, or custodial care have been deleted, and the above codes should also be used in those settings. When total time on the date of the encounter exceeds the threshold for code 99345 or 99350 by at least 15 minutes, you can add code 99417 to report prolonged services. The exception to this is for patients with Medicare. For those patients, report prolonged home or residence services to Medicare with code G0318 in addition to 99345 or 99350.

Code G0318 is not limited to time on the date of the encounter, but includes any work within three days prior to the service or within seven days after. Services provided in facilities where significant medical or psychiatric care is available are reported with codes 99304–99310. — Cindy Hughes, CPC, CFPC Posted on Jan. 19, 2023.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^c287ba80]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Performance measures applicable to the addiction specialist physician — coding and data barriers and a registry proposal are outlined: additional barriers include "poor patient treatment adherence" and "lack of incentives for physicians/systems to use the measure or to improve their performance over time". Data-based barriers include a "lack of specificity for psychosocial treatments for addiction codes (e.g. CPT codes)" and "challenges in reconciling data systems between medical and behavioral health systems and between private payer and block grant-funded systems". A "lack of CPT specific codes of certain types of addiction creates challenges in the outpatient clinical setting" (including "outpatient withdrawal management for AUD or OUD, buprenorphine induction and medication transitions"), and as a start, codes "should include outpatient detoxification, buprenorphine and naltrexone induction, medication management for addictive disorders and relapse intervention". For implementation, "one important step would be to develop a national addiction treatment outcome registry, akin to 'tumor registries' in cancer care".

E/M Documentation and Coding

Introduction

E/M services are the mainstay of clinical practice. Proper and complete documentation of services is essential for quality patient care, medicolegal reasons and appropriate reimbursement for the services rendered.

The CPT code range for E/M services is a medical code set maintained by the American Medical Association. The CPT code range for E/M (99201–99499) contains CPT codes for office/other outpatient services, hospital observation services, hospital inpatient services, consultations, ED services and critical care, among many other services. A detailed listing can be found at.

Medicare establishes a relative value unit (RVU) for each CPT code to determine reimbursement. The RVU has three components: physician work, practice expense and malpractice. The physician work RVU, or wRVU, is a method used to quantify and compare the productivity of physicians which neutralizes variables such as fee schedules or geographical costs. Physicians employed by a medical group, hospital or academic institution are commonly compensated using a productivity formula based on wRVUs. Since these formulas have significant bearing on earnings, it is advisable to be knowledgeable about how the compensation formula works and specifically how wRVUs are tabulated.

E/M components

There are three key components of E/M and its documentation:

History (Hx).
Physical examination (PE).
Medical decision making (MDM).

In certain circumstances, time may be used instead of Hx, PE, or MDM. If more than 50% of the provider's time was spent in face-to-face counseling and coordination of care of the patient (outpatient) or services were provided on the hospital ward (inpatient) with at least a face-to-face encounter, consider using time-based billing to choose the appropriate E/M code submitted.

### The undervaluation of evaluation and management professional services: the lasting impact of current procedural terminology code deficiencies on physician payment [^7e200533]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) is fundamentally undermined by the following foundational errors: (1) The full range of office-based evaluation and management (E/M) activities are not captured by the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code choices, (2) it places relatively high values on procedural services, (3) there is no measure of intensity for complex outpatient E/M care, and (4) its maintenance and update have been delegated to select professional societies. Limitations imposed on the development of the RBRVS dating back to the early 1980s have not been corrected. The repertoire of codes for physician office-based E/M work must be expanded to create a new topology of choices with new outpatient code families with discrete service code levels, such as comprehensive outpatient consultation care, comprehensive outpatient primary care, and limited outpatient consultation care. Service code relative values must be based on representative samples and reliable survey data, draw from the broader literature on work intensity, and be developed with accountable and representative professional engagement.

### Frequently asked coding questions [^c23f0ed8]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding is not an exact science. Although the CPT code set was developed to describe clearly and comprehensively services provided by health care professionals, the intended application of individual codes is not always clear. In addition, coding that may be correct in terms of CPT definitions and instructions may contradict instructions from payment policies set by insurers. This article provides answers to the gastroenterologists' most commonly asked questions and provides primary sources for coding and payment policies when possible. Answers to the questions are accurate as of the date of publication but may be subject to change.

### Reframing Medicare physician payment policy for 2019: a look at proposed policy [^10065307]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

On July 12, 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released the proposed 2019 Medicare physician fee schedule and quality payment program, combining these 2 rules for the first time. This occurred in a milieu of changing regulations that have been challenging for interventional pain management specialists. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) continuous to be amended by multiple administrative changes. This July 12th rule proposes substantial payment changes for evaluation and management (E&M) services, with documentation requirements, and blending of Level II to V CPT codes for E&M into a single payment. In addition, various changes in the quality payment program with liberalization of some metrics have been published. Recognizing that there are differing impacts based on specialty and practice type, as a whole interventional pain management specialists would likely see favorable reimbursement trends for E&M services as a result of this proposal. Moreover, in comparison with recent CMS final ruling, this proposed rule has relatively limited changes in procedural reimbursement performed in a facility or in-office setting.CMS, in the new rule, has proposed an overhaul of the E&M documentation and coding system ostensibly to reduce the amount of time physicians are required to spend inputting information into patients' records. The new proposed rule blends Level II to V codes for E&M services into a single payment of $93 for office outpatient visits for established patients and $135 for new patient visits. This will also have an effect with blended payments for services provided in hospital outpatients. CMS also has provided additional codes to increase the reimbursement when prolonged services are provided with total reimbursement coming to Level V payments. Interventional pain management-centered care has been identified as a specialty with complexity inherent to E&M associated with these services. Among the procedural payments, there exist significant discrepancies for the services performed in hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), and offices. A particularly egregious example is peripheral neurolytic blocks, which is reimbursed at 1,800% higher in hospital outpatient department (HOPD) settings as compared with procedures done in the office. The majority of hospital based procedures have faced relatively small cuts as compared with office based practice. The only significant change noted is for spinal cord stimulator implant leads when performed in office setting with 19.2% increase. However, epidural codes, which have been initiated with a lower payment, continue to face small reductions for physician portion. This review describes the effects of the proposed policy on interventional pain management reimbursement for E&M services, procedural services by physicians and procedures performed in office settings.

### The association of mild cognitive impairment with outpatient visits for hypertension [^2d1bf1c6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Outcome

The primary outcome was the total number of outpatient visits for hypertension in the 12 months following each participant's cohort evaluation. Outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) ambulatory medical visits for hypertension were determined from the Medicare Fee‐For‐Service (FFS) carrier and outpatient claims (to capture federally qualified health center visits). The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes used to define E&M visits included 99202‐99205, 99212‐99215, 99381‐99387, 99391‐99397, G0438, G0439, and G0402. Definitions of each of the CPT codes are included in Table S1. From these E&M visits we identified visits for hypertension by International Classification of Diseases‐9th Revision (ICD‐9) diagnosis codes for hypertension, including 401.0, 401.1, 401.9, 405.01, 405.09, 405.11, 405.19, 405.91, and 405.99, and ICD‐10 diagnosis codes for hypertension, including I10, I15.0, I15.1, I15.2, I15.8, I15.9, I16.0, I16.1, I16.9, and I1A.0. Secondary outcomes were the total number of outpatient E&M visits for hypertension in the 12 months following each participant's cohort evaluation by provider specialty, the total number of outpatient E&M visits that were not for hypertension in the 12 months following each participant's cohort evaluation, and the number of outpatient E&M visits following each participant's cohort evaluation regardless of the reason for the visit. We categorized E&M visits by provider specialty with the provider taxonomy code associated with the National Provider Identifiers (NPI) number of the provider. We categorized provider specialties into primary care and medical specialties. The provider specialty categorizations can be found in Table S2. We defined outpatient E&M visits that were not for hypertension as outpatient E&M visits that did not have an ICD‐9 or ICD‐10 code for hypertension.

### Receipt of out-of-state telemedicine visits among Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic [^ecf26544]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Identification of Telemedicine Visits

This analysis used 100% Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims from January 2018 through June 2021. In describing which patients and specialties were using out-of-state telemedicine, we focused on the period between January to June 2021. We chose this period because it was after the turmoil of the early pandemic, when vaccines became widely available and the health care system had stabilized, but before many of the temporary licensing regulations began to lapse by mid-2021. When these lapsed, prepandemic state-based licensing laws were effectively reinstated. As a point of comparison, we also show results from the second half of 2020 and the patterns were largely similar (eTables 7–9 in the Supplement).

The Harvard Medical School institutional review board judged this study exempt and waived informed consent because all data were deidentified. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for cross-sectional studies; although, in this descriptive study of the full Medicare sample size, we did not prespecify a sample size and do not report on missing data for all variables.

We identified telemedicine visits as evaluation and management visits (visits limited to those services eligible for Medicare telemedicine reimbursement) in any setting (eg, emergency department, inpatient, office, skilled nursing facility) with any of the following telemedicine-specific codes: place of service code (02), modifier codes (GT, GQ, 95, GO), or telemedicine-specific CPT codes (G2025, 99441–3, 98966–98968, G0425-7, G0406-8, G0459, G0508-9, 0188T, G2012, G2010, 99421–99423, G2061-3, G0071, 99453, 99454, 99457, 99091, 95250–1).

### Implementing telehealth in practice: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 798 [^ce151507]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Billing and payment — Medicare coverage and CPT/HCPCS telehealth codes specify remote patient monitoring and communication services with defined time windows. Payment policies for telehealth services are constantly evolving. As of 2018, Medicare will reimburse physicians who provide telehealth for remote patient monitoring services billed under CPT code 99091, requiring a minimum of 30 minutes, and in addition to payment for two new (for 2019) HCPCS codes and three new (for 2019) CPT codes. HCPCS code G2010 includes follow-up with the patient within 24 business hours and specifies not originating from a related evaluation and management (E/M) service within the previous 7 days nor leading to an E/M service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment. HCPCS code G2012 is a brief communication technology-based service with 5–10 minutes of medical discussion and includes the same 7 days and 24 hours/soonest available-appointment boundaries. CPT code 99453 describes initial setup and patient education on use of equipment; CPT code 99454 includes device supply with daily recordings or programmed alerts transmission, each 30 days; and CPT code 99457 defines remote physiologic monitoring treatment management services, 20 minutes or more in a calendar month requiring interactive communication with the patient/caregiver. The CMS website lists the core requirements to bill Medicare for remote patient monitoring services; current fee-for-service procedural codes typically have been developed based on face-to-face encounters, and in 2017 CPT published a subset of procedural codes for services that can be performed reasonably using a live, synchronous platform with commonly available technology.

### Physician reimbursement in Medicare advantage compared with traditional medicare and commercial health insurance [^eb20e1ae]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, yet little is known about the prices that MA plans pay for physician services. Medicare Advantage insurers typically also sell commercial plans, and the extent to which MA physician reimbursement reflects traditional Medicare (TM) rates vs negotiated commercial prices is unclear.

Objective

To compare prices paid for physician and other health care services in MA, traditional Medicare, and commercial plans.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective analysis of claims data evaluating MA prices paid to physicians and for laboratory services and durable medical equipment between 2007 and 2012 in 348 US core-based statistical areas. The study population included all MA and commercial enrollees with a large national health insurer operating in both markets, as well as a 20% sample of TM beneficiaries.

Exposures

Enrollment in an MA plan.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean reimbursement paid to physicians, laboratories, and durable medical equipment suppliers for MA and commercial enrollees relative to TM rates for 11 Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Systems (HCPCS) codes spanning 7 sites of care.

Results

The sample consisted of 144 million claims. Physician reimbursement in MA was more strongly tied to TM rates than commercial prices, although MA plans tended to pay physicians less than TM. For a mid-level office visit with an established patient (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 99213), the mean MA price was 96.9% (95% CI, 96.7%-97.2%) of TM. Across the common physician services we evaluated, mean MA reimbursement ranged from 91.3% of TM for cataract removal in an ambulatory surgery center (CPT 66984; 95% CI, 90.7%-91.9%) to 102.3% of TM for complex evaluation and management of a patient in the emergency department (CPT 99285; 95% CI, 102.1%-102.6%). However, for laboratory services and durable medical equipment, where commercial prices are lower than TM rates, MA plans take advantage of these lower commercial prices, ranging from 67.4% for a walker (HCPCS code E0143; 95% CI, 66.3%-68.5%) to 75.8% for a complete blood cell count (CPT 85025; 95% CI, 75.0%-76.6%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Traditional Medicare's administratively set rates act as a strong anchor for physician reimbursement in the MA market, although MA plans succeed in negotiating lower prices for other health care services for which TM overpays. Reforms that transition the Medicare program toward some premium support models could substantially affect how physicians and other clinicians are paid.

### Mental health beliefs, access, and engagement with military sexual trauma-related mental health care [^c5a197e1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

VHA Administrative Data

National Patient Care Database outpatient treatment files were used to characterize utilization in the year following MST detection. For Veterans with a positive screen for MST, the VHA electronic medical record prompts providers to denote whether the care provided during the visit is related to the MST experiences when entering diagnostic and procedure codes. This indicator identifies encounters for co-pay release but can also be used to track the clinical care provided for MST-related conditions, or MST-related care. We aggregated outpatient mental health encounters for all MST-related care. We also examined three subsets of these encounters, using definitions consistent with VHA performance measurement, hierarchically coded as follows: individual psychotherapy (cpt codes: 90801, 90806, 90818, 90808, 90821, 90807, 90819, 90822, 90845, 90791, 90834, 90837); group psychotherapy (cpt codes: 90853, 90857); and medication management (mental health visit where the provider has a prescriber person-class that is not coded as psychotherapy). Because the sample is comprised of Veterans with a perceived need for care, we considered one or more visits to indicate access to care, and three or more visits to indicate engagement with care, consistent with prior work.

Data Sources and Participants

We used the 100% Medicare fee‐for‐service Beneficiary Summary, carrier, hospital outpatient, and inpatient claims data in 2012 and the Beneficiary Summary file in 2013. Beneficiaries were eligible for inclusion if they had any outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visits (procedure codes 99201‐5 and 99211‐5) to a cardiologist (specialty code "06") during the year. Beneficiaries were excluded if they had missing demographic data (0.3%), less than a full year of part B eligibility or were enrolled in Medicare Advantage during the year (7.5%), or attributed to practices with fewer than 100 beneficiaries (0.8%). Demographic variables were extracted from the Beneficiary Summary file, and chronic condition variables were extracted from the Chronic Conditions Warehouse categories. 16

Follow-up after withdrawal management services — measure construction used ASAM outpatient follow-up criteria and also tested a broader measure including inpatient and residential services. The denominator consisted of all withdrawal management episodes that ended during 2014, and the numerator included those who received another outpatient treatment service after discharge within a 30 day follow-up window. Episodes were identified and bundled so no episode had a treatment gap greater than 3 days, using withdrawal management revenue codes 0116, 0126, 0136, 0146, 0156 and service codes H0047, H0014. Appropriate follow-up to a withdrawal management episode was defined as a service or prescription between 1 and 7 days after discharge with a substance use disorder diagnosis and not representing a new withdrawal management episode; claims or prescriptions on the last day of the episode did not count. Inpatient or residential follow-up without SUD treatment services was treated as distinct using codes 99,221 to 99,239 with an SUD diagnosis.

### Acute care surgery billing, coding and documentation series part 1: basic evaluation and management (E / M), emergency department E / M, prolonged services, adult critical care documentation and coding [^273c33b1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Prolonged services

Codes +99358, prolonged E/M service before and/or after direct (face-to-face) patient care (eg, review of extensive records and tests, communication with other professionals and/or the patient/family); first hour (list separately in addition to code(s) for other physician service(s) and/or inpatient or outpatient E/M service) and +99359, prolonged E/M service before and/or after direct (face-to-face) patient care (eg, review of extensive records and tests, communication with other professionals and/or the patient/family); each additional 30 minutes (list separately in addition to code for prolonged physician service) report non face-to-face prolonged services, but these are not recognized by Medicare and many other payers.

Time counted towards prolonged services need not be continuous, but it must occur on the same service date. Do not consider time spent discussing the patient's case with other physicians, time reviewing data or tests without the patient present, or other activities not involving direct patient contact towards prolonged services.

Documentation must explain why the physician provided prolonged services. Rules state 'to support billing for prolonged services, the medical record must document the duration and content of the E/M code billed'. A notation that the physician spent an extra 40 minutes with the patient, for instance, is not adequate. The medical record must support specifically medical necessity for the extra time spent.

Note: Prolonged services codes (+99354 to +99357) are 'add on' codes and may be combined with other E/M services to report extended, face-to-face patient/provider visits. To report prolonged services, the physician must document at least an additional 30 minutes of face to face beyond the time reference of the chosen E/M service level. Do not report prolonged service codes in addition to any E/M services (such as observation services) that do not include a time reference.

### Assuring quality for non-hospital-based biologic infusions in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^bbeccf8c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-hospital-based biologic infusions in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — cost and remuneration include that a proper appeals process should be in place to prevent cost transfer from the payer to patient in payer-mandated decisions for home- or office-based infusions, and that shifting costs of care from the payer to patients is not acceptable. For care coordination remuneration, we recommend pediatric gastroenterologists and staff use the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 99374 which generates 1.1 RVUs for care coordination efforts from 15 to 29 minutes, and no evaluation and management (E/M) code is required to bill this CPT code, although effective use of this CPT code may vary based on contracting, documentation, and billing method.

### Documentation and coding of ED patient encounters: an evaluation of the accuracy of an electronic medical record [^0c61fd53]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to describe a paper-based, template-driven and an electronic medical record used for capturing emergency care clinical information and to compare the accuracy of these documentation systems for coding patient encounters using the American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology-2004 (AMA CPT-2004) evaluation and management codes intended for provider reimbursement.

Methods

A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 4-consecutive-day samples of ED patient encounter records from 2 similar community hospitals was done. For clinical documentation, hospital A uses an electronic medical record, whereas hospital B uses a paper-based template-driven record. Using a simple analytic model, expert coders A and B, respectively, coded the records from hospitals A and B for completeness. First, power analysis determined the acceptability of the patient record sample sizes (1 - beta = .90 at 1% significance level), and the frequency of AMA CPT-2004 primary evaluation and management codes 99281 through 99285 was calculated. Second, the completeness discrepancy rates for hospitals A and B were compared to determine the accuracy of both the paper-based, template-driven record and the electronic medical record in documenting and representing the clinical encounter. Third, interrater reliability between expert coders A and B was calculated to assess the level of agreement between each expert coder in determining the completeness discrepancy rates between hospitals A and B. Finally, the frequency of primary evaluation and management codes was analyzed to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the paper-based, template-driven record and the electronic medical record representation of the clinical information, and if that difference could be attributable to the differing clinical documentation systems used in hospitals A and B.

Results

First, descriptive display demonstrated a difference in the frequency of the primary evaluation and management codes 99283 and 99284 within hospital A (expert coder A assessment, 36.1% vs 39.1%; expert coder B assessment, 36.6% vs 38.7%) and hospital B (expert coder A assessment, 47.8% vs 21.9%; expert coder B assessment, 48.6% vs 21.4%) was noted with the median, primary evaluation, and management code for hospital A of 99284 and the median, primary evaluation, and management code for hospital B of 99283. Second, Fisher exact test compared the completeness discrepancy rates between hospitals A and B as assessed by each expert coder and demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the completeness discrepancy rates (accuracy) between the paper-based, template-driven record and the electronic medical record documentation and coding system when assessed by either expert coder A (P = 0.370) or expert coder B (P = 0.819). Third, interrater reliability between expert coders A and B was evaluated using Cohen's kappa statistic. When evaluated both individually and jointly with respect to hospitals A and B, expert coders A and B had a good strength of agreement in their assessments of the accuracy of the documentation and coding system for hospital A (kappa = 0.6200) and hospital B (kappa = 0.6906) as well as for both hospitals evaluated together (kappa = 0.6616). Finally, interhospital differences in the frequency of primary evaluation and management codes were evaluated using Pearson chi(2) test with 3 df. The results for expert coder A (chi(2) = 47.4160; P < .001) and expert coder B (chi(2) = 46.5946; P < .001) recognize that there is a statistically significant degree of difference between hospitals A and B in the frequency distribution of primary evaluation and management codes, probably because of the dispersion of codes 99283 and 99284.

Conclusions

A keystroke-driven, electronic medical record that resides on a knowledge platform that incorporates a clinical structured terminology, administrative coding schemata, AMA CPT-2004 codes and uses object-oriented, open-ended, branching chain clinical algorithms that "force" physician documentation of the clinical elements provides an equally accurate capture and representation of ED clinical encounter data as a paper-based, template-driven documentation system both in terms of the presence or absence of both the medically necessary, discrete data elements and the textual documentation-dependent, medical decision-making elements.

### Screening and intervention for mental health disorders and substance use and misuse in the acute trauma patient [^0190b308]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Appendix C-2 — CPT Code 90792 — coding requires elicitation of complete medical and psychiatric history (including past, family, social), mental status examination, establishment of an initial diagnosis, evaluation of the patient's ability and capacity to respond to treatment, an initial plan of treatment, and to "Report once per day and not on the same day as an Evaluation and Management service performed by the same provider for the same client". If you are not performing a medical evaluation as you would when coding 90792 (because you are not licensed to do so), please use CPT Code 90791. This applies to all non-MD mental health providers. CPT Code 90792 documentation should include a psychiatric diagnostic evaluation with history, mental status, and recommendations, and document one or more medical services such as physical examination, writing a prescription, or modifying psychiatric treatment.

### Racial and ethnic differences in telemedicine use [^c25e8985]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Measuring Visits

The primary outcome was the number of telemedicine visits per patient during the second pandemic year. We identified telemedicine visits using the relevant modifier (GT, GQ, 95) or CPT codes (99441–99443). The first year of the pandemic was used for collection of baseline information on covariates. The list of codes used to identify outpatient visits is provided in the eMethods in Supplement 1. As a point of comparison, we reran the analysis with the same outcomes during the first pandemic year, and the patterns were similar (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Outlier observations could be associated with comparison between racial and ethnic groups. We addressed outliers with respect to the number of telemedicine claims by Winsorizing the number of total and telemedicine visits per patient at 52 per year. Individuals deemed outliers tended to have more comorbidities and dual-eligible status compared with nonoutliers in the analytic sample (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

Secondary outcomes included whether an individual had any telemedicine visits (yes/no), the number of audio-only telemedicine visits (CPT 99441–99443), the number of telemedicine visits for mental health conditions (see the eMethods in Supplement 1 for codes that identified telemedicine mental health visits), and the number of total outpatient visits (telemedicine plus in-person) during the second pandemic year. Because of the digital divide, many have argued that audio-only visits are critical to maintaining access for disadvantaged groups. Several states have mandated reimbursement for audio-only visits to ensure equity. Prior work has highlighted that audio-only visits are likely undercounted in claims and electronic health records; therefore, we emphasize that the analyses focused on audio-only care should be considered exploratory.

Journal of Arrhythmia (2021). High credibility.

Appendix 1 — Remote patient monitoring (RPM) CPT codes — In 2015, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated a new chronic care management code, and in November 2018 it finalized plans to reimburse healthcare providers for certain remote patient monitoring and telehealth services, focusing on three new CPT codes that separate RPM from telehealth. The new CPT codes include #99453, 99454, and 99457; the first two describe remote monitoring of physiologic parameters without specifically including ECG monitoring, while the third provides management services requiring 20 minutes or more of clinical staff/physician/other qualified HCP time in a calendar month with interactive communication with the patient/caregiver. The pre-existing CPT code 93040 (used for reporting on a Rhythm ECG, 1–3 leads, without interpretation and report) would not be appropriate for patient initiated mobile device events as this would require an order followed by a separate signed and retrievable report.

### Association of outpatient behavioral health treatment with medical and pharmacy costs in the first 27 months following a new behavioral health diagnosis in the US [^ab43d925]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The primary aim of this study was to quantify the association of 1 or more OPBHTs with postperiod medical and pharmacy costs. The secondary aim was to assess whether different quantities of OPBHTs were associated with differences in postperiod costs. An OPBHT was defined by 116 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, of which 95% of claims came from the predominant CPT codes associated with psychotherapy (90837, 90834, 90847, 99214, 99213, 90833, 90853, and 90836) or psychiatry (90791, 90792). The OPBHT claims came from licensed behavioral clinicians, including counselors (35%), social workers (22%), psychologists (19%), psychiatrists (13%), and behavioral nurses (2%).

### Acute care surgery billing, coding and documentation series part 2: postoperative documentation and coding; documentation and coding in conjunction with trainees and advanced practitioners; coding select procedures [^a5f1a3b0]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Postoperative Care Documentation, Coding and Evaluation and Management

Introduction

It can sometimes be confusing to decide what services can be billed for in the postoperative period. This often results in omission of valid charges and lost revenue. Therefore, it is imperative that the service provider be familiar with what is allowable. Services not covered in the global period of an operation must be recognized and captured to maximize reimbursement.

Many surgeons believe that they are not able to bill for such care in the form of Critical Care Evaluation and Management (E/M) services using CPT codes 99291 and 99292 when they have operated on the patient who requires critical care services. However, it is commonly the case that the operating surgeon can bill for surgical critical care as well as any other E/M service (such as a daily inpatient visit CPT code: 99231, 99232, or 99233) if certain conditions are met. Following is further guidance on this issue with a historical perspective on how the rules were developed.

Defining the postoperative period for billing purposes

There are three types of global surgical packages with a different number of postoperative days included in each.

0-Day postoperative period (minor procedures such as endoscopies, arterial and central line insertion, etc.)

10-Day postoperative period (other minor procedures, excision of skin lesions, I&D of abscess, intermediate and complex repairs, etc.). There is no preoperative period and includes services provided on the surgical day and 10 days following the day of surgery.

90-Day postoperative period (major procedures, for example, splenectomy, bowel resection, gastrostomy, etc.). A 1-day preoperative period is included, along with the day of surgery and then 90 days following the surgery.

A complete listing of postoperative periods for surgical procedures can be found in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.

### The industry impact of the American medical association's digital medicine payment advisory group (DMPAG) [^f39b8e3e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Following the RPM code implementation, the DMPAG was instrumental in developing and refining the parallel set of codes for the gap in CPT coding for remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) technologies. These RTM codes are new enough that, to date, the utilization data for the RTM codes is limited.

Another example of a code born of the DMPAG's efforts allows for reimbursement for so-called e-consults, where a clinician (often a primary care clinician) sends relevant information about a complex case to a specialist. The specialist can now be reimbursed for that activity. Fig. 2 illustrates the growth in the utilization of those codes.

Fig. 2
CPT codes of Interprofessional telephone/ internet/ EHR consultation.

The CPT codes are defined as: 99451: Interprofessional telephone/internet/electronic health record assessment and management service provided by a consultative physician, including a written report to the patient's treating/requesting physician or other qualified health care professional, 5 min or more of medical consultative time; 99452: Interprofessional telephone/internet/electronic health record referral service(s) provided by a treating/requesting physician or other qualified health care professional, 30 min.

Since DMPAG's initiation in 2016, digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence (sometimes referred to as augmented intelligence), and other digital innovations have reached the marketplace and the AMA has attempted to resolve the complexity of appropriate reimbursement for digital medicine. The DMPAG has taken its moniker of 'digital medicine' seriously and not focused simply on telehealth and remote care. A recent example of another foray into technology-related reimbursement has been efforts to create a taxonomy for using augmented intelligence in healthcare delivery (Table 2).

Table 2
Taxonomy for the use of augmented intelligence in healthcare.

What makes the DMPAG successful? The group formed a productive culture and chemistry early on. The AMA has devoted tremendous resources to giving the group a perspective on upcoming challenges in digital medicine payment and the tools needed to gather the data required to make thoughtful policy recommendations.

### Guiding principles for managed care arrangements for the health of newborns, infants, children, adolescents and young adults [^48727869]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Financing and payment — payment methods should be developed that cover all the health care needs of children as defined by the AAP policy statement "Scope of Health Care Benefits for Children From Birth Through Age 26", with periodicity of visits, screenings, and procedures per "Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care", the current edition of Bright Futures, and "Principles of Child Health Care Financing", and payment models should not discourage providers from caring for patients who are most in need of expert care; the method used for pediatric health care payment should consider age, chronicity, and severity of underlying health problems (case mix, risk, or severity adjustment), service area market, and geographic considerations; if payments are made to the patient-centered medical home on a fee-for-service model for chronic condition management, the payments should support additional visits and time for care plan development and complex disease management, including CPT-coded care plan oversight, non–face-to-face care, complex and transitional care, meaningful care by telephone and electronic consultations, and recommended care coordination services by nonphysician professionals; and the payment structure should encompass recognition of all CPT and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes.

### Successful management of interstitial cystitis in clinical practice [^bfafe2d2]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians, urologists, and gynecologists have the opportunity to detect interstitial cystitis (IC) in its early stages in symptomatic patients and provide effective treatment before the disease progresses. In this article, we present guidelines for clinical practice management and coding for reimbursement for the care of patients with IC. Important issues in the management of IC are presented, including appropriate Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding for office visits and procedures associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Excellent IC care can be integrated into a successful clinical practice with appropriate clinical management and coding for reimbursement.

### Association of time-based billing with evaluation and management revenue for outpatient visits [^1b5654ca]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Time-based billing options for physicians have expanded, enabling many physicians to bill according to time spent instead of medical decision-making (MDM) level for fee-for-service outpatient visits. However, no study to date has estimated the revenue changes associated with time-based billing.

Objective

To compare evaluation and management (E/M) reimbursement for physicians using time-based billing vs MDM-based billing for outpatient visits of varying lengths.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation used 2019 billing data for outpatient E/M codes and 2021 reimbursement rates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Modeling of generic clinic templates was performed to estimate expected yearly E/M revenues for a single full-time physician working in an outpatient clinic using fee-for-service billing.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Yearly E/M revenues for different patient visit templates were modeled. The standardized length of return patient visits was 10 to 45 minutes, and new patient visits were twice as long in duration.

Results

Under MDM-based billing, increased visit length was associated with decreased E/M revenue ($564 188 for 30-minute new patient visit/15-minute return patient visit vs $423 137 for 40-minute new patient visit/20-minute return patient visit). Under time-based billing, yearly E/M revenue remained similar across increasing visit lengths ($400 432 for 30-minute new patient visit/15-minute return patient visit vs $458 718 for 40-minute new patient visit/20-minute return patient visit). Compared with time-based billing, MDM-based billing was associated with higher E/M revenue for 10- to 15-minute return patient visits ($400 432 vs $564 188). Time-based billing was associated with higher E/M revenue for return patient visits lasting 20 minutes or longer. The highest modeled E/M revenue of $846 273 occurred for 10-minute return patient visits under MDM-based billing.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this study showed that the relative economic benefits of MDM-based billing and time-based billing differed and were associated with the length of patient visits. Physicians with longer patient visits were more likely to experience revenue increases from using time-based billing than physicians with shorter patient visits.

Emergency Department Evaluation and Management

Introduction

Acute Care Surgeons deliver many of their services in the ED either singularly or often in conjunction with a number of other providers from the same or different specialties. Therefore it is incumbent on all providers to be aware of coding rules and options and for coders to communicate before submitting claims to avoid denials and audits but also to assure appropriate credit and reimbursement to each provider.

Basic principles

Any provider can use the ED codes (99281 to 99285), as long as the service is provided in the ED setting. There is not a requirement for the provider to be an ED physician to use these codes.

When an ED physician requests another physician to see the patient in the ED, both physicians should report an ED code, unless the patient is admitted. If the patient is admitted, the ED provider chooses a code from 99281 to 99285 and the physician admitting the patient through the ED will report an initial hospital care code (99221 to 99223) or critical care code (99291 to 99292).

The same qualifiers and documentation requirements govern level of service which can be claimed for both hospital E/M and ED E/M services. The reimbursement (wRVU) is, of course, greater for critical care than either the ED or hospital admission E/M. If critical care is billed, be mindful of the need for more detailed and specific documentation to support the claim.

It is generally more advantageous for the surgeon to bill critical care in the ED rather than inpatient hospital visit codes when admitting patients to their service. Obviously this is predicated on the service qualifying as such (see Adult Critical Care section).

ED E/M Codes

99281 (wRVU 0.45) ED visit for the E/M of a patient,

Requires these three key components: a problem-focused history; a problem-focused examination; and straightforward MDM. Counseling and/or coordination of care with other providers or agencies are provided consistent with the nature of the problem(s) and the patient's and/or family's needs. Usually, the presenting problem(s) are self-limited or minor.

### Outpatient E / M coding simplified… [^047f1ce3]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2021, significant changes were adopted for the documentation guidelines for outpatient evaluation and management visit codes. Most notably, medical decision making or time became primary drivers of visit level selection, rather than the number of history and physical exam bullets. In this article, we review the context for these changes, describe them briefly, and offer a quick reference tool to help physicians apply the new rules in practice. KEY POINTS The revisions to the E/M outpatient visit codes reduced administrative burden by eliminating bullet points for the history and physical exam elements. Code level selection is now simplified — based on either medical decision making or total time. The authors' one-page coding reference tool can help simplify the new rules.

HOW WE GOT HERE In the 2019 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule, released in November 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services adopted revisions to the outpatient E/M codes in order to reduce administrative burden. Originally scheduled for implementation in 2021, these changes would have combined visit levels 2–4 into a blended payment rate, among other changes. In response, the American Medical Association convened a joint CPT Editorial Board and Relative Value Scale Update Committee workgroup to build on the changes and propose some alternatives. The workgroup's goals were to decrease administrative burden, payer audits, and unnecessary medical record documentation while ensuring that payment of E/M services is resource-based.

The workgroup approved significant revisions to the outpatient office visit E/M codes. Code 99201 was deleted. The history and/or physical examination and the counting of bullets were eliminated as components for code selection. Medical decision making or time could be used for code level selection. Changes were made to the code descriptors for 99202–99205 and 99211–99215, the definition of medical decision making, and the calculation of time, and a shorter prolonged services add-on code was created. CMS adopted these new E/M coding guidelines. As a result of the changes to medical decision making and time-based coding, the RUC revised the 2021 relative value units for office visit E/M codes. To determine the level of code for a visit, two of the three components must meet or exceed that level of coding. For example, if the patient has multiple problems addressed at the encounter, but the data is limited and the risk of complications is low, then the level of medical decision making would be low. New patient codes 99202–99205 and established patient codes 99212–99215 use the same components and levels of decision making for code selection. The risk component may include prescription drug management, a decision for minor surgery with patient or procedure risk factors, a decision for elective major surgery without patient or procedure risk factors, or social determinants of health that significantly limit diagnostic or treatment options, such as food or housing insecurity. For prescription drug management, renewing pre-existing chronic medications would qualify. Documentation that the physician is managing the patient for the condition for which the medications are being prescribed would help establish validity in the use of this criterion for MDM.

### Early changes in billing and notes after evaluation and management guideline change [^1e3dbe9d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Medical Association updated guidance in 2021 for frequently used billing codes for outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) visits. The intent was to account for provider time outside of face-to-face encounters and to reduce onerous documentation requirements.

Objective

To analyze E/M visit use, documentation length, and time spent in the electronic health record (EHR) before and after the guideline change.

Design

Observational, retrospective, pre-post study.

Setting

U.S.-based ambulatory practices using the Epic Systems EHR.

Participants

303 547 advanced practice providers and physicians across 389 organizations.

Measurements

Data from September 2020 through April 2021 containing weekly provider-level E/M code and EHR use metadata were extracted from the Epic Signal database. We descriptively analyzed overall and specialty-specific changes in E/M visit use, note length, and time spent in the EHR before and after the new guidelines using provider-level paired t tests.

Results

Following the new guidelines, level 3 visits decreased by 2.41 percentage points (95% CI, -2.48 to -2.34 percentage points) to 38.5% of all E/M visits, a 5.9% relative decrease from fall 2020. Level 4 visits increased by 0.89 percentage points (CI, 0.82 to 0.96 percentage points) to 40.9% of E/M visits, a 2.2% relative increase. Level 5 visits (the highest acuity level) increased by 1.85 percentage points (CI, 1.81 to 1.89 percentage points) to 10.1% of E/M visits, a 22.6% relative increase. These changes varied by specialty. We found no meaningful changes in measures of note length or time spent in the EHR.

Limitation

The Epic ambulatory client base may underrepresent smaller and independent practices.

Conclusion

Immediate changes in E/M coding contrast with null findings for changes in both note length and EHR time. Provider organizations are positioned to respond more rapidly to billing process changes than to changes in care delivery and associated EHR use behaviors. Fully realizing the intended benefits of this guideline change will require more time, facilitation, and scaling of best practices that more directly address EHR documentation practices and associated burden.

Primary Funding Source

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^7d9931ba]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Payment opportunities for HCT — Current payment mechanisms address professional services through traditional fee-for-service reporting and various performance-based and alternative models, and CPT with CMS has addressed care management and coordination through code development for vulnerable care transition scenarios such as hospital-to-home transition, chronic care coordination, and behavioral health. Although there is currently not a code specifically defined as pediatric-to-adult transition, newly developed care management services offer an opportunity to report fee-for-service for many elements of transitional care, and as billing options evolve, several coding options are available in both pediatric and adult care settings. In addition to evaluation and management codes for face-to-face visits, CPT includes categories such as prolonged services (with or without) direct patient contact, medical team conferences, care plan oversight, preventive medicine counseling and behavior change interventions, interprofessional Internet and/or telephone consultations, and chronic and complex chronic care management; CPT also includes codes for administration of health risk assessment instruments that can be used for transition readiness assessments with youth and parents and self-care assessments with young adults, with the prerequisite that the tools be scorable and standardized. Examples of standardized scorable tools include the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire and the Am I ON TRAC for Adult Care Questionnaire, and CMS notes an ongoing incremental effort to identify gaps in appropriate coding and payment for care management/coordination, cognitive services and primary care within the physician fee schedule.

### Access, utilization, and quality of behavioral health integration in medicaid managed care [^50717e03]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Outcome Variables

We analyzed 5 measures of utilization (outpatient mental health visits, primary care visits for mental health, primary care visits for physical health, emergency department [ED] visits for mental health conditions or self-harm incidents, and inpatient/residential stays for mental health conditions); 4 health outcome measures (readmissions after mental health hospitalizations, cardiac events resulting in inpatient or ED visits, inpatient stays associated with diabetes, and self-harm incidents); and 3 outcomes associated with social determinants of health (any arrests, any employment, and any homelessness). The unit of observation for these outcomes was the person-quarter.

We also included several Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)quality measures for individuals with SMI: comprehensive diabetes care (hemoglobin A 1c testing only); monitoring of persistent medications; diabetes screening for people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who were using antipsychotic medication; and antidepressant medication management (acute and continuous). The unit of observation for HEDIS measures was the person-year.

By 2019, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified 5 codes that clinicians could use to bill for collaborative care (CoCM): Current Procedural Terminology codes 99492, 99493, and 99494 and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes G0511 and G0512. These codes offer a mechanism to be paid directly for time spent coordinating behavioral and physical health (rather than treating integration as something that happens seamlessly without a need for additional resources). We analyzed their claim frequency and the percentage of total outpatient mental claims they represented.

### CPTCodes: what are they, why are they necessary, and how are they developed? [^eb343f2b]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

Qualified healthcare professionals (QHPs) need to identify the professional services they provide and to report those services in a way that can be universally understood by institutions, private and government payers, researchers, and others interested parties. The QHPs' data are used to track healthcare utilization, identify services for payment, and to gather statistical healthcare information about populations. Each year, in the United States, healthcare insurers process over 5 billion claims for payment. 1 To ensure that healthcare data are captured accurately and consistently and that health claims are processed properly for Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs, a standardized coding system for medical services and procedures is essential. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT ®) system, developed by the American Medical Association (AMA), is used for just these purposes. The AMA system provides a standard language and numerical coding methodology to accurately communicate across many stakeholders, including patients, the medical, surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic services provided by QHPs. The CPT descriptive terminology and associated code numbers provide the most widely accepted medical nomenclature used to report medical procedures and services for processing claims, conducting research, evaluating healthcare utilization, and developing medical guidelines and other forms of healthcare documentation.

### A novel data mining application to detect safety signals for newly approved medications in routine care of patients with diabetes [^ac8c7ee9]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

2.5 Incident outcomes

We defined an incident outcome as the first inpatient or emergency department diagnosis code that occurred during a patient's available follow‐up time for which there was not another inpatient, emergency department or outpatient diagnosis with the same ICD‐9 code during the 180 day period. Specifically, in the tree looking at second level outcomes, if the exact second level outcome occurred in the preceding 180 days (in addition to the 180 days before the index date), then this event would not be counted. This step was purposeful to increase the likelihood of identifying real incident events, rather than pre‐existing chronic medical conditions. If there were more than one potential incident outcome on the same day, we selected the one that was less common based on the frequency of the code in our dataset. This approach is in line with prior studies applying TreeScan because a key aim of this approach is to detect rare adverse events and has the goal to reduce the likelihood of false signals.

Incident outcomes were assessed at the second, third, fourth and fifth level of the ICD9 hierarchical tree. Potential outcomes at level 1 of the tree were not considered because of the broad nature of these categories. In secondary analyses, we also explored incident outcomes based on outpatient diagnoses in addition to inpatient and emergency visits. This was to assess signals for potential adverse events that may be managed in an outpatient setting without requiring a hospitalization or an emergency department visit.

Discharge summary documentation

The Joint Commission mandates that discharge summaries contain certain components. These are: reason for hospitalization; significant findings; procedures and treatment provided; patient's discharge condition; patient and family instructions; and attending physician's signature. The definition of each component is listed below.

Reason for hospitalization — CC and/or HPI.
Significant findings — primary diagnoses.
Procedures and treatment provided — hospital course and/or hospital consults and/or hospital procedures and their outcomes, significant laboratory results or diagnostic imaging findings.
Patient's discharge condition — documentation that gives a sense for how the patient is doing at discharge or the patient's health status on discharge.
Patient and family instructions (as appropriate) — as discharge medications and/or activity orders and/or therapy orders and/or dietary instructions and/or plans for medical follow-up.
Attending physician's signature — an electronic or physical signature of the attending physician on the discharge summary.

Important changes to E/M rules and requirements are planned for 2021. Not uncommonly, CMS and CPT rule language and definitions will differ and private payers may, or may not, adopt either thereby adding to the coding conundrum and complexity.

### 2023 brings important coding, Medicare payment updates… [^5afe8801]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Dec. 20, 2022, 3: 20 p. m. News Staff — Two years ago, the AAFP was busy developing resources to help members prepare for major revisions to office visit evaluation and management coding and documentation guidelines scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, 2021. The changes, intended to reduce physicians' administrative burden and allow them more time for direct patient care, followed extensive advocacy by the AAFP and other medical groups. This year, the AAFP began educating members about similar changes coming in 2023 to coding for E/M services provided in hospitals, nursing homes and other settings, beginning with a session at the 2022 Family Medicine Experience. Members are encouraged to keep an eye out for additional information and resources to be released on this topic. As of Jan. 1, code level selection for facility-based E/M services will largely mirror that now used for office/outpatient E/M services.

The history and physical examination will no longer contribute to the level for these visits; rather, physicians will select codes for these services based on either the total time they spent caring for the patient on the date of the encounter or their level of medical decision-making. Furthermore, only a few adjustments are needed to repurpose the MDM table used to select office-based E/M codes for use in coding hospital and nursing home E/M services. They are Story Highlights Other CPT changes that stand to affect how these services are reported include For more details about the changes, members can review an. FPM article published online ahead of print on Dec. 5; the article will appear in the January/February print journal issue.

On a related note, CPT has revised its hospital E/M guidelines to allow more than one service to be reported when a patient is admitted to inpatient or observation status during a visit at another service site, such as a physician's office. According to the guidelines, physicians should append modifier 25 to the initial service and report the hospital-based service, as well. CMS, however, is continuing its policy of allowing only a single service to be reported to Medicare in such instances. It is unclear at this time whether non-Medicare payers will follow CPT's lead. Another CPT-related change involves how prolonged services — whether provided in an office or inpatient setting — should be reported. CPT has deleted the codes for reporting prolonged E/M services with direct patient contact in an office or inpatient setting.

Physicians have been able to use code 99417, in conjunction with 99205 or 99215, to report prolonged services in the office setting since the 2021 changes were implemented; as of Jan. 1, that will be the only option for doing so. A new code, 99218, will be used to report prolonged hospital or nursing facility services. Although CPT guidance allows physicians to report 99417 or 99418, along with a primary E/M code for the highest level of service in the appropriate setting, when they surpass the minimum time of the highest level of service by 15 minutes, Medicare requires clinicians to surpass the maximum time of the highest E/M level by 15 minutes before reporting prolonged services codes. CMS has developed specific Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes, broken down by practice setting, for reporting such services. A second FPM article slated for the January/February issue but published early online shares more information about these additional coding updates.

### Aerosol therapy for obstructive lung diseases: device selection and practice management issues [^3f50a172]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Inhaled aerosol therapies are the mainstay of treatment of obstructive lung diseases. Aerosol devices deliver drugs rapidly and directly into the airways, allowing high local drug concentrations while limiting systemic toxicity. While numerous clinical trials, literature reviews, and expert panel guidelines inform the choice of inhalational drugs, deciding which aerosol device (ie, metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer, or dry powder inhaler) best suits a given patient and clinical setting can seem arbitrary and confusing. Similar confusion regarding Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding for administration of aerosol therapies can lead to lost revenue from underbilling and wasted administrative effort handling denied claims. This article reviews the aerosol devices currently available, discusses their relative merits in various clinical settings, and summarizes appropriate CPT coding for aerosol therapy.

### Ascertainment of outpatient visits by patients with diabetes: the national ambulatory medical care survey (NAMCS) and the national hospital ambulatory medical care survey (NHAMCS) [^886bb91c]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To estimate and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of providers' diagnosis codes and medication lists to identify outpatient visits by patients with diabetes.

Methods

We used data from the 2006 to 2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of providers' diagnoses and medication lists to identify patients with diabetes, using the checkbox for diabetes as the gold standard. We then examined differences in sensitivity by patients' characteristics using multivariate logistic regression models.

Results

The checkbox identified 12,647 outpatient visits by adults with diabetes among the 70,352 visits used for this analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of providers' diagnoses or listed diabetes medications were 72.3% (95% CI: 70.8% to 73.8%) and 99.2% (99.1% to 99.4%), respectively. Diabetic patients ≥ 75 years of age, women, non-Hispanics, and those with private insurance or Medicare were more likely to be missed by providers' diagnoses and medication lists. Diabetic patients who had more diagnosis codes and medications recorded, had glucose or hemoglobin A1c measured, or made office- rather than hospital-outpatient visits were less likely to be missed.

Conclusions

Providers' diagnosis codes and medication lists fail to identify approximately one quarter of outpatient visits by patients with diabetes.

### Data interoperability and harmonization in cardiovascular genomic and precision medicine [^6089f7e0]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Coding Sets

Disease, treatment, or outcome data may be derivable from data required for clinical care or claims billing. Although the integration of healthcare information systems has been accelerated by regulations, including the EHR Meaningful Use program and the Physician Quality Reporting System, most systems have focused on documentation for billing charges. Thus, billing code classifications may yield the most complete lists of diagnoses and procedures.

The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System is a US national code set used for processing claims. HPCS level I codes are part of the current procedural terminology codes, maintained and copyrighted by the American Medical Association, for medical procedures and professional services in outpatient and ambulatory settings, and physician visits to inpatients. The current set (CPT-4) covers services and procedures categorized by Evaluation and Management, Anesthesiology, Surgery, Radiology, Pathology and Laboratory, and Medicine. HPCS level II codes, maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, except for D codes (dental services) maintained by the American Dental Association, cover products, supplies, and services not included in level I current procedural terminology codes and include durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, supplies, ambulance services, certain drugs and biologicals, and miscellaneous codes not otherwise classified. SNOMED CT has become a coding standard in the United States for electronic health information exchange and is a standard for interoperability required by the US Health Information Technology Standards Panel. For cardiovascular imaging, DICOM standards have enabled a degree of interoperability and have become a global standard.

Drug databases include the National Drug Code, maintained by the US Food and Drug Administration, and the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, which includes registration, documentation, and safety monitoring of medical products before and after regulatory approval.

### Early pregnancy loss management in the emergency department vs outpatient setting [^2afd3700]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Early pregnancy loss (EPL), or miscarriage, is the most common pregnancy complication. Up to 20% of pregnancies end in EPL, which is defined as a nonviable, intrauterine pregnancy within the first 12 weeks of gestation. Although many patients seek care for EPL in the outpatient setting, a substantial portion present to the emergency department (ED) for a variety of reasons, including lack of an established physician, ease of access, or perceived sense of urgency. EPL or bleeding in early pregnancy accounts for a combined 2.7% of all ED visits among reproductive-aged women, or approximately 900 000 ED visits annually.

Treatment options for patients with a diagnosis of EPL include expectant management, medication management, or surgical management via uterine aspiration. Although these management options are all typically available to patients who present to an outpatient clinic, it is unclear which options are routinely offered to patients who initially present to an ED.

Multiple studies, have demonstrated that patient experiences of EPL in the ED setting differ from those in the outpatient clinic setting. Patients who seek EPL care in the ED report that they do not receive adequate communication, follow-up, or emotional support, and they may not have the same access to active (either surgical or medication) management as patients seen in the outpatient setting. Delays in treatment and inadequate communication exacerbate the psychological trauma associated with EPL. The factors associated with presentation to the ED vs the outpatient setting, and the ways in which management differs in these settings, have not been well researched.

A substantial portion of patients with EPL present to the ED for management, but little is known about how these patients differ from those who present to an outpatient clinic. Furthermore, little is known about how EPL management in the ED differs from the outpatient setting. A better understanding of how EPL presentation and management differs between the ED and outpatient clinics could inform future efforts to improve clinical care and patient experiences with EPL in the ED setting.

We sought to identify characteristics associated with type of EPL management (surgical, medication, and expectant management) using a national claims database. We also sought to describe characteristics of patients presenting with EPL to the ED vs outpatient setting, and to compare clinical outcomes and complications by location of service. We hypothesized that patients presenting with EPL to the ED would be less likely to undergo active management of EPL within a week following their diagnosis compared with patients presenting to outpatient settings.

### Evaluation and management codes: from current procedural terminology through relative update commission to center for Medicare and medicaid services [^434d7952]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians should have a working knowledge of the process by which patient care codes are created and subsequently assigned values. The Society of Critical Care Medicine has representatives on the national committees that focus on code creation and definition and on assignment of relative value units. In addition, a better understanding of documentation requirements and the audit process will facilitate improved compliance and minimize liability.

Discussion

The authors discuss the current procedural terminology (CPT) process for defining care codes and the relative update commission (RUC) process for assigning values to those codes, with each code assigned a separate value in three separate categories. Steps for managing any concern or dispute about billing, denials, or an audit are subsequently addressed. Tenets of proper documentation are discussed, and some future developments are identified that are likely to affect critical care.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the procedures by which care codes are defined and valued is necessary for using these codes properly, as well as for addressing needs unmet by existing codes. Preventing audits is the best approach to proper coding and billing, and documentation is key.

### 2021 ISHNE / HRS / EHRA / APHRS collaborative statement on mHealth in arrhythmia management: digital medical tools for heart rhythm professionals: from the international society for holter and noninvasive electrocardiology / Heart Rhythm Society / European Heart Rhythm Association / Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^bd19a7e0]. Journal of Arrhythmia (2021). High credibility.

Appendix 1 — United States CMS reimbursement and CPT coding for mHealth management — In the United States, reimbursement for medical services is guided primarily by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Committee develops descriptive codes that are then referred to the Relative Value Update Committee to develop recommended relative value units (RVU). Presently, the CPT Committee is developing codes to represent the clinical work involved in managing mHealth data, and these codes will be evaluated and assigned RVU values; if accepted by CMS, they will be included in the Medicare Fee Schedule and go into clinical use. This process typically takes 2 years, other insurers typically accept them once published, and at the time of writing CPT 99091 and CPT 99457 had received approval.

### Disparities in the management of newly diagnosed paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia for women versus men in the United States [^b76f097e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the impact of PSVT on HRU in women and men, we examined office visits, outpatient hospital visits, emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient admissions, and prescription drug use before and after index diagnosis. These groupings of HRU and expenditure by setting of care follow standard groupings for organizing provider payments. For example, outpatient hospital visits covered services provided in an outpatient hospital setting and billed by the hospital. We calculated mean per‐patient annual numbers of office, outpatient hospital and ED visits, inpatient admissions, and prescription medication fills for β blockers and calcium channel blockers, which can be used for PSVT management. Because women in our study were of child‐bearing age, we also examined rates of contraceptive prescriptions. We then calculated the proportions of patients with at least 1 ED visit, ≥ 1 hospitalization, and ≥ 1 medication fill. The analysis also identified the subset of medical encounters with a PSVT or a PSVT‐related diagnosis in the postindex year to assess the contribution of PSVT and PSVT‐related services to HRU following initial diagnosis and examine whether PSVT and PSVT‐related service use differed for women versus men.

Rates of PSVT catheter ablations for women versus men were calculated in the year after PSVT diagnosis. Current Procedural Terminology and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes identified ablations; claims for the same patient within 7 days were grouped as a single ablation. Ablations were required to occur in an inpatient or outpatient hospital setting, and all claims with a procedure code for ablation that occurred within 7 days of the first observed ablation claim were considered a single ablation, as reablation would not be expected to occur within 7 days. Because the same procedure codes for ablation can be used for PSVT and other rhythm disorders, ablations were grouped according to whether they had at least 1 PSVT diagnosis. Clinical codes used to identify ablations are listed in Table S3. The proportion of women versus men and women with at least 1 ablation in the 12 months after diagnosis was calculated.

### Documentation and coding for trauma and surgical critical care: updates and tips [^2781a9fc]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

CPT code 99291 will be used only once per date even if the time spent by the practitioner is not continuous on that date. Thereafter, the physician or NPP will report CPT code 99292 for additional 30-minute time increments provided to the same patient.

Prior to the 2022 changes, CMS rules required that a practitioner complete 30 consecutive minutes to qualify for the 99291 E&M code. The new rules now allow multiple practitioners from the same practice to accumulate the necessary 30 minutes to qualify for 99291.

When one practitioner begins furnishing the initial critical care service but does not meet the time required to report CPT code 99291, another practitioner in the same specialty and group can continue to deliver critical care to the same patient on the same date. The total time spent by the practitioners is aggregated to meet the time requirement to bill CPT code 99291.

Once the cumulative required critical care service time is met to report CPT code 99291, CPT code 99292 can only be reported by a practitioner in the same specialty and group when an additional 30 minutes of critical care services have been furnished to the same patient on the same date (74 min+30 min = 104 total min).

Another important change by CMS in 2022 relates to split/shared services. Prior to 2023, critical care was not eligible for split/shared services. A physician and an NPP could not collaborate on generating the same critical care E&M code (99291 and 99292). Under the new rules, billing for split/shared services for critical care is now allowedunder the following conditions:

No changes in how services qualify as critical care.
Critical care time is the sum of MD and NPP time spent providing critical care.
Whomever does > 50% (substantive portion) of the critical care time bills for the critical care.
The new modifier -FS is required for all split/shared services coding.

### American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position paper for the use of telemedicine for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders [^787e1f7b]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Medicare telemedicine site definitions — An originating site is the location of an eligible Medicare beneficiary at the time the service being furnished (via a telecommunications system) occurs, and authorized originating sites include the office of a physician or practitioner, a hospital, a critical access hospital (CAH), a rural health clinic, a federally qualified health center, a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), and a Community Mental Health Center (CMHC). Distant site practitioners who may administer and receive payment for covered telemedicine services are physicians, physician assistants (PA), nurse practitioners (NP), nurse-midwives, clinical nurse specialists (CNS), clinical psychologists (CP), and clinical social workers (CSW). CPs and CSWs cannot bill for psychotherapy services that include medical evaluation and management services under Medicare and may not bill or receive payment for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 90792, 90833, 90836, and 90838. The physician visits required under § 483.40(c) for care provided in long term care facilities may not be furnished as telemedicine services.

### Use of new audio-only telemedicine claim modifiers [^692086fe]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 spurred a rapid uptake of telemedicine in the US. This adoption was enabled in part by responses to pandemic circumstances, including policy changes by Medicare and other insurers to reimburse for telemedicine services at parity to in-person services. Such changes included coverage and payment parity for audio-only telemedicine services that enabled patients and clinicians to connect synchronously via telephone.

However, audio-only telemedicine use has been difficult to characterize. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, audio-only telemedicine services were intended to be coded with specific Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 99441 to 99443 (evaluation and management [E/M] telephone visits conducted with physicians) and 98966 to 98968 (telephone visits conducted with nonphysician health care professionals) in contrast to audiovisual services, which were denoted by CPT code modifiers 95 or GT. However, additional types of services denoted by other CPT codes were increasingly permitted to be offered via audio-only telemedicine over the course of the pandemicand difficult to capture due to a lack of specific modifiers.

Furthermore, among patients who self-reported having an audio-only service in a survey in fall 2020, only 20% had a matching corresponding claim. In comparison, among those reporting an audiovisual service, 96% had an audiovisual service claim. The reasons for this difference are unclear and may be due to discrepancies in billing (eg, clinician billing for audio-only services as audiovisual services) or perceptions (eg, differences in patients' and clinicians' definitions of audio-only services). Data discrepancies undercut the ability to accurately identify and understand utilization of audio-only telemedicine services.

This problem is particularly worrisome because of what is at stake. From a financial perspective, reimbursement for audio-only telemedicine is new, with ongoing debates about whether and how to continue reimbursement. This is, in part, due to the limited evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of audio-only telemedicine and despite the lack of firmly established evidence, assumptions about the superiority of audiovisual telemedicine. In reality, some patients may prefer audio-only telemedicine when offered a choice.

### Specifying and pilot testing quality measures for the American Society of Addiction Medicine's standards of care [^cec0d4e7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Specifying measure 3 — percent of withdrawal management episodes with outpatient follow‑up within 7 days: The denominator is composed of detoxification episodes identified using procedure codes, but in VA data it was impossible to reliably distinguish inpatient from outpatient episodes, so the panel combined these into a single measure. A medication‑based identification method paired with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) or OUD diagnosis identified about 10% more patients than procedure codes alone but was not included due to added complexity and cursory validation. To address closely spaced ambulatory events, the panel included only the last ambulatory detoxification episode per patient in the measurement year and included each inpatient detoxification with a unique discharge day, meaning each patient might contribute at most 1 outpatient detoxification but potentially many inpatient detoxifications to the denominator. The numerator is outpatient follow‑up care for substance use disorder (SUD) within 7 days after detoxification, with alternative windows considered including 3 and 10 days.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^6e657ea5]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

CMS and MPFS process and scope are outlined: when RVUs are designated for the target CPT service, the RUC reports its RVU recommendations to the CMS, which then has final authority to either accept, reject, or modify the RUC recommendations, and the CMS announces its final valuation assignments through its annually published MPFS. The MPFS lists CMS-accepted RVU values and details such as whether Medicare designates the CPT code as an active (covered) service, its procedural global package, and the applicability of other descriptive modifiers, with many other payers, including Medicaid programs and commercial plans, using MPFS information in modeling fee schedules. In the 2018 MPFS, the CMS expressed interest in eventually modifying evaluation and management (E/M) documentation guidelines to reduce regulatory burden and place greater emphasis on medical decision-making, and the AAP provided extensive comments highlighting the uniqueness of pediatric care in documenting E/M visits; global packages represent 0-, 10-, or 90-day postsurgical periods and specify the bundled services.

### Rounding out the pediatric CF care team: including the profession of occupational therapy [^e7355f06]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

As depicted through an overview of literature, the profession of occupational therapy is prepared to address several areas of need through skilled, billable services; yet these professionals are rarely consulted or referred to on the team. Lorenzo and Metz surveyed occupational therapy practitioners (n = 82) on their knowledge and perceptions of their role in working with children with chronic respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis. Researchers reported that 91% of respondents endorsed a least one role of the profession with this population. The endorsed roles included: developing efficient ways to complete everyday occupations (85%), patient education (84%), energy conservation (81%), and engagement in physical activity (78%). These findings demonstrate OT's preparedness to address the needs of this population, yet there has been little advancements in bringing OTs onto the team. Similar findings were noted during a needs assessment with local professionals during an occupational therapy student project. The needs assessment included direct interviews and digital surveys with open and closed ended questions. There was a unanimous agreement from OTs (n = 5) and pediatric pulmonologists (n = 4) that a child with cystic fibrosis would benefit from outpatient OT services. Similarly, 75% endorsed the need for OT during inpatient/acute services due to pulmonary exacerbation. However, providers reported rarely utilizing the profession thus far.

Upon inquiring with patients and families at a local cystic fibrosis care center, several needs that fall into the OT scope of practice were identified. These included additional training and education in life skills (e.g. attention and stress management), mental health care (e.g. coping skills and emotional regulation), medication management (e.g. identifying and communicating symptoms and managing medications), and daily needs (e.g. routines and feeding). OTs have extensive training to provide interventions and education to address these identified needs. An OT would strengthen the interdisciplinary team and should be added to the staff in the care center or referrals should be made to OTs in an outpatient clinic or in the inpatient/acute setting. In the outpatient and inpatient/acute therapy setting, services would be billable through CPT codes. Funding options would need to be explored to support an OT in the care center.

### Estimate of the direct and indirect annual cost of bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States [^9b1fa0fa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Physician Costs

Data on the office cost associated with visiting either a pediatrician, general practitioner or ophthalmologist due to bacterial conjunctivitis were derived from an examination of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS Codes) commonly used by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These codes are based on the Current Procedural Technology (CPT) codes developed by the American Medical Association to monitor fees for various medical procedures. According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the key CPT codes of interest are: i) 99213 defined as "An office other outpatient visit for the evaluation and management of an established patient. Usually, the presenting problem(s) are of low to moderate severity. Physicians typically spend 15 minutes face-to-face with the patient and/or family" and ii) 92004 defined as "(Ophthalmological services) Medical examination and evaluation with initiation of diagnostic treatment program; comprehensive, new patient, one or more visits". Data on the mean values associated with each of these CPT fee codes for 2005 are presented in Table 1. The use of the Medicare CPT fee codes was selected as it was most likely to approximate the cost of seeing either a pediatrican, general physician or ophthalmologist across the United States.

In WC outpatient care, "there is little use of risky diagnostic procedures or treatment options, however, there may be the need for substantial time and effort to address risk for work disability, which we consider a severe negative outcome". For high-risk determinations, "the risk assigned for management options selected usually refers to the risk of not managing related problems in a WC case" and considers complexities such as "ongoing opioid use and prolonged work disability".

### Documentation and coding for trauma and surgical critical care: updates and tips [^30bbe04e]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical condition: "Direct delivery by a physician or NPP of medical care for a critically ill/injured patient in which there is acute impairment of one or more vital organ systems such that there is a probability of imminent or life-threatening deterioration of the patient's condition".
Treatment condition: " It involves high complexity decision-making to treat single or multiple vital organ system failure and/or prevent further life-threatening deterioration of the patient's condition. Critical care may be furnished on multiple days and is typically furnished in a critical care area which can include an intensive care unit or emergency care facility".
Full attention condition: "… requires the full attention of the physician or NPP, for any given time period spent providing critical care services, the practitioner cannot provide services to any other patient during the same period of time".
Documentation of time condition: Including a statement such as: Critical care time of XX minutes excluding procedures.

Beginning in 2022, CMS introduced a number of changes that affect documentation, coding and billing for trauma and acute care operation. As one of the new requirements, an entire additional 30 minutes must be completed to "earn" CPT 99292. In other words, at least 104 minutes of qualifying critical care must be rendered for billing both 99291 and 99292:

… CPT code 99292 can only be reported by a practitioner in the same specialty and group when an additional 30 minutes of critical care services have been furnished to the same patient on the same date (74 min+30 min = 104 total min).

Note that 99291 can only be used once by a practitioner and their partners in the same specialty under the same tax ID number:

### The 2023 CPT coding and Medicare payment update… [^87b39559]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

As the new year begins, it's time to get familiar with the 2023 changes to CPT coding, Medicare payment policies, and Medicare's Quality Payment Program. There are a host of coding changes, including substantial revisions to evaluation and management services that occur in hospitals or nursing homes, and changes to how prolonged services can be reported. E/M CODING There are changes to E/M coding on several fronts, as CPT follows up on the office and outpatient E/M visit reforms of 2021.

1. Hospital and nursing home visits. The most consequential changes to E/M coding this year come in hospital and nursing home settings, which have moved to the same code level selection criteria as office/outpatient E/M services. Physicians will now select codes for these services based on either their total time spent caring for the patient or their level of medical decision making.

The same MDM table CPT used for office-based E/M codes will now be used for hospital and nursing home E/M services, with a few revisions from CPT:

2. Added "1 stable acute illness" and "1 acute, uncomplicated illness or injury requiring hospital inpatient or observation level of care" to the low-level MDM elements in the problems category, Added decisions regarding the "escalation of hospital-level of care" and "parenteral controlled substances" to the high-level MDM elements in the risk category. Added "multiple morbidities requiring intensive management" to the risk category, but this applies only to initial nursing facility visits. Other CPT changes also impact how you will report these services. For 2023, CPT has done the following: Consolidated hospital inpatient and observation codes into a single family of codes: 99221–99223 and 99231–99233.

Redefined the lowest level of emergency department codes to describe visits that do not require a physician or other qualified health care professional, Deleted the separate code for nursing home annual exams, which will now be coded as subsequent nursing home visits. Multiple E/M services on the same day. CPT has also revised its guidelines for hospital E/M to allow the reporting of multiple services when a patient is admitted to inpatient or observation status during a visit at another site of service. The CPT guidelines advise clinicians to append modifier 25 to the initial service and then also report the hospital-based service. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is retaining its policy that clinicians should only report one service per calendar date in these situations.

It remains to be seen whether non-Medicare payers will follow CPT's guidance or Medicare's. Prolonged services. CPT has deleted the codes for prolonged E/M services with direct patient contact in the office and inpatient settings. Physicians have been able to use code 99417 to report prolonged services in the office setting since the 2021 changes, and that will now be the only option there. Meanwhile, a new code, 99418, will be used for prolonged services in hospitals and nursing homes. CPT guidance allows clinicians to report 99417 and 99418, along with a primary E/M code for the highest level of service in each setting, once they surpass the minimum time of the highest level of service by 15 minutes. But this is another area where CPT and Medicare differ. Medicare requires clinicians to surpass the maximum time of the highest E/M level by 15 minutes before reporting prolonged services codes.

### Interventional pain management: evolving issues for 2003 [^4a281879]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The new millennium has seen the introduction of an array of new Current Procedural Terminology(R) (CPT) codes and the expansion of interventional techniques. Among the many issues of interest to physicians practicing interventional pain management in 2003 are CPT coding, correct coding issues, and utilization. The CPT developed and updated by the American Medical Association, is the most important and commonly used coding system for interventional pain physicians in the United States. A recent development in the CPT system has been to include Category I, Category II, and Category III CPT codes. Inclusion of a code in Category I is generally based on the procedure being consistent with contemporary medical practice and being performed by many physicians in clinical practice in multiple locations. In contrast, CPT Category III, also known as emerging technology codes, is a set of temporary codes for emerging technology, services, and procedures. There have been many new codes since 2000, along with changes in the definitions of the codes and vignettes. In order for the correct coding initiative to be effective, it is essential that the coding describes what actually transpires at each patient encounter. When multiple procedures are performed at the same session, the procedure and post-procedure work do not have to be repeated for each procedure, and, therefore, a comprehensive code describing the multiple services commonly performed together can be used. Thus, many activities which are integral to a procedure are considered as generic activities and are assumed to be included as acceptable medical/surgical practice and, while they couldn't be performed separately, they should not be considered as such when a code narrative is defined. Under this initiative, almost all interventional techniques are affected. The utilization of interventional techniques in the modern era is the final issue. Utilization has been increasing gradually. Thus, it is important for interventional pain physicians to understand the utilization patterns across the nation and for various techniques. This review will discuss the issues of CPT coding, correct coding, and utilization as they pertain to interventional techniques.

### Coding for evaluation and management services… [^ff6d29b6]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Evaluation and management services are at the core of most family medicine practices and represent a category of Current Procedural Terminology codes used for billing purposes. There are different levels of E/M codes, which are determined by the physician's or qualified health professional 's medical decision-making or time involved. In response to advocacy from the AAFP and other medical specialty societies, the CPT Editorial Panel revised the office visit E/M documentation and coding guidelines in January 2021. As part of the continued effort to simplify documentation requirements and reduce burden, the CPT Editorial Panel revised the E/M documentation guidelines for several other E/M services in January
2023. The 2023 changes are largely an expanded application of the 2021 office visit E/M guideline changes.

In 2024, add-on code G2211 is available to provide additional payment to primary care physicians for the high-value, complex, continuous visits they provide patients. 2021 E/M coding office and outpatient resources General AAFP resources for E/M coding changes Additional resources Generally, it's appropriate to use total time to select the level of service for a patient encounter when the amount of time the physician or other QHP spends on the date of the encounter performing visit-related activities before, during, and after the visit exceeds the MDM involved. Time includes all activities related to the encounter performed by the physician or QHP on the date of the encounter. This includes activities such as reviewing external notes/tests/etc. not separately reported, performing an examination, counseling and educating the patient/caregiver, and documenting in the medical record.

Time spent performing activities normally completed by ancillary staff should not be included, and neither should travel time. When providing a split or shared visit, the time personally spent by the physician and QHP on the date of the encounter is summed to select the appropriate level of service. However, only distinct time should be counted. When there is overlapping time only count the time of one individual. When code selection is based on total time on the date of the encounter, the split or shared service is reported by the professional who spent the majority of the face-to-face or non-face-to-face time performing the service. No, the rules for teaching physicians have not changed. Only the time personally spent by the teaching physician and related to the encounter can be included in the calculation of total time. The CPT Panel made additional modifications to the prolonged services codes.

Prolonged services codes may only be used when total time has been used to select the level of service. The revised prolonged services codes are listed below: Prolonged services with direct patient contact CPT codes have been deleted. Medicare does not cover CPT codes 99417 and 99418, and as of January 1, 2021, it no longer covers prolonged services without direct patient contact CPT codes 99358 and 99359. Instead, physicians can report prolonged services for Medicare patients using the following HCPCS codes: Like CPT codes 99417 and 99418, HCPCS codes G2212, G0316, G0317, and G0318 can only be used when time is used to select the level of service. They are add-on codes to and may only be used for increments of at least 15 minutes. No, not if these tests were separately billed. Tests that have an interpretive component and are reported separately cannot count toward the MDM.

### Cost-effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis in older men with a history of falls [^a68dff8e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Costs

The costs of DXA and a physician visit were obtained from the 2020 Medicare National Average Rates (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes 77080 and 99213, respectively). The wholesale acquisition costs of alendronate and zoledronic acid were used as the medication costs. Those who did not adhere to alendronate therapy accrued the medication cost for only 6 months. Those who did not adhere to zoledronic acid therapy accrued the medication cost for only the first year. Infusion and related supply costs of zoledronic acid were taken from a US claim-based cost analysis. Costs of the basic metabolic panel (CPT code 80048) and comprehensive dental examination (CPT code D 0150) were based on the national mean commercial rates. Acute costs of managing each type of fracture were taken from a US claim-based cost analyses. The long-term cost of hip fractures (eg, increased admission to long-term care facilities) was incorporated. All costs were inflated to 2019 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index for Medical Care for All Urban Consumers.

Quality of Life

The age-dependent, fracture-free utility values were based on EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) scores collected from nationally representative US community-dwelling samples. The utility multiplier for a history of falls was calculated using a EQ-5D survey in Germany. The utility multiplier for each type of fracture was taken from the International Costs and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic Fractures Study. If individuals sustained a fracture, for example, their baseline utilities were multiplied by the utility of that fracture event in the first year and by the utility of that postfracture health state in subsequent years.

Model Validation

To assess its external validity, the model simulated the prognosis of men aged 50 years without a history of falls receiving usual care. The predicted lifetime risk of hip fracture was 11%; clinical vertebral fracture, 9%; wrist fracture, 3%; and humeral fracture, 3%. These predicted risks approximated well with published estimates.

### CPT: an open system that describes all that you do [^ac8d8c65]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The American Medical Association, with the cooperation of multiple major medical specialty societies, including the ACR, responded in 1966 to the need for a complete coding system for describing medical procedures and services with the first publication of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). This system, now CPT IV, forms the basis of reporting of virtually all inpatient and outpatient services performed by physicians and nonphysician health care providers as well as facilities. This coding system and its maintenance process have evolved in complexity and sophistication, particularly in the past decade, such that it is now integral to all facets of health care, including tracking new and investigational procedures and reporting and monitoring performance measures (read "pay for performance"), in addition to its long-standing use for reporting for reimbursement. To paraphrase a recent automobile commercial, "This is not your father's CPT". The author describes the development of CPT as it exists today, examining the forces that molded its current form, the input opportunities available to medical specialty societies and others, the ever increasing transparency of the CPT maintenance process, and the availability of resources allowing all to stay current. Understanding this system, critical to the practice of all of medicine, including radiology, will aid all health care providers in maintaining the quality, efficiency, and accuracy of their practices' business operations as well as assist them in a world of increasingly complex reporting requirements.

METHODS

Data Availability

To comply with Alberta's Health Information Act, the data set used for this study cannot be made publicly available. The data set from this study is held securely in coded form within the Alberta Support for Patient Oriented Research Unit Data Platform. Although legal data sharing agreements between the investigators, Alberta Support for Patient Oriented Research Unit, and Alberta Health Services/Alberta Health prohibit us from making the data set publicly available, access may be granted to those who meet prespecified criteria for confidential access, available at. The data set analytic codes are available from the authors upon request, understanding that the computer programs may rely upon coding templates or macros that are unique to the Alberta Support for Patient Oriented Research Unit.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study and has been described more fully elsewhere. We included all adult Albertans who used physician services in 2 sequential time periods: March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 (classified as prepandemic), and March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 (pandemic).

Data Sources and Study Sample

This study linked population‐based health administrative data sets in Alberta, Canada for 3.8 million adults. All health care in the province is publicly funded, with universal access and without user fees for physician services, emergency department (ED) use, or hospitalizations.

Several data sets were linked deterministically via encrypted unique health identifier number to create our study's analytical data set. The Discharge Abstract Database captures all acute care hospitalizations recording admission and discharge date, as well as up to 25 diagnoses and 16 procedures indicated with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision, Canada (ICD‐9, ICD‐10‐CA) and Canadian Classification of health Interventions codes, respectively. The Ambulatory Care Database captures all ED assessments and hospital‐based physician office visits, recording the date along with up to 10 diagnostic codes. The Healthcare Provider Claims Database captures claims for all physician visits (including those shadow‐billed by salaried physicians), recording the date and up to 3 diagnoses. The Pharmacy Information Network captures all medication dispensations from community pharmacies. The Alberta Health Care Insurance Registry captures all patient demographics, addresses, and dates of death/emigration from the province. The comprehensiveness of the databases and the validity of the ICD‐9 and ICD‐10‐CA case definitions we used in this study have been previously established.

### Integrating advanced practice providers into medical critical care teams [^8c93e348]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Because there is increasing demand for critical care providers in the United States, many medical ICUs for adults have begun to integrate nurse practitioners and physician assistants into their medical teams. Studies suggest that such advanced practice providers (APPs), when appropriately trained in acute care, can be highly effective in helping to deliver high-quality medical critical care and can be important elements of teams with multiple providers, including those with medical house staff. One aspect of building an integrated team is a practice model that features appropriate coding and billing of services by all providers. Therefore, it is important to understand an APP's scope of practice, when they are qualified for reimbursement, and how they may appropriately coordinate coding and billing with other team providers. In particular, understanding when and how to appropriately code for critical care services (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 99291, critical care, evaluation and management of the critically ill or critically injured patient, first 30–74 min; CPT code 99292, critical care, each additional 30 min) and procedures is vital for creating a sustainable program. Because APPs will likely play a growing role in medical critical care units in the future, more studies are needed to compare different practice models and to determine the best way to deploy this talent in specific ICU settings.

### Review of transitional care management and chronic care management codes for Pulmonologists [^2e26a066]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced respiratory illness are often hospitalized, requiring close follow-up after discharge and also requiring care coordination outside of traditional face-to-face outpatient visits. Primary care providers and specialists often provide services outside of outpatient visits that have not been captured and reimbursed with traditional billing evaluation and management codes. Within the last 5 years, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid added new codes to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that reimburse for care coordination services not paid for by traditional evaluation and management codes. Transitional care management includes the 30-day period following hospitalization in which a clinician is responsible for care of the patient postdischarge from the hospital. Chronic care management provides reimbursement for coordination of care for chronic conditions that is performed by any clinician and his or her staff on a monthly basis that is > 20 min in duration.

### Community factors associated with telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic [^457d4c53]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Using OptumLabs Data Warehouse deidentified medical claims, we captured all outpatient visits, in person and telemedicine, from January 1 to July 14, 2020. We defined outpatient visits using Medicare's list of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes eligible for telemedicine. Telemedicine visits were those with modifier codes GT, GQ, or 95, or CPT codes 99441 to 99443 with the remainder defined as in-person visits.

After excluding counties with fewer than 100 members enrolled from July 2019 through July 2020, we assessed county-level telemedicine use during the pandemic (defined as March 18 to July 14, 2020) using the percentage of total visits delivered via telemedicine. We measured county-level population density (number of people per square mile) as a proxy for rurality, race, income, broadband availability, and per capita number of hospital beds, community health centers, physicians, and advanced practice registered nurses using data from the US Census and Area Health Resource Files. County-level prepandemic telemedicine use was measured as the percentage of total visits delivered via telemedicine from January 1 to March 17, 2020, and cumulative COVID-19 cases per capita were measured over 2 periods, March 18 to April 16, 2020, and March 18 to July 14, 2020.

To measure the association between these county characteristics and percentage point differences in telemedicine use, we used targeted maximum likelihood estimation, a machine learning procedure used in prior clinical literature. We divided county characteristic measures into tertiles for meaningful interpretation except for those where there were positivity violations. We addressed violations by dichotomizing variables (see eAppendix in the Supplement). The Harvard Medical School institutional review board exempted this study from review because it involved the study of data recorded such that participants cannot be reasonably identified. This study adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for cross-sectional studies.

Data analyses were performed using R statistical software version 3.6.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the SuperLearner and tmle packages. These analyses were performed on September 17, 2020.

### Prescribing patterns for atopic dermatitis in the United States [^dda6ac08]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Introduction: Although future atopic dermatitis (AD) clinical research is intended to improve standard-of-care treatment, how patients are currently treated is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to determine the most frequent medications prescribed in all ages of AD.

Methods: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is a nationally representative survey of United States office-based ambulatory visits and records demographics, diagnoses, and treatments. This is a cross-sectional study using the NAMCS of all AD outpatient office visits from 2006 to 2015. Patient visits with an ICD-9-CM code for AD (691.8) were collected and analyzed. Frequency tables were created for age, race, providers managing AD, and treatment.

Results: Patient demographics of AD visits included 51% male (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 44–58%), 71% white (65–77%), 19% African American (14–25%), and 10% Asian (6–14%). About 31% (24–37%) of visits were to pediatricians and 27% (22–33%) to dermatologists whereas per physician, dermatologists managed more AD visits than pediatricians. Topical corticosteroids (59%; 52–66%) were the most common class of medications prescribed followed by antibiotics (11%; 6–16%) and second generation antihistamines (6%; 3–10%). The most common topical corticosteroid prescribed in AD was triamcinolone (25% of office visits; 18–31%). Hydrocortisone was the most common topical corticosteroid prescribed to children < 1 year of age and children aged 8 to 18, whereas triamcinolone was more common in children 2 to 7 years and adults > 18 years.

Discussion: Topical corticosteroids were the most frequent prescriptions provided at office-based ambulatory visits whereas antibiotics and second-generation antihistamines were the second and third most common prescribed medications, respectively. Although pediatricians manage more AD visits than dermatologists in total visits, dermatologists manage more AD visits than pediatricians per physician. Characterizing how AD patients are currently treated may build a reference for future clinical research investigating novel standard-of-care treatment in AD.

### Development of a multifaceted program for pharmacogenetics adOption At an academic medical center: practical considerations and lessons learned [^f7315192]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Interventions.

We tracked third-party reimbursement within our healthcare system for each of the implemented PGx tests by current procedural terminology (CPT) code. PGx orders are linked to CPT codes. Single genes are billed using gene-specific individual CPT codes and PGx panels of six or more genes are billed with the CPT code 81418. We navigated differences in inpatient and outpatient billing and reimbursement, including unique billing structures for special patient populations (e.g. pending transplant recipients and donors). Although the billing and reimbursement structure differed depending on the patient admission status and potential program-based billing, the insurer approval rate at the test level was needed to estimate all reimbursement structures.

Initially, we tried to obtain prior authorization to determine reimbursement before testing was performed, but this process was labor-intensive and not conducive to large-scale implementation. Instead, we reviewed reimbursement rates for all genetic test CPT codes. Since our PGx laboratory bills through the health system (rather than independently), this required a review of all health system encounters at the financial identification number (FIN) level that included at least one PGx test CPT code. As a result, this method only allowed us to determine whether all procedures associated with each encounter were reimbursed (and not to specifically determine whether the PGx test CPT codes were reimbursed), which likely greatly underestimated the actual reimbursement rate for each PGx test. Thus, we were unable to obtain accurate third-party reimbursement rates for PGx testing CPT codes in the majority of our patient populations, with kidney transplant patients being an exception (described in the following paragraph).

We also observed differences in PGx testing reimbursement if the procedures were rolled into diagnosis-related group (DRG) billing. Care for pending transplant recipients falls under a DRG covered by a transplant-specific SIHO insurance group, obscuring the ability to discern specific reimbursement of PGx testing apart from other clinical procedures. However, we observed > 99% reimbursement rates for claims including CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 testing in kidney transplant patients, as we have previously reported.

We are not routinely performing prior authorizations before completing PGx testing. However, if providers/patients prefer to know if the test will be covered prior to ordering testing, our team will submit a prior authorization and communicate the results. If a prior authorization is not performed and a patient receives a bill, we assist the patient in navigating payment assistance programs.

### Defining documentation requirements for coding quality care in workers' compensation [^216a81a3]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Proposed solution — ACOEM proposes a new set of ground rules for documenting E&M encounters in workers' compensation care with a decreased emphasis on irrelevant history and examination elements and an increased emphasis on work-related factors, function, and mitigating the risk of work disability, and to support proper documentation ACOEM proposes an occupational medicine specialty musculoskeletal examination. ACOEM also proposes recognition of codes for consultation in workers' compensation care and supports specific new ground rules for their use even though these codes are no longer recognized by CMS, supports the use of management codes with alternative ground rules appropriate for workers' compensation care, and for services with no existing CPT codes critical to workers' compensation care supports the adoption of new codes with clear ground rules for their use.

### Acute care surgery billing, coding and documentation series part 3: coding of additional select procedures; modifiers; telemedicine coding; robotic surgery [^640951a4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Further confusing the issue is that the American Medical Association created a new telehealth modifier in 2017, Modifier 95 (Synchronous telemedicine service), but Medicare does not recognize this modifier. Medicaid requires GT Modifier and POS 02. A 95 modifier is applied to CPT codes 99201–99215, 99212–99215 visits for Medicare without POS 02. Medicare does not require POS 02 or 95 modifier on phone E/M services. When billing payers other than Medicare for telehealth, the specific payer guidelines should be reviewed to determine the correct modifier use.

If a telehealth service is provided for a Medicare patient located at an ineligible originating site, consider appending Modifier GY (Item or service statutorily excluded, does not meet the definition of any Medicare benefit or for non-Medicare insurers, is not a contract benefit). Appending this modifier will allow tracking of telehealth services provided while indicating the payer's reimbursement criteria have not been met.

Telehealth visits can be billed according to medical decision making or time, so if the code indicates it can be a time-based service, then the service can be billed accordingly.

Telephone E/M service are the following:

99441 — 5–10 min

99442 — 11–20 min

99443 — 21–30 min

Medicare HCPCS Code G2012 — A brief communication (5–10 min), a virtual check in with your practitioner via telephone or other telecommunication device.

Office or other E/M codes for telemedicine encounters include

99201–99205, New patient visit.

99212–99215, Established patient visit.

99241–99245, Consultative visit

CPT codes for online digital visits (E-visits) via patient portal, secure email are

99421 (5–10 min)

99422 (11–20 min)

99423 (21 or more minutes)

Medicare accepted telehealth codes

Medicare provides a list of CPT and HCPCS Level II codes eligible for reimbursement when provided via telehealth on its website.

Individuals can submit a request to CMS for an addition to the approved list, but their submission must meet the CMS criteria to be considered (see). Not all payers cover telehealth services.

### Need for clarifying remote physiologic monitoring reimbursement during the COVID-19 pandemic: a respiratory disease case study [^4b4bbb0b]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

"Physiologic" limitations: the challenge of reimbursement given general terms

The lack of definition of "physiologic" has created confusion within the reimbursement community, causing providers and payers to question which technologies and physiologic markers qualify for remote "physiologic" monitoring reimbursement, therefore limiting adoption.

The term "physiologic" appears nearly 80 times throughout the AMA CPT ® 2020 Professional Edition codebook. The CPT ® Editorial Panel publishes the annual codebook to report the rules and guidelines surrounding CPT ® codes and descriptors. Despite urgings by stakeholders for clarity, "physiologic" is not formally defined in the CPT® manual, the CPT ® Coding Assistant, a coding "Resource and Coverage Guide", AMA's Digital Health Implementation Playbook, nor on any associated website.

CMS coverage and payment of remote physiologic monitoring

In November 2018, CMS extended coverage and payment for CPT ® remote physiologic monitoring codes 99453, 99454, and remote physiologic monitoring treatment management services code 99457. In November 2019, CMS announced that it would adopt, cover, and pay CPT ® code 99458 for each "additional 20 min", beginning January 1, 2020. In the Final Rule commentary, CMS acknowledged the need for clarification of the term physiologic and indicated they would consider these issues in future rulemaking. However, as of September 2020, CMS has not issued regulatory, sub-regulatory, or clarifying policy specific to the entire suite of remote physiologic (9945X) monitoring codes. More broadly, the term physiologic does not have a formal definition by CMS within rule, policy, or even in its listing of chronic diseases and associated terms.

### Optimizing coding and reimbursement to improve management of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias [^f460d4cd]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to review the diagnostic, International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), diagnosis related groups (DRGs), and common procedural terminology (CPT) coding and reimbursement issues (including Medicare Part B reimbursement for physicians) encountered in caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); to review the implications of these policies for the long-term clinical management of the patient with ADRD; and to provide recommendations for promoting appropriate recognition and reimbursement for clinical services provided to ADRD patients. Relevant English-language articles identified from MEDLINE about ADRD prevalence estimates; disease morbidity and mortality; diagnostic coding practices for ADRD; and Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care organization data on diagnostic coding and reimbursement were reviewed. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is grossly undercoded. Few AD cases are recognized at an early stage. Only 13% of a group of patients receiving the AD therapy donepezil had AD as the primary diagnosis, and AD is rarely included as a primary or secondary DRG diagnosis when the condition precipitating admission to the hospital is caused by AD. In addition, AD is often not mentioned on death certificates, although it may be the proximate cause of death. There is only one ICD-9-CM code for AD-331.0-and no clinical modification codes, despite numerous complications that can be directly attributed to AD. Medicare carriers consider ICD-9 codes for senile dementia (290 series) to be mental health codes and pay them at a lower rate than medical codes. DRG coding is biased against recognition of ADRD as an acute, admitting diagnosis. The CPT code system is an impediment to quality of care for ADRD patients because the complex, time-intensive services ADRD patients require are not adequately, if at all, reimbursed. Also, physicians treating significant numbers of AD patients are at greater risk of audit if they submit a high frequency of complex codes. AD is grossly undercoded in acute hospital and outpatient care settings because of failure to diagnose, limitations of the coding system, and reimbursement issues. Such undercoding leads to a lack of recognition of the effect of AD and its complications on clinical care and impedes the development of better care management. We recommend continuing physician education on the importance of early diagnosis and care management of AD and its documentation through appropriate coding, expansion of the current ICD-9-CM codes for AD, more appropriate use of DRG coding for ADRD, recognition of the need for time-intensive services by ADRD patients that result in a higher frequency of use of complex CPT codes, and reimbursement for CPT codes that cover ADRD care management services.

### Annual wellness visits and care management before and after dialysis initiation [^b28c6ab3]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome, Covariates and analysis

We had two outcomes of interest: visit with a PCP and receipt of AWV in the year following dialysis initiation. From OLDW data, we constructed a binary outcome of whether an enrollee had an outpatient visit with a PCP, based on claims with family practice or internal medicine provider specialty codes (e.g. family practice, internist, or internal medicine specialist) in outpatient settings where primary care providers may care for patients (i.e. physician's office, urgent care facility, ambulatory surgical center, independent clinic, outpatient hospital, telehealth, federally qualified health center, state or local public health clinic, rural health clinic). Receipt of an AWV within the year following dialysis initiation was ascertained from Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes G0402, G0438, or G0439 in medical claims.

We also included several patient characteristics for covariate adjustment: age group at dialysis initiation (18–64, 65–74, 75+), sex, race/ethnicity (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, unknown), geographic location (metropolitan) from Census tract-based Rural Urban Community Area (RUCA) codes, comorbidity burden in the year prior to dialysis initiation via the Charlson comorbidity index (0–5, 6–9, 10+), initial dialysis modality, as well as indicators whether patients had an outpatient visit with a PCP or nephrologist, clinical recognition of CKD, and receipt of an annual wellness visit in the year prior to dialysis initiation. Outpatient visit provider types (PCP, nephrologist) were ascertained from provider specialty code in claims. An MA enrollee was indicated to have clinically recognized CKD if there was at least one diagnosis in the year prior to dialysis initiation, which was determined from inpatient and outpatient claims indicating CKD stages 1–5 (ICD-9 codes 585.1–585.5; ICD-10 codes N18.1-N18.5) or unknown stage (ICD-9 code 585.9; ICD-10 code N18.9).
