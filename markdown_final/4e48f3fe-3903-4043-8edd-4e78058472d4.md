## Question

How do you dose gentamicin in hemodialysis patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to dose gentamicin in hemodialysis patients, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles that drive aminoglycoside dosing in dialysis. Then, I should verify the impact of dialysis modality and timing on drug clearance and exposure. Next, I will review traditional post-dialysis dosing versus emerging predialysis strategies and weigh the evidence. After that, I need to outline practical dosing algorithms for conventional thrice-weekly HD, short-daily HD, and CRRT, and confirm monitoring targets. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety, and stewardship, and synthesize a concise, actionable recommendation with caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic foundation. Aminoglycosides exhibit concentration-dependent bactericidal activity and a post-antibiotic effect, so efficacy correlates with peak-to-MIC ratio while toxicity correlates with total exposure (AUC) and high troughs; in dialysis patients, nonrenal clearance is minimal, so dialytic clearance dominates and interdialytic half-life is markedly prolonged, which changes how we should dose and monitor [^112EgchN] [^117DqzS1].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of dialytic removal. Multiple sources indicate that an 8-hour conventional HD session removes roughly 50% of gentamicin, with dialytic clearance around 100–135 mL/min depending on filter and flows, and there is often post-dialysis rebound of 30–40% as drug redistributes, which can confound post-HD sampling and dosing decisions [^111xeCnx] [^117DqzS1].

> I will now examine the traditional post-dialysis approach. The FDA label recommends 1–1.7 mg/kg IV after each HD session, acknowledging variability in dialytic removal and positioning this as a guide when levels are not available; this strategy aims to restore concentrations after HD but risks subtherapeutic peaks and prolonged low-level exposure between sessions, which may impair efficacy and select resistance [^111xeCnx] [^116DjRgF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the predialysis rationale. By dosing before HD, we can achieve higher peaks that better meet pharmacodynamic targets, then use the dialysis session to deliberately pull levels down and limit AUC exposure, thereby potentially improving efficacy while reducing toxicity; modeling and pilot data suggest predialysis dosing can optimize Cmax/MIC with lower AUC compared with post-dialysis dosing, though clinical outcome data remain limited [^117RU842] [^116doChQ].

> Let me consider short-daily HD specifically. In SDHD, dialytic clearance is higher and interdialytic intervals are shorter; predialysis every-other-day dosing has been shown to achieve target efficacy thresholds (Cmax ≥ 8 mg/L, AUC48 ≥ 140 mg·h/L) with less toxicity than post-dialysis regimens, supporting a predialysis strategy in this modality when clinically appropriate [^114HvqNt].

> Next, I should review CRRT, because it is not interchangeable with intermittent HD. In CRRT, aminoglycoside clearance is substantial and continuous, and current regimens often underdose relative to PK/PD targets; typical practice uses 2–3 mg/kg every 24 hours with aggressive TDM, but even these doses frequently fail to reach target peaks, so individualized PK-guided dosing is essential [^111GfLhP] [^1145T8ou].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit. For intermittent HD, obtain a peak 30–60 minutes after the dose and a pre-dialysis trough just before the next session; practical targets are peak 6–10 mg/L and pre-dialysis trough 1–2 mg/L, with dose adjustments based on both and attention to post-dialysis rebound when interpreting troughs; for CRRT, monitor levels every 24–48 hours and adjust to maintain peaks ≥ 8–10× MIC when feasible while avoiding accumulation [^116C4SFg] [^117S3jak] [^115fhdJY].

> But wait, what about special populations and safety. Elderly patients, those with prior aminoglycoside exposure, and those on concomitant nephrotoxins have higher risks of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; limit total duration when possible, avoid loop diuretics, and consider alternatives if prolonged therapy is anticipated; in pediatrics, weight-based dosing is used with even greater emphasis on TDM given developmental PK variability [^117S3jak] [^1145zwag] [^116C4SFg].

> I should double-check the role of residual kidney function. Even small amounts of RRF can meaningfully contribute to aminoglycoside clearance and alter interdialytic kinetics; therefore, dosing and intervals should be individualized, and TDM becomes even more critical when RRF is present or fluctuating [^1141TDaw] [^113oC548].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach for conventional thrice-weekly HD. A reasonable starting point is 2–3 mg/kg IV administered 30–60 minutes before HD, with immediate post-HD levels drawn to quantify dialytic removal and guide redosing; if predialysis troughs approach or exceed 2 mg/L, extend the interdose interval or reduce the dose, and if peaks are subtherapeutic, consider modest dose escalation or timing optimization; this balances PD optimization with AUC control via dialysis [^117RU842].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the FDA-endorsed post-dialysis regimen might be the most evidence-based across the board, but I should correct that impression; while post-dialysis dosing remains a conservative, label-supported fallback, emerging PK/PD and dialysis-timing data increasingly support predialysis strategies to better achieve efficacy targets, particularly in SDHD and selected IHD contexts, provided that robust TDM is in place to mitigate accumulation and toxicity [^111xeCnx] [^114HvqNt] [^117DqzS1].

> Finally, I need to ensure stewardship and contingency planning. Use aminoglycosides only when indicated, reassess at 48–72 hours for de-escalation, and transition to less nephrotoxic agents when possible; in cases of overdose or rising levels, remember that HD can aid removal, though peritoneal dialysis is far less effective for drug clearance, reinforcing the importance of proactive TDM and dose adjustment rather than reactive dialysis [^116WXfr8] [^115g5Ldq] [^116bEoF4].

Gentamicin dosing in hemodialysis patients should be **post-dialysis dosing** at 1–1.7 mg/kg after each session [^111xeCnx], with **trough monitoring** before the next dialysis to guide adjustments [^114wWgDn]. For severe infections, consider a 2–3 mg/kg loading dose if levels are unavailable, then adjust to post-dialysis dosing thereafter [^notfound]. Monitor for nephro- and ototoxicity, and adjust based on troughs and clinical response [^117S3jak].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations in hemodialysis patients

- **Volume of distribution (Vd)**: Gentamicin distributes mainly into extracellular fluid; in hemodialysis, Vd is often increased due to fluid overload, which can lower peak concentrations and may require higher initial doses [^114wWgDn].

- **Clearance**: Non-renal clearance is minimal; hemodialysis provides significant removal, with about 50% of gentamicin removed during a standard 4-hour session [^111xeCnx].

- **Half-life**: The interdialytic half-life is prolonged (30–60 hours), so dosing intervals must be extended to avoid accumulation [^117DqzS1].

---

## Recommended dosing strategies

### Traditional post-dialysis dosing

The **standard regimen** is 1–1.7 mg/kg IV after each dialysis session, adjusted to infection severity and patient factors [^111xeCnx]. The **rationale** is that post-dialysis dosing maintains therapeutic levels while minimizing accumulation and toxicity [^notfound].

---

### Alternative dosing strategies

Predialysis dosing (2–3 mg/kg 30–60 minutes before dialysis) can achieve higher peaks and improved pharmacodynamic targets but increases toxicity risk if not carefully monitored [^notfound]. Intradialytic dosing (during the first 30 minutes of dialysis) yields similar peaks with lower AUC and pre-dialysis concentrations, potentially reducing toxicity [^116doChQ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing strategies

| **Dosing strategy** | **Evidence summary** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Post-dialysis dosing | - Widely used <br/> - Supported by FDA labeling <br/> - Facilitates trough monitoring [^111xeCnx] | - Effective for most infections <br/> - Lower toxicity risk |
| Predialysis dosing | - Achieves higher peaks <br/> - Better PD targets <br/> - Requires close monitoring [^117DqzS1] | - Potentially improved efficacy <br/> - Higher toxicity risk |
| Intradialytic dosing | - Lower AUC <br/> - Similar peaks <br/> - Reduced pre-dialysis levels [^116doChQ] | - Potentially lower toxicity <br/> - Limited clinical data |

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment

- **Peak and trough levels**: Measure peak 30–60 minutes post-dose and trough just before dialysis; adjust to keep peaks 4–10 mcg/mL and troughs < 2 mcg/mL [^1145zwag].

- **Frequency of monitoring**: Check levels after the initial dose and periodically during therapy, especially with changing clinical status or dialysis prescription [^117S3jak].

- **Dose adjustments**: Increase dose if peaks are low; extend the interval or reduce dose if troughs are high or toxicity occurs [^1141TDaw].

---

## Factors influencing dosing decisions

- **Residual renal function**: Even minimal renal function can prolong half-life and increase accumulation risk [^117NqD5c].

- **Dialysis modality and prescription**: High-flux or prolonged dialysis increases removal and may require dose adjustments [^1111SA9k].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, weight, fluid status, and comorbidities affect pharmacokinetics and dosing [^113x22jj].

---

## Risks and benefits of different dosing strategies

Post-dialysis dosing offers a **lower toxicity risk** and facilitates trough monitoring, but may result in suboptimal peaks for severe infections. Predialysis dosing achieves **higher peaks** and improved pharmacodynamic targets, yet carries a **higher toxicity risk** and requires close monitoring. Intradialytic dosing may reduce toxicity with similar peaks, but evidence remains limited and implementation is complex [^116doChQ].

---

## Special considerations

Loading dose: Consider a **2–3 mg/kg loading dose** for severe infections when levels are unavailable, then transition to post-dialysis dosing [^111xeCnx]. Combination therapy: When used with beta-lactams, administer separately to avoid inactivation [^116iDe2M]. Toxicity monitoring: Watch for nephro- and ototoxicity, especially with prolonged therapy or elevated troughs [^117S3jak].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard dosing**: 1–1.7 mg/kg IV after each dialysis session [^111xeCnx].

- **Loading dose**: 2–3 mg/kg for severe infections if levels unavailable, then transition to post-dialysis dosing [^111xeCnx].

- **Monitoring**: Peak and trough levels to guide adjustments; keep peaks 4–10 mcg/mL and troughs < 2 mcg/mL [^1145zwag].

- **Adjustments**: Modify dose and interval based on levels, clinical response, and patient factors [^1141TDaw].

---

Gentamicin dosing in hemodialysis should be **post-dialysis** at 1–1.7 mg/kg, with trough monitoring to guide adjustments; consider a loading dose for severe infections and tailor to patient-specific factors to balance efficacy and toxicity [^111xeCnx].

### Dose timing of aminoglycosides in hemodialysis patients: a pharmacology view [^1167enZb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides for patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) have traditionally been dosed at half the normal dose administered at the end of a hemodialysis session. Several investigations have suggested that administering higher doses preceding or with the initiation of dialysis would more readily optimize pharmacodynamic parameters. However, the selection of an optimal aminoglycoside dosing strategy in patients receiving IHD is complex and requires consideration of numerous factors, precluding a singular approach. By reviewing aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, risks for toxicity and resistance development, and practical considerations, we derive indication- and setting- specific recommendations. We identify some areas (definitive therapy of gram-negative infections in patients receiving predictable hemodialysis sessions, for example) where dosing preceding or with the initiation of dialysis is optimal and feasible, and others (gram-positive synergy, unstable patients with poor/unpredictable vascular access) where postdialysis dosing remains preferred. Finally, given the dearth of data exploring the pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes of IHD patients receiving aminoglycoside therapy, we identify several key questions in need of investigation.

### Aminoglycosides in hemodialysis patients: is the current practice of post dialysis dosing appropriate? [^117RU842]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides have been widely used in end-stage renal failure patients for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Traditionally, these agents are administered post dialysis to avoid premature dialytic clearance, although no studies have been performed to confirm that this dosing strategy represents the optimal treatment regimen. In recent years, a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of aminoglycosides has led to a global change in clinical practice from multiple to once-daily dosing in patients with normal renal function with the aim of providing intermittent pulses to maximize the peak concentration relative to overall drug exposure. These same considerations strongly support administration of aminoglycosides before, rather than after, hemodialysis. This study will review the key pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations in aminoglycoside dosing, the relationship between serum aminoglycoside concentrations and efficacy/toxicity, the influence of renal function and hemodialysis on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and the mounting population pharmacokinetic and clinical study evidence supporting a paradigm shift in aminoglycoside dosing from post dialysis to predialysis.

### Gentamicin [^116rkPgj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with serious systemic infections and renal impairment, it may be desirable to administer the antibiotic more frequently but in reduced dosage. In such patients, serum concentrations of gentamicin should be measured so that adequate but not excessive levels result.

A peak and trough concentration measured intermittently during therapy will provide optimal guidance for adjusting dosage. After the usual initial dose, a rough guide for determining reduced dosage at eight-hour intervals is to divide the normally recommended dose by the serum creatinine level (Table 1). For example, after an initial dose of 20 mg (2 mg/kg), a child weighing 10 kg with a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/100 mL could be given 10 mg every eight hours (20 ÷ 2). It should be noted that the status of renal function may be changing over the course of the infectious process. It is important to recognize that deteriorating renal function may require a greater reduction in dosage than that specified in the above guidelines for patients with stable renal impairment.

### Influence of hemodialysis on gentamicin pharmacokinetics, removal during hemodialysis, and recommended dosing [^117DqzS1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Aminoglycoside antibiotics are commonly used in chronic kidney disease stage 5 patients. The purpose of this study was to characterize gentamicin pharmacokinetics, dialytic clearance, and removal by hemodialysis and to develop appropriate dosing strategies. Design Setting, Participants, and Measurements: Eight subjects receiving chronic, thrice-weekly hemodialysis with no measurable residual renal function received gentamicin after a hemodialysis session. Blood samples were collected serially, and serum concentrations of gentamicin were determined.

Results

Median (range) systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, and terminal elimination half-life were 3.89 ml/min (2.69–4.81 ml/min), 13.5 L (8.7–17.9 L), and 39.4 h (32.0–53.6 h), respectively. Median (range) dialytic clearance, estimated amount removed, and percent maximum rebound were 103.5 ml/min (87.2–132.7 ml/min), 39.6 mg (19.7–43.9 mg), and 38.7% (0%-71.8%), respectively. Gentamicin dialytic clearance was statistically significantly related to creatinine dialytic clearance (r² = 0.52, P = 0.04), although this relationship is not likely to be strong enough to serve as a surrogate for gentamicin monitoring. The pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate gentamicin serum concentrations over a one-wk period.

Conclusions

In clinical situations where gentamicin is used as the primary therapy in a patient receiving hemodialysis with a CAHP hemodialyzer, conventional doses after each dialysis session are not as efficient at achieving treatment targets as predialysis dosing with larger doses.

### Gentamicin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during short-daily hemodialysis [^114HvqNt]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Gentamicin pharmacokinetics have not been described in patients undergoing short-daily hemodialysis (SDHD). The aim of this study is to describe gentamicin pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance (Cl(dial)) in SDHD patients and simulate gentamicin exposure after six dosing regimens to help guide future dosing.

Methods

Six anuric patients undergoing SDHD were enrolled. Patients received intravenous infusion of 2 mg/kg gentamicin on day 1 after the first HD session followed by HD sessions on days 2, 3, and 4. Blood samples for determination of gentamicin concentrations were serially collected. Gentamicin pharmacokinetic parameters and Cl(dial) and interindividual variability terms (IIV) were estimated using NONMEM VII. Influence of patient weight on systemic clearance (Cl(s)) and central volume of distribution (V(c)) and influence of urea removal estimates on Cl(dial) were assessed. The model was used to simulate gentamicin concentrations after six dosing regimens including pre- and postdialysis as well as daily and every-other-day dosing.

Results

A two-compartment model with first-order elimination from central compartment described gentamicin pharmacokinetics. Population estimates for Cl(s) and Cl(dial) were 7.6 and 134 ml/min, respectively. Patient weight was statistically significantly associated with Cl(s) and V(c). Predialysis every-other-day regimens were as effective (C(max) ≥ 8 mg/l and AUC(48 h) ≥ 140 mg·h/l) and less toxic (C(min) < 2 mg/l and AUC(48 h) < 240 mg·h/l) than postdialysis regimens.

Conclusions

Estimated gentamicin Cl(dial) is higher than previous estimates with thrice-weekly regimens. Predialysis every-other-day dosing may be recommended during SDHD.

### We give aminoglycoside antibiotics at the end of hemodialysis [^1129Ypgd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

We often administer dialyzable medications after dialysis to ensure that adequate concentrations are maintained in the body until the next session. In the case of aminoglycosides, we may have the opportunity to dose more aggressively predialysis, and then use the clearance of the drug by dialysis to limit toxicities. Predialysis aminoglycoside dosing is intriguing, although studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of this approach are necessary before it can be used routinely.

### Clinical experience with aminoglycosides in dialysis-dependent patients: risk factors for mortality and reassessment of current dosing practices [^114dCVVP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A resurgence of aminoglycoside use has followed the recent increase of multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens and is often needed even in the treatment of dialysis-dependent patients; however, studies evaluating the treatment of gram-negative infections with aminoglycosides, including the optimal dose, in the setting of dialysis are limited.

Objective

To evaluate the current patterns of aminoglycoside use, including microbiologic and clinical indications, and identify risk factors associated with mortality in dialysis-dependent patients receiving aminoglycosides.

Methods

Utilization, clinical, and microbiologic data were collected retrospectively over a 2-year period (July 2008-June 2010) for adults with a diagnosis of renal failure requiring dialysis and aminoglycoside therapy. Binary logistic and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for all-cause 30-day mortality.

Results

Ninety-five consecutive aminoglycoside courses in 88 patients met inclusion criteria for evaluation. A wide variety of clinical and microbiologic indications were documented. The average duration of aminoglycoside therapy was 5.2 days (range 1–42), the average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 13.5 days (1–60), and the all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 36.5%. Factors associated with all-cause 30-day mortality were gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia (OR 28.6; p = 0.035), advanced age (OR 8.5; p = 0.030), recent admission (OR 33.4; p = 0.038), and inadequate empiric therapy (OR 14.9; p = 0.024). Intravenous catheter removal was protective of all-cause 30-day mortality (OR 0.01; p = 0.005). A first pre-dialysis plasma concentration relative to the minimum inhibitory concentration (Cp:MIC) < 6 mg/L (gentamicin/tobramycin) was associated with an increased risk of mortality (p = 0.026) upon subgroup analysis of dialysis-dependent patients with GNR bloodstream infections.

Conclusions

Outcomes among dialysis-dependent patients who received aminoglycosides were below expectations. Various risk factors for mortality were identified, including retention of the catheter, inadequate empiric therapy, and a Cp:MIC < 6 mg/L. Improved approaches to dosing of aminoglycosides in dialysis-dependent patients, including more aggressive dosing practices, should be urgently explored in attempts to maximize favorable patient outcomes.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^113zRAAy]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are preferentially delivered via the peritoneal route to treat peritonitis, a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), so that maximal concentrations are delivered at the site of infection. However, drugs administered intraperitoneally can be absorbed into the systemic circulation. Drugs excreted by the kidneys accumulate in PD patients, increasing the risk of toxicity. The aim of this study is to examine a model of gentamicin pharmacokinetics and to develop an intraperitoneal drug dosing regime that maximises bacterial killing and minimises toxicity.

Methods/Design

This is an observational pharmacokinetic study of consecutive PD patients presenting to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital with PD peritonitis and who meet the inclusion criteria. Participants will be allocated to either group 1, if anuric as defined by urine output less than 100 ml/day, or group 2: if non-anuric, as defined by urine output more than 100 ml/day. Recruitment will be limited to 15 participants in each group. Gentamicin dosing will be based on the present Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital guidelines, which reflect the current International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis Treatment Recommendations. The primary endpoint is to describe the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin administered intraperitoneally in PD patients with peritonitis based on serial blood and dialysate drug levels.

Discussion

The study will develop improved dosing recommendations for intraperitoneally administered gentamicin in PD patients with peritonitis. This will guide clinicians and pharmacists in selecting the most appropriate dosing regime of intraperitoneal gentamicin to treat peritonitis.

### Administration of tobramycin in the beginning of the hemodialysis session: a novel intradialytic dosing regimen [^116doChQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Aminoglycoside antibiotic efficacy is related to peak concentration (C(max)) and postantibiotic effect, whereas toxicity is directly related to body exposure as measured by area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC). On the basis of pharmacokinetic simulation models, tobramycin administration during the first 30 min of high-flux hemodialysis achieves similar C(max) but significantly lower AUC and prehemodialysis concentrations compared with conventional dosing in the last 30 min of hemodialysis.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements

To test this hypothesis, a pilot study in which five adult chronic hemodialysis patients who were undergoing high-flux dialysis received one dose of tobramycin 1.5 mg/kg intravenously during the first or last 30 min of hemodialysis was conducted. After a 1-mo washout period, patients crossed over to the other treatment schedule. Tobramycin serum concentrations were measured to determine C(max), interdialytic and intradialytic elimination rate constants and half-lives, AUC, and clearance.

Results

Tobramycin administration during the first and last 30 min of hemodialysis resulted in similar C(max) of 5.63 ± 0.49 and 5.83 ± 0.67 mg/L (P > 0.05) but significantly lower prehemodialysis concentrations of 0.16 ± 0.09 and 2.44 ± 0.43 mg/L (P < 0.001) and AUC of 21.06 and 179.23 ± 25.84 mg/h per L (P < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

Tobramycin administration during the first 30 min of hemodialysis results in similar C(max) but lower AUC to conventional dosing, which may translate into comparable efficacy but lower toxicity.

### Aminoglycosides in critically ill septic patients with acute kidney injury receiving intermittent hemodialysis: a multicenter, observational study [^111h1Qbe]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Data on aminoglycoside stewardship in critically ill septic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) needing intermittent hemodialysis (IH) are scarce. The first objective of the study was to evaluate whether aminoglycoside administration occurs before vs after IH in the real-life management of critically ill septic patients with AKI needing IH. The second objective was to assess the delay in achieving a potential reinjection window for a second dose of aminoglycoside, which should be obtained with a postdialysis vs predialysis regimen.

Methods

A post hoc observational analysis of a multicenter randomized trial of critically ill patients with AKI needing renal replacement therapy was conducted. Inclusion criteria consisted of any patients receiving IH for AKI during an antimicrobial therapy for a septic episode.

Findings

Among 206 of 341 septic patients (60%) receiving aminoglycosides, 90 underwent IH (46 with previous continuous renal replacement therapy and 44 without). Amikacin and gentamicin were administered for a mean (SD) of 2.2 (1.5) and 2.5 (2.1) days with mean (SD) doses of 20.6 (6.6) and 5.4 (2.5) mg/kg, respectively. In the 44 patients undergoing exclusive IH, aminoglycosides were administered in a predialysis in 53% of episodes versus 35% in a postdialysis schedule. The first C min target was obtained earlier with a predialysis vs postdialysis schedule (33.9 [14.2] hours vs 50.9 [12.2] hours, P = 0.009).

Implications

Despite being less frequently used than a predialysis schedule, the postdialysis administration of aminoglycosides remains a regular practice in the intensive care unit. A predialysis schedule of administration in IH reduces the interval time to tolerable aminoglycoside redosing.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^114Fny5H]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is a major complication of PD and is one of the main reasons why patients are transferred to haemodialysis. Antibiotics used to treat peritonitis may be delivered via the intraperitoneal (IP), intravenous (IV) or oral routes. In most cases of PD related peritonitis, the infection is localised to the peritoneum and cells lining the peritoneal cavity. The IP route of antibiotic administration is preferred because it ensures antibiotic concentrations at the local site/s of the infection are maximised. However, drugs administered intraperitoneally may still be absorbed into the systemic circulation potentially leading to toxicity. Peritonitis may also alter the permeability of the peritoneal membrane with an inflamed peritoneal membrane allowing increased absorption of drugs from the peritoneal cavity into the blood stream.

Most studies in this area have concentrated on the effectiveness and outcomes of IP antibiotic therapy in PD related peritonitis. Only a few small studies have reported the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics delivered via the IP route. Most were conducted in volunteer PD patients without peritonitis. The absorption and clearance of drugs administered intraperitoneally are not well described, particularly in pathological states such as inflammation and infection. Poor or absent renal excretion adds complexity to the pharmacodynamics when drugs that reach the systemic circulation and are excreted by the kidneys, such as gentamicin, are used.

Gentamicin belongs to the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics and provides excellent coverage against Gram-negative bacteria. However, high blood levels are associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. In the past, gentamicin was not recommended for use in PD patients with residual renal function due to the risk of causing it to further decline. A recent study has shown that the short term use of aminoglycosides is safe and does not compromise residual renal function. This is reflected in the current International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) Guidelines/Recommendation for Peritoneal Dialysis-Related Infections published in 2005 where gentamicin is listed as one of the drug options for gram negative empirical antibiotic cover. The recommended dose for intraperitoneal gentamicin in anuric patients is 0.6 mg/kg in a single dialysis bag administered once daily and allowed to dwell for at least six-hours.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^114UQ1Zw]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides display concentration dependent bacterial killing meaning maximal bacterial killing requires high peak drug concentrations and also have a prolonged post-antibiotic effect (PAE) where bacterial growth continues to be inhibited even when the drug concentrations fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration. Both the concentration dependent killing and the PAE justify the recommendations for once-daily gentamicin dosing. IP antibiotic dosing according to current guidelines gives rise to high gentamicin concentrations in the peritoneal cavity for at least six-hours, which increases the likelihood of systemic absorption and subsequent toxicity without additional antibacterial effect.

A gentamicin trough concentration of < 2 mg/L is usually recommended because early studies reported an increased risk of toxicity with higher concentrations. A recent retrospective study from the UK found that the current ISPD dosing guidelines for IP gentamicin resulted in high trough plasma concentrations in over 50% of patients. High plasma concentrations of gentamicin can not be rapidly removed by renal excretion in patients requiring PD increasing the risk of toxicity. Monitoring of gentamicin plasma concentrations in patients with renal impairment is useful in avoiding drug accumulation and minimising the possible toxicities of the drug, including loss of residual renal function.

This pharmacokinetic study of gentamicin was designed to develop improved dosing guidelines to achieve optimal bacterial kill, based on the performance of drug delivered intraperitoneally to a population with poor or no renal function.

Aims

To describe the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin administered intraperitoneally in PD patients with peritonitis using a population pharmacokinetic model; and To test this pharmacokinetic model by computerised dosing simulations and subsequently develop dosing recommendations for IP gentamicin to optimise antibiotic efficacy and minimise toxicity.

### Aminoglycosides in intermittent hemodialysis: pharmacokinetics with individual dosing [^114wWgDn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Data are limited on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetic differences between acute renal failure (ARF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) or infection survival when maintaining peak and pre-hemodialysis serum concentrations between 7 and 10 and 3.5 and 5 mg/L, respectively.

Objective

To report aminoglycoside pharmacokinetic observations in a consecutive series of patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), including treatment impact of patient-specific dosing regimens.

Methods

In this prospective study, all calculated pharmacokinetic parameters used concentrations drawn more than 12 hours after the initial dose and peak concentrations at least 2 hours after the dose. Analysis included pharmacokinetic parameters in stage 5 CKD, ARF, impact of the dialysis prescription, and treatment results of individualized dosing regimens lasting more than 4 days.

Results

Consecutive patients with IHD (N = 167) receiving 216 courses of aminoglycosides were evaluated. The mean ± SD volume of distribution was 0.39 ± 0.15 L/kg ideal body weight, and elimination half-life during dialysis was 4.2 ± 2.3 hours. The elimination half-life off IHD was 30% shorter in ARF (31.9 ± 20.8 h) versus 45.7 ± 24.2 hours in CKD (p < 0.001). Mean extrapolated peak concentrations and pre-IHD levels were 7.7 ± 1.6 and 3.9 ± 1.2 mg/L, respectively. A 91% treatment success rate was observed in 117 individualized treatment courses in 100 patients receiving greater than or equal to 5 days of aminoglycoside therapy.

Conclusions

A large variability in aminoglycoside pharmacokinetic parameters in IHD exists, with aminoglycoside elimination off IHD significantly faster in ARF. Individualized regimens using serum concentrations drawn in patients requiring treatment (non-synergistic) targeting peak concentrations of 7–10 mg/L and pre-hemodialysis serum concentrations of 3.5–5 mg/L appears successful for eradicating infections.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^116Cknqs]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Multiple factors influence the absorption and clearance of IP antibiotics in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis. These include individual patient related variables like membrane transport characteristics and residual renal function, drug related factors such as the physicochemical properties of the drug itself and factors relating to the dialysis modality such as dialysate dwell time and the number of exchanges. The pharmacokinetic model that will be developed from this study will incorporate these factors and the information will be used to conduct dosing simulations of different antibiotic doses with different dwell times to determine the most effective dosing regimen for gentamicin delivered intraperitoneally. Optimised IP gentamicin dosing can shift the balance of our therapeutic interventions to maintain good clinical outcomes and lesser toxicity in this high risk patient population.

### Clinical pharmacology of antibiotics [^1141TDaw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial pharmacology and its effect on prescribing is quite complex. Selecting an antibiotic that will optimally treat an infection while minimizing adverse effects and the development of resistance is only the first step, as one must also consider the patient's individual pharmacokinetic alterations and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug when prescribing it as well. Patients with CKD may have alterations in their protein binding, volumes of distribution, kidney clearance, and nonrenal clearance that necessitates antibiotic dose adjustments to prevent the development of toxicity. Knowledge of a drug's pharmacodynamics, defined as the relationship between drug exposure and antibacterial efficacy, provides some guidance regarding the optimal way to make dose adjustments. Different pharmacodynamic goals, such as maximizing the time that free (unbound) drug concentrations spend above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for time dependent drugs (e.g., β -lactams) or maximizing the free peak-to-MIC ratio for concentration-dependent antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides), require different adjustment strategies; for instance, decreasing the dose while maintaining normal dosing frequency or giving normal (or even larger) doses less frequently, respectively. Patients receiving hemodialysis have other important prescribing considerations as well. The nephrologist or patient may prefer to receive antibiotics that can be administered intravenously toward the end of a dialysis session. Additionally, newer dialysis technologies and filters can increase drug removal more than originally reported. This review will discuss the place in therapy, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other pharmacologic considerations encountered when prescribing commonly used antibiotics in patients with chronic kidney disease or ESKD.

Data collection

Additional data will be obtained by history from the participant or extracted from the clinical notes. These include:

1. Participant information - age, gender, weight, height, allergies, cause of kidney disease, co-morbidities

2. Microbiology results - Gram stain, culture and antimicrobial sensitivities of dialysate fluid at admission to hospital

3. Laboratory investigations - full blood count, electrolytes, coagulation profile, liver function test and C-reactive protein at admission to hospital as part of usual care.

4. Date of start of this period of peritoneal dialysis

5. Previous dialysis history

6. Other antibiotics prescribed concomitantly

7. Other drugs prescribed concomitantly

8. Details of gentamicin therapy, including dosing regime and duration

9. Length of stay in hospital

10. Outcome of treatment (clinical and/or bacteriological success) will be described using the definitions listed in Table 1

11. Renal function assessments -urine output measurement, 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance

Statistical considerations

A sample size calculation including a power calculation is not required as this study is a non-interventional study and is not intended to compare between different treatments or interventions. The purpose of the study is to identify significant covariates that describe the variability in gentamicin pharmacokinetics in peritoneal dialysis participants. A sample size of 30 is sufficient for this population pharmacokinetic study to identify most clinically significant covariates. In general, population pharmacokinetic studies have fewer statistical design restrictions.

Data analysis

The results of sample analysis will be entered into the pharmacokinetic computer software program NONMEM (GloboMax LLC, Hanover, MD, USA) to develop a model for gentamicin dosing via the intraperitoneal route. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, including anuria, will be tested in the model. The model will simulate gentamicin pharmacokinetics for different dosing schedules to predict the best dosing recommendations for intraperitoneal gentamicin in peritoneal dialysis participants with peritonitis.

Ethical Considerations

The Human Research and Ethics Committee of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (HREC/08/QRBW/8) and the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University of Queensland (2009000673) have approved this study.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^117NqD5c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The recommended dosage for IM and IV administration is identical.

Gentamicin injection should not be physically premixed with other drugs, but should be administered separately in accordance with the recommended route of administration and dosage schedule.

PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION

Dosage must be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function to assure therapeutically adequate, but not excessive blood levels. Whenever possible serum concentration of gentamicin should be monitored. One method of dosage adjustment is to increase the interval between administration of the usual doses. Since the serum creatinine concentration has a high correlation with the serum half-life of gentamicin, this laboratory test may provide guidance for adjustment of the interval between doses. The interval between doses (in hours) may be approximated by multiplying the serum creatinine level (mg/100 mL) by 8. For example, a patient weighing 60 kg with a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/100 mL could be given 60 mg (1 mg/kg) every 16 hours (2 x 8).

In patients with serious systemic infections and renal impairment, it may be desirable to administer the antibiotic more frequently but in reduced dosage. In such patients, serum concentrations of gentamicin should be measured so that adequate but not excessive levels result. A peak and trough concentration measured intermittently during therapy will provide optimal guidance for adjusting dosage. After the usual initial dose, a rough guide for determining reduced dosage at eight-hour intervals is to divide the normally recommended dose by the serum creatinine level (Table II). For example, after an initial dose of 60 mg (1 mg/kg), a patient weighing 60 kg with a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/100 mL could be given 30 mg every eight hours (60 ÷ 2). It should be noted that the status of renal function may be changing over the course of the infectious process.

### Aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy [^1145T8ou]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are few studies describing aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Objective

To characterize the effect of CRRT on aminoglycoside clearance and volume of distribution (Vd).

Methods

Retrospective observational pharmacokinetic study of adult critically ill oncologic patients who received a first dose of amikacin or tobramycin during CRRT between February 2012 and May 2017. Study outcomes included aminoglycoside clearance, Vd, and attainment of the target peak: MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) ratio as a surrogate for dosing appropriateness.

Results

In total, 80 patients were included, sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED), n = 49; continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD), n = 19; continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), n = 12. Fifty-one patients received amikacin at a median dose of 14.5 mg/kg per actual body weight and achieved a median peak level of 26.7 mg/L. Twenty-nine patients received tobramycin at a median dose of 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight and achieved a median peak level of 10.3 mg/L. The median aminoglycoside clearance was 63.1 mL/min and was similar between CRRT modality groups (P = 0.97). The median Vd was 0.47 L/kg and was different between the SLED and CVVH groups (P = 0.007). Attainment of target peak: MIC occurred in 29% in the total study population and 44% in the subgroup of 23 patients with isolates tested for aminoglycoside susceptibility.

Conclusion and Relevance

Critically ill oncology patients undergoing CRRT exhibited reduced clearance and expanded Vd that was not significantly different between CRRT modalities. Current dosing regimens led to low peak concentrations and poor attainment of pharmacokinetic targets.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^115hJYig]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Drug dosing

Drug dosing will be based on the current International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Guidelines/Recommendations for Peritoneal Dialysis-Related Infections (2005). The dose administered will depend on whether the participant is anuric or non-anuric.

Anuric participants

0.6 mg/kg gentamicin in a single two-litre PD bag administered intraperitoneally once daily and allowed to dwell for at least six-hours

Non-anuric participants

For this group of patients with residual renal function, the dose of gentamicin will be increased by 25% - 0.75 mg/kg for at least a six-hour dwell.

Sample collection

All participants will have blood sampling on two separate days (day one and another day between day two and five of treatment). A cannula will be placed for serial plasma sampling and PD fluid will be collected as follows:

Sample collection on day one of treatment

Plasma samples (5 mL each) taken at one hour, three hours, six hours, seven hours and 24 hours after the start of draining in the first dialysate bag containing gentamicin.

PD fluid samples (5 ml) will also be collected at three hours and at the end of the dwell time at six hours.

Sample collection on one day between day two and five of treatment

Five millilitres of blood will be taken just prior to draining in the dialysate with gentamicin to measure the true 'trough' gentamicin levels. A further 5 mls of blood will be collected at one hour, three hours, six hours, seven hours and 24 hours after the administration of the bag with IP gentamicin. Five millilitres of PD fluid will also be collected prior to administration of next bag of gentamicin, at three hours and at the end of the dwell time. For each dose of IP gentamicin administered, the type and volume of dialysate and inflow rate of the dialysate loaded with drug will be recorded. A 5 mL sample from the preceding 24-hour urine collection will be collected to measure the concentration of gentamicin excreted in urine. Ten millilitre samples of PD fluid from each drained bag will also be obtained before the dialysis effluent is discarded.

Sample handling and storage

Blood samples will be placed on ice and centrifuged at 3000 rpm before being stored at -80°C until analysis. Dialysate and urine samples will be stored at -80°C until analysis.

Sample analysis

The Burns Trauma and Critical Care Research Centre of The University of Queensland will measure gentamicin levels in plasma and dialysate using validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analytical assays.

### Gentamicin pharmacokinetics during slow daily home hemodialysis [^113oC548]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Gentamicin is commonly used in hemodialysis patients. Gentamicin pharmacokinetics during traditional hemodialysis have been described. Slow daily home (SDH) hemodialysis (7 to 9 hours a day/6 days a week) use is increasing due to benefits observed with increased hemodialysis. We determined gentamicin pharmacokinetics for SDH hemodialysis patients.

Methods

Eight patients (four male and four female) received a single intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/kg gentamicin post-hemodialysis. Blood samples were collected at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after dose. The next day patients underwent a typical SDH hemodialysis (high-flux F50NR dialyzer) session. Blood samples were taken at 0, 5, 15, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480 minutes during and 15, 30 and 60 minutes post-hemodialysis. Baseline and 24-hour urine samples were collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated assuming a one-compartment model.

Results

Patients were 42.5 ± 13.1 years old (mean ± SD). Inter-, intra-, and post-hemodialysis collection periods were 17.0 ± 2.1 hours, 8.1 ± 0.4 hours, and 1.1 ± 0.1 hours, respectively. Intra-, and interdialytic gentamicin half-lives were different (intradialytic, 3.7 ± 0.8 hours; interdialytic, 20.4 ± 4.7 hours; P < 0.0001). Hemodialysis clearance accounted for 70.5% gentamicin total clearance. Renal clearance correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (renal clearance = 1.2 GFR; r² = 0.98; P < 0.001). Mean peak and trough of hemodialysis concentrations were 1.8 ± 0.6 microg/mL and 0.5 ± 0.2 microg/mL, respectively. Post-hemodialysis rebound was 3.1 ± 8.8% at 1 hour.

Conclusion

Pharmacokinetic model predicts 2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg dose gentamicin post-hemodialysis would provide peak (1 hour post-dose) and trough (end of SDH hemodialysis session) concentrations of 6.0 to 7.5 microg/mL and 0.7 to 0.8 microg/mL, respectively. This would provide adequate coverage for most gram-negative organisms in SDH hemodialysis patients.

### Aminoglycosides in critically ill septic patients with acute kidney injury receiving continuous renal replacement therapy: a multicenter, observational study [^113hQPCq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Data on aminoglycoside stewardship in critically ill septic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) needing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are scarce. The objectives of the study were to determine, during CRRT, the time window with low likelihood for safe reinjection and the proportion of inappropriate reinjection.

Methods

A post hoc observational analysis of a multicenter randomized trial comparing the risk of hemodialysis catheter infection with ethanol lock vs placebo in critically ill patients with AKI was conducted. Eligible patients were adults in intensive care units from 6 French hospitals. Any patient with AKI needing CRRT and receiving an antimicrobial therapy for a septic episode occurring before (≤ 24 hours) or during CRRT was included. The aminoglycoside orders were left to the physicians' discretion, but high dose once daily was the schedule of aminoglycoside administration.

Findings

A total of 145 septic episodes treated by aminoglycosides were analyzed in patients receiving CRRT. A mean (SD) of 1.6 (0.8) amikacin and 1.8 (1.2) gentamicin administrations per patient were observed. During CRRT, C max was 17.3 mg/L (interquartile range, 13.2–22.5 mg/L) for gentamicin and 50 mg/L (interquartile range, 43.7–76.6 mg/L) for amikacin. The plasma drug concentration at 24 hours (C H24) was 2.3 mg/L (interquartile range, 1.6–3.2 mg/L) for gentamicin and 9.3 (interquartile range, 6.6–12.0 mg/L) for amikacin. Sixty-five C min dosages remained above the reinjection threshold. Inappropriate reinjection was observed in 11 of 65 episodes (17%). Inappropriate reinjection (defined by, at the reinjection time, C min dosages above the threshold; ie, C min > 2 mg/L for gentamicin and > 5 mg/L for amikacin) was observed in 17% of analyzed episodes. Most patients did not need reinjection until approximately ≥ 30 hours after their initial administration.

Implications

During CRRT, as indicated by the C H24 value, which was higher than the recommended threshold, the interval to obtain a C min low enough to allow for redosing aminoglycosides is significantly longer than 24 hours. This interval is not always respected and leads to an of inappropriate reinjection rate of 17%. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ISRCTNCT00875069.

### Determination of vancomycin and gentamicin clearance in an in vitro, closed loop dialysis system [^113TFA58]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacokinetics are significantly altered during hemodialysis and require directed studies in this setting in order to guide drug dosing. These clinical studies provide valuable information but are limited since dialysis variables (flow rates, filter selection, time on dialysis) may or may not be standardized. Studies can be designed using one regimen with standardized blood flow rates (BFR) and dialysate flow rates (DFR), similar hemodialysis filters and similar convective (ultrafiltration) flow rates (UFR). While this type of design reduces variability and is desirable in a small sample size, it may confine application of the results to that stated hemodialysis prescription and thus the determined pharmacokinetic parameters. Studies that do not standardize the dialysis prescription lack clarity on the potential influence of those variables on drug clearance. A more comprehensive study to evaluate the impact of a change in one or more of these parameters is desirable but challenging to conduct in an in vivo design. However, these studies may be feasible in a simulated model of hemodialysis. While in vitro models of dialysis have been used to predict drug clearance, most have investigated the influence of changing just one variable such as the dialyzer.

This study was aimed at characterizing the clearance of vancomycin and gentamicin and the influence of changes in 3 variables (BFR, DFR and hemodialysis filters) on clearance in a closed loop in vitro dialysis system. It is hypothesized that the clearance of vancomycin and gentamicin will increase with increasing flow rates and more efficient hemodialysis filters.

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of overdose or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, and is especially important if renal function is, or becomes, compromised. The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably less by peritoneal dialysis than it is by hemodialysis. In the newborn infant, exchange transfusions may also be considered.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^115mBRpX]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus endocarditis — aminoglycoside use and dosing: Approximately 97% of cases of enterococcal IE are caused by E faecalis, and in older, comorbid patients gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity may complicate a "standard" 4- to 6-week course; in some situations the potential risk of attempting to complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy may exceed the benefit. Human studies used dosing intervals ranging from once daily to 3 times daily, and the data were insufficient to compare the efficacy of once-daily with divided doses; until more convincing data demonstrate once-daily dosing is as effective, in patients with normal renal function, gentamicin should be administered in daily multiple divided doses (total, ≈3 mg·kg−1·d−1). In patients with normal renal function, it is reasonable to administer gentamicin every 8 hours with the dose adjusted to achieve a 1-hour serum concentration of ≈3 μg/mL and a trough concentration of < 1 μg/mL; increasing the dose did not enhance efficacy but did increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

In adults with renal impairment, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage (Table 2) may be used as a guide.

When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Males: Weight (kg) x (140 - age)

72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)

Females: 0.85 x above value

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis, and the maintenance dose should be given as indicated in Table 2.

2.4 Preparation and Administration of Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in DUPLEX® Container

Important Administration Instructions

- This reconstituted solution is for intravenous use only.

- Administer Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.

- Do not use in series connections. Such use would result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result.

- Do not introduce additives into the DUPLEX® Container.

- Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection may be administered through the tubing system by which the patient may be receiving other intravenous solutions. However, during infusion of the solution containing Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, it is advisable to temporarily discontinue administration of any other solutions at the same site.

- Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, like most beta-lactam antibiotics, should not be added to aminoglycoside solutions (e.g., gentamicin sulfate, tobramycin sulfate, amikacin sulfate) because of potential interaction. However, Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection and aminoglycosides may be administered separately to the same patient.

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of overdosage or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised. The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably lower by peritoneal dialysis than it is by hemodialysis.

### Gentamicin [^1145zwag]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. When monitoring gentamicin peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided.

When monitoring gentamicin trough concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Excessive peak and/or trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides may increase the risk of renal and eighth cranial nerve toxicity. In the event of overdose or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised. The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably less by peritoneal dialysis than by hemodialysis.

In the newborn infant, exchange transfusions may also be considered.

Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin, cephaloridine, kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin, and viomycin, should be avoided. Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.

The concurrent use of gentamicin with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide, should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity. In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering the antibiotic concentration in serum and tissue.

Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see WARNINGS section).

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [^115DwQm4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a cornerstone antibiotic for the treatment of severe gram-positive infections in dialysis patients for decades. Whereas subtherapeutic vancomycin levels convey a risk of treatment failure and the further emergence of resistance in staphylococci, supratherapeutic vancomycin levels are associated with a dose-related incremental risk for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Consequently, a narrow therapeutic range with a trough-level target between 15 and 20 μg/ml is recommended. Vancomycin dosing in hemodialysis patients is mainly influenced by the timing of administration (during or after dialysis), the type of filter used, and the duration of dialysis. Actual body weight, the interdialytic interval, and residual renal function are also considerations. As in patients with normal kidney function, a weight-based loading dose of 20–25 mg/kg should be used in dialysis patients. While most fixed-dose maintenance regimens fail to reach target levels in the majority of hemodialysis patients, straightforward evidence on optimal maintenance dosing is lacking.

### Antibiotic dosing in critically ill adult patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112hKzTu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is now commonly used as a means of support for critically ill patients with renal failure. No recent comprehensive guidelines exist that provide antibiotic dosing recommendations for adult patients receiving CRRT. Doses used in intermittent hemodialysis cannot be directly applied to these patients, and antibiotic pharmacokinetics are different than those in patients with normal renal function. We reviewed the literature for studies involving the following antibiotics frequently used to treat critically ill adult patients receiving CRRT: vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, nafcillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, colistin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B (deoxycholate and lipid formulations), and acyclovir. We used these data, as well as clinical experience, to make recommendations for antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients receiving CRRT.

Design

When considering the underlying cause of this problem, it became clear that the calculations involved for calculating gentamicin accurately were too complex in the busy environment that healthcare professionals work in. The reliance of mentally calculating the dose had to be overcome. The most obvious way was to automate the calculations and to generate the correct dose based on the inputting of certain parameters. A gentamicin calculator was developed which allowed users to input a patient's height, weight, age, creatinine and gender, which would then give a result by pressing a 'dose' button.

### Pharmacodynamics and dosing of aminoglycosides [^112EgchN]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides are concentration-dependent killing agents whose pharmacodynamic predictors of efficacy are the area-under-the-curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio and the peak to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio. Prospective studies have shown that these agents can be given once-daily or less frequently in most clinical settings, with equal efficacy and possible reduced toxicity. Dosages for different clinical settings have been studied and methods are available to monitor once-daily dosing.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^116C4SFg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Gentamicin injection may be given IM or IV. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body mass. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term.

PATIENTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION

Adults

The recommended dosage of gentamicin injection for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours (Table I).

For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. This dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (Table I).

It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after IM injection) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after IM or IV administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection and the status of the patient's host-defense mechanisms.

Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.

The concurrent use of gentamicin with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide, should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Nephrotoxicity - Adverse renal effects, as demonstrated by the presence of casts, cells, or protein in the urine or by rising BUN, NPN, serum creatinine and oliguria, have been reported. They occur more frequently in patients with a history of renal impairment and in patients treated for longer periods or with larger dosages than recommended.

Neurotoxicity - Serious adverse effects on both vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth cranial nerve have been reported, primarily in patients with renal impairment (especially if hemodialysis is required) and in patients on high doses and/or prolonged therapy. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears and also hearing loss, which, as with the other aminoglycosides, may be irreversible. Hearing loss is usually manifested initially by diminishing high-tone acuity. Other factors which may increase the risk of toxicity include excessive dosage, dehydration and previous exposure to other ototoxic drugs.

Peripheral neuropathy or encephalopathy, including numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, convulsions, and a myasthenia gravis-like syndrome, have been reported.

Note: This risk of toxic reactions is low in patients with normal renal function who do not receive gentamicin sulfate at higher doses or for longer periods of time than recommended.

### Back to the future: using aminoglycosides again and how to dose them optimally [^112yoVVq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Gram-negative organisms have become increasingly resistant to both beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones. Consequently, aminoglycoside antibiotics have undergone a resurgence in use. Because of the known toxicities of aminoglycoside antibiotics, clinicians have avoided their use, unless no other alternatives were extant. Over the past 2 decades, we have learned much about the relationship between aminoglycoside exposure and the likelihood of a good clinical outcome or the occurrence of nephrotoxicity. For example, minimum inhibitory concentration values ≥ 2.0 mg/L lead to unacceptably low probabilities of a good clinical outcome, and infrequent administration of doses (i.e., intervals of 24 h and longer intervals for patients with compromised renal function) plays a central role in minimizing the likelihood of toxicity. Using these new insights, we suggest ways of evaluating the dose and schedule of administration of aminoglycosides in empirical therapy to obtain the highest likelihood of an efficacious and nontoxic therapy.

### Standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of acute kidney injury: a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study [^116jzcKG]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

SOP evaluation for the therapy with vancomycin

Every consecutive day was evaluated for adherence of SOPs. Vancomycin therapy was separately evaluated for continued and intermittent therapy, each with a specific dosing concept based on renal function and pre-existing kidney damage. For vancomycin initiation in adults, a loading dose of 1 g intravenously is recommended. In the continuous dosing regimen this is followed by 2 g over 24 h (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/h with 1 g/24 h, < 20 ml/h with 500 mg/24 h). For intermittent dosing, maintenance doses are recommended with 0.5 g/6 h or 1 g/12 h. Regarding therapeutic drug monitoring in continuous therapy, first measurements are obtained after 24 to 36 h with target levels of 15 to 20 mg/l. In intermittent therapy the trough levels are to be obtained before the fourth application of vancomycin with a target level of 10 to 20 mg/l. During maintenance therapy, SOP conformity required adaptation of dosing regimen according to therapeutic drug monitoring.

SOP evaluation for the therapy with gentamicin and tobramycin

For management of gentamicin and tobramycin therapy, recommendations based on renal function and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were analysed. For initial therapy induction, doses with 3 to 6 mg/Kg body weight in gentamicin and 5 to 7 mg/Kg body weight for tobramycin are used. Maintenance therapy should be adapted to serum trough levels with a 2 mg/l cut off for each agent based on the laboratory reference. The recommendations include adjustment to blood trough levels for the two drugs or dosing adaptation based on elevated serum creatinine levels. Aminoglycosides were administered once daily after achievement of the results of the TDM. Dose adaption was performed according to the results; only if the results were extremely high one dose was omitted. Peak levels have no influence on the dosing and are for this reason not measured regularly.

Calculation of the adherence rate

To calculate adherence rates, each study day on which a patient was treated with either vancomycin, gentamicin or tobramycin was recorded and evaluated as described in detail elsewhere. For combination therapy all related SOPs had to be fulfilled. The binary variable of daily adherence was transferred into a relative variable. Therefore, in each patient the cumulative number of days with SOP conformity was divided by the total number of days with an application of these antibiotics.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^115fhdJY]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Doses of β-lactams

β-Lactams are time-dependent antibiotics. Several studies have shown that β-lactam concentrations are inadequate in patients with sepsis compared with non-critically ill patients when standard dosage regimens are administered, particularly when dealing with difficult-to-treat strains such as P. aeruginosa. To improve PD target attainment, β-lactams can be administered at increased doses, increased frequency, or by an extended or continuous infusion. Among these options, continuous infusions are often used in critically ill patients and have repeatedly been shown to achieve higher steady-state β-lactam concentrations compared with trough concentrations with standard intermittent regimens, although outcome benefits have not been clearly demonstrated. Interestingly, even when given by continuous infusion, β-lactam concentrations can still remain below the MIC for difficult-to-treat pathogens, especially in patients with a high creatinine clearance associated with high renal drug elimination. Importantly, β-lactams have been associated with neurotoxicity and high β-lactam concentrations may be implicated in clinical neurological deterioration. It is important, therefore, to ensure that concentrations remain within therapeutic ranges.

Doses of aminoglycosides

To be active, aminoglycosides need to reach peak concentrations at least eight times higher than the MIC for the strain, while low trough concentrations need to be achieved (high concentrations are associated with toxicity). Due to changes in Vd and renal clearance, the PK of aminoglycosides may be altered in sepsis, especially in septic shock, leading to insufficient peak concentrations. Accordingly, aminoglycoside doses have been revisited. For example, the recommended loading dose of amikacin has been increased from 15 to 25 mg/kg and even these doses may not be high enough in some patients. In a multicenter trial in 80 patients, administration of 25 mg/kg of amikacin allowed adequate peak concentrations to be achieved in only 70% of patients. Similar results were observed in a trial of 146 patients in which the higher the fluid balance the lower the chances of reaching adequate concentrations, highlighting the crucial role of changes in aminoglycoside Vd. Importantly, toxic trough concentrations were uncommon in both trials.

When very high peak concentrations need to be reached, as in patients with MDR pathogens with intermediate susceptibility to aminoglycosides, combination of very high doses of aminoglycosides associated with high-flow (50 ml/kg/min) continuous veno-venous hemofiltration may help achieve adequate peak concentrations while minimizing toxicity and, even more importantly, enable daily administration of the agent (and thus more frequent exposure to its bactericidal effects).

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^11289W4d]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Renal Support

The need for renal support to treat DIKD is low (Table 1). The use of renal replacement therapy for DIKD is two-fold, firstly, dialysis can be utilized to remove the offending drug and minimize ongoing damage; additionally, dialysis can be utilized to support renal function to allow recovery. The decision to start renal replacement therapy is a complex one and generally reserved for severe injuries or cases in which the drug toxicity may be mitigated through removal by dialysis (example: vancomycin, aminoglycosides).

Drug removal by dialysis is dependent on the characteristic of the drug including molecular weight, protein binding, volume of distribution and operational characteristics of the dialysis treatment include type of membrane, blood and dialysate flow rates and duration of therapy.

When starting renal support therapy, it is critical to consider the potential for errors in drug dosing and exposures. Renal clearance is determined by the dialysis prescription for drug dosing. However, in the critically ill population, gaps in dialysis delivery are frequent (e.g. filter clotting, time off treatment for procedures) and current prediction equations do not account for these situations. When possible, TDM should be employed. The decision to stop renal support is challenging and generally based on changes in pre-dialysis Scr values, urine output, fluid status and acidosis. These transitions from AKI with no renal support to dialysis therapies to resolution of injury are time periods with increased susceptibility to drug dosing errors. During recovery, total renal clearance should be estimated by quantifying intrinsic kidney function in addition to the dialysis therapy for drug dosing. Urinary creatinine clearance determination, despite its limitations, may assist in the estimation of intrinsic kidney function. During resolution, drug clearance estimated from TDM may be used in the assessment of kidney function. For example, the clearance of aminoglycosides and vancomycin correlate well with creatinine clearance. Estimation of clearance of these drugs by TDM may assist the clinician in dosing other drugs that are not monitored (e.g. cephalosporins, quinolones).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Gentamicin Sulfate in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is for intravenous use only.

The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body mass. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term.

Patients with Normal Renal Function

Adults: The recommended dosage of Gentamicin Sulfate in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day administered in three equal doses every eight hours (Table 3).

For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (Table 3).

It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes following cessation of infusion) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection, and the status of the patient's host-defense mechanisms.

### Experience with a once-daily dosing program of aminoglycosides in critically ill patients [^116yYUux]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

As aminoglycosides show concentration-dependent killing, once-daily aminoglycoside (ODA) regimens have been instituted. Data on experience with ODA regimens in critically ill patients are limited.

Objectives

1) To evaluate the ODA-program in critically ill patients; 2) to describe the pharmacokinetics of aminoglycosides (gentamicin and tobramycin); and 3) to assess the incidence of nephrotoxicity associated with an ODA regimen in this specific of group patients.

Design

A prospective, descriptive study.

Setting

Eighteen-bed surgical and 12-bed medical intensive care unit in a referral centre.

Patients

Eighty-nine critically ill patients with a suspected or confirmed infection for which gentamicin or tobramycin was indicated and a creatinine clearance > 30 ml/min were monitored. One hundred and nine pharmacokinetic profiles were gathered.

Interventions

A first dose of 7 mg/kg/24 h of gentamicin or tobramycin was given to every patient independent of renal function. Subsequent doses were chosen on the basis of the pharmacokinetic results of the first dose.

Measurements

Serum samples were collected 1 h and 6 h after start of the aminoglycoside infusion. All samples were assayed by using immunofluorescence. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a one-compartment model.

Results

The volume of distribution of aminoglycosides was significantly higher in critical ill patients with septic shock than in those without. Consequently, the maximum concentration reached was significantly lower in patients with septic shock. In P. aeruginosa infections the mean (SD) estimated Cmax/MIC ratio was 10.3 (3.3). In n = 17 (49%) of the patients treated > 24 h (n = 35), a dose adjustment or lengthening of interval was necessary. The recommended dosing interval based on the Hartford Hospital nomogram and one-serum concentration at 6 h was correct in only 62% of all cases. Signs of renal impairment occurred in n = 12 (14%) of the patients; in all survivors renal function recovered completely and no haemofiltration was needed.

Conclusions

An ODA-regimen of 7 mg/kg produced Cmax/MIC ratios > 10 in the majority of critically ill patients in our population. Septic shock and renal dysfunction caused an aberrant pharmacokinetic profile of aminoglycosides in these patients. Therefore, individual therapeutic drug monitoring is warranted. Signs of renal impairment were common in the presence of shock, but appeared to be reversible.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^111PtH3q]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Baseline

For this project fifty patients from the surgical wards who had been prescribed gentamicin had their doses checked. Patients who had been given a prophylactic dose of 80–120mg were not included in the baseline measurement as there was no dependence on height, weight and renal function. For all of the patients, their height, weight, age, gender and serum creatinine at the time of dosing were recorded as well as the dose of gentamicin they were given. The correct gentamicin dose was calculated for each patient and compared with the dose which had been prescribed and dispensed. The results showed that only 30% of patients received the correct dose of gentamicin.

### Comparison of low-dose gentamicin with minocycline as catheter lock solutions in the prevention of catheter-related bacteremia [^112gV1z1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter-restricted antibiotic lock solutions were found to be effective in the prevention of catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), but insufficient data are available about the ideal agent and dose. We hypothesized that a low concentration of gentamicin would be as effective as the high doses studied in the past.

Methods

In this prospective, open-labeled, randomized, clinical trial of patients on long-term hemodialysis therapy, patients were randomly assigned to administration of an antibiotic lock solution of gentamicin/citrate (4 mg/mL), minocycline/EDTA, or the control solution of heparin. Patients were followed up until the study end point of CRB was reached or a censoring event occurred. Interim data analysis was performed after 6 months to assess data safety; efficacy was noted and the study was terminated early.

Results

Sixty-two patients were enrolled into the study, evenly distributed in 3 arms, with data from 1 patient excluded from analysis. Seven of 20 patients in the heparin group (4.0 events/1,000 catheter days), 1 of 21 patients in the minocycline group (0.4 events/1,000 catheter days), and none of 20 patients in the gentamicin group developed bacteremia. Results were statistically significant by using 2-tailed Fisher exact test; heparin versus gentamicin, P = 0.008, and heparin versus minocycline, P = 0.020.

Conclusion

Antibiotic lock solutions are superior to the standard heparin lock alone in the prevention of CRBs, and low-dose gentamicin solution has efficacy similar to that of greater concentrations used in previous studies.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^112FNi87]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Gentamicin is an antibiotic from the class of aminoglcosides. It is used predominantly to treat gram-negative infections, particularly urinary, biliary and abdominal but does have some anti-staphylococcal activity as well. Gentamicin is being used increasingly in clinical care because of its lack of 'diffogenicity' (causing clostridium difficile) but there are a number of problems associated with it. Gentamicin is a potentially nephrotoxic and ototoxic antibiotic if given incorrectly. A patient is given a dose according to their body weight. If they are obese, they are dosed according to a corrected body weight. The patient's renal function will also determine how many mg/kg they will be dosed at. Once a patient is given gentamicin and is due to receive subsequent doses, they must have a level taken 6–14 hours after the initial dose which will demonstrate how well their kidneys are clearing the antibiotic as it is renally excreted. This manner of giving gentamicin is the once-daily extended interval regime which is replacing the traditional method of giving it more than once a day depending on peak and trough levels. It is presumed that this is a safer and more effective way of giving the antibiotic. Calculating the correct dose of gentamicin is dependent upon calculating the patient's ideal body weight, followed by the corrected body weight and finally their creatinine clearance. By not following this protocol significant variation can occur in dosing and subsequent prescription.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^111ByuVG]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Nephrotoxicity

Adverse renal effects, as demonstrated by the presence of casts, cells or protein in the urine or by rising BUN, NPN, serum creatinine or oliguria, have been reported. They occur more frequently in patients with a history of renal impairment (especially if dialysis is required) and in patients treated for longer periods or with larger doses than recommended.

Neurotoxicity

Serious adverse effects on both vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been reported, primarily in patients with renal impairment (especially if hemodialysis is required) and in patients on high doses and/or prolonged therapy. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears and also hearing loss, which, as with the other aminoglycosides, may be irreversible. Hearing loss is usually manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Other factors which may increase the risk of toxicity include excessive dosage, dehydration and previous exposure to other ototoxic drugs.

Peripheral neuropathy or encephalopathy, including numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, convulsions and a myasthenia gravis-like syndrome have been reported.

NOTE: The risk of toxic reactions is low in patients with normal renal function who did not receive gentamicin sulfate at higher doses or for longer periods of time than recommended.

Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to gentamicin include: respiratory depression, lethargy, confusion, depression, visual disturbances, decreased appetite, weight loss and hypotension and hypertension; rash, itching, urticaria, generalized burning, laryngeal edema, anaphylactoid reactions, fever and headache; nausea, vomiting, increased salivation and stomatitis; purpura, pseudotumor cerebri, acute organic brain syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, alopecia, joint pain, transient hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.

Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to gentamicin include: increased levels of serum transaminase (SGOT, SGPT), serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium; anemia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, transient agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, increased and decreased reticulocyte counts and thrombocytopenia. While clinical laboratory test abnormalities may be isolated findings, they may also be associated with clinically related signs and symptoms. For example, tetany and muscle weakness may be associated with hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and hypokalemia.

While the local tolerance of gentamicin sulfate is generally excellent, there has been an occasional report of pain at the injection site. Subcutaneous atrophy or fat necrosis suggesting local irritation has been reported rarely.

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^114AJ6Dr]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk

To evaluate the risk of nephrotoxicity, general questions can be applied to each causal drug. What is the predictable risk based on the known pharmacology of the drug? What is the known risk, contributing risk factors and the typical timeline for injury? If the risks are known, how is this information used clinically to predict the risk for an individual patient (i.e. clinical risk scores for contrast nephropathy)? How is this information used to mitigate the risk?

Drug induced adverse events can be classified into two categories: dose dependent and idiosyncratic reactions. This categorization is important to consider in the context of drug induced kidney disease (DIKD) since the mechanisms for drug toxicity are different posing challenges in risk assessment. Dose dependent reactions are predictable from the known pharmacology of the drug. For example, the risk of aminoglycoside induced nephrotoxicity increases with higher trough drug concentrations and longer duration of therapy. Whereas, interstitial nephritis from proton pump inhibitors is an unpredictable idiosyncratic reaction, which is unlikely to be preventable or minimized.

When assessing the known risk of DIKD, often this information may be in the form of case reports, adverse event reporting from clinical trials or post marketing surveillance. Prospective studies focused on determining the incidence of DIKD are few. Most studies are retrospective and are focused largely on drugs with predictable toxicities and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Determining the incidence of idiosyncratic reactions is difficult since data is often limited to case reports. Some studies attempt to demonstrate an association using claims data and diagnostic codes; however, the incidence of the AKI is variable between cohorts and likely overstated Most importantly, the definition of DIKD has not been standardized, making interpretation of the epidemiology challenging. The information on drug specific DIKD risk is summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
5R Summary by Causal Drug

Risk factors contributing to the development of DIKD include patient specific factors, disease specific factors and process of care factors (Table 1). Common risk factors include age, causal drug single and/or cumulative dose, underlying CKD and concurrent nephrotoxin exposures. In the case of hospitalized patients, our experience is that a retrospective evaluation of DIKD almost always reveals the prescription of additional nephrotoxins concurrent to the causal drug (i.e. ketorolac prescribed to a patient receiving gentamicin and vancomycin). Minimizing these exposures may mitigate the development of DIKD.

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^113QFrAZ]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Response

Treatment of nephrotoxicity is dependent on the phenotype, severity of the injury and the underlying condition for which the medication was prescribed. The decision to stop or reduce the dose of the offending drug requires a careful consideration of the risk versus benefit. In Type A reactions, dose reduction may be sufficient to mitigate the injury (e.g. vancomycin or gentamicin). However, stage 2 AKI often warrants drug discontinuation. In the setting of vancomycin DIKD, a critical appraisal of other therapeutic options and dose minimization is warranted. National guidelines on the use of vancomycin have recommended higher target trough concentrations to obtain a high area under the curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio. However, the level of evidence for this recommendation was grade IIIb (limited evidence). With the widespread adoption of this recommendation, the rate of nephrotoxicity has increased. Meta-analysis conducted found the incidence of nephrotoxicity to be between 5–43% and target trough concentrations > 15 ng/mL to have a 2.67 odds ratio for the development of nephrotoxicity. A more recent study of 1430 patients receiving vancomycin provides support for the association between concentrations and duration of therapy with risk of nephrotoxicity. Post hoc analysis of prospective studies have examined the need for higher targets and demonstrated equivocal or lower cure rates with trough concentrations above 15 ng/mL for the treatment of staphylococcus aureus nosocomial acquired pneumonia. Additionally, these studies have demonstrated that alternative treatments such as linezolid or telavancin could be considered. Based on these studies, we believe that DIKD from higher vancomycin trough concentrations is a real concern. However, prospective studies designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of high therapeutic concentrations need to be done. Type B DIKD, which is idiosyncratic, will require discontinuation of the offending drug and careful observation. Severe injuries or type B reactions often require longer periods of time to improve and may not completely resolve.

### Using a simple handover to improve the timing of gentamicin levels [^113x22jj]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Gentamicin is a renally excreted aminoglycoside antibiotic commonly used to cover gram negative bacterial infections. It is often delivered intravenously within the surgical wards of many NHS trusts to treat intra-abdominal sepsis, upper urinary tract sepsis and sepsis of unknown origin and is thus a key feature of the "Sepsis 6" protocol outlined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. Despite it's effectiveness, gentamicin is known to have severe ototoxic and nephrotoxic properties. These side effects can be exacerbated by a patient's age, renal function, weight, concurrent drug therapies, and certain comorbidities. As a result, gentamicin is typically prescribed as a single daily dose, which is individually calculated according to a patient's age, weight, height, gender and creatinine clearance. In addition, daily serum levels must be taken and the dosing regimen adjusted accordingly, in order to maintain both a both an adequate dose to combat infection and to avoid the onset of potentially severe side effects such as ototoxicity and acute kidney injury.

It has been documented that collection of accurate gentamicin levels can prove difficult in practice, particularly on very busy, high turnover surgical wards. Previous quality projects gave improved the prescription of gentamicin by implementing an online calculator. While our trust already utilises an online calculator for initial prescription, it has become clear that more intervention is needed to provide effective patient care.

Guideline 24 — Gentamicin plus anticoagulant locks for prevention of catheter-related infection (CRI) indicates that the incidence of CRI was lower in the gentamicin/anticoagulant locks compared with heparin locks. Across 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 observational studies, the 4 RCTs enrolled a total of 555 (range, 41–303) participants, with follow-up in total CVC days ranging from less than 3,300 in 2 trials to approximately 18,000 in 1 trial, and nearly 40,000 in 1 trial; two trials were conducted in the United Kingdom, 1 in the United States, and 1 in China. Regimens included gentamicin 4 or 5 mg/mL in either 3% citrate or heparin only (5,000–5,500 U/mL) locks compared to heparin (5,000–5,500 U/mL) locks, and one trial (n = 303) used lower-concentration gentamicin 320 μg/mL in 4% citrate versus heparin 1,000 U/mL. Overall, the 4 RCTs showed a significant reduction in the incidence of CRBSI in the gentamicin/anticoagulant group versus the heparin group (RR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.07–0.46), with no significant differences in exit site infections; harms were sporadically reported and events were few.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^1111SA9k]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Dosing during extracorporeal therapies

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) can be delivered by diffusion (hemodialysis), convection (hemofiltration), or a combination of both (hemodiafiltration). It may be delivered continuously (CRRT) or intermittently. There are several papers on drug dosing during CRRT, but very few in critically ill patients receiving intermittent RRT. A specific issue for intermittent RRT is the inconsistent drug clearance likely to occur during a 24-hour period. Such inconsistent clearance is highly problematic for time-dependent antibiotics where unadjusted dosing in the presence of high drug clearance that alternates with no drug clearance will result in potentially very low and very high concentrations over the course of the day exposing the patient to risks of clinical failure and toxicity.

Drugs that are hydrophilic and usually subject to renal clearance are commonly cleared by dialysis. Large molecules (> 1000 Da), like vancomycin, are poorly cleared by hemodialysis, although the availability of high-flux filters has increased the clearance of these drugs somewhat. Smaller molecules, like the β-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics, are largely cleared by hemodialysis, although this clearance is typically lower than with normal renal function. Protein binding has important effects on drug clearance with highly protein-bound drugs, like teicoplanin, oxacillin and ceftriaxone, having low dialysis clearance because the protein-bound fraction cannot be cleared. Finally, for antibiotics with a larger Vd there is typically less antibiotic in the vascular compartment and so less is available for clearance. This is seen with the quinolones, which have a comparatively larger Vd than the β-lactams or aminoglycosides.

In the absence of clinical PK and dosing data for hemodialysis in critically ill patients, valuable mechanistic insights can be gained from in vitro RRT models. Such experiments have shown that dialysate flow rate is the most important factor associated with hemodialysis clearance of drugs. More data are needed to improve dosing in hemodialysis as the sub-optimal achievement of target concentrations seen in the early phase of therapy in critically ill patients receiving CRRT is likely to also be problematic with intermittent techniques.

Antibiotics are commonly required during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); however, few data are available regarding antibiotic PK during ECMO. The major changes in ECMO are increased Vd and decreased drug clearance, although the extent of such changes remains poorly characterized. Antibiotic concentrations may be further altered during ECMO because of the circuit itself (with associated drug sequestration) and/or the associated systemic inflammation (with vasodilation and capillary leak).

### Empirical aminoglycosides for peritonitis do not affect residual renal function [^111uyuvQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Aminoglycosides have been proven to be an efficacious treatment for peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients for many years. Consequently, they have been recommended in previous guidelines for the empirical treatment of peritonitis. However, with the increasing emphasis on preserving residual renal function (RRF), there has been concern about the nephrotoxic potential of these compounds. The 2000 International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines recommended that aminoglycosides not be used in patients with RRF, and that ceftazidime be used instead. In 1997, in response to the 1996 ISPD guidelines, we changed our peritonitis regimen from vancomycin and ciprofloxacin to cefazolin and gentamicin. The aim of this study is to compare the change in renal function occurring after treatment of peritonitis with and without gentamicin.

Methods

Using 6-monthly urine and dialysis clearance measurements, preperitonitis and postperitonitis RRF (mean of 24-hour urea and creatinine clearance) were determined for 70 peritonitis episodes treated with the aminoglycoside-based regimen (group A), 61 episodes treated without aminoglycosides (group B), and 74 control patients without peritonitis (group C).

Results

Group A had mean declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine output of -0.08 ± 0.50 mL/min/mon and -8.82 ± 88.09 mL/24 h/mon compared with -0.17 ± 0.27 mL/min/mon and -34.68 ± 69.58 mL/24 h/mon in group B and -0.20 ± 0.39 mL/min/mon and -14.61 ± 77.33 mL/24 h/mon in group C, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups.

Conclusion

In our patients, there was no evidence of an accelerated decline in RRF when using an empirical regimen containing aminoglycosides for peritonitis. Because there are few data to contradict this finding, we recommend the continued use of these drugs in peritonitis regimens, even in patients with significant RRF.

### Pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal gentamicin in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD study) [^111RFWHQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Peritonitis is a major infectious complication in peritoneal dialysis patients, and intraperitoneal antibiotic administration is preferred to ensure maximal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. This study aimed to describe the plasma and infection site pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal gentamicin in patients with peritonitis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This prospective pharmacokinetic study of intraperitoneal gentamicin was conducted in peritoneal dialysis patients presenting to hospital with clinically defined signs and symptoms of peritonitis. Twenty-four patients were administered a 0.6-mg/kg dose of intraperitoneal gentamicin, which was allowed to dwell for 6 hours. Serial blood and dialysate samples were collected for 24 hours after the first dose. Gentamicin concentrations in plasma and dialysate were measured using a validated assay.

Results

The median percentage of the dose absorbed into the systemic circulation was 76% (interquartile range = 69%-82%) and significantly different between patients with low average, high average, and high peritoneal membrane transporter status (P = 0.03). The calculated pharmacokinetic parameters were plasma terminal elimination half-life of 24.7 (20.4–29.9) hours, terminal volume of distribution of 0.30 (0.20–0.36) L/kg, observed peak plasma concentration of 3.1 (2.4–3.4) mg/L, and observed trough plasma concentration of 1.9 (1.4–2.2) mg/L. The peak gentamicin concentration in dialysate was at least eight times the minimum inhibitory concentration of the likely pathogens.

Conclusions

The high systemic absorption of gentamicin in patients with peritonitis and prolonged plasma elimination half-life may lead to drug accumulation in the systemic circulation, increasing the risk of toxicity.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^112KwzC4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The most helpful study is a meta-analysis of 28 cohort studies that were published between 1990 and 2013, including 1596 bacteraemia episodes, in which one of three treatment strategies was used: (A) antibiotics alone (N = 697) typically for 3–4 weeks (range 2–6), without catheter replacement; (B) antibiotic lock (N = 546) in which systemic antibiotic treatment is supplemented by antibiotic delivered as a lock between dialysis sessions, throughout the antibiotic period, without catheter replacement; or (C) guidewire exchange (N = 353) in which the catheter is replaced by exchange over a guidewire during the period of antibiotic treatment. Typical antibiotic locks used were vancomycin (2.5 mg/ml), ceftazidime (5 mg/ml) or gentamicin (1 mg/ml), alone or in combination depending on microbiology, added to heparin (5000 u/ml). Treatment strategy selection is not detailed, though it appears to have been largely institutional rather than clinical, and did not appear to depend on the infecting organism, which was distributed roughly evenly between three main groups: Staphylococcus aureus (StA), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CnS), and Gram-negative bacilli (GnB), with a smaller number of other bacteria or poly-microbial infections.

Cure was defined as clinical resolution without recurrent bacteraemia, over an average observation period of 3 months (range 3 weeks - 6 months), and was achieved in 45%, 57% and 67% of patients in groups A, B and C respectively, with both treatment B (OR 2.08, 95%CI 1.25–3.45) and C (OR 2.88, 95%CI 1.82–4.55) appearing superior to A. This treatment advantage was to a large extent driven by recurrent bacteraemia which was seen in groups A, B and C at 29%, 14% and 7%. Treatment outcomes appeared to interact with organism, with catheter exchange having the strongest advantage in StA infections (OR 4.72, 95%CI 1.79–12.46) which were the hardest to cure, and no clear advantage in CnS infections, which were the easiest. Serious infectious complications, including severe sepsis, metastatic infection and death occurred at similar rates in all treatment groups (9%, 8%, and 8% for pooled rates).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^111VtuMC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Residual kidney function in peritoneal dialysis (PD) — "The amount of kidney function that continues to remove waste products and the remaining urine volume should be known for all individuals doing PD. Management should focus on preserving this as long as possible". The work group suggests residual kidney function "be measured as the average of the 24-hour urinary urea and creatinine clearances", with tracking of "urine volume in milliliters per 24 hours" if full measurement is not feasible, and they recommend evaluating it "as practical under individual circumstances because there is no evidence for the ideal frequency of evaluation". For preservation, "Several clinical trials support the recommendations for the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and neutral-pH low glucose degradation product PD solutions", and "other recommendations such as the use of volume diuretics and icodextrin as needed to maintain euvolemia while avoiding volume depletion" are noted albeit with "evidence that is more limited". Modality choice "(CAPD vs APD) should be based on individual choice because there is no consistent evidence that one preserves residual kidney function better than the other", aminoglycosides — "it is advisable to limit their use to less than 3 weeks to prevent ototoxicity", and "there are no studies that have shown an association of contrast administration with a sustained decrease in residual kidney function in people receiving PD". Clinical utility is emphasized because residual kidney function has been associated with "longer survival; better control of volume and BP, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia; lower probability of protein-energy wasting, inflammation, and peritonitis; and increased clearance of middle molecules and protein-bound uremic solutes", and recognizing it "allows for a potential decrease in the PD prescription, which would likely mean less treatment burden for the person on PD". Implementation challenges include dependence on collecting "a 24-hour urine sample" and that "neutral-pH low glucose degradation product PD solutions are not commercially available and use of icodextrin is restricted by some dialysis provider organizations in the United States".

### Prevention of tunneled hemodialysis catheter-related infections using catheter-restricted filling with gentamicin and citrate: a randomized controlled study [^115tY9mF]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Tunneled catheters are widely used for the provision of hemodialysis. Long-term catheter survival is limited by tunneled catheter-related infections (CRI). This study assesses the efficacy of catheter-restricted filling with gentamicin and citrate in preventing CRI in hemodialysis patients. A double-blind randomized study was conducted to compare heparin (5000 U/ml) with gentamicin/citrate (40 mg/ml and 3.13% citrate; ratio 2:1) as catheter-lock solutions. A total of 112 tunneled catheters in 83 patients were enrolled at the time of catheter insertion for commencement or maintenance of hemodialysis. The primary end point was CRI. Catheter malfunction, defined as blood flow rate of < 200 ml/min for three consecutive dialyses and/or the use of urokinase, was also assessed as a secondary end point. Infection rates per 100 catheter-days were 0.03 in the gentamicin group versus 0.42 in the heparin group (P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed mean infection-free catheter survival of 282 d (95% CI, 272 to 293 d) in the gentamicin group versus 181 d (95% CI, 124 to 237 d) in the heparin group (log rank, 9.58; P = 0.002). Cox regression analyses showed a relative risk for infection-free catheter survival of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.92) in the gentamicin group when adjusted for gender, race, diabetes mellitus, catheter malfunction, and hemoglobin (P = 0.042). The incidence of catheter malfunction was not significantly different between groups. Predialysis gentamicin levels were significantly higher in patients randomized to gentamicin (gentamicin/citrate: median 2.8 mg/L [range, 0.6 to 3.5 mg/L], n = 5; heparin: median < 0.2 mg/L [range < 0.2 to 0.2 mg/L], n = 5; P = 0.008). Tunneled hemodialysis catheter-restricted filling with gentamicin and citrate is a highly effective strategy for prevention of CRI. Although citrate as a catheter-lock solution provides adequate anticoagulation for the interdialytic period, gentamicin levels suggest significant risk for chronic aminoglycoside exposure and associated ototoxicity. Before this technique is adopted, these preliminary observations warrant replication in future studies that will examine the efficacy and safety of lower doses of gentamicin or alternative agents with a reduced potential for toxicity.

### Approaches to prolong the use of uncuffed hemodialysis catheters: results of a randomized trial [^115h7HSc]. American Journal of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Use of uncuffed catheters (UCs) in hemodialysis patients is common practice. An antibiotic lock has been recommended to prevent catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), although insufficient data are available about the appropriate antimicrobial agent and dose with prolonged use of UCs.

Methods

This open-label randomized study was conducted to compare gentamicin/heparin (group A) and taurolidine/citrate (group B), as catheter-lock solutions, in 119 chronic hemodialysis patients in whom a total of 150 UCs were placed. A well-matched historical control group (heparin) included 67 UCs in 58 patients (group C).

Results

CRB episodes developed in 6 and 8 patients in groups A and B, respectively, significantly fewer than in group C (20 patients). Cumulative CRB-free catheter survival at 90 days was 82% for A and 78% for B, which is significantly higher than the 26% for C. Similar Gram-positive infection rates were found in all groups. The Gram-negative infection rate was significantly lower in B compared to C. No significant differences in thrombosis rates were observed between the groups.

Conclusions

Gentamicin/heparin and taurolidine/citrate, used for locking UC, were similarly effective at preventing CRB and catheter thrombosis for up to 3 months, until a functional permanent vascular access became available. Both antimicrobial lock solutions were superior to heparin in CRB prevention with similar thrombosis rates.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116BJU4A]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hemodialysis adequacy — evidence and dosing considerations: more data are available regarding adequacy in pediatric HD patients, but the numbers thankfully remain small, so definitive evidence is lacking, and the greater metabolic rate per unit of surface area in children has been invoked by some to justify a higher dose, while use of V as a denominator may endanger smaller patients.

### Modification of diet in renal disease and modified Cockcroft-Gault formulas in predicting aminoglycoside elimination [^114E2jZE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula and a modified version of the Cockcroft-Gault (CG(m)) formula adjusting for body surface area have been found to more accurately estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared with the original CG equation in specific patient populations. To date, the use of these formulas in determining drug dosage and estimating drug elimination has not been thoroughly investigated.

Objective

To evaluate the ability of the MDRD and CG(m) formulas to predict aminoglycoside elimination rate and clearance.

Methods

A 6-month prospective, noninterventional, pharmacokinetic study was conducted at a university teaching hospital. Patients receiving aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, or tobramycin) were eligible for study inclusion. Predicted elimination rate and aminoglycoside clearance were calculated for each patient using the MDRD and CG(m) formulas. Actual (patient-specific) elimination rate and aminoglycoside clearance were calculated for each patient using measured aminoglycoside serum concentrations. Predictive ability of the formulas was compared through Spearman correlations and Student's t-tests. Accuracy of formula estimates was also evaluated.

Results

Seventy-one patients met study inclusion criteria; the majority (82%) were in an intensive care unit. The 6-variable MDRD formula was found to be a significantly better predictor of aminoglycoside clearance (p = 0.035) compared with CG(m). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 methods in predicting patient-specific elimination rates (p = 0.167). Among subgroups, the MDRD formula was a significantly better predictor of aminoglycoside clearance for patients with an estimated GFR less than 60 mL/min (p = 0.027).

Conclusions

The 6-variable MDRD performs better than the CG(m) formula in predicting aminoglycoside clearance and may be considered as a tool in aminoglycoside dosing recommendations.

### An IQ industry perspective on informing dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment [^114sxfSX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

With regards to enrollment of severe renal impairment vs. ND‐ESRD (non‐dialysis dependent — end‐stage renal disease) participants in dedicated renal impairment studies, most survey participants recommended enrollment of severe renal impairment participants over ND‐ESRD participants with the justification that ND‐ESRD participants constitute a vulnerable population which is difficult to enroll. Additionally, ND‐ESRD participants are at risk for progressing into dialysis dependent — end‐stage renal disease (DD‐ESRD) very quickly (sometimes during the trial). The participants with severe renal impairment are considered more stable in terms of renal function compared to ND‐ESRD participants. Per the recently issued FDA guidance and EMA guidance, PK data in participants with DD‐ESRD are recommended to be collected for drugs that are likely to be administered to these patients to determine the contribution of the specific replacement modality (e.g. intermittent hemodialysis) to the elimination of the drug and its potentially active metabolites.

Survey responders indicated that challenges with enrolling ND‐ESRD or severe RI subjects in dedicated RI study included participant availability, safety of the drug in this population, and impact of concomitant medications. Dialysis schedule and fluctuating renal function in the subjects were the other challenges in conducting a study in DD‐ESRD subjects. These challenges could be mitigated by using multiple, experienced and/or dedicated sites, increased advertising, staged enrollment, dose reduction/up‐titration.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^111NQ97g]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcal prosthetic valve infective endocarditis — oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant regimens are as follows: For oxacillin-susceptible strains, nafcillin or oxacillin 12 g/24 h IV in 6 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6 (Class I; Level of Evidence B), plus rifampin 900 mg per 24 h IV or orally in 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6, and gentamicin 3 mg/kg per 24 h IV or IM in 2 or 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk 2; vancomycin should be used for immediate-type β-lactam hypersensitivity and cefazolin may be substituted for non–immediate-type reactions, and doses are for patients with normal renal function. For oxacillin-resistant strains, vancomycin 30 mg/kg 24 h in 2 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6 (Class I; Level of Evidence B), plus rifampin 900 mg/24 h IV/PO in 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6, and gentamicin 3 mg/kg per 24 h IV/IM in 2 or 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk 2; adjust vancomycin to a trough concentration of 10–20 µg/mL; gentamicin should be administered in close proximity to companion dosing.

### 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the management of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^113QQok3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Aminoglycoside monitoring in outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) lacks evidence to define specific monitoring protocols; use warrants careful monitoring during OPAT and dose adjustments based on serum drug levels due to the narrow therapeutic range, but optimal frequency of serum level checks and schedules for renal and oto-vestibular toxicity monitoring remain unanswerable from published literature.

### Gentamicin sulfate injection, USP 80mg / 2ml (40 mg / mL as… [^111HLWkG]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults: The recommended dosage of gentamicin sulfate for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours. For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides.

In such patients treated with gentamicin, measurement of serum concentrations is recommended as a basis for dosage adjustment. Children: 6 to 7. 5 mg/kg/day. Infants and Neonates:

7. 5 mg/kg/day. Premature or Full-Term Neonates One Week of Age or Less: 5 mg/kg/day. NOTE: For further information concerning the use of gentamicin in infants and children, see pediatric gentamicin sulfate injection product information. Dosage must be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function to assure therapeutically adequate, but not excessive blood levels. Whenever possible, serum concentrations of gentamicin should be monitored. One method of dosage adjustment is to increase the interval between administration of the usual doses.

Since the serum creatinine concentration has a high correlation with the serum half-life of gentamicin, this laboratory test may provide guidance for adjustment of the interval between doses. The interval between doses may be approximated by multiplying the serum creatinine level by 8. For example, a patient weighing 60 kg with a serum creatinine level of
2. 0 mg/100 mL could be given 60 mg every 16 hours.
