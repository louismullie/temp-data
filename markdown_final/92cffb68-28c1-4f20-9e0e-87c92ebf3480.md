## Question

Peritoneal dyalisis infection management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about peritoneal dialysis infection management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entities and diagnostic thresholds that define PD-related infections. Then, I should verify the initial diagnostic steps and sampling strategy. Next, I will review empiric therapy choices, including route and coverage, and check for any nuances like vancomycin monotherapy in select presentations. After that, I need to examine culture-directed therapy, durations, and special organisms such as MRSA, Pseudomonas, fungi, and nontuberculous mycobacteria. I will then consider catheter management decisions, including salvage strategies and when to remove versus exchange. Finally, I should integrate prevention, quality metrics, and special populations, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and epidemiology so I don't miss the forest for the trees: PD-related infections include peritonitis, exit-site infection, and tunnel infection, with peritonitis being the most consequential and a leading cause of technique failure and transfer to hemodialysis, and with substantial mortality and cost burdens that vary by organism and center practices [^111hwaZm] [^115bGCXZ] [^115Q4Cb8] [^1171JBv4].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds and definitions before moving to treatment: ISPD and contemporary cohorts emphasize standardized definitions, with culture-negative peritonitis ideally kept under 15–20% and peritonitis rates benchmarked around less than 0.5 episodes per patient-year in high-performing programs, recognizing that culture-negative episodes still carry meaningful morbidity and warrant diligent evaluation and follow-up [^114jn2Kz] [^111TmhsM] [^1157edED].

> I need to check the initial diagnostic steps and sampling strategy so we don't lose time: at symptom onset, obtain PD effluent for cell count with differential, Gram stain, and culture in blood culture bottles and standard media, and send a concurrent exit-site swab if ESI is suspected. If the patient is on automated PD, a manual bag exchange can facilitate sampling, and I should remember that a peritoneal fluid white cell count greater than 100 cells/µL with at least 50% neutrophils supports peritonitis even before culture returns [^115Q4Cb8] [^111hwaZm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric therapy. I should confirm route and spectrum: intraperitoneal antibiotics are preferred over intravenous for peritonitis because they achieve higher local concentrations and have been associated with lower treatment failure in small trials, and empiric regimens must cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas, with typical combinations such as a glycopeptide plus a third-generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside, tailored to local epidemiology and resistance patterns [^111hF49b] [^1131dVeB] [^115Q4Cb8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought vancomycin monotherapy might be reasonable broadly if local MRSA prevalence is high, but I should double-check that nuance: emerging observational data suggest that patients who present with cloudy effluent as the only manifestation may have a higher likelihood of vancomycin-susceptible gram-positive organisms, supporting vancomycin monotherapy in that narrowly selected phenotype, yet this remains hypothesis-generating and should not replace standard empiric coverage in most patients, especially those with pain, fever, or risk factors for gram-negative or resistant organisms [^115JeoyK] [^1133M7PF] [^1167zZRb].

> Next, I should review culture-directed therapy and durations so I don't over- or under-treat: for gram-positive peritonitis, continue or narrow to agents like cefazolin or vancomycin for about 14 days, extending to 21 days for Staphylococcus aureus. For gram-negative peritonitis, treat for 21 days and consider dual therapy in severe or Pseudomonas cases given worse outcomes. For culture-negative peritonitis, continue broad empiric therapy for 14–21 days while reassessing for atypical organisms or noninfectious causes if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^115Q4Cb8] [^115CboaV] [^111eewAn].

> I will now examine special organisms that change management, starting with MRSA: if MRSA is identified, vancomycin is appropriate, and I should ensure adequate IP dosing and consider organism MIC and clinical response to avoid undertreatment or persistent infection [^115Q4Cb8].

> But wait, what if Pseudomonas is involved? I need to ensure aggressive therapy and consider catheter issues: Pseudomonas peritonitis has higher risks of refractory infection and technique failure, so dual antipseudomonal therapy and early evaluation for catheter infection or biofilm are prudent, and if there is concomitant exit-site infection with the same organism, simultaneous catheter removal and replacement after clinical response may be favored over delayed reinsertion in selected cases [^111DGqSi] [^115Q4Cb8].

> Fungal peritonitis is a different beast. I should confirm that catheter removal is essential: for Candida or Aspergillus peritonitis, prompt catheter removal plus systemic antifungal therapy is recommended, with voriconazole preferred for Aspergillus and fluconazole reasonable for Candida, and if the catheter cannot be removed immediately, some experts consider adjunctive intraperitoneal amphotericin, though this is controversial and not uniformly endorsed [^113qYtwH] [^111VU5vu] [^115Q4Cb8].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to nontuberculous mycobacterial infections because they are frequently missed: if cultures are negative and there is no improvement by 5–7 days, I should send effluent for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture and consider molecular identification, as NTM like M. abscessus are increasingly reported and generally require prolonged multidrug therapy and catheter removal for cure, with case series suggesting high catheter loss rates and the need for aggressive, organism-specific regimens [^116vBAJq] [^116jQXc3] [^111i5Gd5].

> Next, I should review catheter management decisions and make sure I align with salvage versus removal principles: for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis, catheter removal is indicated, typically with a 2–4 week delay before reinsertion. For refractory exit-site or tunnel infections, salvage procedures such as cuff shaving, exit-site relocation, or partial replantation can be considered to preserve the peritoneum and avoid hemodialysis, but persistent infection despite appropriate antibiotics should lower the threshold for complete catheter removal [^111DGqSi] [^114n3qrp] [^116CsBUe].

> I need to ensure prevention is embedded because it changes baseline risk: prophylactic antibiotics at catheter insertion, routine exit-site antimicrobial prophylaxis with mupirocin or aminoglycoside cream, structured patient training with regular technique review, and antifungal prophylaxis during any antibacterial course reduce infection risk, and programs should audit peritonitis and exit-site infection rates against ISPD benchmarks to drive quality improvement [^111axhsK] [^114prC1D] [^115bGCXZ].

> Let me consider special populations and settings so I don't overlook high-risk groups: patients with HIV have higher peritonitis risk early in the PD course, and good viral control with HAART mitigates risk. Patients living remotely have higher rates of S. aureus peritonitis and may benefit from targeted decolonization strategies. And in pediatrics, lower thresholds for admission and parenteral therapy are reasonable given age-specific risks and tolerability [^1163yM7t] [^114RGmgw] [^115CboaV].

> I should double-check that my algorithm is coherent and actionable: suspect PD infection with cloudy effluent, pain, fever, or exit-site erythema/purulence. Obtain effluent cell count, Gram stain, and cultures promptly. Start IP antibiotics covering gram-positive and gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas. Reassess at 48–72 hours and tailor to culture results. Extend therapy to 21 days for S. aureus, Pseudomonas, or culture-negative cases without clear response. Involve surgery early for refractory or fungal cases. And embed prevention practices with ongoing audit and feedback to sustain low infection rates [^115Q4Cb8] [^111hF49b] [^111axhsK].

---

Peritoneal dialysis infection management centers on **early recognition** and **prompt empiric intraperitoneal antibiotics** covering Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas [^115Q4Cb8] [^1132Pc7W]. Obtain dialysate for cell count, Gram stain, and culture before starting antibiotics, and adjust therapy to culture results [^115Q4Cb8]. For refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis, **catheter removal is essential** [^115Q4Cb8] [^113qYtwH]; for exit-site or tunnel infections, use topical and systemic antibiotics, with ultrasound to assess tunnel involvement [^1132Pc7W] [^115CboaV]. Prevention relies on strict aseptic technique, prophylactic antibiotics at catheter insertion, and routine exit-site care with topical antibiotics [^111axhsK] [^114prC1D].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis are critical for effective management. Common **clinical features** include:

- **Cloudy dialysate**: Typically indicates infection due to elevated leukocyte count [^111KU1ME].
- **Abdominal pain**: Commonly reported by patients [^115JeoyK].
- **Fever**: Present in approximately 50% of cases [^notfound].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequent accompanying symptoms [^notfound].

Diagnostic evaluation should include:

- **Dialysate cell count and differential**: Leukocyte count > 100 cells/µL with > 50% neutrophils is highly suggestive of peritonitis [^notfound].
- **Gram stain and culture**: Essential for identifying causative organisms and guiding antibiotic therapy [^115Q4Cb8].
- **Exit-site examination**: Look for erythema, swelling, purulent discharge, or crusting, indicating exit-site infection (ESI) [^1132Pc7W].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated **promptly** once peritonitis is suspected, ideally within 2 hours of presentation [^notfound]. The **recommended empiric regimen** includes:

- **Gram-positive coverage**: Vancomycin or a first-generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefazolin) [^115JeoyK].
- **Gram-negative coverage**: A third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftazidime) or an aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin) [^115JeoyK].
- **Pseudomonas coverage**: Essential due to the organism's association with refractory peritonitis and poor outcomes [^111axhsK].

Intraperitoneal (IP) administration is preferred over intravenous (IV) due to higher local antibiotic concentrations and improved outcomes [^1131dVeB] [^111hF49b].

---

## Pathogen-specific antibiotic therapy

Once culture and sensitivity results are available, antibiotic therapy should be **tailored** to the identified organism:

| **Organism** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|
| Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive) | Cefazolin or vancomycin |
| Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) | Vancomycin |
| Coagulase-negative staphylococci | Cefazolin or vancomycin |
| Pseudomonas aeruginosa | - Two antipseudomonal agents (e.g. ceftazidime + aminoglycoside) [^115CboaV] <br/> - Consider catheter removal if refractory [^111DGqSi] |
| Fungal peritonitis (Candida spp.) | - Immediate catheter removal [^113qYtwH] <br/> - Fluconazole or amphotericin B [^notfound] |
| Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) | - Catheter removal [^116vBAJq] <br/> - Combination antibiotic therapy (e.g. macrolide + fluoroquinolone + aminoglycoside) [^112NRFBg] |

---

Duration of therapy typically ranges from **14 to 21 days**, depending on the organism and clinical response [^115Q4Cb8].

---

## Indications for catheter removal

Catheter removal is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Refractory peritonitis**: Failure to respond to appropriate antibiotics within 5 days [^notfound].
- **Relapsing peritonitis**: Recurrence within 4 weeks of completing therapy [^notfound].
- **Fungal peritonitis**: Immediate catheter removal is essential [^113qYtwH].
- **Exit-site or tunnel infection**: Refractory to antibiotics or associated with Pseudomonas or NTM [^115CboaV] [^116vBAJq].

---

## Management of exit-site and tunnel infections

Exit-site infections (ESI) and tunnel infections require **aggressive management** to prevent progression to peritonitis:

- **Topical antibiotics**: Mupirocin or gentamicin cream applied daily to the exit site [^111TmhsM].
- **Systemic antibiotics**: Cover Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^1132Pc7W].
- **Ultrasound evaluation**: Assess for tunnel involvement, which may necessitate catheter removal [^115CboaV].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive measures are essential to **reduce infection rates**:

- **Aseptic technique**: Strict adherence during catheter insertion and dialysis exchanges [^notfound].
- **Prophylactic antibiotics**: Administered at catheter insertion [^114prC1D].
- **Exit-site care**: Regular application of topical antibiotics (mupirocin or gentamicin) [^111TmhsM].
- **Patient training**: Comprehensive education on hygiene and infection recognition [^113DmqTV].

---

## Outcomes and complications

Peritoneal dialysis infections are associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**:

- **Hospitalization**: Frequently required for severe infections [^116DYCgf].
- **Catheter removal**: Often necessary in refractory or fungal infections [^115Q4Cb8].
- **Technique failure**: Increased risk of permanent transfer to hemodialysis [^1171JBv4].
- **Mortality**: Elevated risk, particularly with fungal or Gram-negative infections [^notfound].

---

Effective management of peritoneal dialysis infections requires **early recognition**, prompt empiric antibiotic therapy, and pathogen-specific treatment. Catheter removal is essential in refractory, relapsing, or fungal infections, while preventive strategies significantly reduce infection rates.

### Surgical management of complications with peritoneal dialysis [^111woLaN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

This report reviews the most common surgical interventions and complications of chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Based on the current knowledge as well as our experience we detail the role of these surgical procedures. We supplement the reported knowledge in the field with our own experience in this area. The areas discussed include early complications such as surgical wound hemorrhage, bleeding from the catheter, intestinal perforation and urinary bladder perforation, dialysate leakage through the wound, as well as late complications including catheter kinking or occlusion, retention of fluid in the peritoneal recess, hernias and hydrothorax, and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. We also briefly cover the surgical aspects of exit-site infection and peritonitis. An understanding by nephrologists of the role for surgical intervention in PD patients will improve their care and outcomes.

### Successful management of catheter injury or refractory infection by partial replantation of peritoneal dialysis catheters: a retrospective observational study [^114n3qrp]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has served as a vital treatment option for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), as well as for older patients, with continuous improvements aimed at reducing complications since its introduction in 1975. In Korea, approximately 5,610 patients underwent PD, accounting for 4.4% of ESKD patients. Catheter-related infections, specifically exit site infections (ESI) and tunnel infections (TI), significantly burden patients by causing technical setbacks and leading to the discontinuation of PD. When PD catheter damage occurs, particularly near the proximal portion of the exit site, the removal of the old catheter and simultaneous insertion of a new one is often required.

In 2023, the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) revised guidelines on catheter-related infections. They endorsed salvage methods such as cuff shaving and exit site relocation within the surgical intervention section for refractory cases, assigning them the same recommendation grade. The strategy of simultaneous removal and reinsertion is frequently adopted for intractable cases. Nevertheless, this approach necessitates interrupting peritoneal dialysis and transitioning to hemodialysis due to peritoneal manipulation. Moreover, manipulations for new peritoneal catheter insertion may lead to complications such as hemorrhage, peritoneal leakage, catheter malposition, and omental trapping. Additionally, transitioning to hemodialysis, even temporarily, may be essential, necessitating the disruption of PD.

When considering a shift to hemodialysis, salvage methods provide the benefit of preserving the peritoneum, enabling the immediate resumption of PD after the procedure. Several studies have documented their efficacy and clinical outcomes over multiple years across various countries. Nevertheless, the studies reported so far are mostly descriptive in nature, with limited case series that lack control groups. The scarcity of cases does not suffice to establish statistical significance. In this context, we highlight the effectiveness and non-inferiority of partial replantation as one of the salvage methods, compared to a control group with de novo catheter insertion.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113qYtwH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Aspergillus peritonitis — diagnosis and management including catheter removal and voriconazole duration: We recommend prompt peritoneal dialysis catheter removal accompanied by systemic antifungal therapy with voriconazole (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Diagnosis can be suggested by detection of (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan and GM in the peritoneal fluid, or confirmed by culture of peritoneal fluid. Removal of the dialysis catheter is essential in cases of fungal peritonitis and has been associated with improved survival, and in most cases the catheter should be immediately removed. Following catheter removal, systemic antifungal therapy is required; intravenous AmB formulations result in suboptimal and, in many cases, undetectable peritoneal drug concentrations, and systemic therapy with voriconazole for 6–8 weeks is thus recommended. In cases where the catheter cannot be promptly removed, intraperitoneal AmB in conjunction with voriconazole administration is not recommended by this panel, and posaconazole and the echinocandins may have utility as salvage therapy in Aspergillus peritonitis.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^112iAikq]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

These guidelines cover the organisation and performance of peritoneal dialysis as a treatment for kidney patients, including infants and children. It includes prevention and treatment of complications. It does not include factors involved in the choice of peritoneal dialysis compared to other options for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. This document is intended for use by any member of the health care team engaged in the care of kidney patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is long established as a major option for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is an important part of an integrated service for renal replacement therapy that is frequently selected by patients as their preferred initial mode of therapy and is a therapeutic option for patients wishing or needing to swap from HD and after renal transplant failure. PD is the best option for infants and small children. NICE Clinical Guideline 125 (2011) recommends PD as the initial dialysis treatment of choice of chronic kidney disease stage 5 for children aged 2 years or older, people with residual renal function and adults without significant associated comorbidities.

For the first time, this Renal Association guideline includes recommendations relating to PD in children. Recommendations in this guideline will refer to both adult and paediatric patients, except where the recommendation specifies one of these patient groups or provides alternative recommendations to them.

This guideline is an update of the PD module published on-line on the Renal Association website, in 2010. The English language literature was searched in December 2016 to identify relevant articles on PD published between 2008 and 2016 including:
Medline search using 'peritoneal dialysis' combined with relevant terms from each of the sections - Equipment & Resources, Training & Catheter Insertion, Dialysis Clearance, Ultrafiltration & Overhydration, Infections, Peritonitis, Exit Site Infections, Renal Osteodystrophy & Diabetes Mellitus, Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis, Assisted Peritoneal Dialysis, Icodextrin, Peritoneal Membrane, Urgent Start and Biocompatible Solutions
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Review of other national/international PD clinical guidelines
Identification of further articles quoted in identified papers
Review of Peritoneal Dialysis International's table of contents for articles relating to the content of the guidelines
Searches within the major renal journals (Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, Kidney International, American Journal of Kidney Diseases) for articles with 'peritoneal dialysis' in the title/abstract

The recommendations in this guideline have been harmonised with other PD guidelines whenever possible and the recommendations to follow international PD or other Renal Association guidelines have not been graded.

### Peritoneal dialysis access-related procedures by nephrologists [^115krr92]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Traditionally the placement of a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been accomplished by a surgeon and using general anesthesia. This approach often introduces delays in starting PD, incurs additional costs in utilizing an operating room as well as anesthesia services, and introduces the mortality risk associated with general anesthesia. Recent data have emphasized that interventional nephrologists can safely and successfully perform PD access procedures. In this context, operating room facilities and staff and anesthesia services are not required and catheter insertion can be performed in a procedure room using local anesthesia, thereby reducing costs and completely bypassing the mortality risk associated with general anesthesia. When performed by a nephrologist, the catheter insertion can be accomplished swiftly and dialysis therapy initiated in a timely manner. Once begun, the success of PD hinges on reliable and long-term access to the peritoneal cavity. Prospective randomized and nonrandomized studies have shown that PD catheters peritoneoscopically placed by nephrologists have fewer complications (infection, exit site leak) and longer catheter survival rates than those inserted surgically. Although PD offers a variety of advantages, it remains an underutilized form of renal replacement therapy. To counteract PD underutilization, at least two separate centers have demonstrated a positive impact on the growth of the PD population when catheter insertion is performed by nephrologists. This article presents PD access-related procedures currently performed by interventional nephrologists. Furthermore, some of the complicating issues (bowel perforation, catheter migration, prior abdominal surgery) related to PD catheter insertion and management are also discussed.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^1167zZRb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an effective renal replacement therapy for the treatment of end-stage renal disease. However, PD-associated peritonitis (PDAP) is a serious complication that is the greatest contributor to infection-related morbidity, including the risk of hospitalization, temporary or permanent transfer to hemodialysis and mortality. Timely and effective treatment of PDAP is essential.

A precise etiological diagnosis and early targeted antibiotic therapy are highly desirable. However, the causative organisms are difficult to determine at the time of initial diagnosis of peritonitis. Consequently, ISPD recommends that gram-positive organisms be covered by a first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin and that gram-negative organisms be covered by a third-generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside. However, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage increases the possibility of secondary infections such as fungal peritonitis episodes and potential problems (including drug interactions and the emergence of resistant strains) with fungal prophylaxis treatment.

According to a previous study, the most common germs causing PDAP were gram-positive, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are the most frequent cause of PDAP in many centers, with an oxacillin resistance rate of 69.6%. Theoretically, vancomycin is a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive bacteria. It is effective for the treatment of gram-positive peritonitis, including that caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. In addition to cephazolin, which can only cover some coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains, vancomycin can also cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The use of vancomycin as the first treatment for gram-positive peritonitis was found to be an independent predictor of resolution. However, identifying how to treat PDAP with vancomycin alone is a challenge.

In practice, a substantial percentage of peritonitis patients present with only cloudy effluent, without abdominal pain or fever. This manifestation is always linked to gram-positive organisms, including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. We hypothesized that certain clinical manifestations could be indicators for initial vancomycin monotherapy.

Therefore, In the present study, we analyzed the initial clinical manifestations of culture-positive PDAP, including patients who presented with only cloudy effluent and patients who presented with cloudy effluent, abdominal pain and/or fever. We linked the clinical characteristics of peritonitis to the susceptibility of the causative organism to vancomycin and investigated the possibility of using vancomycin monotherapy as an initial treatment regimen for some patients with PDAP to avoid unnecessary antibiotic exposure and secondary infection.

### Peritoneal dialysis-related infections recommendations 2005 – an important tool for quality improvement [^114jn2Kz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Adequate performance measurement should be based on evidence-based guidelines. The recently published update of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommendations for peritoneal dialysis-related infections provides an opportunity to define a limited set of quality indicators as suitable for performance measurement and useful as targets for the improvement of dialysis care. Suitable quality indicators seem the incidence of peritonitis (target less than one episode every 18 months) and the percentage of culture-negative episodes (< 20%). The lack of uniformity in definitions and the lack of studies providing evidence for firm recommendations are major limitations for further improvements in prevention, diagnosis and outcome of peritoneal dialysis-related infectious complications.

Our case highlights an unusual cause of ESI in PD as well as some of the challenges associated in management, including catheter removal, antibiotic selection, and duration. Further research is needed to refine these challenges in the management of M. abscessus ESI, including risk factors for development of M. abscessus, optimal selection of empiric antibiotic therapies, duration of antibiotics, and PD catheter re-insertion timing.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access surgery [^112MmiN7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) access postoperative management — Bleeding after PD catheter insertion may occur from inferior epigastric artery injury or lysis of adhesions and should be managed according to standard surgical principals; the insertion point should be at the medial border of the rectus sheath to avoid arterial injury, and coagulation parameters should be assessed and corrected pre-operatively (++Evidence, Weak recommendation). Dialysate leaks after PD catheter placement may be amenable to treatment, and potentially prevention, with the use of fibrin glue, particularly in the pediatric population (++Evidence, Weak recommendation.). Exit site infection is managed by oral antibiotics, and chronic exit site and cuff infections may managed by catheter salvage consisting of unroofing the track, shaving the superficial cuff and using a new exit site (++Evidence, Weak recommendation). Pain during PD is a rare complication that is usually amenable to medical management but occasionally requires repositioning or removal of the catheter (++Evidence, Weak recommendation).

### Managing hospitalized peritoneal dialysis patients: ten practical points for non-nephrologists [^115ju82q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although nephrologists are responsible for the long-term care of dialysis patients, physicians from all disciplines will potentially be involved in the management of patients with kidney failure, including patients on peritoneal dialysis, the major home-based form of kidney-replacement therapy. This review aims to fill knowledge gaps of non-experts in peritoneal dialysis and to highlight key management aspects of in-hospital care of patients on peritoneal dialysis, with a focus on acute scenarios to facilitate prompt decision-making. The clinical pearls provided should enable non-nephrologists to avoid common pitfalls in the initial assessment of peritoneal dialysis-related complications and guide their decision regarding when to refer their patients to a specialist, resulting in improved multidisciplinary patient care.

### Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^115Q4Cb8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Peritonitis is a common and severe complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Detailed recommendations on the prevention and treatment of PD-associated peritonitis have been published by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD), but there is a substantial variation in clinical practice among dialysis units. Prophylactic antibiotics administered before PD catheter insertion, colonoscopy, or invasive gynecologic procedures, daily topical application of antibiotic cream or ointment to the catheter exit site, and prompt treatment of exit site or catheter infection are key measures to prevent PD-associated peritonitis. When a patient on PD presents with clinical features compatible with PD-associated peritonitis, empirical antibiotic therapy, with coverage of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas species), should be started once the appropriate microbiologic specimens have been obtained. Intraperitoneal is the preferred route of administration. Antifungal prophylaxis, preferably oral nystatin, should be added to prevent secondary fungal peritonitis. Once the PD effluent Gram stain or culture and sensitivity results are available, antibiotic therapy can be adjusted accordingly. A detailed description on the dosage of individual antibiotic can be found in the latest recommendations by the ISPD. The duration of antibiotics is usually 2–3 weeks, depending on the specific organisms identified. Catheter removal and temporary hemodialysis support is recommended for refractory, relapsing, or fungal peritonitis. In some patients, a new PD catheter could be inserted after complete resolution of the peritonitis. PD catheter removal should also be considered for refractory exit site or tunnel infections. After the improvement in clinical practice, there is a worldwide trend of reduction in PD-associated peritonitis rate, supporting the use of PD as a first-line dialysis modality.

### Granuloma formation after repeated episodes of peritoneal dialysis catheter-related infection, a case report [^116feyGY]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

PD is an effective renal replacement treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) allowing patients to perform self-assisted dialysis at home. However, if the complications are not handled in a timely manner, treatment failure may occur. Infection is one of the primary complications of peritoneal dialysis. Catheter-related infections include exit-site and tunnel infections. The purpose of the case report is to suggest that we should actively treat catheter infection to avoid repeated infection leading to granuloma formation and ultimately failure of peritoneal dialysis. Another teaching point in the case report is timely removal of a PD catheter when no longer in use.

### Strategies for improving long-term survival in peritoneal dialysis patients [^117AFyvy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of ESRD in the United States continues to increase. Currently there are over 26,000 patients maintained on peritoneal dialysis. Mortality rates have fallen over the past several years, but long-term survival remains poor, with only 11% of peritoneal dialysis patients surviving past 10 years. Cardiovascular disease accounts for most deaths, and dialysis patients have many traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. Lowering of these risk factors has not resulted in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. Maneuvers to improve long-term peritoneal dialysis patient survival must therefore focus on modifiable risk factors including residual renal function, peritoneal membrane integrity, rate of infections, and peritoneal dialysis center size. This article reviews strategies for preserving residual renal function and peritoneal membrane integrity as well as strategies for reducing the rate of infections to enhance long-term survival in peritoneal dialysis patients.

### Mycobacterium abscessus-an uncommon, but important cause of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis-case report and literature review [^113QonCn]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, we present, to our knowledge, the first reported case of M.abscessus PD peritonitis in the United Kingdom. It was managed with catheter removal, a prolonged course of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and conversion to HD. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of M.abscessus in cases of non-resolving PD related infections, or culture-negative peritonitis. Catheter removal appears to be essential for clinical recovery, and the switch to HD may be permanent.

### Worldwide variation of dialysis-associated peritonitis in children [^1178XmGA]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Peritonitis is the most common cause of dialysis failure in children on chronic peritoneal dialysis. We performed a prospective study of 501 peritonitis episodes in 44 pediatric dialysis centers located in 14 countries that examined peritonitis etiology, efficiency of opinion-based management guidelines, and final outcomes. Culture-negative incidence varied significantly from 11% in North America to 67% in Mexico. Argentina and North America had the highest rate of Gram-negative episodes. Pseudomonas-based peritonitis was eightfold more common in the United States than in Europe, and correlated with the frequency of exit site cleansing and topical mupirocin administration. Significant regional variation in antibiotic susceptibility was noted for the first generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. Initial response rates to standardized empiric antibiotic treatment did not differ between regions; however, final outcomes were significantly less favorable in Eastern Europe. The wide regional variation in culture-negative peritonitis, and the distribution and antibiotic susceptibilities of causative bacteria needs to be taken into consideration when the guidelines for empiric therapy of pediatric dialysis-associated peritonitis are revised.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) (guidelines PD 5.1–5.2)

Guideline 5.1 – PD: Infectious complications

Guideline 5.1.1 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that PD units should undertake regular audit of their peritonitis and exit-site infection rates, including causative organism, treatment and outcomes. They should enter into active dialogue with their microbiology department and infection control team to develop optimal local treatment and prevention protocols (1B).

Guideline 5.1.2 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that flush-before-fill dialysis delivery systems should be used for CAPD (1A).

Guideline 5.1.3 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that patients (and/or carers or parents) should undergo regular revision of their technique (at least annually or more frequently if indicated, such as after an episode of PD-related infection or a significant interruption to the patient performing PD) and receive intensified training if this is below standard (1C).

Guideline 5.1.4 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that initial catheter insertion should be accompanied by antibiotic prophylaxis (1B).

Guideline 5.1.5 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that invasive procedures should be accompanied by antibiotic prophylaxis and emptying the abdomen of dialysis fluid for a period commensurate with the procedure (1C).

Guideline 5.1.6 – PD infectious complications: Prevention strategies

We recommend that topical antibiotic administration should be used to reduce the frequency of exit-site infection and peritonitis (1A).

Guideline 5.2 – PD: Infectious complications

Guideline 5.2.1 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that exit site infection is suggested by pain, swelling, crusting, erythema and serous discharge; purulent discharge always indicates infection. Swabs should be taken for culture and initial empiric therapy should be with oral antibiotics that will cover S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (1B).

Guideline 5.2.2 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that methicillin resistant organisms (MRSA) will require systemic treatment (e.g. vancomycin) and will need to comply with local infection control policies (1C).

Guideline 5.2.3 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that initial treatment regimens for peritonitis should include cover for bacterial Gram positive and Gram negative organisms including Pseudomonas species until result of culture and antibiotic sensitivities are obtained (1C).

### Peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion surgery and management [^115J8dSy]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal access surgery is the first step to achieve successful peritoneal dialysis. It is important to perform easy, safe, and less invasive surgery of peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion. Secure peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion will lead to less infection, that is, exit site, tunnel infection, and peritonitis, which sometimes result in peritoneal dialysis discontinuation. To avoid these undesirable results, we should perform good and proper peritoneal dialysis insertion surgery. In this article, we describe peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion surgery and its management.

### Streptococcal peritonitis in Australian peritoneal dialysis patients: predictors, treatment and outcomes in 287 cases [^113gD9rS]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal peritonitis accounts for between 6% and 16% of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis and is generally reported to be severe. The 2005 update of the International Society of PD (ISPD) Guidelines for Management of PD-related Infections recommends that streptococcal peritonitis is best treated with intraperitoneal ampicillin for a period of 3 weeks. However, these recommendations are based on limited observations, mostly in the form of case reports or small case series, some of which have been potentially confounded by the inclusion of enterococci (previously called non-haemolytic streptococci and now recognised to be a separate genus of Gram-positive cocci). Moreover, there has not previously been a comprehensive examination of different therapeutic approaches to streptococcal peritonitis.

The aim of the current study was to examine the frequency, predictors, treatment and clinical outcomes of streptococcal peritonitis in all Australian PD patients involving 66 PD centres.

### Peritoneal dialysis infections: an opportunity for improvement [^111HFhJ3]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter-associated infections remain a challenging cause of technique failure. Patient training and preventive measures are key elements in the management of infection rates. Twenty-seven of the 167 PD catheter transfer sets analyzed (19%) yielded a positive microbial culture (58% gram-negative bacteria). These results show that subclinical contamination, particularly from environmental gram-negative bacteria, is a potential hazard, indicating the need for a protocol for regular transfer set changes.

### Management of peritoneal dialysisexit-site infection: a case report and literature review [^1154vn74]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis associated infections are common and associated with high morbidity and mortality, if not treated in a timely manner. Mycobacterium abscessus is an uncommon pathogen in peritoneal dialysis associated infections, but is resistant to standard antimicrobial therapies used. Here we present a case of a 56 year-old male with end stage kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis for 7 years who developed a Mycobacterium abscessus exit-site infection. Peritonitis and peritoneal dialysis catheter tunneled line infections were ruled out and he was treated with linezolid, amikacin, and azithromycin. He required peritoneal dialysis catheter removal and hemodialysis conversion. Antibiotics were de-escalated based on erm inducibility and antibiotic sensitivities. Linezolid and amikacin were continued for approximately 7 total weeks, with complete resolution of the infection. Further research is needed to refine challenges in the management of Mycobacterium abscessus exit-site infections, including risk factors for development of Mycobacterium abscessus, optimal selection of empiric antibiotic therapies, duration of antibiotics, and peritoneal dialysis catheter re-insertion timing.

### Peritoneal adhesion: it can be life-threatening, and life-saving [^114QUZJa]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a modality chosen by approximately 11% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in 2004 and 15.8% in 2009 globally. The primary advantage of PD is patients' ability to undertake treatment without having to visit a medical facility frequently. It has comparable risks attributed to the permanent catheter that may introduce bacteria into the abdomen and cause peritonitis, the most common acute complication of PD. PD-related peritonitis is largely caused by cutaneous Gram's (+) bacteria, although Gram's (−) bacteria peritonitis has become more and more common, and can usually be treated effectively by appropriate antibiotics. However, the inevitable post-inflammatory fibrosis and adhesion often compromise patients' future treatment. Manifestations of impaired peritoneal function include ultrafiltration failure, PD inadequacy, abdominal symptoms of bowel obstruction, and malnutrition, thus threatening patients' lives. The most severe form estimated to occur in roughly 2.5% of patients is encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), in which the bowels become obstructed due to the growth of a thick layer of collagen within the peritoneum. Mortality rate of EPS can be as high as 50%. The management of peritoneal fibrosis and adhesion itself is usually not effective enough to restore the peritoneal function to its original level. Therefore, peritonitis rate is often employed to audit the quality assurance in PD practice and it also reflects faithfully whether the education offered to the patients and prevention measures are successful.

Here, we describe a patient who experienced an unusual form of EPS that made her give up PD. However, its unique pattern also saved her from infection caused by bowel perforation.

### Successful management of catheter injury or refractory infection by partial replantation of peritoneal dialysis catheters: a retrospective observational study [^114txrUQ]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The revised 2023 guidelines from the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) emphasize salvage methods for treating refractory catheter-related infections, or mechanical catheter damage. This approach preserves the existing catheter by manipulating only the outer cuff above the peritoneum, avoiding hemodialysis transfer. We investigated the effectiveness of the partial replantation technique.

Methods

In this retrospective single-center study (January 2021 - December 2023), outcomes for nine patients undergoing salvage methods were compared with 58 patients receiving de novo catheter insertion. We assessed exit-site infection (ESI), tunnel infection (TI), peritonitis, and catheter dysfunction. The salvage method entailed distal cutting of the impaired catheter and attaching a new segment using a connector with a PD adaptor and transfer set.

Results

Nine patients (four males, mean age 56 years, average PD duration 66 months) employed the salvage method. Post-procedure, one patient (11.1%) reported ESI, one (11.1%) experienced TI, three (33.3%) developed peritonitis, and two (22.2%) required catheter removal. No procedural complications or catheter dysfunctions were observed. In the control group, ESI occurred in six patients (10.3%), TI in one (1.7%), peritonitis in 11 (19.0%), catheter removal in seven (12.1%), and catheter dysfunction in one (1.7%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no statistical difference between the groups: ESI (p = 0.306), TI (p = 0.094), peritonitis (p = 0.838), catheter dysfunction (p = 0.694), and catheter removal (p = 0.393).

Conclusions

This study supports the non-inferiority and effectiveness of the salvage method compared to de novo insertion in managing ESI or TI and mechanical catheter damage.

### Salvage of problematic peritoneal dialysis catheters [^116bBeR1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a markedly underutilized modality for permanent renal replacement therapy in the United States owing to a low rate of patient referral and high rate of patient dropout or transfer to hemodialysis. One cause for patient loss from PD is problematic PD catheters that often are removed rather than being subjected to simple surgical salvage procedures. We report three patients with problematic catheters and our approach to their management. The first patient developed erosion of the skin overlying the portion of the catheter between the deep and superficial cuffs after 6 months of PD. The second patient developed extrusion of the superficial cuff after 4 years of PD. The third patient demonstrated a localized abscess at the incision site for catheter insertion after 3 years of PD. Other than a mild superficial exit site infection and localized abscess in the second and third patient, respectively, there were no associated infections of the catheter tunnel and cuff or of the peritoneal cavity as determined by either clinical examination, ultrasound evidence of fluid collection, or cultures and white blood cell counts. All three cases were managed successfully by interventional nephrology on an outpatient basis and under local anesthesia without either catheter removal or placement of a new PD catheter. It was possible to continue uninterrupted PD in the first and third patients, while the second patient had temporary hemodialysis to allow for complete healing of the surgical wound. We conclude that in selected cases simple interventions can salvage problematic PD catheters and maintain patients on PD.

SAGES peritoneal dialysis (PD) access guideline update 2023 — evidence summary and research needs for urgent versus conventional start PD. A well-constructed multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that can adequately compare the outcomes of starting hemodialysis (HD) and converting to PD versus initial urgent start PD is needed. A Cochran database review in 2019 identified 16 studies (2953 participants) examining the outcomes of urgent versus conventional start PD, and when results from patients who initiated dialysis two weeks after catheter insertion were compared to those who initiated dialysis urgently, the latter were more likely to have leakage of dialysis fluid outside the abdominal cavity into the skin near the exit-site of peritoneal dialysis catheter. The study was unable to make conclusions about differences in rates of peritonitis, exit-site infection, mechanical complications of peritoneal dialysis (including catheter blockage, catheter malposition and catheter readjustment), patients remaining on peritoneal dialysis (technique survival), and death. The ISPD 2019 guideline update concluded, "There are no RCTs comparing urgent start on PD with urgent start on hemodialysis".

### Management of acute kidney injury associated with COVID-19: what have we learned? [^116Mioba]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although initially kidney involvement in COVID-19 infection was felt to occur relatively infrequently, this has proved not to be the case. In critically ill patients with COVID-19, multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. This review focuses briefly on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI as well as options for management.

Recent Findings

The risk factors for AKI are common to both noncovid-related AKI and COVID-19 associated AKI. Kidney injury in COVID-19 associated AKI may arise through several mechanisms, including not only direct effects on the kidney leading to tubular injury but also through the effects of treatment of multiorgan failure complicating infection. During surge conditions, the use of kidney replacement therapy has embraced all modalities including the use of peritoneal dialysis. The use of blood purification techniques has been proposed, but to date, the results are variable.

Summary

COVID-19 associated AKI is common, affecting approximately a quarter of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Glomerular injury can occur, but in the main tubular injury seems most likely leading to AKI, which should be managed following clinical pathways informed by accepted guidelines.

### Peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis: insights from a long-term analysis of an Italian center [^116DYCgf]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is a common and severe complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). For comparative analysis standardized definitions as well as measurements and outcomes are crucial. However, most PD-related peritonitis studies have been using heterogenous definitions and variable methods to measure outcomes. The ISPD 2022 guidelines have revised and clarified numerous definitions and proposed new peritonitis categories and outcomes.

Methods

Between 1st January 2009 and 31st May 2023, 267 patients who started PD at our institution were included in the study. All PD-related peritonitis episodes that occurred in our unit during the study period were collected. The new definitions and outcomes of ISPD 2022 recommendations were employed.

Results

The overall peritonitis rate was 0.25 episode/patient year. Patient cumulative probability of remaining peritonitis-free at one year was 84.2%. The medical cure and refractory peritonitis rates were equal to 70.3 and 22.4%, respectively. Culture-negative peritonitis accounted for 25.6% of all specimens. The rates of peritonitis associated death, hemodialysis transfer, catheter removal and hospitalization were 6.8%, 18.3%, 18.7% and 64.4%, respectively. Relapsing, repeat, recurrent and enteric peritonitis accounted for 7.8%, 6.8%, 4.1% and 2.7% of all episodes, respectively. Catheter insertion, catheter related and pre-PD peritonitis were 4.2, 2.1 and 0.5%.

Conclusions

The implementation of PD-related peritonitis reports using standardized definitions and outcome measurements is of paramount importance to enhance clinical practice and to allow comparative studies.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes between culture-negative and positive peritonitis in patients undergoing maintenance peritoneal dialysis: a prospective cohort study [^1157edED]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is a common and serious complication of PD, which accounts for 2–15% of mortality risk, 16–20% of cases of catheter removal, and 16–18% of cases of transfer to hemodialysis. PD culture results influence the choice of antibiotics, treatment duration, and prognosis. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines recommend that the proportion of culture-negative peritonitis to be < 15% of all peritonitis episodes. However, culture-negative peritonitis has been reported in up to 40% of all peritonitis episodes and remains a significant problem.

The clinical outcomes of culture-negative peritonitis are controversial, with conflicting data reported in the literature. However, many patients with this condition generally exhibit more favorable clinical outcomes than those with culture-positive peritonitis. The cause of this more benign course is not yet fully understood. While empirical treatment for culture-negative peritonitis can pose challenges for clinicians, cause-specific treatment may have advantages such as facilitating the identification of potential sources of infection, which can lead to more targeted therapy.

Our hypothesis was that the clinical outcome of culture-negative peritonitis is not different from, or may even be worse than, that of culture-positive peritonitis. Previous data on culture-negative peritonitis are mostly derived from retrospective cohort and registry studies. Therefore, we conducted a prospective cohort study at our center to compare the clinical outcomes of culture-negative and culture-positive peritonitis using more detailed data. In addition, we aimed to identify the culture practices associated with culture-negative peritonitis.

### Mycobacterium abscessus-an uncommon, but important cause of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis-case report and literature review [^111i5Gd5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis is used for managing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It requires access to the peritoneal space by way of a percutaneous tunnelled dialysis catheter. Infective complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) include catheter exit-site infection (ESI), catheter tunnel infection (TI) and peritonitis. Peritonitis can be particularly severe and can lead to PD failure and discontinuation of PD. Early recognition of infections, prompt microbiological diagnosis, and establishing appropriate treatment are therefore essential. An essential factor that determines a successful outcome in such cases is anti-microbial susceptibility testing to guide appropriate therapy. PD related peritonitis is most commonly caused by gram-positive aerobes such as coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, or gram-negative aerobes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reports of PD related peritonitis caused by Mycobacterium species are relatively rare, although their incidence has been well documented. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are members of the genus Mycobacterium but are significantly different from other members of the same genus, e.g. M.tuberculosis and M.leprae. NTM related PD peritonitis is emerging as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the management of PD peritonitis, with comparatively higher rates of PD catheter loss and PD failure compared to other organisms. Consensus on the management of NTM related PD peritonitis does not currently exist, possibly because of the paucity of reported cases. We describe what is to our knowledge the first reported case in the UK of PD related peritonitis secondary to the NTM species Mycobacterium abscessus.

### Peritoneal dialysis catheter salvage performed by nephrologists in tunnel exposure management [^113eozHf]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) has many merits compared to hemodialysis (HD), it has been underutilized in many countries. A previous study suggested that this problem could be improved by PD catheter insertion performed by nephrologists. PD catheter insertion by nephrologists can improve the utilization of PD, but various complications requiring surgical intervention after PD catheter insertion are a hurdle. Therefore, the proper recognition and treatment of PD catheter-related complications, which may require surgical intervention, would be indirectly useful in reducing the barrier to induce PD catheter insertion by nephrologists. Furthermore, this could lead to the maintenance of long-term PD and decrease the transition from PD to HD.

PD catheter-related complications represent an important hurdle in maintaining long-term PD. They include non-infectious complications, such as ultrafiltration failure and migration, and infectious complications, such as exit-site and tunnel infection. Tunnel exposure, a non-infectious complication, is a rare finding in PD patients, which has been described in some case reports. Therefore, information regarding the nature and proper treatment of tunnel exposure is relatively limited, leading to insufficient or improper treatment of this condition. Finally, this process results in PD catheter removal regardless of the medical requirements. Therefore, our study aimed to present catheter salvage therapy using a revision procedure of tunnel exposure by nephrologists.

### Successful management of catheter injury or refractory infection by partial replantation of peritoneal dialysis catheters: a retrospective observational study [^116CsBUe]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

According to the 2023 ISPD revised guidelines, the initial treatment of catheter-related infections involves adequate antibiotic administration. However, if the infection persists, particularly in cases of refractory ESI or TI, salvage methods such as cuff saving and exit site relocation could be prioritized over the simultaneous removal and reinsertion technique. These approaches preserve the peritoneum, unlike the latter technique which entails peritoneal manipulation.

In cases of intractable infection where both the catheter and cuff are invaded by pathogenic organisms, complete catheter removal is often necessary to ensure eradication, as failure to eliminate the pathogens may result in persistent bacterial colonization. If the infection does not involve the inner cuff, considering partial replantation as a salvage method is feasible. This approach requires several conditions, including a still-functioning inner conduit, a negative culture of dialysate, no signs of infection over the internal cuff area, and specifically, the presence of a near-cuff perforation.

Particularly, eschewing peritoneal manipulation offers numerous benefits. A study in the United States reported that up to 15.5% of PD-naïve patients required a follow-up procedure within 90 days post-initial PD catheter insertion due to complications such as bleeding, catheter obstruction, malposition, kinking, and peritoneal leakage. Notably, the replantation method allows for the prompt resumption of PD without requiring a hemodialysis catheter (0 day vs. 16.6 days, p < 0.001). The use of a hemodialysis catheter, even in short-term, can potentially induce vessel damage, and prolonged dwelling can exacerbate this damage. Additionally, partial replantation can be executed in an outpatient setting, which obviates the need for hospitalization thus potentially offering greater convenience and cost effectiveness. At our hospital, patients undergoing simultaneous catheter replacement typically required at least three nights and four days of hospitalization to monitor procedure-related complications.

Conclusion

CAPD plays an integral role in renal replacement therapy with its many advantages to patients; however, there are significant adverse risks associated with it, leading to serious risk of morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of complications, both clinically and on the different imaging modalities, is essential in the management of CAPD in order to reduce treatment failure and limit patient morbidity and mortality.

### Mycobacterium abscessus-an uncommon, but important cause of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis-case report and literature review [^116jQXc3]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a form of therapy for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and peritonitis is a known complication. Mycobacterium (M) species associated peritonitis in PD patients is uncommon. Our experience of managing PD associated peritonitis caused by M abscessus in a middle-aged man with ESKD due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is shared in this article with a review of the literature on this condition.

Case Presentation

A 49-year old man presented to our unit with symptoms of peritonitis and cloudy PD effluent. Initial analysis of PD fluid showed Gram stain was negative, with no organism grown. Empirical PD peritonitis treatment with intra-peritoneal antibiotics did not improve his symptoms and he required intravenous antibiotics, PD catheter removal and a switch to haemodialysis. Cultures of the PD fluid later grew M abscessus, and the antibiotic regimen was changed appropriately, leading to clinical improvement.

Conclusion

M abscessus associated peritonitis in PD patients is rare. It needs to be borne in mind when clinical improvement is not seen with standard broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in situations where the PD fluid is initially deemed to be culture negative. PD fluid samples should be sent for acid-fast bacillus and if detected, should be further analysed with genome-wide sequencing to confirm the species of the Mycobacterium. Prompt removal of the catheter with peritoneal washout is critical for clinical improvement.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^115CboaV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) has developed a simple scoring system for exit site signs and symptoms which is easy to use and gives guidance on when to treat immediately rather than waiting for a swab result. Purulent discharge is an absolute indicator for antibiotic treatment.

The ISPD has become less dogmatic about the initial choice of antibiotic treatment for peritonitis, provided that gram positive and negative infections are covered. It is recognised that patterns of resistance vary considerably and thus a local policy must be developed. Studies do not currently demonstrate a favoured regime. For exit site infections the presence of a tunnel infection should be recognised as it may require more aggressive management. We concur with the ISPD guidelines that suggest suitable antibiotic dosing regimens, including options for intermittent and continuous dosing of intraperitoneal antibiotics. We also note their comment that infections from Gram negative organisms are more likely to lead to refractory or recurrent peritonitis. A single study suggested that treating Gram negative peritonitis with 2 appropriate antibiotics might be associated with better outcomes. It is also important to be aware of the potential for impaired absorption of oral antibiotics in some situations, e.g. co-prescription of ciprofloxacin with some phosphate binders.

We would emphasise the ISPD guidelines that it is important that timely PD catheter removal is undertaken in refractory PD peritonitis. PD catheter removal or swap is also required in refractory exit site infections, and may be required earlier where there is a Pseudomonas infection or associated tunnel infection, which can be confirmed by ultrasound imaging.

There will be a lower threshold in paediatrics for admission for IV antibiotics (at least for first 48 h), especially in infants and small children where oral antibiotics commonly cause diarrhoea/feed intolerance.

### Prevention of peritoneal dialysis-related infections [^112iam71]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) varies widely from country to country, with the main limitation being infectious complications, particularly peritonitis, which leads to technique failure, hospitalization and increased mortality. A large number of prophylactic strategies have been employed to reduce the occurrence of peritonitis, including the use of oral, nasal and topical antibiotics, disinfection of the exit site, modification of the transfer set used in continuous ambulatory PD exchanges, changes to the design of the PD catheter implanted, the surgical method by which the PD catheter is inserted, the type and length of training given to patients, the occurrence of home visits by trained PD nurses, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing certain invasive procedures and the administration of antifungal prophylaxis to PD patients whenever they are given an antibiotic treatment course. This review summarizes the existing evidence evaluating these interventions to prevent exit-site/tunnel infections and peritonitis.

Peritonitis is a common serious complication of peritoneal dialysis that results in considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It also significantly limits the use of this important dialysis modality. Despite its importance as a patient safety issue, peritonitis practices and outcomes vary markedly and unacceptably among different centers, regions, and countries. This article reviews peritonitis risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, particularly focusing on potential drivers of variable practices and outcomes, controversial or unresolved areas, and promising avenues warranting further research. Potential strategies for augmenting the existing limited evidence base and reducing the gap between evidence-based best practice and actual practice also are discussed.

### Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis with simultaneous exit-site infection [^111DGqSi]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

With the implementation of best demonstrated clinical practices, peritonitis has become an infrequent complication of peritoneal dialysis in many centers around the world. Yet the gains in reduction in risk of peritonitis are not uniform. Most episodes of peritonitis do not require hospitalization and it is possible to achieve cure rates of 70%-80%. Some circumstances, however, necessitate the removal of the peritoneal dialysis catheter. These include patients with inadequate response to antimicrobial therapy, those with fungal peritonitis, or those with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas peritonitis with coexisting exit-site infection with the same organism. If the peritoneal dialysis catheter is removed in the presence of active intraperitoneal infection, replacement of the peritoneal dialysis catheter should be deferred by 2–4 weeks. However, simultaneous removal and replacement is possible in selected circumstances such as in patients with S. aureus or Pseudomonas peritonitis who also have exit-site infection with the same organism, after the intraperitoneal infection has responded to antibiotic therapy.

Peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and is associated with significant morbidity. Adequate treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and recurrence.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for PD-associated peritonitis.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the treatment of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients (adults and children) evaluating: administration of an antibiotic(s) by different routes (e.g. oral, intraperitoneal, intravenous); dose of an antibiotic agent(s); different schedules of administration of antimicrobial agents; comparisons of different regimens of antimicrobial agents; any other intervention including fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage and early catheter removal were included.

Two authors extracted data on study quality and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the dichotomous results were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We identified 36 studies (2089 patients): antimicrobial agents (30); urokinase (4), peritoneal lavage (1) intraperitoneal (IP) immunoglobulin (1). No superior antibiotic agent or combination of agents were identified. Primary response and relapse rates did not differ between IP glycopeptide-based regimens compared to first generation cephalosporin regimens, although glycopeptide regimens were more likely to achieve a complete cure (3 studies, 370 episodes: RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.58). For relapsing or persistent peritonitis, simultaneous catheter removal/replacement was superior to urokinase at reducing treatment failure rates (1 study, 37 patients: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91). Continuous IP and intermittent IP antibiotic dosing had similar treatment failure and relapse rates. IP antibiotics were superior to IV antibiotics in reducing treatment failure (1 study, 75 patients: RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.81). The methodological quality of most included studies was suboptimal and outcome definitions were often inconsistent. There were no RCTs regarding duration of antibiotics or timing of catheter removal.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on one study, IP administration of antibiotics is superior to IV dosing for treating PD peritonitis. Intermittent and continuous dosing of antibiotics are equally efficacious. There is no role shown for routine peritoneal lavage or use of urokinase. No interventions were found to be associated with significant harm.

### Systematic literature review of the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related infection caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria [^116vGUsF]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are major components of the microflora in the environment. They cause soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, surgical-site infection, and infections following the insertion of artificial materials. Generally, diagnosing infections caused by NTM is not possible with routine bacterial cultures, and acid-fast bacilli stain, culture, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is required.

Mycobacterium fortuitum (M. fortuitum), Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus), and Mycobacterium chelonae (M. chelonae) are common NTM known to cause peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related infection (including PD catheter-related infection such as exit-site infection and tunnel infection) and PD-related peritonitis. Despite the increasing incidence and prevalence of catheter-related infection caused by NTM, their accurate diagnostic methods and appropriate management, especially with respect to the relocation of the exit site and catheter removal, remain unclear. Furthermore, their prognosis and the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment remain unclear. Accordingly, this literature review aimed to investigate the accurate diagnostic methods and most effective treatment for PD catheter-related infection and peritonitis caused by NTM.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients [^1141RNmF]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

While nontuberculous mycobacterial peritonitis is uncommon among peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, these infections have serious consequences. They present a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Diagnosis can be delayed due to the slow growth rate of some mycobacterial species. These organisms can also be overlooked when adequate culture media are not used in the microbiological evaluation process. The choice of antimicrobial therapy depends upon isolation and speciation of the infecting Mycobacterium species, and prompt catheter removal is essential. Because serious intra-abdominal complications may follow infection, identifying patient risk factors for nontuberculous mycobacterial peritonitis and initiating prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. We report three cases of peritonitis associated with Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium gordonae, each with a unique presentation, and discuss the appropriate diagnosis and treatment strategies for the management of PD-associated mycobacterial infections.

### Intraperitoneal ampicillin treatment for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis with Listeria monocytogenes-a case report [^113eaLo7]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an established method of renal replacement therapy. PD-related peritonitis is a rare but serious complication and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, each instance of peritonitis reduces the transport capacity of the peritoneum and eventually limits the effectiveness of dialysis.

PD-related peritonitis is most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus, but infection with Listeria monocytogenes may also occur. Antibiotics used to treat peritonitis may be administered intravenously, orally, or intraperitoneally, but intraperitoneal administration is preferred to ensure maximal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. Recommendations of antibiotic therapy for Listeria infection are currently based on a small number of case reports and suggest the administration of ampicillin. But, unlike vancomycin or gentamicin, for ampicillin the route of application, dosage, and duration of treatment have not yet been established. We report a case of PD-associated peritonitis due to L. monocytogenes infection that was managed with ampicillin administered intravenously and intraperitoneally, separately and in combination.

### Randomised controlled trial to determine the appropriate time to initiate peritoneal dialysis after insertion of catheter to minimise complications (timely PD study) [^116fgXGY]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

Primary

Peritoneal fluid leaks (over the four weeks following start up of PD) and/or PD related infection - either exit site and/or tunnel and/or peritonitis - over the four weeks following start up of PD (Table 1).

Table 1
Explanation of definitions to be used as part of this study

Secondary

Composite of all PD catheter related complications and HD requirements and associated complications. PD catheter related complications include fluid leaks, infection, cuff erosion, cuff extrusion, failure to establish PD successfully (may be due to blockage, fibrin plug or outflow obstruction), delayed wound healing, haematoma, catheter revision or replacement, conversion to HD, HD related events, allergic reactions, hospitalisation for any reason with cause recorded as related to either surgery or start up of dialysis and death during the study period.

Outcomes will be recorded for eight weeks following the insertion of the Tenckhoff catheter. However, primary outcomes will relate only to those events occurring within four weeks after start up of dialysis as these will best inform the question of optimal delay time.

The HD related events include the number of HD treatments required during the study period, the use of temporary HD vascular access (non-tunnelled and tunnelled central venous catheters) and a composite of HD vascular access complications - infection (exit site or bacteraemia or septicaemia), blockage requiring intervention eg urokinase, replacement, repositioning and/or removal

Data collection

Data will be obtained by history from the participant or extracted from the clinical notes. These include:

1. Participant information - age, gender, weight, height, allergies, cause of kidney disease, co-morbidities

2. Date of PD catheter insertion and start of this period of peritoneal dialysis

3. Type of PD catheter and the technique by which PD catheter was inserted

4. Previous dialysis history

5. PD related complications

6. HD related events

7. Laboratory investigations - full blood count, electrolytes, coagulation profile, liver function test and C-reactive protein at admission to hospital as part of usual care.

8. Microbiology results - Gram stain, culture and antimicrobial sensitivities of dialysate fluid at admission to hospital if there is clinical suspicion of peritonitis

9. Antibiotics and other drugs prescribed concomitantly

10. Length of stay in hospital.

### Variation in peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis outcomes in the peritoneal dialysis outcomes and practice patterns study (PDOPPS) [^111eewAn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is a significant PD-related complication. We describe the likelihood of cure after a peritonitis episode, exploring its association with various patient, peritonitis, and treatment characteristics.

Study Design

Observational prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

1,631 peritonitis episodes (1,190 patients, 126 facilities) in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Exposure

Patient characteristics (demographics, patient history, laboratory values), peritonitis characteristics (organism category, concomitant exit-site infection), dialysis center characteristics (use of icodextrin and low glucose degradation product solutions, policies regarding antibiotic self-administration), and peritonitis treatment characteristics (antibiotic used).

Outcome

Cure, defined as absence of death, transfer to hemodialysis (HD), PD catheter removal, relapse, or recurrent peritonitis within 50 days of a peritonitis episode.

Analytical Approach

Mixed-effects logistic models.

Results

Overall, 65% of episodes resulted in a cure. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for cure were similar across countries (range, 54%-68%), by age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes status. Compared with Gram-positive peritonitis, the odds of cure were lower for Gram-negative (AOR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.30–0.57]), polymicrobial (AOR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.20–0.47]), and fungal (AOR, 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00–0.07]) peritonitis. Odds of cure were higher with automated PD versus continuous ambulatory PD (AOR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.02–1.82]), facility icodextrin use (AOR per 10% greater icodextrin use, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01–1.12]), empirical aminoglycoside use (AOR, 3.95 [95% CI, 1.23–12.68]), and ciprofloxacin use versus ceftazidime use for Gram-negative peritonitis (AOR, 5.73 [95% CI, 1.07–30.61]). Prior peritonitis episodes (AOR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74–0.99]) and concomitant exit-site infection (AOR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.26–0.64]) were associated with a lower odds of cure.

Limitations

Sample selection may be biased and generalizability may be limited. Residual confounding and confounding by indication limit inferences. Use of facility-level treatment variables may not capture patient-level treatments.

Conclusions

Outcomes after peritonitis vary by patient characteristics, peritonitis characteristics, and modifiable peritonitis treatment practices. Differences in the odds of cure across infecting organisms and antibiotic regimens suggest that organism-specific treatment considerations warrant further investigation.

### Management of peritoneal dialysis in patients with obesity [^111pUtFA]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The healthcare system is increasingly burdened by the rising number of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), alongside a parallel surge in obesity. However, use of peritoneal dialysis in patients with obesity has been met with caution despite increasing recognition of advantages of home dialysis. This review addresses these concerns and outlines evidence-based guidelines for effective management.

Recent Findings

Contemporary analysis of peritoneal dialysis cohorts demonstrates that catheter-related complications are not higher in patients with obesity compared to normal weight using basic or advanced laparoscopic methods, and even percutaneously placed catheters can achieve good outcomes using technical advancements. A meticulously identified and well placed exit site facilitates infection free peritoneal dialysis delivery in patients with obesity. It is important to recognize that adipocytes have a significantly lower water content; therefore, adjusted body weight is proposed to estimate the volume of distribution and the clearance of small solutes more accurately. The practice of incremental dialysis and use of Icodextrin for long dwells help limit glucose exposure and manage related metabolic complications. Recent evidence does not support the notion that peritoneal dialysis modality alters the impact of obesity on likelihood of transplantation or overall survival.

Summary

Obesity is associated with adverse outcomes in dialysis patients; however, these effects are comparable between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and are not more pronounced in peritoneal dialysis. With careful technical and clinical considerations, peritoneal dialysis therapy can be effectively delivered to patients with obesity without imposing undue burden. Therefore, obesity should not be viewed as a contraindication to peritoneal dialysis.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^112LDwQZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with cIAIs involves generally both source control, antibiotic therapy, and potentially novel therapies targeted at modulating or ameliorating the host inflammatory response. Antibiotics can prevent local and hematogenous spread and can reduce late complications.

This classification has been questioned by some authors because it often has incited confusion by mixing elements of anatomical barrier disruption and severity of disease expression.

Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum. Depending on the underlying pathology, it can be infectious or sterile. Infectious peritonitis is classified into primary peritonitis, secondary peritonitis, and tertiary peritonitis. Primary peritonitis is a diffuse bacterial infection (usually caused by a single organism) without loss of integrity of the gastrointestinal tract, typically seen in cirrhotic patients with ascites or in patients with a peritoneal dialysis catheter. It has a low incidence on surgical wards and is usually managed without any surgical intervention. Secondary peritonitis, the most common form of peritonitis, is an acute peritoneal infection resulting from loss of integrity of the gastrointestinal tract. Tertiary peritonitis is a recurrent infection of the peritoneal cavity that occurs > 48 h after apparently successful and adequate surgical source control of secondary peritonitis. It is more common among critically ill or immunocompromised patients and may be often associated with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). It is typically associated with high morbidity and mortality. Tertiary peritonitis has been accepted as a distinct entity. However, it represents an evolution and complication of secondary peritonitis. The term "ongoing peritonitis" or "persistent peritonitis" may better indicate that it is not a different disease to secondary peritonitis, but rather represents secondary peritonitis lasting longer and harboring other (selected and more resistant) pathogens.

The term "healthcare-associated infection" (HCAI) is a new term for infections acquired during the course of receiving healthcare. It includes not only hospital-acquired infections but also infections in patients living in nursing facilities, having recent hospitalization within 90 days, and using aggressive medical therapies (intravenous therapy, wound dressing) at home and invasive therapies (hemodialysis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) in outpatient clinics within 30 days of the index infection. In the setting of IAIs, there is relatively little data regarding the concept of healthcare-associated infections as opposed to hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections.

Differentiating community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (CA-IAIs) from hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections (HA-IAIs) is useful to define the presumed resistance patterns and identify patients with increased likelihood of infection caused by MDROs.

### Optimizing peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis prevention in the United States: from standardized peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis reporting and beyond [^1171JBv4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is the leading cause of permanent transition to hemodialysis among patients receiving PD. Peritonitis is associated with higher mortality risk and added treatment costs and limits more widespread PD utilization. Optimizing the prevention of peritonitis in the United States will first require standardization of peritonitis definitions, key data elements, and outcomes in an effort to facilitate nationwide reporting. Standardized reporting can also help describe the variability in peritonitis rates and outcomes across facilities in the United States in an effort to identify potential peritonitis prevention strategies and engage with stakeholders to develop strategies for their implementation. Here, we will highlight considerations and challenges in developing standardized definitions and implementation of national reporting of peritonitis rates by PD facilities. We will describe existing peritonitis prevention evidence gaps, highlight successful infection-reporting initiatives among patients receiving in-center hemodialysis or PD, and provide an overview of nationwide quality improvement initiatives, both in the United States and elsewhere, that have translated into a reduction in peritonitis incidence. We will discuss opportunities for collaboration and expansion of the Nephrologists Transforming Dialysis Safety (NTDS) initiative to develop knowledge translation pathways that will lead to dissemination of best practices in an effort to reduce peritonitis incidence.

### Updates on infectious and other complications in peritoneal dialysis: core curriculum 2023 [^1159e64n]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The last few years have seen several developments in the field of peritoneal dialysis (PD), including successful use of acute PD, increasing emphasis on home dialysis utilization, and improved understanding of models of peritoneal solute transfer. This installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology emphasizes the latest data available for prevention and management of infectious and noninfectious complications of PD. Through case vignettes, appropriate strategies for diagnosis and care of patients with PD peritonitis are reviewed as well as noninfectious complications evident in clinical practice including complications from increased intra-abdominal pressure, namely pericatheter and abdominal leaks, hernia formation, and complications from pleuroperitoneal communication (hydrothorax). Although rates of incisional hernias and pericatheter leaks have decreased with improved peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion techniques, these mechanical complications continue to be common occurrences and are reviewed via pertinent clinical vignettes which aim to address and discuss common implications of these scenarios. Finally, this Core Curriculum article covers a practical overview of peritoneal dialysis catheter dysfunction.

### Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-a guide to imaging appearances and complications [^117DMzkQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this article is to review and illustrate the typical imaging findings for a patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and its complications, examining the uses and limitations of multimodality imaging.

Background

CAPD is a commonly and increasingly used method of renal replacement therapy in end-stage renal failure (ESRF). From the set-up and insertion of the peritoneal catheter through to the actual treatment, there are pitfalls and complications that may adversely affect the patient and compromise the success of the dialysis. Complications can be either immediate or delayed, and can also be categorised into infectious and non-infectious aetiologies, including catheter failure, dialysate leaks, hernias and encapsulating sclerosing peritonitis.

Conclusion

Early recognition of complications, both clinically and on the different imaging modalities, is essential in the management of CAPD in order to reduce treatment failure and limit patient morbidity and mortality.

Main messages

Complications of peritoneal dialysis cause patient morbidity and treatment failure.
Early recognition of complications from normal appearances is essential to limit dialysis failure.
Multimodality imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of these complications.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^115JeoyK]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PDAP is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis, and it is the main cause of PD-related technical failure, even leading to death. Few studies have explored the relationship between the clinical manifestations of PDAP and related vancomycin sensitivity.

The ISPD guidelines recommend that gram-positive organisms be covered by a first-generation cephalosporin or vancomycin and that gram-negative organisms be covered by a third-generation cephalosporin or aminoglycoside. We found that cloudy dialysis effluent, as the only clinical manifestation at the onset of PDAP, is an independent indicator of vancomycin-sensitive peritonitis with high specificity, which indicates that vancomycin may be chosen as monotherapy for initial management of PDAP patients with only cloudy dialysis effluent as the initial manifestation.

As documented by this and previous studies, approximately 20–30% of patients are without abdominal pain when peritonitis occurs; if vancomycin could be chosen as the initial treatment for these patients, a substantial percentage of patients could avoid gram-negative antibiotics. Therefore, this strength could theoretically decrease the occurrence of fungal peritonitis and reduce treatment costs.

### Systematic literature review of the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related infection caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria [^112NRFBg]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

In our review, more than 80% of cases were treated with combination therapy with multiple antibiotics, including macrolides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides (Table 1). Although the FDA currently warns against the use of fluoroquinolones, infections caused by gram-negative rods have long been treated with fluoroquinolones as the first-choice medications. Notably, fluoroquinolones are partially effective against NTM infection, sometimes resulting in the induction of highly resistant strains, even in patients with a history of PD catheter-related infection. In our study, 25.2% and 8.6% of patients with PD catheter-related infection and peritonitis, respectively, were conservatively managed using antimicrobial therapy only. There remain no established guidelines for catheter removal in cases of tunnel infections caused by NTM; further, treatment approaches significantly vary across facilities. Although our findings do not confirm the validity of catheter removal, extended use of multiple antibiotics in patients with PD-related infection results in an increased risk of side effects. Moreover, patients with renal dysfunction have an increased risk of strong side effects from antibiotics. For example, fluoroquinolones involve risks of enteritis, Achilles tendon rupture, and malignant arrhythmias. Macrolides can cause gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiovascular-related death. Tetracyclines may cause pigment deposition and gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas aminoglycosides carry the risk of renal and hearing impairment. The average duration of antibiotic therapy was 3.8 and 6.0 months in patients with PD catheter-related infection and peritonitis, respectively. However, given the lack of randomized controlled trials, further prospective studies investigating and validating the potential impact of treatment duration on prognosis are required.

Notably, 15 (8.7%) patients with PD-related peritonitis died (Fig. 2), whereas only one (0.8%) patient with PD catheter-related infection died (Fig. 1). Regarding the continuation of PD, 79 (62.2%) and 26 (16.0%) of patients with PD catheter-related infection and peritonitis, respectively, continued/resumed PD. In the former group, almost half of the patients tolerated conservative multiple-antibiotic therapy; however, one patient died. All patients who underwent surgical intervention (including relocation of the exit site or removal and reinsertion) survived with PD. This could be attributed to early intervention preventing the progression of catheter-related infection to peritonitis. Consistent with current guidelines, our findings indicate that patients with PD-related peritonitis should undergo immediate catheter removal.

### Clostridioides difficile associated peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients-a case series based review of an under-recognized entity with therapeutic challenges [^111KU1ME]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis is a dominant cause of PD failure among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). These individuals present largely with a gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome with or without accompanying systemic features e.g. fever; and a cloudy PD effluent secondary to elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts with predominance of neutrophils. Current management guidelines recommend early institution of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy triggered by PD fluid cytology. However, even with the current recommended protocols for microbiology, 15–20% of the PD peritonitis are culture negative. Concerns for atypical infections or non-infectious peritonitis are higher in culture negative peritonitis. Neutrophilic reaction can also occur with peri-peritoneal infection or inflammation as in pancreatitis and colitis.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) presents with GI symptoms and has significant adverse outcomes including mortality, for both hospitalized and ambulatory patient populations. Chronically ill and immunocompromised individuals, including those with end stage renal disease (ESRD), are at higher risk for developing CDI. These statistics along with the similar presenting syndromes, pose two unique challenges in the routine clinical care of ESRD patients on PD: GI presentation with cloudy PD effluent can detract from the timely diagnosis of CDI and empirical management of PD peritonitis with routinely recommended antimicrobials including cephalosporins negatively impacts CDI. Together, these could lead to inappropriate early management, prolonged disease course, and adverse patient outcomes. A strategy that allows greater vigilance for diagnosing CDI, and appropriate antimicrobial administration without potential for worsening CDI may improve patient care in this population. We present a potentially novel strategy for the empiric management of PD peritonitis through discussion of two such cases who received care in our medical center within a 12-month period.

### Antimicrobial agents for preventing peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients [^114prC1D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an important therapy for patients with end-stage kidney disease and is used in more than 200,000 such patients globally. However, its value is often limited by the development of infections such as peritonitis and exit-site and tunnel infections. Multiple strategies have been developed to reduce the risk of peritonitis including antibiotics, topical disinfectants to the exit site and antifungal agents. However, the effectiveness of these strategies has been variable and are based on a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The optimal preventive strategies to reduce the occurrence of peritonitis remain unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antimicrobial strategies used to prevent peritonitis in PD patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 4 October 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

RCTs or quasi-RCTs in patients receiving chronic PD, which evaluated any antimicrobial agents used systemically or locally to prevent peritonitis or exit-site/tunnel infection were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Thirty-nine studies, randomising 4435 patients, were included. Twenty additional studies have been included in this update. The risk of bias domains were often unclear or high; risk of bias was judged to be low in 19 (49%) studies for random sequence generation, 12 (31%) studies for allocation concealment, 22 (56%) studies for incomplete outcome reporting, and in 12 (31%) studies for selective outcome reporting. Blinding of participants and personnel was considered to be at low risk of bias in 8 (21%) and 10 studies (26%) for blinding of outcome assessors. It should be noted that blinding of participants and personnel was not possible in many of the studies because of the nature of the intervention or control treatment. The use of oral or topical antibiotic compared with placebo/no treatment, had uncertain effects on the risk of exit-site/tunnel infection (3 studies, 191 patients, low quality evidence: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.04) and the risk of peritonitis (5 studies, 395 patients, low quality evidence: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.19). The use of nasal antibiotic compared with placebo/no treatment had uncertain effects on the risk of exit-site/tunnel infection (3 studies, 338 patients, low quality evidence: RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.87) and the risk of peritonitis (3 studies, 338 patients, low quality evidence: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.31). Pre/perioperative intravenous vancomycin compared with no treatment may reduce the risk of early peritonitis (1 study, 177 patients, low quality evidence: RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61) but has an uncertain effect on the risk of exit-site/tunnel infection (1 study, 177 patients, low quality evidence: RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.32). The use of topical disinfectant compared with standard care or other active treatment (antibiotic or other disinfectant) had uncertain effects on the risk of exit-site/tunnel infection (8 studies, 973 patients, low quality evidence, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33) and the risk of peritonitis (6 studies, 853 patients, low quality evidence: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06). Antifungal prophylaxis with oral nystatin/fluconazole compared with placebo/no treatment may reduce the risk of fungal peritonitis occurring after a patient has had an antibiotic course (2 studies, 817 patients, low quality evidence: RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63). No intervention reduced the risk of catheter removal or replacement. Most of the available studies were small and of suboptimal quality. Only six studies enrolled 200 or more patients.

Authors' Conclusions

In this update, we identified limited data from RCTs and quasi-RCTs which evaluated strategies to prevent peritonitis and exit-site/tunnel infections. This review demonstrates that pre/peri-operative intravenous vancomycin may reduce the risk of early peritonitis and that antifungal prophylaxis with oral nystatin or fluconazole reduces the risk of fungal peritonitis following an antibiotic course. However, no other antimicrobial interventions have proven efficacy. In particular, the use of nasal antibiotic to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus, had an uncertain effect on the risk of peritonitis and raises questions about the usefulness of this approach. Given the large number of patients on PD and the importance of peritonitis, the lack of adequately powered and high quality RCTs to inform decision making about strategies to prevent peritonitis is striking.

### Catheter type, placement and insertion techniques for preventing catheter-related infections in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients [^116kuDN2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is one of the limiting factors for the growth of peritoneal dialysis (PD) worldwide and is a major cause of technique failure. Several studies have examined the effectiveness of various catheter-related interventions for lowering the risk of PD-related peritonitis. This is an update of a review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of different catheter implantation techniques and catheter types in lowering the risk of PD-related peritonitis in PD patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 15 January 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Studies comparing different catheter insertion techniques, catheter types, use of immobilisation techniques and different break-in periods were included. Studies of different PD sets were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Forty-two studies (3144 participants) were included: 18 evaluated techniques of catheter implantation, 22 examined catheter types, one assessed an immobiliser device, and one examined break-in period. In general, study quality was variable and almost all aspects of study design did not fulfil CONSORT standards for reporting. Catheter insertion by laparoscopy compared with laparotomy probably makes little or no difference to the risks of peritonitis (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.35; moderate certainty evidence), exit-site/tunnel infection (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.31; low certainty evidence), catheter removal/replacement (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.86; low certainty evidence), technique failure (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.08; low certainty evidence), and death (all causes) (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.20; moderate certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether subcutaneous burying of catheter increases peritonitis (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.60; very low certainty evidence). Midline insertion compared to lateral insertion probably makes little or no difference to the risks of peritonitis (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.33; moderate certainty evidence) and may make little or no difference to exit-site/tunnel infection (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.58; low certainty evidence). Percutaneous insertion compared with open surgery probably makes little or no difference to the exit-site/tunnel infection (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.30; moderate certainty evidence). Straight catheters probably make little or no difference to the risk of peritonitis (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.31; moderate certainty evidence), peritonitis rate (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.21; moderate certainty evidence), risk of exit-site infection (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.34; moderate certainty evidence), and exit-site infection rate (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.43; moderate certainty evidence) compared to coiled catheter. It is uncertain whether straight catheters prevent catheter removal or replacement (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; very low certainty evidence) but straight catheters probably make little or no difference to technique failure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.31; moderate certainty evidence) and death (all causes) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.46; low certainty evidence) compared to coiled catheter. Tenckhoff catheter with artificial curve at subcutaneous tract compared with swan-neck catheter may make little or no difference to peritonitis (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.96; low certainty evidence) and incidence of exit-site/tunnel infection (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; low certainty evidence) but may slightly improve exit-site infection rate (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no strong evidence that any catheter-related intervention, including the use of different catheter types or different insertion techniques, reduces the risks of PD peritonitis or other PD-related infections, technique failure or death (all causes). However, the numbers and sizes of studies were generally small and the methodological quality of available studies was suboptimal, such that the possibility that a particular catheter-related intervention might have a beneficial effect cannot be completely ruled out with confidence.

### Regional variation in the treatment and prevention of peritoneal dialysis-related infections in the peritoneal dialysis outcomes and practice patterns study [^112zeaU6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related infections lead to significant morbidity. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines for the prevention and treatment of PD-related infections are based on variable evidence. We describe practice patterns across facilities participating in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS).

Methods

PDOPPS, a prospective cohort study, enrolled nationally representative samples of PD patients in Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Canada, Thailand, Japan, the UK and the USA. Data on PD-related infection prevention and treatment practices across facilities were obtained from a survey of medical directors'.

Results

A total of 170 centers, caring for > 11000 patients, were included. The proportion of facilities reporting antibiotic administration at the time of PD catheter insertion was lowest in the USA (63%) and highest in Canada and the UK (100%). Exit-site antimicrobial prophylaxis was variably used across countries, with Japan (4%) and Thailand (28%) having the lowest proportions. Exit-site mupirocin was the predominant exit-site prophylactic strategy in ANZ (56%), Canada (50%) and the UK (47%), while exit-site aminoglycosides were more common in the USA (72%). Empiric Gram-positive peritonitis treatment with vancomycin was most common in the UK (88%) and USA (83%) compared with 10–45% elsewhere. Empiric Gram-negative peritonitis treatment with aminoglycoside therapy was highest in ANZ (72%) and the UK (77%) compared with 10–45% elsewhere.

Conclusions

Variation in PD-related infection prevention and treatment strategies exist across countries with limited uptake of ISPD guideline recommendations. Further work will aim to understand the impact these differences have on the wide variation in infection risk between facilities and other clinically relevant PD outcomes.

### Evolving peritoneal dialysis care in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2020: comparison data from two surveys [^112DNBfU]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Along with the peritoneal dialysis (PD)-favored policy in China and the implementation of more comprehensive PD management, PD has evolved in Chinese mainland over the last decade. Despite the existence of national registries and several provincial epidemiological descriptive studies, there was almost no national research on the changing trajectory in PD population. A comparison study, based on two national surveys that were 10 years apart, was conducted to reveal the evolvement of PD care in Chinese mainland.

Methods

Two national surveys have been done respectively in 2010 and 2020 to capture the epidemiological status, application of different modalities, management of perioperative infection, and long-term complications among PD patients.

Results

In the study with 730 participating hospitals (n = 14,912 PD patients) in 2010 and 746 hospitals (n = 101,537) in 2020, prevalent PD patients have increased in the past 10 years with increased numbers of PD patients in both secondary (average 5 ± 16 vs. 43 ± 41, p < 0.01) and tertiary hospitals (32 ± 53 vs. 153 ± 215, p < 0.01). Automated PD has been accessible in 0.4% of all hospitals, only in tertiary centers in 2010 and its application increased to 51% in 2020. PD centers have become more engaged in PD catheter placement, treated properly for the PD-related infection, and carried out the follow-up in compliance with the national protocols.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that over the past decade, the prevalent PD population has quickly expanded with increased APD availability in Chinese mainland. The management of PD patients has become better conforming to the guidelines and long-term follow-up of patients have remained stable. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether the rapidly changing paradigm of PD could translate into the socio-economic benefits in the society.

### The effects of living distantly from peritoneal dialysis units on peritonitis risk, microbiology, treatment and outcomes: a multi-centre registry study [^114RGmgw]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study represents the largest examination to date of the effect of living distantly from a PD unit on the risk, microbiology, treatment and clinical outcomes of PD-associated peritonitis. Living at least 100 km away from a PD unit was independently associated with a heightened risk of S. aureus peritonitis, modified approaches to peritonitis treatment (including less frequent hospitalisation, greater reliance on vancomycin-based regimens and a tendency to persist with antimicrobial agents in preference to catheter removal) and superior antimicrobial cure rates compared with patients living within 100 km of a PD unit. The heightened risk of S. aureus peritonitis and lower use of antifungal prophylaxis in remote living PD patients highlights the need to focus on implementation of evidence-based infection control strategies (such as staphylococcal decolonisation) in this patient group. Further research evaluating the effectiveness of different guideline implementation strategies on peritonitis prevention, particularly in remote-living PD patients, is warranted.

### Treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^116gS5GN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis frequently complicates peritoneal dialysis. Appropriate treatment is essential to reduce adverse outcomes. Available trial evidence about peritoneal dialysis peritonitis treatment was evaluated.

Selection Criteria For Studies

The Cochrane CENTRAL Registry (2005 issue), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), EMBASE (1985 to February 2006), and reference lists were searched to identify randomized trials of treatments for patients with peritoneal dialysis peritonitis.

Interventions

Trials of antibiotics (comparisons of routes, agents, and dosing regimens), fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage, and intraperitoneal immunoglobulin.

Outcomes

Treatment failure, relapse, catheter removal, microbiological eradication, hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and adverse reactions.

Results

36 eligible trials were identified: 30 trials (1,800 patients) of antibiotics; 4 trials (229 patients) of urokinase; 1 trial of peritoneal lavage (36 patients); and 1 trial of intraperitoneal immunoglobulin (24 patients). No superior antimicrobial class was identified. In particular, glycopeptides and first-generation cephalosporins were equivalent (3 trials, 387 patients; relative risk [RR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 3.58). Simultaneous catheter removal/replacement was superior to urokinase at decreasing treatment failures (1 trial, 37 patients; RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.13 to 4.91). Continuous and intermittent intraperitoneal antibiotic dosing were equivalent regarding treatment failure (4 trials, 338 patients; RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.30) and relapse (4 trials, 324 patients; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.39). One trial showed superiority of intraperitoneal antibiotics over intravenous therapy.

Limitations

The method quality of trials generally was suboptimal and outcome definitions were inconsistent. Small patient numbers led to inadequate power to show an effect. Interventions, such as optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, were not evaluated.

Conclusions

Trials did not identify superior antibiotic regimens. Intermittent and continuous antibiotic dosing are equivalent treatment strategies.

### Linking clinical manifestations and causative organisms may provide clues for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^1133M7PF]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found that cloudy dialysis effluent, as the only clinical manifestation at the onset of PDAP, is an independent factor associated with vancomycin sensitivity with high specificity, and PDAP patients with cloudy dialysis effluent as the only manifestation may respond to vancomycin monotherapy as initial management.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^1132Pc7W]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 5.2 – PD: Infectious complications

Guideline 5.2.1 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that exit site infection is suggested by pain, swelling, crusting, erythema and serous discharge; purulent discharge always indicates infection. Swabs should be taken for culture and initial empiric therapy should be with oral antibiotics that will cover S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (1B).

Guideline 5.2.2 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that methicillin resistant organisms (MRSA) will require systemic treatment (e.g. vancomycin) and will need to comply with local infection control policies (1C).

Guideline 5.2.3 – PD infectious complications: Treatment

We recommend that initial treatment regimens for peritonitis should include cover for bacterial Gram positive and Gram negative organisms including Pseudomonas species until result of culture and antibiotic sensitivities are obtained (1C).

### Management of peritoneal dialysisexit-site infection: a case report and literature review [^111krSgL]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a commonly employed modality for kidney replacement therapy both worldwide and in the United States. PD-associated infections include peritonitis, tunnel infections, and exit-site infections (ESI). ESI have a strong association with development of peritonitis, which frequently lead to failure of PD ultrafiltration and solute clearance, increased hospitalizations, and high mortality. Given this, empiric antibiotic therapies targeting the most common gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, are used to treat suspected ESI.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria are acid-fast bacilli that include Mycobacterium abscessus complex. M. abscessus are ubiquitously found in the environment, characterized by rapid growth and intrinsic resistance to common antibiotics. There is a growing body of literature of M. abscessus involvement in PD-associated infections with little consensus in regards to antibiotic choice, duration of treatment, and catheter removal timing. Publications on M. abscessus involved ESI in adults are more limited, with only 2 case reports from the United States. More recently, case reports on M. abscessus ESI have described differing management principles and high rates of complications, highlighting a large knowledge gap and lack of guiding evidence in this disease. – Here we report a case of M. abscessus ESI and discuss current evidence supporting management of this difficult diagnosis.

### Mycobacteria avium-related peritonitis in a patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis: case report and review of the literature [^116kQdZC]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

There have been no large trials to guide the treatment of extrapulmonary MAC infections including MAC peritonitis. The latest International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis guideline on peritonitis suggests individualized protocols for NTM peritonitis based on susceptibility testing and timely PD catheter removal in the setting of suboptimal treatment response, nevertheless, no specific medications are suggested. In addition, the pathogens are not covered by most of the recommended empirical antibiotics for PD-related peritonitis. The experience of treatment for PD-related MAC peritonitis is limited, and relevant antibiotic regimens may be extrapolated from recommendations for other MAC infections. The statement by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America published in 2007 recommends a combination of a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) and ethambutol, with or without a rifamycin (rifabutin or rifampin) to treat disseminated infections. Recently, a panel of international respiratory medicine and infectious diseases societies established a guideline on NTM pulmonary disease. It advocates a 3-drug or 4-drug regimen for severe or refractory MAC lung disease, and the preferred drugs include azithromycin, ethambutol, rifampin, and intravenous amikacin or streptomycin. The optimal antibiotic course remains unaddressed, and it is suggested to be at least 12 months after culture conversion.

### Peritonitis outcomes in patients with HIV and end-stage renal failure on peritoneal dialysis: a prospective cohort study [^111mQRTQ]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is the dialysis modality of choice for many patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a cost-effective option easily implemented in low-resource settings. However, peritonitis presents an ongoing challenge and is a major cause of technical failure, particularly under poor socioeconomic conditions and in immunocompromised patients. Considerable advancement has been made in CAPD management over the last decades leading to a substantial decrease in peritonitis rates, with as few as 1 case/51 patient–months reported by some authors. However, peritonitis remains an important factor influencing CAPD-associated morbidity and mortality, and certain organisms, such as fungi and Gram-negative bacteria, are associated with worse outcomes. Although reports are inconsistent, some of the factors associated with increased peritonitis risks are age, race, sex, comorbidities (diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), socioeconomic status, smoking, higher body mass index (BMI), malnutrition and chronic inflammation.

HIV infection presents a unique challenge in patients with ESRD managed with CAPD. As HIV impairs local host defense mechanisms, the risk of peritonitis in this population may be influenced by the adequacy of viral control and the patient's immunologic state. Furthermore, the protein and amino acid losses frequently observed in CAPD may aggravate the malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia common in HIV infection, which can further compound the risk of peritonitis. The rates of non-communicable diseases such as chronic kidney diseases (CKD) among HIV-positive populations are expected to rise significantly, as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) becomes widely accessible, and life expectancy improves. However, in economically disadvantaged regions such as sub-Saharan Africa where the HIV population is disproportionately concentrated, only a small percentage of those in need are expected to have access to renal replacement therapy. CAPD is a relatively inexpensive, easily learned, and readily implemented dialysis option that does not require complex equipment. As such, it is particularly well suited as a home dialysis modality in regions where dialysis facilities are limited. However, peritonitis may complicate the use of CAPD in patients with ESRD and HIV. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of HIV infection on CAPD-associated peritonitis rates and outcomes, and to assess risk factors associated with the development of peritonitis and technique failure in HAART-treated HIV-positive CAPD populations.

### Peritoneal dialysis-related infection rates and outcomes: results from the peritoneal dialysis outcomes and practice patterns study (PDOPPS) [^115bGCXZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis carries high morbidity for PD patients. Understanding the characteristics and risk factors for peritonitis can guide regional development of prevention strategies. We describe peritonitis rates and the associations of selected facility practices with peritonitis risk among countries participating in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS).

Study Design

Observational prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

7,051 adult PD patients in 209 facilities across 7 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States).

Exposures

Facility characteristics (census count, facility age, nurse to patient ratio) and selected facility practices (use of automated PD, use of icodextrin or biocompatible PD solutions, antibiotic prophylaxis strategies, duration of PD training).

Outcomes

Peritonitis rate (by country, overall and variation across facilities), microbiology patterns.

Analytical Approach

Poisson rate estimation, proportional rate models adjusted for selected patient case-mix variables.

Results

2,272 peritonitis episodes were identified in 7,051 patients (crude rate, 0.28 episodes/patient-year). Facility peritonitis rates were variable within each country and exceeded 0.50/patient-year in 10% of facilities. Overall peritonitis rates, in episodes per patient-year, were 0.40 (95% CI, 0.36–0.46) in Thailand, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.32–0.46) in the United Kingdom, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.30–0.40) in Australia/New Zealand, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.26–0.32) in Canada, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.25–0.30) in Japan, and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24–0.27) in the United States. The microbiology of peritonitis was similar across countries, except in Thailand, where Gram-negative infections and culture-negative peritonitis were more common. Facility size was positively associated with risk for peritonitis in Japan (rate ratio [RR] per 10 patients, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04–1.09). Lower peritonitis risk was observed in facilities that had higher automated PD use (RR per 10 percentage points greater, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–1.00), facilities that used antibiotics at catheter insertion (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–0.99), and facilities with PD training duration of 6 or more (vs < 6) days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68–0.96). Lower peritonitis risk was seen in facilities that used topical exit-site mupirocin or aminoglycoside ointment, but this association did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–1.01).

Limitations

Sampling variation, selection bias (rate estimates), and residual confounding (associations).

Conclusions

Important international differences exist in the risk for peritonitis that may result from varied and potentially modifiable treatment practices. These findings may inform future guidelines in potentially setting lower maximally acceptable peritonitis rates.

### Mycobacterium simiae: a previously undescribed pathogen in peritoneal dialysis peritonitis [^112wpToL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Peritonitis is a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria cause the majority of these infections and usually are amenable to conventional antibiotic therapy, allowing continuation of PD. Mycobacterial and fungal peritonitis represent a more difficult clinical challenge. The infecting organism is often difficult to isolate and can rarely be eradicated without catheter removal. Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to opportunistic infection and, in the context of PD, may have PD peritonitis with different organisms from immunocompetent patients. Here the authors report for the first time PD peritonitis caused by Mycobacterium simiae, a nontuberculous mycobacterium, in a human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient. In addition the difficulty in diagnosing and managing nontuberculous PD peritonitis is discussed.

### Antimicrobial agents to prevent peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^112bc2Mv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A large proportion (15% to 50%) of the end-stage renal disease population are on peritoneal dialysis (PD). The major limitation is peritonitis, which leads to technique failure, hospitalization, and increased mortality. Oral, nasal, and topical antibiotic prophylaxis; exit-site disinfectants; and other antimicrobial interventions are used to prevent it. This study was conducted to assess what evidence supports these approaches.

Methods

The Cochrane CENTRAL Registry, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference lists were searched for randomized trials of antimicrobial agents in patients on PD. Two reviewers extracted data on the number of patients with 1 or more episodes and rates of peritonitis and exit-site and tunnel infection, catheter removal and/or replacement, technique failure, antibiotic toxicity, and all-cause mortality. Analysis was by means of a random-effects model, and results are expressed as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

Nineteen eligible trials (1,949 patients) were identified. Nasal mupirocin compared with placebo significantly reduced the exit-site and tunnel infection rate (1 trial; 2,716 patient-months; RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.85), but not peritonitis rate (1 trial; 2,716 patient-months; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.60). Perioperative intravenous antibiotic therapy compared with no treatment significantly reduced the risk for early peritonitis (4 trials; 335 patients; RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.80), but not exit-site and tunnel infection (3 trials; 114 patients; RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02 to 4.81).

Conclusion

Based on 1 study, nasal mupirocin reduces exit-site and tunnel infection, but not peritonitis. Based on 4 studies, preoperative intravenous prophylaxis reduces early peritonitis, but not exit-site and tunnel infection. No other antimicrobial intervention has proven efficacy. Given the large number of patients on PD therapy and the importance of peritonitis, the lack of adequately powered randomized trials to inform decision making about strategies to prevent peritonitis is striking.

### Peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis: insights from a long-term analysis of an Italian center [^114jLvke]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis represents the leading cause of permanent transfer to hemodialysis (HD). Its occurrence is strongly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, death as well as higher healthcare costs and long-term peritoneal membrane disfunction. Standardization of peritonitis definitions, measures and outcomes is crucial to allow comparative analysis of interventions and delineate benchmarks of performance. In fact, most PD-related peritonitis studies have been using heterogenous definitions as well as variable methods to report and measure outcomes.

According to the latest International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis guidelines (ISPD), PD-related peritonitis can be further classified according to cause, association with catheter implantations, exit-site/tunnel infections, timing in relation to previous episodes and outcomes.

Thus, deeper comprehension concerning the incidence, prevalence, and outcome of cause- and time specific peritonitis in contemporary cohorts is ncessary to develop peritonitis prevention strategies and enhance its treatment.

In addition, to improve and address practice variations on peritonitis prevention strategies and promote its treatment, a better comprehension of the peritonitis causes is also required.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^111TmhsM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The rationale underpinning the guidelines in this section is laid out in a series of documents published by the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis, available on their web-site:

Prevention strategies: The ISPD 2016 PD-related infections guideline, the ISPD 2011 position statement on reducing the incidence of PD-related infections, 2017 ISPD catheter-related infection recommendations and the 2012 ISPD guideline for prevention and treatment of catheter-related infections and peritonitis in paediatric patients receiving PD place increasing emphasis on prevention strategies. Regular audit is essential to this progress with a team approach to quality improvement and the following standards should be considered as minimal:
Peritonitis rates of less than 0.5 episode per patient year in adults and children
A primary cure rate of > 80%
A culture negative rate of < 20%

Patient training to perform PD technique by experienced PD nurses trained to do this as part of a formalised training programme is essential in patients commencing PD. Greater experience of nurses providing training is associated with greater time to initial episode of peritonitis. It is recommended that review of patient PD technique is performed on a regular basis, at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence of inadequate technique or development of PD –related infection, or a significant interruption in the performing PD e.g. after a significant period of hospitalisation). Approaches that have been shown to reduce infection rates in randomised studies include increased intensity of training, use of flush before fill systems, antibiotic prophylaxis to cover catheter insertion and prevention of exit-site infections. Several studies have addressed the latter issue; following demonstration that the risk of Staph aureus exit site infection (the organism most frequently responsible) is associated with pre-existing skin carriage, several randomised studies demonstrated that clinical exit-site infection and associated peritonitis could be reduced by either nasal or exit-site application of mupirocin. This has led to the practice of applying mupirocin to all patients and this approach should be discussed with the local microbiology and infection control team. A systematic review has confirmed the benefits of prophylactic mupirocin in preventing exit-site infections and Staph aureus peritonitis A more recent study, comparing mupirocin with gentamicin cream, found that the latter prevented both Staph aureus and Pseudomonas exit-site infections and peritonitis episodes. This approach should be considered in patients with a known history of Pseudomonas infections; again the policy should be discussed and agreed with the local microbiology team.

### Peritoneal dialysis-related infections [^111hwaZm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents an important treatment choice for patients with kidney failure. It allows them to dialyze outside the hospital setting, facilitating enhanced opportunities to participate in life-related activities, flexibility in schedules, time and cost savings from reduced travel to dialysis centers, and improved quality of life. Despite its numerous advantages, PD utilization has been static or diminishing in parts of the world. PD-related infection, such as peritonitis, exit-site infection, or tunnel infection, is a major concern for patients, caregivers, and health professionals-which may result in hesitation to consider this as treatment or to cease therapy when these complications take place. In this review, the definition, epidemiology, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of PD-related infection on the basis of the contemporary evidence will be described.

### Assessment of current practice and barriers to antimicrobial prophylaxis in peritoneal dialysis patients [^111yewdz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Existing Australasian and international guidelines outline antibiotic and antifungal measures to prevent the development of treatment-related infection in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Practice patterns and rates of PD-related infection vary widely across renal units in Australia and New Zealand and are known to vary significantly from guideline recommendations, resulting in PD technique survival rates that are lower than those achieved in many other countries. The aim of this study was to determine if there is an association between current practice and PD-related infection outcomes and to identify the barriers and enablers to good clinical practice.

Methods

This is a multicentre network study involving eight PD units in Australia and New Zealand, with a focus on adherence to guideline recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis in PD patients. Current practice was established by asking the PD unit heads to respond to a short survey about practice/protocols/policies and a 'process map' was constructed following a face-to-face interview with the primary PD nurse at each unit. The perceived barriers/enablers to adherence to the relevant guideline recommendations were obtained from the completion of 'cause and effect' diagrams by the nephrologist and PD nurse at each unit. Data on PD-related infections were obtained for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.

Results

Perceived barriers that may result in reduced adherence to guideline recommendations included lack of knowledge, procedural lapses, lack of a centralized patient database, patients with non-English speaking background, professional concern about antibiotic resistance, medication cost and the inability of nephrologists and infectious diseases staff to reach consensus on unit protocols. The definitions of PD-related infections used by some units varied from those recommended by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, particularly with exit-site infection (ESI). Wide variations were observed in the rates of ESI (0.06–0.53 episodes per patient-year) and peritonitis (0.31–0.86 episodes per patient-year).

Conclusions

Despite the existence of strongly evidence-based guideline recommendations, there was wide variation in adherence to these recommendations between PD units which might contribute to PD-related infection rates, which varied widely between units. Although individual patient characteristics may account for some of this variability, inconsistencies in the processes of care to prevent infection in PD patients also play a role.

### Infection prevention in home dialysis [^113DmqTV]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Among patients with kidney failure, home dialysis modalities, including peritoneal dialysis (PD) and home hemodialysis (HHD) provide several individual and healthcare system benefits over in-center hemodialysis (HD). Infection remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in this population, and a core outcome of critical importance to patients, caregivers, and kidney health professionals. This narrative review provides evidence-based measures for infection prevention among individuals receiving home dialysis, with a particular emphasis on dialysis and access-related infections.

Recent Findings

Patient and care partner education and training is an important and major theme for infection prevention in home dialysis. In PD, identifying and managing modifiable risk factors for infections such as hypokalemia, constipation, use of gastric acid suppressants, and domestic pets, along with the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis, when indicated, can substantially reduce peritonitis risk. Reducing the use of central venous catheters (CVC), and duration of CVC dependence is the most effective means of prevention of HD access-related bloodstream infections in individuals receiving HHD. For arteriovenous fistula cannulation, rope ladder technique is associated with lower risk of infection compared to buttonhole cannulation.

Summary

Developing and instituting a well structured and evidence-based patient training and education program within home dialysis units is the most important measure in preventing and reducing dialysis and access-related infections. Kidney care providers should be familiar with different infection risk factors among individuals receiving home dialysis.

### Infectious complications in dialysis – epidemiology and outcomes [^112doB2T]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

This Review focuses on the changing epidemiology of infections among patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing dialysis. In particular, bloodstream infections related to vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, are highlighted. Gram-positive (staphylococcal and enterococcal) bloodstream infections and Gram-negative peritonitis (especially extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms) contribute substantially to excess health-care use owing to infection caused by dialysis access. Although the management of peritoneal-dialysis-related peritonitis has been hampered by a dearth of randomized, controlled studies, epidemiological data have provided useful information. To overcome the problem of differing methods used to monitor infections within various dialysis centers, uniform reporting systems for vascular-access-related infection and peritoneal-dialysis-related peritonitis, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, respectively, are discussed. Infections unrelated to the port of entry for dialysis are also examined, namely hepatitis and respiratory infection. To address the disease burden, we examine the infection-related mortality as well as the implications for subsequent cardiovascular mortality.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C in CKD [^116F9hWx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

KDIGO guideline process for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) defines the target population as patients with CKD stages 1 to 5, as well as those on dialysis therapy (HD or peritoneal dialysis) and kidney transplant recipients, and focuses on 5 aspects of management (diagnosis; treatment; preventing transmission in HD facilities; management of infected patients before and after kidney transplantation; and management of kidney diseases associated with HCV infection). For study inclusion, eligible studies evaluated patients with any CKD stage being tested or treated for HCV infection, and for treatment-related topics the work group primarily considered clinical outcomes (including adverse events) or sustained virological response (SVR). A modification of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method was applied to appraise evidence, and recommendations were rated as strong, moderate, or weak based on the quality of evidence and other considerations, including the size of the effect estimate and values and preferences; costs were not formally considered.

### Treatment for peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis [^111hF49b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) that is associated with significant morbidity including death, hospitalisation, and need to change from PD to haemodialysis. Treatment is aimed to reduce morbidity and recurrence. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for PD-associated peritonitis.

Search Methods

For this review update we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to March 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, and handsearching conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the treatment of peritonitis in PD patients (adults and children). We included any study that evaluated: administration of an antibiotic by different routes (e.g. oral, intraperitoneal (IP), intravenous (IV)); dose of an antibiotic agent; different schedules of administration of antimicrobial agents; comparisons of different regimens of antimicrobial agents; any other intervention including fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage and early catheter removal.

Data Collection and Analysis

Multiple authors independently extracted data on study risk of bias and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model. We expressed summarised treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 42 eligible studies in 2433 participants: antimicrobial agents (36 studies); urokinase (4 studies), peritoneal lavage (1 study), and IP immunoglobulin (1 study). We did not identify any optimal antibiotic agent or combination of agents. IP glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) had uncertain effects on primary treatment response, relapse rates, and need for catheter removal compared to first generation cephalosporins, although glycopeptide regimens were more likely to achieve a complete cure (3 studies, 370 episodes: RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.72). For relapsing or persistent peritonitis, simultaneous catheter removal and replacement was better than urokinase at reducing treatment failure rates (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91) although evidence was limited to a single small study. Continuous and intermittent IP antibiotic dosing schedules had similar treatment failure and relapse rates. IP antibiotics were superior to IV antibiotics in reducing treatment failure in one small study (RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.81). Longer duration treatment (21 days of IV vancomycin and IP gentamicin) had uncertain effects on risk of treatment relapse compared with 10 days treatment (1 study, 49 patients: RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.95) although may have increased ototoxicity. In general, review conclusions were based on a small number of studies with few events in which risk of bias was generally high; interventions were heterogeneous, and outcome definitions were often inconsistent. There were no RCTs evaluating optimal timing of catheter removal and data for automated PD were absent.

Authors' Conclusions

Many of the studies evaluating treatment of PD-related peritonitis are small, out-dated, of poor quality, and had inconsistent definitions and dosing regimens. IP administration of antibiotics was superior to IV administration for treating PD-associated peritonitis and glycopeptides appear optimal for complete cure of peritonitis, although evidence for this finding was assessed as low quality. PD catheter removal may be the best treatment for relapsing or persistent peritonitis. Evidence was insufficient to identify the optimal agent, route or duration of antibiotics to treat peritonitis. No specific antibiotic appears to have superior efficacy for preventing treatment failure or relapse of peritonitis, but evidence is limited to few trials. The role of routine peritoneal lavage or urokinase is uncertain.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^111yN7uB]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline — urgent start versus traditional start in adults initiating peritoneal dialysis: For adult patients, the panel suggests traditional start as opposed to urgent start when initiating peritoneal dialysis. (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). Urgent start peritoneal dialysis (PD) is defined as initiation of PD prior to the standard 2 week break-in period after implantation surgery, and the benefits of avoiding bridging hemodialysis (HD) include preservation of vascular access, better outcome after renal transplantation, and lower risk of hepatitis B and C infection. Evidence included a total of nine observational studies comparing urgent start to traditional start, with mortality deemed critical to decision-making. The panel considered the desirable effects of urgent start to be small, though beginning renal replacement therapy urgently may improve clinical status and avoid fluid overload, hyperkalemia, uremia, and even death, while avoiding temporary hemodialysis. In this group there was a lower incidence of late catheter dysfunction and less exit site infection, with late catheter dysfunction estimated 60 fewer events per 1,000 patients (95% CI 119 fewer to 21 more) based on 4 studies with 828 patients.

### Infectious complications of dialysis access devices [^1162tJ4S]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious complications remain a major source of morbidity and mortality for patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. The majority of these complications are related to dialysis access devices, and as such represent a potentially modifiable risk factor. This article reviews the important infectious complications associated with dialysis access, including both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The discussion highlights the epidemiology, management, and prevention of dialysis access infections.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^115xTpMi]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Lay summary

These guidelines cover all aspects of the care of patients who are treated with peritoneal dialysis. This includes equipment and resources, preparation for peritoneal dialysis, and adequacy of dialysis (both in terms of removing waste products and fluid), preventing and treating infections. There is also a section on diagnosis and treatment of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, a rare but serious complication of peritoneal dialysis where fibrotic (scar) tissue forms around the intestine. The guidelines include recommendations for infants and children, for whom peritoneal dialysis is recommended over haemodialysis.

Immediately after the introduction there is a statement of all the recommendations. These recommendations are written in a language that we think should be understandable by many patients, relatives, carers and other interested people. Consequently we have not reworded or restated them in this lay summary. They are graded 1 or 2 depending on the strength of the recommendation by the authors, and A-D depending on the quality of the evidence that the recommendation is based on.

### How should peritoneal-dialysis-associated peritonitis be treated? [^1131dVeB]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

In this Practice Point commentary, we discuss Wiggins et al.'s systematic review of the treatment of peritonitis, a serious problem in peritoneal dialysis patients. Wiggins and co-workers reported that most antibiotic classes were similarly effective for the treatment of peritonitis. Despite the limited data available, the investigators found that the intraperitoneal route was more effective than the intravenous route in preventing treatment failure, that intermittent dosing of various antibiotics was as effective as continuous administration of these drugs, and that glycopeptide-based regimens were more likely than first-generation cephalosporins to achieve a complete cure. Here, we discuss the importance of treating peritonitis and the lack of and limitations of existing data, and emphasize the urgent need for well-designed, large randomized trials in this area.

### Systematic literature review of the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related infection caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria [^1128KsNu]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that it is advisable to promptly perform acid-fast bacilli stain and culture when PD catheter-related infection caused by NTM is suspected. Moreover, temporal catheter removal may be an appropriate management strategy during the early stages of PD catheter-related infection caused by NTM.

### Systematic literature review of the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related infection caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria [^116vBAJq]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The number of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter-related infections and peritonitis caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has been increasing. Nonetheless, the optimal timing for the relocation of the exit site, removal and reinsertion of the PD catheter, prognosis, and duration of antibiotic treatment remain unclear. This literature review aimed to investigate the epidemiology of patient characteristics and evaluate the most effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for PD catheter-related infections and peritonitis caused by NTM. The systematic literature review was conducted on published cases of PD catheter-related infection and peritonitis caused by NTM in PubMed, Embase, and Ichushi databases up to August 2022. A total of 335 cases (64.1%, male; mean age, 53.4 years; mean dialysis duration, 25.4 months) were analyzed. The most common causative agent of infection was Mycobacterium abscessus (40.1%), followed by Mycobacterium fortuitum (24.8%) and Mycobacterium chelonae (16.6%). With respect to diagnosis, 42.9%, 28.1%, and 29.0% of cases were diagnosed as PD catheter-related infection only, peritonitis only, and both, respectively. The initial cultures were positive for NTM only, positive for any other bacteria, and negative for NTM only in 56.5%, 19.8%, and 23.7% of cases, respectively. Ultimately, more than 80% of cases were treated with multiple antibiotics. PD catheter removal was performed in 55.4% of patients with PD catheter-related infections only and 85.5% of those with PD peritonitis. PD continuation or resumption was possible in 62.2% and 16.0% of patients, respectively. In conclusion, our findings indicate that it is advisable to perform acid-fast bacilli stain and culture in order to promptly identify NTM. PD catheter removal may be an essential management strategy during the early stages of NTM infection.

### Infections in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [^116pqThF]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Considering experience acquired in the past years, it seems as though physicians have reached a plateau in the frequency of peritonitis. A peritonitis rate of 1 every 2 patient years may be acceptable. Further reduction of this peritonitis rate will require inordinately large efforts on all fronts. One will have to consider what are the acceptable costs and risks of peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis. New developments in catheter technology, improved connections, better understanding of patient selection and training programs, improved diagnostic and therapeutic methods in the management of peritonitis, and understanding of the infectious and immune processes are eagerly awaited developments.

### Peritonitis outcomes in patients with HIV and end-stage renal failure on peritoneal dialysis: a prospective cohort study [^1163yM7t]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that HIV infection can adversely influence CAPD-associated peritonitis rates, and this association is further modified by the immunological state of the infected patient. The peritonitis risk attributable to HIV infection manifests early in the course of CAPD treatment and increases the risk for subsequent episodes, but it was not shown to result in increased technique failure rates at 18 months. Early detection of CKD and HIV with the initiation of HAART before significant immunological compromise and careful management of comorbid conditions can help minimize the risk. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered and investigated as possible strategies to help improve peritonitis outcomes.
