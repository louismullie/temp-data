## Question

How long can TPN be given

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be given. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context and whether we are talking about inpatient short-term TPN versus home TPN for chronic intestinal failure. Then, I should verify guideline-based thresholds for when to start TPN and how long to continue it. Next, I will examine access-related constraints that limit duration by route. After that, I need to review safety and complication risks that scale with duration. Finally, I will synthesize practical duration ranges by scenario and outline weaning criteria and monitoring needs to keep patients safe as duration extends.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame, because duration depends on why TPN is being used and where it is delivered. Short-term inpatient TPN is typically for acute illness with expected return of gut function, whereas home TPN addresses chronic intestinal failure where enteral nutrition is not feasible long term; I should not conflate these scenarios when estimating "how long" TPN can be given, since the former spans days to weeks and the latter can extend months to years with appropriate infrastructure and monitoring [^113knPsr].

> Next, I should review when to start TPN, because duration is partly a function of timing. For well-nourished, stable adults who cannot meet at least half of estimated needs enterally, guidelines suggest initiating TPN after about 7 days. For nutritionally at-risk adults, earlier initiation around 3–5 days is reasonable. For severely malnourished patients, start as soon as feasible once metabolic stability is addressed. In critically ill ICU patients, consider supplemental PN after 7–10 days if enteral intake remains inadequate. In pediatrics, delays of about a week may be appropriate in self-limited illness, but initiation within 1–3 days is advised when extended enteral nonuse is anticipated. In postoperative ileus, many surgical groups recommend TPN when the gut is nonfunctioning beyond 7 days, including preoperative starvation time, and only if at least a week of TPN is anticipated to be needed [^115wBN1J] [^112BJrsv] [^1171ufva] [^111FWg4U] [^115bbo89].

> Hold on, I should verify access-related duration limits because the venous route constrains how long TPN can be delivered safely. Peripheral parenteral nutrition is generally limited to about 10–14 days due to osmolarity constraints and phlebitis risk; formulations should stay under roughly 900 mOsm/L, and some data suggest tolerance up to about 15 days in select adults, but standard guidance still advises transitioning to central access if longer therapy is expected; central venous access via PICC, tunneled catheter, or implanted port supports longer courses and is the backbone of home TPN, with device selection tailored to expected duration and infection risk [^117Qg4Vk] [^1157hK7p] [^112PpLMm].

> I will now examine short-term inpatient durations to anchor expectations. In U.S. hospitals, average PN durations hover around 6–7 days in adults, with slightly longer in neonatal ICUs. Clinically, many inpatient courses span 1–2 weeks as a bridge while enteral access or tolerance is restored. In surgical contexts such as enterocutaneous fistula, spontaneous closure often occurs within about 25 days, aligning with a several-week TPN horizon in select cases. Critically ill patients may receive supplemental PN for roughly 6–8 days in trials once initiated after day 7, reflecting common ICU practice patterns [^115An9u3] [^113knPsr] [^1171ufva].

> Let me consider long-term and home TPN, where duration can extend far beyond the hospital. For chronic intestinal failure, home TPN is standard and may be lifelong. Pediatric series describe multi-year dependence with substantial liver complication risk, underscoring the need for specialized teams. Adults on HPN are often transitioned to cyclic infusions over 10–14 hours to support daytime activities. In advanced cancer with malignant bowel obstruction, expert groups suggest limiting HPN to carefully selected patients with an expected survival of about 2–3 months, balancing benefit and burden. Observational cohorts of in-hospital intestinal failure requiring TPN show approximately 58% survival at a mean of 1.5 years, illustrating that TPN duration often tracks with disease severity rather than an arbitrary cap [^113knPsr] [^116bog55] [^111b9Fz7] [^117BXdYG] [^116KA7Bw].

> Wait, let me verify the safety signals that scale with duration, because these influence how long TPN should continue. TPN-associated liver injury can emerge within 1–2 weeks and progresses with longer exposure, particularly in infants; histologic abnormalities including steatosis, cholestasis, and fibrosis are well described and correlate with duration and lipid composition; hyperglycemia is common and independently associated with complications and mortality; catheter-related bloodstream infection risk rises with caloric load and central access duration; in diabetes, longer TPN duration increases hypoglycemia risk when insulin is used; these risks do not impose a universal maximum duration but mandate vigilant monitoring and mitigation strategies as therapy extends [^116Ai39D] [^111za1Fp] [^113q4Cz3] [^1117Q828] [^112ZB5bo].

> I should double-check weaning criteria and transition planning, because duration is also bounded by when enteral nutrition becomes feasible. PN should be weaned as soon as oral or enteral intake reliably provides 50–75% of goal without feeding intolerance; in home settings, cycling and gradual tapering are standard, and abrupt discontinuation is generally tolerated in adults once steady-state glucose needs are accounted for; for infants, to avoid rebound hypoglycemia, a 5% dextrose infusion is advised when hypertonic dextrose is stopped abruptly; multidisciplinary oversight is essential to coordinate access, prescriptions, and monitoring during transitions [^111GTpf4] [^111b9Fz7] [^112zerd5] [^114C8cTb].

> Let me synthesize practical duration ranges by scenario, while acknowledging exceptions. Very short-term inpatient TPN often spans 3–7 days as a bridge. Standard inpatient courses commonly last 1–2 weeks. Peripheral PN is generally capped at 10–14 days before switching to central access. Condition-specific courses may extend 3–4 weeks, such as postoperative ileus or enterocutaneous fistula. Home TPN for chronic intestinal failure may continue for months to years, and in select palliative contexts is typically limited to patients with an expected 2–3 month survival. These ranges are consistent with guideline timing thresholds and observational utilization data [^115An9u3] [^117Qg4Vk] [^113knPsr] [^117BXdYG].

> But wait, what if the question is "how long is too long" rather than "how long can it be given". I need to ensure the answer emphasizes that there is no absolute maximum duration; rather, duration should be driven by indication, access safety, metabolic tolerance, and the feasibility of enteral transition, with continuous reassessment for ongoing net benefit; this is precisely why consensus statements and home PN guidance focus on indications, monitoring, and timely transition rather than arbitrary time limits [^111wT6JJ] [^117TzwLk].

> Finally, I should confirm the operational guardrails that make longer durations safer. Standardized processes, dedicated nutrition support teams, and competency-based prescribing reduce complications. Routine monitoring of liver tests, glucose, electrolytes, and catheter integrity should intensify with longer TPN courses. In pediatrics, specialized HPN programs and experienced centers improve outcomes. These system-level measures are especially critical when TPN extends beyond the hospital and into the home setting [^114C8cTb] [^114ZUKiK] [^116FKqfz].

TPN can be given for **days to years**, depending on the patient's clinical condition, nutritional needs, and access device. Short-term TPN is typically used for **7–14 days** when enteral feeding is not feasible [^115An9u3], while long-term TPN is indicated for chronic intestinal failure or malabsorption syndromes [^111oC8cA]. The duration is limited by **complications** such as catheter-related infections, metabolic disturbances, and liver disease [^1117Q828] [^111za1Fp]; therefore, continuous monitoring and regular reassessment are essential [^117TzwLk]. TPN should be discontinued as soon as enteral nutrition is feasible to minimize risks [^111GTpf4].

---

## Indications for TPN

TPN is indicated when the gastrointestinal tract is **nonfunctional or inaccessible** for an extended period [^1176X85G]. Common indications include:

- **Short-term TPN**: Postoperative ileus, severe acute pancreatitis, prolonged NPO status, or critical illness [^115bbo89] [^112BJrsv] [^1171ufva].

- **Long-term TPN**: Chronic intestinal failure, severe malabsorption syndromes, short bowel syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis [^113knPsr] [^111oC8cA].

---

## Duration of TPN therapy

The duration of TPN therapy varies based on the **underlying condition** and the patient's nutritional needs:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Typical duration** | **Access device** |
|-|-|-|
| Short-term TPN | 7–14 days | Peripheral IV catheter or PICC line [^114oNg9b] [^112PpLMm] |
| Long-term TPN | Months to years | Tunneled central venous catheter or implanted port [^112PpLMm] |
| Home TPN | Months to years | Tunneled central venous catheter or implanted port [^113YwTDa] |

---

## Complications associated with prolonged TPN

Prolonged TPN is associated with several **significant complications**, including:

- **Catheter-related infections**: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a major concern, with reported rates ranging from 20% to 30% [^notfound].

- **Metabolic disturbances**: Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and refeeding syndrome are common [^113q4Cz3] [^113BDkpR].

- **Liver complications**: TPN-associated liver disease (TPALD), including steatosis, cholestasis, and fibrosis, can develop with prolonged use [^111za1Fp] [^116bog55].

- **Bone disease**: Long-term TPN can lead to metabolic bone disease due to calcium and vitamin D deficiencies [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management of TPN

Continuous monitoring and regular reassessment are essential to minimize complications and ensure **optimal nutrition**. Key aspects include:

- **Regular laboratory monitoring**: Electrolytes, liver function tests, renal function, glucose levels, and trace elements should be monitored frequently [^116STTA7].

- **Catheter care**: Strict aseptic technique, regular dressing changes, and infection prevention protocols are critical [^113YwTDa].

- **Nutrition reassessment**: Regular evaluation of nutritional status and adjustment of TPN composition as needed [^111wT6JJ].

- **Transition to enteral nutrition**: TPN should be gradually reduced and discontinued as soon as enteral nutrition becomes feasible [^111GTpf4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **individualized decision-making** and regular reassessment of TPN therapy. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) provides comprehensive recommendations on the initiation, monitoring, and discontinuation of TPN, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary care and patient-specific considerations [^114C8cTb] [^111wT6JJ].

---

## Conclusion

TPN can be administered for varying durations, from short-term use in acute settings to long-term or lifelong therapy in chronic conditions. The duration is determined by the patient's clinical condition, nutritional needs, and the presence of complications. Continuous monitoring, regular reassessment, and adherence to clinical guidelines are essential to ensure **safe and effective TPN therapy** [^114hQXXP].

### Parenteral nutrition… [^116STTA7]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Nutrition is essential to health and can be provided via the bloodstream if necessary. Nutrition. Adequate hydration must be provided, but many patients can be without nutrition for up to 7 days. However, depending on the circumstances, nutrition might need to be started sooner. Short-term Nutrition. If a patient is expected to need nutrition for a short time, peripheral parenteral nutrition can be provided for a few days. This type of nutrition is fat-based and does not contain full carbohydrates, so it provides only part of the nutrients that a patient needs in a given day and should be used only as a temporary solution. The main advantage to this type of nutrition is that it can be given through an intravenous line. Peripheral parenteral nutrition can be given continuously throughout the day and night or it can be cyclic.

Patients cannot receive PPN at home. Long-term Nutrition If patients are unable to tolerate enteral nutrition for longer than a few days, total parenteral nutrition can provide all the types of nutrients that a patient needs. Although TPN provides complete nutritional support, it contains a large amount of carbohydrates, which can damage small veins. Therefore, it cannot be given through an IV line and instead needs to be given through a line placed into the large veins near the heart. These lines include a peripherally inserted central catheter line, which is usually inserted in the arm; a temporary central line, inserted in the neck or chest; or a long-term tunneled catheter or implanted port, inserted in the chest. Like PPN, TPN can be given continuously or can be cyclic. An advantage of TPN is that patients can continue to receive it at home; however, there is a risk of serious infection associated with central lines.

In contrast, nutrition that is absorbed through the gut is used by the body depending on its needs. It can take several days to adjust parenteral nutrition to a patient's specific needs. Requirements can change from day to day, and severe electrolyte disturbances can occur. Patients need frequent blood tests to make sure that their nutrition is safe. In the hospital, TPN must be specially prepared each day. Once an appropriate recipe is achieved, a patient can go home, and adjustments can be made as needed on a weekly basis.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^111FWg4U]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for parenteral nutrition, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (indications), ASPEN 2017 guidelines recommend to consider delaying PN for 1 week in neonates with a self-limited illness. Initiate PN within 1–3 days when it is evident that full oral intake or enteral nutrition will not be tolerated for an extended period.

### A commentary on the 2015 Canadian clinical practice guidelines in glutamine supplementation to parenteral nutrition [^116CJgrh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

From my point of view, four articles that led to changes in the Canadian Nutrition Guidelines did not actually report changes in clinical outcomes relevant to Gln supplementation in TPN. Such outcomes include mortality rates, LOS, and infections. None of the articles reported any negative findings. I believe that even though these well-designed studies give important clinical evidence, a more rigorous and critical evaluation is required to support appropriate decisions in future guidelines.

### How to define parenteral nutrition [^114UqsZZ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Developing a precise PN definition is challenging. On the one hand, any substrate (glucose, amino acid, lipid) delivered intravenously, independent of the amount and indication, are parenteral nutrients that could be considered PN. On the other hand, from the perspective of sustaining life over an extended period of time, PN would be defined as covering the body's requirement for all macro- and micro-nutrients. Therefore, another relevant question arises: Should supplemental PN (SPN), used in conjunction with oral or enteral intake, be defined differently regarding its composition? With such differentiation, PN administered together with EN is not always considered SPN when capturing different feeding routes in studies or databases.

Taken together, despite a simple initial definition of PN that seemed intuitively clear to most clinicians, a precise, unified definition for data comparison in clinical studies is not available and needs to be developed. The above definition, retrospectively applied to the GUTPHOS study, should only be understood as a compromise aiming at unifying results from different sites in a particular study rather than a consensus definition proposal. We wish to draw attention to varying interpretations of "PN" as a pitfall hindering comparisons between sites or studies. We call critical care and nutrition societies for a joint effort to find a global consensus on a detailed definition of PN.

### Clinical-practice recommendations for the management of bowel obstruction in patients with end-stage cancer [^11547hHj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

The paper highlights a series of questions that doctors need to consider when faced with end-stage cancer patients with bowel obstruction: Is the patient fit for surgery? Is there a place for stenting? Is it necessary to use a venting nasogastric tube (NGT) in inoperable patients? What drugs are indicated for symptom control, what is the proper route for their administration and which can be administered in association? When should a venting gastrostomy be considered? What is the role of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and parenteral hydration (PH)? A working group was established to review issues relating to bowel obstruction in end-stage cancer and to make recommendations for management. A steering group was established by the (multidisciplinary) Board of Directors of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) to select members of the expert panel, who were required to have specific clinical and research interests relating to the topic and to have published significant papers on advanced cancer patients in the last 5 years, or to have particular clinical expertise that is recognised internationally. The final constitution of this group was approved by the Board of the EAPC. This Working Group was made up of English, French and Italian physicians involved in the field of palliative care for advanced and terminal cancer patients; and of English, American and Italian surgeons who also specialized in artificial nutrition (Dr. Bozzetti) and a professor of health economics. We applied a systematic review methodology that showed the relative lack of RCTs in this area and the importance of retrospective and clinical reports from different authors in different countries. The brief was to review published data but also to provide clinical opinion where data were lacking. The recommendations reflect specialist clinical practice in the countries represented. Each member of the group was allocated a specific question and briefed to review the literature and produce a position paper on the indications, advantages and disadvantages of each symptomatic treatment. The position papers were circulated and then debated at a meeting held in Athens and attended by all panel members. The group reviewed all the available data, discussed the evidence and discussed what practical recommendations could be derived from it. An initial outline of the results of the review and recommendations was produced. Where there were gaps in the evidence, consensus was achieved by debate. Only unanimous conclusions have been incorporated. Subsequently the recommendations were drawn together by Carla Ripamonti (Chairperson) and Robert Twycross (Co-Chair) and refined with input from all panel members. The recommendations have been endorsed by the Board of Directors of the EAPC. It was concluded that surgery should not be undertaken routinely in patients with poor prognostic criteria, such as intra-abdominal carcinomatosis, poor performance status and massive ascites. A nasogastric tube should be used only as a temporary measure. Medical measures such as analgesics, anti-secretory drugs and anti-emetics should be used alone or in combination to relieve symptoms. A venting gastrostomy should be considered if drugs fail to reduce vomiting to an acceptable level. TPN should be considered only for patients who may die of starvation rather than from tumour spread. PH is sometimes indicated to correct nausea, whereas regular mouth care is the treatment of choice for dry mouth. A collaborative approach involving both surgeons and physicians can offer patients an individualized and appropriate symptom management plan.

### Patterns and problems of adult total parenteral nutrition use in US academic medical centers… [^116juq4Q]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

The amounts of amino acids and glucose given, when referred to body cell mass in the male and female patients, were equivalent. In 26% of the institutions surveyed, the amounts of glucose given in TPN were high enough to produce a respiratory quotient greater than 1.
0. A standard TPN formula was derived as
4. 25% amino acids, 15% dextrose, and 20% fat emulsion, at a rate to provide required calories. One clue to the mechanism of adverse effects of TPN was found by Guenst and Nelson4 in a correlation between rate of glucose infusion and, by indirect calorimetry, the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed, or the respiratory quotient. An RQ greater than 1. 0 signifies net lipogenesis, a futile metabolic event in a malnourished, hypermetabolic patient whose priorities for energy expenditure do not include fat synthesis. In a patient weighing 70 kg and receiving 35 mL/kg or 2.

5 L/d of TPN containing 25% glucose, the glucose infusion rate would be
6. 1 mg/kg of glucose per minute. This is much larger than the maximum values reported by Guenst and Nelson4 to be associated with an RQ greater than 1. 0 and can also result in hyperglycemia. 5, 6. Many pharmacies, including members of the UHC, use a stock amino acid solution of
8. **5% amino acids, diluted 1**: 1 with dextrose solution. The final amino acid concentration obtained is, therefore, 4. 25%. A standard TPN solution would be 4. 25% amino acids and 15% dextrose plus fat, usually 200 mL of a 20% fat emulsion, to provide the remaining required calories. At the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, prior to 1988 the usual glucose concentration in TPN was 25%. This decreased to 20% approximately 5 years ago and to 15% 2 years ago, for the reasons previously outlined. Our present standard TPN formula is 4.

25% amino acids, 15% dextrose with 200 mL of 20% fat emulsion, all in one, at a rate to provide required calories.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^116EYcp8]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Patients on Enteral/Parenteral Nutrition

Three doses of insulin such as basal, meal-related, and correctional insulins are administered in patients on continuous/bolus enteral or parenteral nutrition. In patients on continuous enteral feedings, the basal insulin dose is based on the patient's preadmission basal insulin dose or 30–50% of the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin or 5 units of NPH/insulin detemir subcutaneously every 12 h or 10 units of insulin glargine every 24 h. The dose of meal-related insulin is calculated as 1 unit of insulin for every 10–15 g carbohydrate per day administered as Regular insulin every 6 h or rapid-acting insulin every 4 h. Correctional insulin should also be administered SC every 6 h using human regular insulin or every 4 h using a rapid-acting insulin such as insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine. For patients receiving enteral bolus feedings, approximately 1 unit of Regular human insulin or rapid-acting insulin per 10–15 g carbohydrate should be given SC before each feeding. Correctional insulin coverage should be added as needed before each feeding. For patients receiving parenteral nutrition, Regular insulin may be added to the solution, particularly if 20 units of correctional insulin have been required in the past 24 h. A starting dose of 1 unit of human regular insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate is recommended, to be adjusted daily in the solution. Correctional insulin should be administered SC. Table 9 shows insulin dosing for enteral/parenteral nutrition.

Insulin Therapy in Patients in Their Home Setting

The patients are usually stabilized on the target blood glucose levels before discharge from hospital. Management of insulin therapy while the patient is at home includes education about insulin regimens, appropriate choice of regimen, scheduling regular blood glucose monitoring, awareness on hypoglycemic symptoms and their management, contact details of the health care worker in the nearest health care facility in case of emergency, and a regular follow-up within 10–14 days' time.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^112GH3xv]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition — administrative and policy-focused issues: The validity of the recommendation that when multilumen central venous access device (CVAD) is used for PN, one lumen of the device should be dedicated exclusively for the PN administration should be confirmed, and whether it is acceptable to administer PN through a lumen previously used for other infusions remains unanswered with no research examining this issue. There is a continued debate on the cutoff on osmolarity for peripheral PN. The recommendation from ASPEN and the Infusion Nurses Society is to limit peripheral PN to a maximum osmolarity of 900 mOsm/L.

Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) — adult recommendations advise: Consider home PN (HPN) for patients with intestinal failure who are clinically stable and able to receive therapy outside an acute care setting; perform a thorough evaluation of medical and psychosocial factors that influence suitability for HPN; and address financial considerations/insurance coverage and patient responsibilities with patient and caregiver. Pediatric recommendations state: Consider HPN for carefully selected, clinically stable pediatric patients who are expected to require PN for an extended period; and discharge all pediatric patients to the care of a pediatric home care team and infusion provider with pediatric experience.

Parenteral nutrition consensus recommendations — scope and strength — state that, in contrast to clinical practice guidelines developed by ASPEN, the strength of evidence does not support GRADE level recommendations and instead relies on weaker supporting literature, expert opinion, and consensus recommendations; the recommendations appear as concrete action statements without qualifiers such as 'shall', 'should', or 'may'; they are not clinical guidelines as defined by ASPEN and are designed to identify best practices, guide day-to-day clinical decisions, reduce variations in practice, and enhance patient safety; and they are not intended to supersede the judgment of the healthcare professional based on the circumstances of the individual patient.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for parenteral nutrition, more specifically with respect to peripheral PN, ASPEN 2017 guidelines recommend to use peripheral PN only for short-term purposes, no more than 10–14 days, as supplemental PN or as a bridge therapy during transition periods, where oral intake or enteral nutrition is suboptimal or clinical circumstances do not justify placing central venous access devices.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^114oNg9b]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral parenteral nutrition (PN) — clinical parameters and selection criteria include maximum osmolarity = 900 mOsm/L and expected duration 10–14 d or less. Peripheral access is associated with increased rates of phlebitis, and extravasation of nutrient admixtures can lead to tissue injury and necrosis. Nutrient delivery is constrained: it requires relatively large fluid volumes, formulation cannot be concentrated, typically relies on lipid as a greater proportion of energy, and osmolarity constraints may restrict electrolyte content. Candidates should be able to tolerate fluid volume of 2.5–3 L/d for adults, 120–125 mL/kg/d for neonates and 1.5 times maintenance needs for pediatric patients.

The early development of total parenteral nutrition and its evolution as an adjunct to the nutritional, metabolic, and antineoplastic therapy of cancer patients is described. Examples related to the sine wave of responses to new data and discovery are placed in context to understand better past, present, and how and where to proceed in the future to achieve optimal results from multimodal comprehensive management of patients with malignancies. Practical and philosophic thoughts are proffered to justify continued, intensified, logical, controlled clinical studies directed toward establishing the most rational, safe, and effective use of total parenteral nutrition in treating patients with cancer.

Parenteral nutrition

Suggestions:
HPN may be beneficial and maintain the quality of life in a very selected group of patients with MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: D).
Central venous access is preferred for HPN delivery (level III, grade: B).
In end-of-life HPN, should be discontinued (or not initiated) as it raises the risk of complications and may prolong suffering (level of evidence: V; grade: D).

The following terms are used to describe parenteral nutrition: "total parenteral nutrition" (TPN): nutrition administered exclusively intravenously; "supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN)": nutrition administered intravenously and enterally, regardless of proportion, orally or by artificial access; and "home parenteral nutrition" (HPN): parenteral nutrition (regardless TPN or SPN) administered at home.

Feeding through the peripheral veins may cause phlebitis and the need for the reintroduction of vein access. It may cause patient suffering and require additional medical procedures. Feeding through the central veins (e.g. Broviac catheter, vascular access port, peripherally inserted central catheter) is advised, as it ensures long-term safe access upon the strict aseptic protocol is followed.

Most studies assessing the role of the parenteral nutrition are retrospective. A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effectiveness of HPN in survival and quality of life in patients with inoperable MBO. Thirteen studies (all observational with a high risk of bias), including 721 participants were included. The median survival intervals were variable, between 15 to 155 days. Only three studies reported validated quality of life measures, showing equivocal results (one study reported improvements during the first three months and two studies showed an equal number of patients with improved and deteriorated quality of life).

Circumstances where PN is the preferred method of nutrition support — Use PN in patients who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition when a contraindication to EN exists or the patient does not tolerate adequate EN or lacks sufficient bowel function to maintain or restore nutrition status. Initiate PN for total or supplemental nutrition provision if EN is not feasible or not sufficient to meet total nutrient needs.

### Total parenteral nutrition therapy and liver injury: a histopathologic study with clinical correlation [^111za1Fp]. Human Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy is a well-recognized cause of liver injury. The histologic changes attributed to TPN in the literature vary widely. In this study, we describe the histopathologic changes associated with TPN therapy and relate these changes to various clinical parameters. We conducted a retrospective study of 89 patients who underwent biopsy or liver transplantation while on TPN. We report that (1) ductopenia, a previously unreported finding, is seen in a significant number of patients on TPN. It is more frequently seen in patients with low stage of fibrosis and may have an inverse relationship with the length of therapy; (2) Perivenular fibrosis is a feature frequently seen in patients with high-stage portal fibrosis. In fact, we find the combination of portal and perivenular fibrosis to be a characteristic of TPN injury; (3) Infants are more susceptible to TPN-related hepatocellular injury, are more likely to develop fibrosis, and progress to high-stage fibrosis more rapidly than older children and adults; (4) Cholestasis, although more common in infants, is the most common pathologic finding in all age groups; (5) Steatosis is more commonly seen in older children and adults than in infants; (6) Progression to fibrosis in infants may be dependent on the length of therapy and the underlying disease for which TPN is administered; and (7) Clinical markers of liver injury (eg, elevated liver enzymes) do not predict the degree of hepatocellular injury or fibrosis, and therefore, serial biopsies may be indicated for patients on TPN therapy.

### Sodium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and sodium acetate anhydrous (TPN electrolytes) [^115Mw4oh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

One 20 mL volume of TPN Electrolytes (multiple electrolyte additive) is added to each liter of amino acid/dextrose solution. Alternatively, the TPN Electrolytes can be added to the bottle of amino acids or concentrated dextrose, to permit addition of the necessary phosphate additive to the remaining bottle. This latter technique helps avoid physical incompatibilities between calcium and phosphorus. A potassium phosphate additive is recommended for addition to nutritional solutions containing TPN Electrolytes. Between 10 and 30 mEq of potassium (as phosphate) should be added per liter of TPN solution, to augment the 20 mEq of potassium provided by TPN Electrolytes.

Between two and three liters of TPN solution with added TPN Electrolytes are usually administered daily to adults. Solutions are given continuously over the entire 24-hour period at a constant rate, ranging from 83 to 125 mL/hour. TPN solutions containing TPN Electrolytes and concentrated dextrose are administered intravenously, through a central venous catheter.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) duration considerations include that "Irreversible gastrointestinal dysfunction can lead to long-term — even lifelong — dependence on HPN, but briefer courses of HPN are often appropriate". Surgical complications may merit shorter courses, as "Patients with complex surgical problems, such as an enterocutaneous fistula, may benefit from a more limited course of HPN", and "For instance, on average, spontaneous closure of an enterocutaneous fistula takes place in 25 days for patients receiving PN". In palliative care, "a 2- to 3-month expected survival is commonly used to identify candidates who are likely to benefit from HPN".

FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Typically, TrophAmine® is admixed with 50% or 70% Dextrose Injection USP supplemented with electrolytes and vitamins and administered over a period of time not to exceed 24 hours.

Total daily fluid intake should be appropriate for the patient's age and size. A fluid dose of 125 mL per kilogram body weight per day is appropriate for most infants on TPN. Although nitrogen requirements may be higher in severely hypercatabolic or depleted patients, provision of additional nitrogen may not be possible due to fluid intake limits, nitrogen, or glucose intolerance.

Cysteine is considered to be an essential amino acid in infants and young pediatric patients. An admixture of cysteine hydrochloride to the TPN solution is therefore recommended. Based on clinical studies, the recommended dosage is 1 mmole of L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate per kilogram of body weight per day.

In many patients, provision of adequate calories in the form of hypertonic dextrose may require the administration of exogenous insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and glycosuria. To prevent rebound hypoglycemia, a solution containing 5% dextrose should be administered when hypertonic dextrose solutions are abruptly discontinued.

Fat emulsion coadministration should be considered when prolonged (more than 5 days) parenteral nutrition is required in order to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (E.F. A.D.). Serum lipids should be monitored for evidence of E.F. A.D. in patients maintained on fat free TPN.

Parenteral or nonvolitional enteral nutrition — evidence summary: A 1990 meta-analyses of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in patients receiving chemotherapy reported that TPN was associated with reduced survival and increased infectious complications, and the authors concluded, "Routine use of TPN in patients undergoing chemotherapy should be strongly discouraged". A 2019 systematic review in advanced cancer included observational studies and two RCTs, both of which enrolled fewer patients than planned. One 2019 trial of 47 patients with incurable GI cancer noted an improvement in fat-free mass at week 12 but not at weeks 6, 18, or 24, while a 2014 trial in 31 patients with terminal cancer found parenteral nutrition did not significantly improve overall survival; the overall evidence from RCTs and observational studies was deemed "weak". In a 2004 RCT enrolling more than 300 patients losing weight, a palliative intervention including supplemental oral nutrition and home parenteral nutrition increased caloric intake but did not improve body composition (per DXA) or survival.

Study of the intervention

A pre-intervention and post-intervention analysis assessed adherence to protocols, formulation accuracy and preparation compliance. Data from audits and observations were analysed using PDSA cycles, with feedback sessions to address confounders. Comparisons with past NICU data ensured improvements were intervention-driven.

PDSA cycles

For each PDSA cycle, we explicitly describe the planning, implementation, evaluation and actions taken for sustainability, summarised in online supplemental table 1.

PDSA cycle 1: transitioning TPN preparation to residents and fellows

Though standard guidelines for TPN existed (NICE 2020, ESPGHAN 2018), they did not specifically address preparation and administration practices. In our unit, considerable inconsistencies were observed in these processes, and baseline adherence was only 10%. The first step was to formulate a structured unit protocol for TPN preparation and administration that detailed who would prepare TPN (trained residents and fellows instead of nurses), how it would be prepared (under a UV-exposed laminar flow hood using a standardised 11-step checklist and individualised formulations, with amino acids mixed with dextrose-electrolyte solutions and lipids administered separately) and when it would be prepared (once daily in a coordinated session). A structured training programme was delivered through hands-on demonstrations, video tutorials and written guides; this was conducted in two batches to accommodate clinical duties, with monthly reinforcement sessions for residents and Level III nurses. Adherence was assessed using the 11-step checklist (online supplemental file 2), which covered eligibility, preparation, labelling and administration steps and was completed through direct observation with real-time feedback. Within 2 weeks, adherence improved to 79%, accompanied by better workflow efficiency, reduced preparation time and greater acceptance of the protocol. The intervention was subsequently adopted into routine practice, supported by ongoing education and continuous monitoring.

PDSA cycle 2: introduction of TPN calculator

Manual TPN calculations often led to inconsistencies and potential errors. To standardise formulations and improve accuracy, an Excel-based TPN calculator was developed. Following structured training, residents and fellows used the tool during a 2-week testing phase for daily TPN preparation. Protocol adherence improved from 76.7% in week 3 to 85.7% in week 4. The calculator enhanced dosage accuracy, minimised calculation errors and increased user confidence. Based on these positive outcomes, it was integrated into routine practice, with periodic updates planned based on user feedback.

### Limited long-term survival after in-hospital intestinal failure requiring total parenteral nutrition [^116KA7Bw]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is an invasive and advanced rescue feeding technique that has acceptable short-term survival although at costs of substantial risks. Survival after the clinical use of TPN > 6 mo is unknown.

Objective

We determined long-term survival after clinical TPN use in a consecutive cohort who were attending an academic hospital.

Design

The study included a prospective cohort with a retrospective analysis of all 537 consecutive episodes of TPN in 437 patients between January 2010 and April 2012. Follow-up was until October 2013 with a total follow-up of 608 patient-years. Survival was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression.

Results

Survival was 58% in 437 patients with a first-time use of TPN at an average of 1.5 y after the initiation of TPN. The mortality rate was 30 deaths/100 patient-years. Older age, admission at an intensive care unit or a nonsurgical department, lower body mass index, and an underlying malignancy were positively associated with mortality.

Conclusion

TPN use, if correctly indicated, is a clinical sign of intestinal failure and a surrogate marker for markedly increased risk of mortality even > 1.5 y after TPN use. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02189993 with protocol identification name TPN-01.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^1162swmp]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition — patient and disease-focused research priorities: It remains unknown how long a patient can withstand an absence of nutrient intake before detrimental clinical effects may ensue, and future research should address the time course when nutrition support therapy should be initiated to prevent adverse clinical outcomes. The optimal timing of PN provision soon after birth in more mature preterm infants and strategies in improving their clinical outcomes require further investigation, and well-designed prospective research to address the optimal timing to initiate PN therapy in pediatric patients when enteral nutrition (EN) is not feasible should be conducted. With the increased provision of protein energy, especially in obese critically ill patients, concerns exist regarding the safest maximum dose of parenteral amino acids; research should assess short-term and long-term benefit of PN with high amino acid provision, evaluate nitrogen balance or amino acid utilization if possible, and carefully evaluate safety, patient tolerability, and cost-effectiveness, preferably in prospective clinical trials. The impact of optimal serum glucose control, protection of the vascular access device, and attention to relative distribution of macronutrients on PN safety outcomes need to be explored for adult, pediatric, and neonatal populations. Further research to clearly define the optimal use of PN, including when and strategy to initiate PN, is urgently needed for PN in the acute phase of critical illness, intradialytic PN, home PN in obese patients, PN use in the palliative care setting, PN use in patients receiving chemotherapy, and PN administration in the presence of bacteremia or fungemia not related to the central venous access device (CVAD).

### Depletion of phytosterols from intravenous lipid emulsions: to be or not to be [^114nHGgV]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) results in the development of intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). Fligor et al. have depleted phytosterols from soy-based intravenous lipid emulsions in an attempt to prevent IFALD. Animal studies describe the mechanism of hepatotoxicity of phytosterols, while studies in patients associate high phytosterols with the severity of liver disease. Yet, there are unanswered questions on how much IFALD could be attributed to phytosterols. Challenges to using a phytosterol-depleted ILE include the possibility of the development of oxidation by-products in the lipid, higher cost in the face of as yet unknown clinical benefit from phytosterol depletion and challenges in performing randomised controlled trials to validate the efficacy of newer ILEs.

### Hyperglycemia during total parenteral nutrition: an important marker of poor outcome and mortality in hospitalized patients [^113BDkpR]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia relate to alterations in immune functions and inflammatory response. Hyperglycemia impairs leukocyte function, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis. Hyperglycemia also increases counterregulatory hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress, which can lead to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular complications. In addition to hyperglycemia, the administration of Intralipid in TPN solutions may worsen clinical outcome. Intralipid infusion, a soybean oil-based emulsion rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, has been associated with exaggerated inflammatory response, immunosuppression, insulin resistance, increased blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.

In summary, TPN-induced hyperglycemia is associated with increased length of hospital stay, increased risk of complications, and higher mortality in hospitalized patients. Our study indicates that blood glucose values before and within 24 h of initiation of TPN are better predictors of hospital mortality and complications than the mean blood glucose during the entire duration of TPN. These results suggest that early and aggressive intervention to prevent and correct hyperglycemia may improve clinical outcome in patients receiving TPN.

### Influence of gestational age and birth weight in neonatal cholesterol response to total parenteral nutrition [^115S7wQx]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Premature and critically ill infants receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are at risk for dyslipidemia, and altered cholesterol levels in early life may contribute to later cardiovascular risk. Data regarding plasma cholesterol response to TPN in young infants are lacking.

Objective

To determine the changes in plasma cholesterol levels during the first week of life in infants receiving TPN and a comparison group of infants who did not receive TPN during routine care.

Methods

In a prospective, pilot cohort study, 38 neonates (30 TPN vs. 8 No-TPN) underwent serial blood sampling during the first week of life. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure cholesterol in plasma and TPN administered to study participants.

Results

Baseline cholesterol level was similar between groups. In contrast to infants who did not receive TPN, cholesterol levels during the first week of life were significantly higher than baseline in infants receiving TPN (maximum cholesterol response 34% vs. 103% change from baseline, No-TPN vs. TPN, respectively, P = 0.036). After adjusting for cumulative cholesterol received by infants receiving TPN, maximum cholesterol response remained inversely related to gestational age and birth weight (P < .05).

Conclusion

Plasma cholesterol significantly increases during the first week of life in neonates receiving TPN. A higher cholesterol response was induced by TPN in infants of lower gestational age and birth weight.

### A mnemonic for pharmacists to ensure optimal monitoring and safety of total parenteral nutrition: I AM FULL [^114do6uk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a guideline-derived mnemonic that provides a systematic monitoring process to increase pharmacists' confidence in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) monitoring and improve safety and efficacy of TPN use.

Data Sources

The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) guidelines were reviewed. Additional resources included a literature search of PubMed (1980 to May 2016) using the search terms: total parenteral nutrition, mnemonic, indications, allergy, macronutrients, micronutrients, fluid, comorbidities, labs, peripheral line, and central line. Articles (English-language only) were evaluated for content, and additional references were identified from a review of literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language observational studies, review articles, meta-analyses, guidelines, and randomized trials assessing monitoring parameters of TPN were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

The ASPEN guidelines were referenced to develop key components of the mnemonic. Review articles, observational trials, meta-analyses, and randomized trials were reviewed in cases where guidelines did not adequately address these components.

Conclusions

A guideline-derived mnemonic was developed to systematically and safely manage TPN therapy. The mnemonic combines 7 essential components of TPN use and monitoring: Indications, Allergies, Macro/Micro nutrients, Fluid, Underlying comorbidities, Labs, and Line type.

Pancreatic necrosis — nutrition initiation and total enteral nutrition (TEN) versus total parenteral nutrition (TPN) — management includes immediate oral feeding when no obstructive symptoms are present and early nutritional support prioritized within the first 24–72 hours if oral intake is not tolerated, with randomized data showing benefits of TEN over TPN. In a prospective randomized study, patients receiving TEN had significantly lower rates of pancreatic infectious complications (20% vs 47%), multiorgan failure (20% vs 50%), and death (6% vs 35%) compared to patients receiving TPN, and another study reported lower rates of organ failure (21% vs 80%), multiorgan failure (15% vs 65%), need for surgery (22% vs 80%), septic pancreatic necrosis (23% vs 72%), and mortality (11% vs 43%) compared to TPN. Regarding route, small randomized studies demonstrated that nasogastric feeding was not inferior to nasojejunal feeding and therefore either route is acceptable, although nasogastric (or nasoduodenal) tubes are easier to place and maintain.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^115An9u3]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) utilization patterns in U.S. hospitals — PN was administered most frequently in non–critical care settings, followed by neonatal intensive care units and intensive care units, with duration of PN averaged 6.5 days and 6.1 days for noncritical care patients and critically ill patients, respectively, and a longer duration (8.9 days) in neonatal intensive care units. The average age of adults receiving PN was 66 years, and another report found that 12.8% of adults receiving PN were 80 years of age or older. Trends derived from hospital discharges indicate that after more than tripling from 1993 to 2010, PN use has declined for 4 consecutive years; in 2014 the ICD-9 code for PN was linked to 292,655 hospital discharges (P < .01) and PN use fell from 0.93% of hospital discharges in 2010 to 0.82% in 2014. Age-stratified data show PN utilization remained stable in patients less than 1 year of age, at approximately 0.3% of hospital stays, while the steepest decline — from 0.24% to 0.19% — occurred in adults aged 65 years or older. No studies have examined the reasons underlying these trends and available data address only PN administered in hospitals and do not include individuals who received PN outside the acute care setting.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^1157hK7p]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral parenteral nutrition (PN) — adult osmolarity limits, duration, and monitoring — directs to estimate the osmolarity of peripheral PN formulations and maintain an upper limit of 900 mOsm/L for the peripheral PN formulations, with a maximum duration of 10–14 days stemming from prior reports and difficulty maintaining peripheral venous access typically after 10 days. A retrospective cohort in adults reported peripheral PNs with a final osmolarity of 993 mOsm/L infused via a short (20- or 22-gauge) polyurethane catheter for less than 15 days were well tolerated. Current ASPEN guidelines recommend maintaining osmolarity less than 900 mOsm/L for peripheral vein infusions; the Infusion Nurses Society raised its minimum limit for peripheral IV vein infusions from 600 mOsm/L to 900 mOsm/L; and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism sets the limit at 850 mOsm/L. When peripheral PN is necessary, the intravenous site must be monitored frequently for signs of phlebitis, and a lower osmolarity limit should be considered in patients at risk for phlebitis or other vascular complications.

### Using arteriovenous fistulae as a dual access for hemodialysis and total parenteral nutrition administration is feasible with a good outcome: a case series [^111oZf2X]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2007). Low credibility.

End stage renal failure patients requiring long term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) often have multiple central line placements due to line infection or occlusion. Sometimes this can cause central venous stenosis or even occlusion. We present three cases in this consecutive series, in which we have successfully used arteriovenous fistulae for both hemodialysis and long term TPN administration as an alternative route without any complications.

Adequate protein delivery: the key to optimal nutrition delivery in the ICU?

The ESPEN guidelines for nutrition support in the critically ill patient recommend a protein delivery of 1.3 to 1.5 g/kg/day for optimal outcomes (grade B recommendation) and the ASPEN guidelines suggest 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day. The results of trials such as the EPaNIC trial revealed significant protein delivery deficits in both early-PN and late-PN groups. This deficit was due to the utilization of a low-protein PN solution, which limited protein delivery to a median of 0.8 g/kg/day throughout the trial period (even for as long as 15 days in the ICU). This trial also appeared to deliver a maximum of ~1.0 g/kg/day to any patient.

PDSA cycle 7: TPN adjustments for extreme low birth weight infants

Frequent electrolyte derangements and blood sugar fluctuations in extreme low birth wAdjustments for Extreme Low Birth Weight (ELBW) infants often led to premature TPN discontinuation, causing wastage and workflow disruption. In week 25, adherence declined to 86.7%, and 2 out of 15 opportunities halted within 6 hours due to metabolic instability. To address this, TPN formulations were proactively modified using prior patient data to anticipate common derangements and improve tolerance in this vulnerable group. Within 2 weeks, adherence improved and remained consistently above the SMART aim, including 100% adherence in weeks 28 and 30. The revised strategy was integrated into routine practice, with ongoing data-driven refinements to ensure continued safety and efficacy in ELBW infants.

### Risk factors for hypoglycemia in inpatients with total parenteral nutrition and type 2 diabetes: a post hoc analysis of the insupar study [^112ZB5bo]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: Treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of hypoglycemia in hospitalized T2DM patients receiving TPN. Methods: Post hoc analysis of the INSUPAR study, which is a prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of adult inpatients with T2DM in a noncritical setting with indication for TPN. Results: The study included 161 patients; 31 patients (19.3%) had hypoglycemic events, but none of them was severe. In univariate analysis, hypoglycemia was significantly associated with the presence of diabetes with end-organ damage, duration of diabetes, use of insulin prior to admission, glycemic variability (GV), belonging to the glargine insulin group in the INSUPAR trial, mean daily grams of lipids in TPN, mean insulin per 10 grams of carbohydrates, duration of TPN, and increase in urea during TPN. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of diabetes with end-organ damage, GV, use of glargine insulin, and TPN duration were risk factors for hypoglycemia. Conclusion: The presence of T2DM with end-organ damage complications, longer TPN duration, belonging to the glargine insulin group, and greater GV are factors associated with the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetic noncritically ill inpatients with parenteral nutrition. Abbreviations: ADA = American Diabetes Association; BMI = body mass index; CV% = coefficient of variation; DM = diabetes mellitus; GI = glargine insulin; GV = glycemic variability; ICU = intensive care unit; RI = regular insulin; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus; TPN = total parenteral nutrition.

### The risk for bloodstream infections is associated with increased parenteral caloric intake in patients receiving parenteral nutrition [^1117Q828]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design, patient enrollment and data collection

The University of Washington institutional review board for human research approved the study protocol and waived the need for informed consent. Two hundred consecutive patients admitted to Harborview Medical Center between July 2004 and August 2005 who received TPN at any time during their hospitalization were prospectively followed. Details regarding patient age, sex, admission diagnosis, comorbid conditions, reason for TPN, hospital location (intensive care unit (ICU) versus general ward) and length of stay were collected. Nutritional parameters, including prealbumin, albumin and C-reactive protein, were measured at the discretion of the attending physicians and dietitians involved in the patients' care.

A catheter-related infection was defined as a positive culture from the catheter tip and a simultaneous blood culture positive for the same organism. Bacteremia was defined as a positive blood culture in a patient with clinical signs of infection.

We recorded the daily parenteral caloric intake and the daily enteral caloric intake for the duration of TPN administration. The maximum parenteral calories received during a 24-hour period were recorded for each patient. This represents the highest calorie load at any time during the study. The average daily parenteral caloric intake for each patient was calculated as the mean number of parenteral calories per day that the patient received. Sources such as intravenous medications diluted in dextrose, and intravenous lipids such as propofol infused for sedation, were included in the total parenteral calorie counts. Where patients received concurrent enteral nutrition, details regarding the maximum and average daily enteral calories were recorded. Total calories are the daily sum of enteral calories and parenteral calories.

The maximum BG over each 8-hour period was collected, giving each patient three daily BG measurements. The average BG and the maximum BG while receiving TPN were calculated. In patients who developed BSI, only glucose values and daily caloric totals prior to the infection were used. Patients were followed from the time TPN was initiated at least until discharge from the hospital. We included the time after discharge from hospital in our follow-up period where this information was available. We therefore documented inhospital mortality and overall mortality over the follow-up period.

### Access routes for nutritional therapy [^112PpLMm]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may provide life-sustaining therapy for surgical patients. The duration of nutritional therapy (enteral or parenteral) implies distinct access routes. We review the main aspects related to access routes for nutrient delivery. The enteral route, whenever feasible, is preferred. For EN lasting less than 6 weeks, nasoenteric tubes are the route of choice. Conversely, enterostomy tubes should be used for longer-term enteral feeding and can be placed surgically or with fluoroscopic and endoscopic assistance. The first choice for patients who will not be submitted to laparotomy is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Postpyloric access, although not consensual, must be considered when there is a high risk of aspiration. For intravenous delivery of nutrients lasting less than 10 days, the peripheral route can be used. However, because of frequent infusion phlebitis, its role is still in discussion. Central venous catheters (CVCs) for TPN delivery may be (1) nonimplantable, percutaneous, nontunneled-used for a few days to 3 to 4 weeks; (2) partially implantable, percutaneous, tunneled-used for longer periods and permanent access; or (3) totally implantable subcutaneous ports-also used for long-term or permanent access. The subclavian vein is usually the insertion site of choice for central venous catheters. Implantable ports are associated with lower rates of septic complications than percutaneous CVCs. The catheter with the least number of necessary lumens should be applied. Central venous nutrient delivery can also be accomplished through peripherally inserted central catheters, which avoid insertion-related risks.

2.1	Important Administration Instructions for Use in All Patients

Administer VFEND Tablets or Oral Suspension at least one hour before or after a meal.

VFEND I.V. for Injection requires reconstitution to 10 mg/mL and subsequent dilution to 5 mg/mL or less prior to administration as an infusion, at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour over 1 to 3 hours.

Administer diluted VFEND I.V. by intravenous infusion over 1 to 3 hours only. Do not administer as an IV bolus injection.

2.2	Use of VFEND I.V. With Other Parenteral Drug Products

Blood products and concentrated electrolytes

VFEND I.V. must not be infused concomitantly with any blood product or short-term infusion of concentrated electrolytes, even if the two infusions are running in separate intravenous lines (or cannulas). Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during VFEND therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes

VFEND I.V. can be infused at the same time as other intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes, but must be infused through a separate line.

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)

VFEND I.V. can be infused at the same time as total parenteral nutrition, but must be infused in a separate line. If infused through a multiple-lumen catheter, TPN needs to be administered using a different port from the one used for VFEND I.V.

### Peripheral parenteral nutrition [^115yR2uG]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) currently accounts for almost 20 per cent of all parenteral nutrition administered in the UK. In the absence of consensus guidelines there is wide variation in practice. Heterogeneity of clinical trials has made direct comparisons difficult and meta-analysis impossible.

Methods

Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for all clinical trials relating to the use of PPN in adults. Relevant papers from the reference lists of these articles and from the authors' personal collections were also reviewed.

Results and Conclusions

Effective PPN is possible in about 50 per cent of inpatients requiring parenteral nutrition. Evidence relating to optimal feed composition, choice of cannula, infusion technique and pharmacological manipulation is discussed, along with practical recommendations for the administration of PPN.

### Improving neonatal total parenteral nutrition (TPN) safety and standardisation in a tertiary NICU: a multicomponent QI initiative [^111JhPbY]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is essential for neonates who cannot meet their nutritional needs enterally due to gastrointestinal immaturity or dysfunction. The primary goal is to prevent growth faltering while ensuring safe, effective nutritional support through careful monitoring and adjustments based on clinical status. Despite its necessity, TPN is complex and requiring expertise at every stage. Variability in TPN practices is driven by limited high-quality evidence, resource constraints and outdated protocols, often resulting in inadequate nutrition and poor growth outcomes. Neonates are particularly vulnerable to adverse events due to both the therapy itself and its intricate multistep process. Variations in healthcare settings and stakeholder practices contribute to inconsistencies in parenteral nutrition (PN) prescription, preparation and administration.

Local problem

Despite the benefits of standardised TPN practices, our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) struggled with adherence to optimal preparation and monitoring protocols. In our 60-bed tertiary NICU, admitting ~1500 neonates annually, TPN preparation was inconsistent due to variability in technique, sterility and adherence to guidelines. Initially, suboptimal formulations were prepared by nursing staff. TPN components were often prepared separately at the bedside and at different times for each baby, rather than in one coordinated session. This unmonitored process led to inconsistent preparation, unnecessary wastage of ingredients and increased infection risk. Instead of a single compounded solution, amino acids, lipids and dextrose-electrolyte solutions were often administered separately, increasing contamination risk due to multiple connections. During a sepsis outbreak, review of infection control practices revealed the absence of a formal laminar flow surveillance system. Although the outbreak was not linked to TPN, this gap highlighted the need for routine monitoring. Additionally, compliance with TPN preparation protocols was only ~10% in the 4 months preceding the quality improvement (QI) project (January–April 2024), underscoring the need for structured improvements.

### Isoleucine, leucine, lysine acetate, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, proline, serine, n-acetyltyrosine, and glycine (aminosyn II) [^1133TYkD]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Aminosyn II solution should only be infused via a central vein when admixed with sufficient dextrose to provide full caloric requirements in patients who require prolonged total parenteral nutrition. I.V. lipid may be administered to provide part of the calories, if desired. Serum lipids should be monitored for evidence of essential fatty acid deficiency in patients maintained on fat-free TPN.

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be started with 10% dextrose added to the calculated daily requirement of amino acids (1.5 g/kg for a metabolically stable patient). Dextrose content is gradually increased over the next few days to the estimated daily caloric need as the patient adapts to the increasing amounts of dextrose. Each gram of dextrose provides approximately 3.4 kcal. Each gram of fat provides 9 kcal.

The average depleted major surgical patient with complications requires between 2500 and 4000 kcal and between 12 and 24 grams of nitrogen per day. An adult patient in an acceptable weight range with restricted activity who is not hypermetabolic, requires about 30 kcal/kg of body weight/day. Average daily adult fluid requirements are between 2500 and 3000 mL and may be much higher with losses from fistula drainage or severe burns. Typically, a hospitalized patient may lose 12 to 18 grams of nitrogen a day, and in severe trauma the daily loss may be 20 to 25 grams or more.

### Management of traumatic duodenal injury: is there a role for early parenteral nutrition? [^111do1xT]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic duodenal injuries are complex in nature and pose major challenges to trauma surgeons. These injuries are associated with high mortality rates ranging from 18% to 30% and require prompt, comprehensive care. Traumatic injury induces a hypercatabolic state that mobilizes body energy stores, leading to muscle wasting, delayed healing, and potential multi-organ failure. Nutritional support is vital in keeping up with the metabolic demands of traumatically injured patients. However, exactly when and how nutrition should be provided for traumatic duodenal injuries is unclear. We hypothesize that patients who sustain high-grade duodenal injuries (grades III-V) will be unable to tolerate enteral nutrition (EN) and may benefit from early initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Methods

In this retrospective chart review study, we queried the trauma registry for patients admitted between January 2018 and December 2022 with duodenal injury. Individuals under the age of 18 and individuals who were pregnant were excluded. Twenty-eight patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was median number of days from initial injury to supplemental nutrition. We also evaluated the route used to achieve adequate nutrition based on duodenal injury grade (I-V), mortality based on duodenal injury grade, morbidity based on route of nutrition supplementation (hospital length of stay [LOS], intensive care unit LOS, and ventilator days), and complications based on route of nutrition supplementation.

Results

Of the 28 patients analyzed, 11 received EN, 10 received TPN (6 of which survived to transition to EN), and 7 died within 3 d of admission and did not receive any form of nutrition. The median number of days post-trauma to toleration of enteral feeding (defined as by mouth or tube feeding that meet total caloric needs based on nutritionist recommendations) was 4 d for those who did tolerate and maintained tolerance of enteral feeding, compared to 7.5 d post-trauma to initiate total parenteral feeding (P = 0.061). Injury grades I and II tolerated EN within a median of 6 d, whereas injury grades III and IV showed inability to tolerate EN until after a median of 22 d or longer (P = 0.02). Mortality increased as injury grade increased. Patients who received TPN were more likely to develop abscesses than those receiving EN (80% vs 27%, P = 0.03) but not more likely to develop a duodenal leak (P = 0.31). Patients who received TPN had longer hospital LOS (35.5 d vs 9 d, P = 0.008), longer intensive care unit LOS (17 d vs 4 d, P = 0.005), and increased ventilator days (9 d vs 1 d, P = 0.005) when compared to patients who received EN.

Conclusions

Individuals with higher grade duodenal injuries showed inability to tolerate EN until after a median of 22 d, and therefore, consideration should be given to initiating TPN early to mitigate the catabolic effects of malnutrition. Further studies need to be done with a larger number of patients to evaluate the effects of malnutrition in these patients.

Intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) use and limitations — 'IDPN therapy does not alter patientâ€™s eating behavior, nor does it encourage healthy eating habits'. 'Because IDPN is usually given for 4 hours during dialysis thrice weekly, it may not provide sufficient calories and fixed dose of amino acids may not meet energy or nutritional requirements'. Barriers and escalation guidance include 'Increased risk of infectious complications and the high cost of IDPN are the greatest barriers for regular use of IDPN', 'IDPN should not be considered as a long-term approach of nutritional support. It should be discontinued once improvements in nutritional status are observed and patients are capable of using oral or enteral route', and 'If IDPN therapy in conjunction with oral intakes does not achieve the nutritional requirements of the patient, or the gastrointestinal tract is malfunctioned, then total parenteral nutrition (TPN) given on a daily basis should be considered'.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^116Mdref]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) represents one of the most notable achievements of modern medicine, serving as a therapeutic modality for all age groups across the healthcare continuum. PN offers a life-sustaining option when intestinal failure prevents adequate oral or enteral nutrition. However, providing nutrients by vein is an expensive form of nutrition support, and serious adverse events can occur. In an effort to provide clinical guidance regarding PN therapy, the Board of Directors of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) convened a task force to develop consensus recommendations regarding appropriate PN use. The recommendations contained in this document aim to delineate appropriate PN use and promote clinical benefits while minimizing the risks associated with the therapy. These consensus recommendations build on previous ASPEN clinical guidelines and consensus recommendations for PN safety. They are intended to guide evidence-based decisions regarding appropriate PN use for organizations and individual professionals, including physicians, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and other clinicians involved in providing PN. They not only support decisions related to initiating and managing PN but also serve as a guide for developing quality monitoring tools for PN and for identifying areas for further research. Finally, the recommendations contained within the document are also designed to inform decisions made by additional stakeholders, such as policy makers and third-party payers, by providing current perspectives regarding the use of PN in a variety of healthcare settings.

A retrospective review was made of results of conventional liver function tests in adult patients who received fat-free total parenteral nutrition for two weeks or longer and who did not have other obvious causes for liver function abnormalities. A "meaningful" increase in SGOT levels was noted in 68% of patients, in alkaline phosphatase levels in 54%, and in serum bilirubin levels in 21% of patients. The median peak values for SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were 3-, 1. 9-, and
0. 25-fold above the upper limit of normal, respectively. The median time interval of peak increase for each of the three tests was between 9 and 12 days after TPN was started. Liver biopsy specimens from four patients, taken when liver function values were abnormal, showed pronounced steatosis in three patients and mild periportal cholestasis in the fourth patient.

The cause of the elevated liver values is unknown, but possibilities include cellular damage, such as steatosis, and an "overshoot" of enzymes when starved patients are refed.

### Tailoring nutrition therapy to illness and recovery [^114xRm5Q]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

How can we improve the worldwide epidemic of starvation in ICU patients?

The basic metabolism and physiology of human nutritional needs described indicate that early hypocaloric feeding in the first few days (acute phase) of critical illness would need to be accompanied by adequate protein delivery to help account for marked protein losses early in the ICU stay. Unfortunately, given the limited high-protein, lower-kilocalorie enteral feeding options available commercially, TPN or enteral protein supplements will currently be required to achieve this in most cases. TPN is now a significantly more viable option to achieve this as three recent large trials of both supplemental and full TPN support versus EN in the ICU setting have shown that TPN use in the ICU is no longer associated with increased infection risk. This is likely due to improvements in glucose control, central line infection control measures, and potentially as a result of improved (nonpure soy-based) lipid formulations as described in detail in the recent review by Manzanares et al. In support of early TPN use, the new SCCM/ASPEN Guidelines indicate that for any patient at high nutrition risk (NRS 2002 > 5 or NUTRIC Score (w/o IL-6 score) > 5) or found to be severely malnourished when EN is not feasible, exclusive PN should be initiated as soon as possible following ICU admission.

### Prevalence of liver complications in children receiving long-term parenteral nutrition [^116bog55]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

The hepatic prognosis of long-term home total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-dependent children is poorly documented. The objective was to study outcome data in home TPN-dependent children and to describe precisely their liver biopsies in the attempt to analyze risk factors for biochemical and histological hepatic abnormalities.

Subjects/Methods

Medical records of 42 children receiving home TPN for more than 2 years between January 1998 and December 2007 in a single approved home total parenteral center were reviewed. Hepatic biochemical abnormalities were analyzed. Hepatic biopsies were classified by two independent pathologists.

Results

Duration of TPN was 7.9 ± 0.8 years (mean ± s.e.m.), with an average age at onset of 1.5 ± 0.5 years. A total of 24 patients (57%) developed biochemical liver abnormalities in an average of 2.9 ± 0.4 years after starting TPN. Risk factors for biochemical abnormalities were younger age at TPN commencement, longer duration of TPN, higher rate of catheter-related infections and higher volume and energy content of TPN. Liver biopsies were carried out in 43% of patients (mean age 3.2 ± 0.9 years). Almost all patients had fibrosis (94%). Risk factors were dependent on each histological abnormality: fibrosis was significantly associated with a shorter length of bowel and a longer duration of TPN; cholestasis correlated with a lower percentage of total parenteral energy intake due to lipids; and steatosis had no risk factor identified.

Conclusion

Our study reports a high rate of histological liver abnormalities and analyzes risk factors in children who underwent very long-term home TPN.

Question 10.4

When should total parenteral nutrition be started in a patient with postoperative ileus?

Recommendation: Total parenteral nutrition should usually be given when the patient has had a non‐functioning gut for over 7 days. This should include the period of preoperative starvation. A formal nutritional assessment of the patient is essential.

Level of evidence: II

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8, A 22.2%)

Malnutrition and weight loss are associated with higher risks of surgical complications. Whilst total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may deliver a patient's metabolic needs it brings its own complications and trials do not show any benefit from starting TPN early. It is essential, however, to consider the duration of preoperative starvation and the likely timing of resumed gut function. In many cases where there has been a prolonged degree of preoperative starvation, for example due to an impending obstruction, the duration of starvation may be much longer than simply the time from operation to resumption of normal gut function. A formal assessment of the patient's nutritional status is essential. It is preferable to give nutritional supplementation enterally rather than by TPN as this is cheaper and, in some trials, has been associated with lower risks of infection. Parenteral nutrition may be given to supplement inadequate enteral nutrition. It is not recommended to start TPN unless it is likely to be needed for a full 7 days.

### Total parenteral nutrition: potion or poison? [^1171VFDz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

The role of nutritional support in clinical care has burgeoned over the past 40 y. Initially, total parenteral nutri-tion (TPN) was considered to be the standard of care. Later, the concept that enteral nutrition (EN) promoted gut function and prevented the translocation of intestinal bacteria resulted in EN becoming the standard of care. Furthermore, TPN was consid-ered to be a dangerous form of therapy. Critical review of the data suggests that, in humans, TPN does not cause mucosal atrophy or increase bacterial translocation. Increased sepsis with TPN can be ascribed to overfeeding; the dangers of TPN-induced complications have been exaggerated. TPN is an equally effective alternative to EN when a risk of malnutrition is present and EN is not tolerated or when gut failure is present.

### Does a multidisciplinary total parenteral nutrition team improve patient outcomes? A systematic review [^1167KCT8]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a specialized form of nutrition support. The complexity associated with the management of patients receiving TPN therapy has led to the development of multidisciplinary TPN teams. The purpose of this review was to critically analyze the literature and present the best available evidence that investigated the effectiveness of multidisciplinary TPN teams in the provision of TPN to adult hospitalized patients.

Methods

A systematic review of studies identified from the Cochrane Library (2001, Issue 4), CINAHL, Complete MEDLINE, Complete Biomedical Collection, Complete Nursing Collection, and EMBASE, published in any language.

Results

Eleven studies, 4 with concurrent controls and 7 with historical controls, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Results of the studies indicate that the incidence of total mechanical complications is reduced in patients managed by the TPN team. However, the benefit of the TPN team in the reduction of catheter-related sepsis remains inconclusive. Four of the 5 studies reported fewer total metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities in patients cared for by the team, and these patients were more likely to receive their optimal caloric intake. However it was unclear if the management of the patients by the TPN team prevented the inappropriate use of TPN therapy. Although only 2 studies (n = 356) investigated total costs associated with management of patients by the TPN teams, there was evidence that a team approach is a cost-effective strategy.

Conclusions

Overall, the general effectiveness of the TPN team has not been conclusively demonstrated. There is evidence that patients managed by TPN teams have a reduced incidence of total mechanical complications; however, it is unclear if there is a reduction in catheter-related sepsis and metabolic and electrolyte complications. The available evidence, although limited, suggests financial benefits from the introduction of multidisciplinary TPN teams in the hospital setting.

total parenteral nutritionListen to pronunciationA form of long-term nutritional support that is given directly into the bloodstream through a catheter placed into a vein. Total parenteral nutrition bypasses the digestive system and may be given when a person is not able to eat or drink by mouth or has a disease or condition that affects their ability to absorb nutrients through the digestive system. Total parenteral nutrition is complete nutrition that provides all the calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals that a person needs when they cannot digest food. Also called TPN.

### Hyperglycemia during total parenteral nutrition: an important marker of poor outcome and mortality in hospitalized patients [^113q4Cz3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The beneficial effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in improving the nutrition status of hospitalized malnourished patients is well established. Recent randomized trials and meta-analyses, however, have raised questions about its safety and the increased rate of TPN-associated complications and mortality in critically ill patients. The increased risk of complications during TPN therapy can be related, among other factors, to the development of hyperglycemia, which occurs in 10–88% of hospitalized patients receiving TPN therapy. Despite the high frequency of TPN-induced hyperglycemia, it is not known if the severity of hyperglycemia and/or the timing of hyperglycemia before initiation or during TPN therapy lead to hospital complications. Accordingly, we determined 1) the impact of TPN-induced hyperglycemia on survival and 2) whether blood glucose value before, shortly after initiation (within 24 h), and/or during TPN therapy can serve as predictive markers of in-hospital complications and mortality.

What is new?

Inadequate monitoring, suboptimal doses, and nutritional imbalances are very common TRPs in this population.
The frequency of TRPs is proportionally associated with the duration of hospitalization, number of medications, as well as renal and liver dysfunction.
Individualized therapy based on neonatal nutritional needs, underlying conditions, and response to therapy, is crucial and yet a novel investigational area.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^116Z687t]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal and pediatric parenteral nutrition — recommendation and key considerations: Initiate PN for total or supplemental nutrition provision if enteral nutrition (EN) is not feasible or not sufficient to meet total nutrient needs. For the neonate, PN is never considered optimal as compared with EN, yet limitations to feeding may make it temporarily the best option for nutrient provision. Metabolic derangements attributable to suboptimal composition of available PN formulations can be reversed through enteral delivery, and poor bone mineralization results from limited calcium solubility in solution resulting from volume restriction, an inability to balance calcium and phosphate, as well as recent cysteine shortages, a PN additive used to increase calcium solubility. Increasing concern exists that the lipid injectable emulsion formulation is a relevant factor in the development of cholestatic liver disease in infants receiving prolonged PN with little to no EN; however, no definitive evidence to show causation exists yet. Safety concerns, specifically risk of mortality, were reported in a meta-analysis evaluating effects of not light protected PN used for preterm infants, and currently, adequate light protection may not be feasible, depending on the circumstances of whether PN is compounded on-site or at a central location. PN admixtures support growth of neonates; however, shortcomings with current compositions and the morbidity related to venous access do not allow for PN being considered a preferred mechanism of nutrition outright.

### Warfarin therapy in children who require long-term total parenteral nutrition [^1137VFSv]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether warfarin can be safely administered to children who require long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN), for the purpose of preventing central venous access device (CVAD)-related thrombosis.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted of 8 children with short-gut syndrome or small intestinal anomalies. All patients received oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) managed by the hematology department at a tertiary pediatric center. Data collected included demographic details, nutritional intake, age, weight, history of deep vein thrombosis, number and functional duration of CVADs, warfarin requirements, and adverse event rates.

Results

A total of 15.2 warfarin years were studied prospectively. The target therapeutic range was achieved 51.1% of time. The mean dose of warfarin required to achieve the target therapeutic range (international normalized ratio) of 2.0 to 3.0 was 0.33 mg/kg/d. The mean duration between warfarin monitoring tests was 6.6 days. The median vitamin K intake per patient was 0.367 mg/kg/d (range: 0.018–2.85 mg/kg/d). Before commencing anticoagulant therapy, the mean CVAD duration was 160.9 days. Concomitant warfarin therapy was associated with a mean CVAD duration of 351.7 days. There were no major bleeding events, and no clinical extension of thrombosis was observed.

Conclusions

This is the first published study to report uniform warfarin prophylaxis for CVADs in children. Warfarin therapy can be administered safely in children who require long-term TPN. Warfarin prophylaxis seems to prolong CVAD survival.

### Hyperglycemia during total parenteral nutrition: an important marker of poor outcome and mortality in hospitalized patients [^113zARz1]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To determine the effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-induced hyperglycemia on hospital outcome.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The study determined whether blood glucose values before, within 24 h, and during days 2–10 of TPN are predictive of hospital complications and mortality.

RESULTS

Subjects included a total of 276 patients receiving TPN for a mean duration of 15 ± 24 days (± SD). In multiple regression models adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes status, mortality was independently predicted by pre-TPN blood glucose of 121–150 mg/dl (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.1–4.4, P = 0.030), 151–180 mg/dl (3.41, 1.3–8.7, P = 0.01), and > 180 mg/dl (2.2, 0.9–5.2, P = 0.077) and by blood glucose within 24 h of > 180 mg/dl (2.8, 1.2–6.8, P = 0.020). A blood glucose within 24 h of > 180 mg/dl was associated with increased risk of pneumonia (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4–7.1) and acute renal failure (2.3, 1.1–5.0).

CONCLUSIONS

Hyperglycemia is associated with increased hospital complications and mortality in patients receiving TPN.

### The risk for bloodstream infections is associated with increased parenteral caloric intake in patients receiving parenteral nutrition [^113ySFk5]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be a valuable adjunct in providing nutrition to hospitalized patients. Reviews of surgical patients receiving perioperative TPN have shown a reduction in morbidity in severely malnourished patients. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials showed an aggregate mortality benefit in critically ill patients on TPN, despite a 1.7-fold increase in infectious complications. Other studies have shown an increased infection risk without a survival benefit in patients receiving TPN. There is a reported sepsis incidence of between 20% and 30% in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. The high risk of sepsis is a major factor leading to an overall preference for enteral nutrition over parenteral nutrition.

Tight glycemic control has been demonstrated to reduce mortality in critically ill surgical patients and to limit certain morbidities (acute renal failure, for example) in critically ill medical patients. Patients experiencing the stress of trauma, critical illness or major surgery typically display endogenous insulin resistance that is characterized by reduced insulin uptake in peripheral tissues, along with an increase in glucose production. When combined with a large exogenous dextrose load such as occurs with TPN, the glucose oxidation capacity can easily be exceeded, which predisposes patients to develop significant hyperglycemia. It is thought that hyperglycemia contributes to adverse outcomes associated with TPN in critically ill patients and other hospitalized patients.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increased incidence of bloodstream infections (BSI) and sepsis in surgical patients. In one study, adverse outcomes in a cohort of 111 critically ill patients were attributed to TPN-associated hyperglycemia. This risk is not restricted to surgical patients. Patients receiving stem cell transplantation have an increased infection risk with TPN-associated hyperglycemia. In contrast to these reports, others have suggested that the amount of intravenous glucose rather than hyperglycemia is detrimental.

Herein, we sought to determine whether hyperglycemia, in the context of contemporary approaches to glycemic control, was associated with BSI in hospitalized patients receiving TPN. We also investigated whether the amount of enteral and parenteral calories were associated with BSI risk. We hypothesized that patients developing BSI while receiving TPN had higher blood glucose (BG) concentrations and received more calories intravenously than patients who did not develop BSI.
