## Question

Types of nonabsorbable sutures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the types of nonabsorbable sutures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how nonabsorbable sutures are defined and classified. Then, I should verify the major material categories and representative examples. Next, I will examine structure (monofilament vs multifilament) and its clinical implications. After that, I should review key performance characteristics and common clinical applications. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful categorization and note any nuances or exceptions I need to check along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify anything. Nonabsorbable sutures are materials that resist degradation in vivo and are either left permanently or require removal; they typically provoke a chronic inflammatory response with fibrous encapsulation rather than absorption, which distinguishes them from absorbable sutures that lose tensile strength and are cleared from tissue over time.

> I will now examine the major material categories. Wait, let me verify the canonical list. The principal nonabsorbable suture families include polypropylene, polyester, nylon (polyamide), silk, stainless steel, and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), with polypropylene and polyester being the most commonly used synthetics in contemporary practice and silk remaining relevant in select scenarios [^113TwP4H] [^1119xVjr] [^116mJfor].

> Let me consider polypropylene first. Polypropylene is a monofilament, nonabsorbable synthetic with low tissue reactivity, excellent knot security, and minimal drag; it is widely used for skin, cardiovascular anastomoses, hernia repairs, and many other applications where durable support and low infection risk are desired, and it is a frequent comparator in trials of absorbable versus nonabsorbable materials [^116VeYFi] [^114ZwEZu].

> Next, I should review polyester. Polyester is a braided, nonabsorbable synthetic with high tensile strength and good handling; it is often used when robust, long-term support is needed, such as in tendon repairs, orthopedic procedures, and some gynecologic suspensions, though braided constructs can carry a higher infection risk than monofilaments in certain contexts [^116v4XRT] [^1124u3Uy] [^116NZXNZ].

> Hold on, I should verify nylon's role. Nylon is a synthetic polyamide available as monofilament or multifilament; it offers good tensile strength and flexibility but can lose strength over time in vivo and is more prone to degradation than polypropylene, so it is often used for skin closure, ophthalmic surgery, and some cardiovascular work where eventual removal or long-term stability is acceptable [^116VeYFi] [^1119xVjr].

> I need to check silk next. Silk is a natural, braided, nonabsorbable protein fiber with excellent handling and knot security but higher tissue reactivity and infection risk; it remains in use for certain ophthalmic, ENT, and neurosurgical applications, and historically has been used for ligatures, though many have moved toward synthetics when feasible [^116VeYFi] [^116mJfor].

> Let me not forget stainless steel. Stainless steel sutures are monofilament or multifilament metallic wires with exceptional tensile strength and minimal tissue reactivity; they are reserved for situations demanding maximal strength and durability, such as sternal closure, orthopedic fixation, and some tendon repairs, but their stiffness and handling limitations restrict routine use [^113TwP4H] [^116v4XRT].

> I should confirm ePTFE's niche. Expanded PTFE is a nonabsorbable, monofilament-like synthetic with minimal tissue adhesion and high biocompatibility; it is particularly valued in cardiovascular and microvascular surgery where low thrombogenicity and minimal tissue drag are critical, and it is also used in some hernia and soft-tissue reconstruction contexts [^116DEzgp] [^116VeYFi].

> Now, I need to ensure I distinguish structure because it meaningfully alters performance. Monofilament sutures (polypropylene, nylon, ePTFE, stainless steel) have lower tissue drag and bacterial adherence but can be more difficult to handle and tie, whereas multifilament/braided sutures (polyester, silk) offer greater flexibility and knot security at the cost of higher friction and potential for bacterial colonization; this trade-off guides selection in contaminated fields versus high-tension closures [^116VeYFi] [^113nv3CV] [^111jQfLo].

> Let me think about performance characteristics I should explicitly verify. Nonabsorbable sutures are chosen for persistent tensile strength, predictable handling, and knot security; however, they can provoke chronic inflammation, suture sinus, or granuloma, and braided materials may harbor infection, so technique and material selection must balance strength and durability against host response and infection risk in the specific surgical context [^116VeYFi] [^115Sa3mp] [^113nv3CV].

> I should double-check common clinical applications to anchor the categories. Polypropylene is ubiquitous in skin, cardiovascular, hernia, and general surgery; polyester is favored for tendon, ligament, and some gynecologic suspensions; nylon is used for skin, ophthalmic, and select cardiovascular closures; silk persists in ophthalmology, ENT, and neurosurgery; stainless steel is used for sternal closure and orthopedic fixation; ePTFE is preferred in vascular and microvascular anastomoses and select hernia repairs, reflecting the need for long-term support, low reactivity, or specific handling properties [^116VeYFi] [^114ZwEZu] [^116v4XRT] [^1124u3Uy] [^113TwP4H] [^116DEzgp].

> But wait, what if I'm overstating absolutes about "permanent" materials? Polypropylene is technically nonabsorbable and durable, yet rare reports describe late degradation or breakage under chronic mechanical stress, reminding me to avoid claiming invincibility and to acknowledge that environmental and mechanical factors can influence long-term behavior even for "permanent" sutures [^115SLGxG].

> Let me reconsider the categorization to ensure it's clinically actionable. A concise, reference-aligned grouping is: synthetic polymers (polypropylene, polyester, nylon), natural fiber (silk), metal (stainless steel), and fluoropolymer (ePTFE), with structure further dividing into monofilament and multifilament variants; this aligns with FDA product codes and contemporary surgical reviews and captures the materials most surgeons encounter in practice [^113TwP4H] [^1119xVjr] [^116mJfor] [^116DEzgp] [^116VeYFi].

Nonabsorbable sutures are materials that **retain tensile strength indefinitely** and are not broken down by the body [^116VeYFi]. They are classified by material into **natural, synthetic, and metallic** types, with common examples including silk, polypropylene, polyester, nylon, and stainless steel [^116mJfor] [^113TwP4H] [^1119xVjr]. Nonabsorbable sutures are selected for **long-term tissue support**, high-tension closures, or when prolonged mechanical strength is required, such as in cardiovascular, orthopedic, and hernia repairs [^114ZwEZu] [^116v4XRT] [^113h8vGb]. They may be monofilament or multifilament and often require removal, though some are left in place permanently [^116VeYFi].

---

## Classification of nonabsorbable sutures

Nonabsorbable sutures are broadly classified into **three categories** based on their material composition:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Natural | Silk | - Derived from silkworm cocoons <br/> - Braided <br/> - Excellent handling and knot security <br/> - Higher infection risk due to capillary action [^116VeYFi] |
| Synthetic | - Polypropylene (Prolene) <br/> - Polyester (Ethibond) <br/> - Nylon (Ethilon) <br/> - Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) | - Polypropylene: monofilament, low tissue reactivity, high tensile strength, used in cardiovascular and hernia repairs [^114ZwEZu] [^113h8vGb] <br/> - Polyester: braided, high tensile strength, excellent handling, used in orthopedic and cardiovascular surgery [^116v4XRT] <br/> - Nylon: monofilament or braided, high tensile strength, used in skin closure and ophthalmic surgery [^116VeYFi] <br/> - PTFE: monofilament, minimal tissue reaction, used in microsurgery and vascular grafts [^116DEzgp] |
| Metallic | Stainless steel | - Highest tensile strength <br/> - Minimal tissue reaction <br/> - Used in orthopedic surgery, sternotomy closures, and tendon repairs [^113TwP4H] [^116v4XRT] |

---

## Properties and clinical considerations

Nonabsorbable sutures possess **distinct properties** that influence their clinical applications:

- **Tensile strength**: High and durable, suitable for long-term tissue support [^116VeYFi].
- **Tissue reactivity**: Varies by material; polypropylene and PTFE have low reactivity, while silk and polyester elicit moderate inflammation [^116VeYFi].
- **Infection risk**: Multifilament sutures (e.g. silk, polyester) have higher infection risk due to bacterial colonization; monofilament sutures (e.g. polypropylene, nylon) are less prone to infection [^113nv3CV] [^111jQfLo].
- **Handling**: Braided sutures (e.g. silk, polyester) offer better knot security and handling, whereas monofilament sutures glide more easily through tissue [^116VeYFi].

---

## Clinical applications

Nonabsorbable sutures are selected based on the **specific requirements** of the surgical procedure:

- **Cardiovascular surgery**: Polypropylene sutures are preferred for vascular anastomoses due to low tissue reactivity and high tensile strength [^114ZwEZu].
- **Orthopedic surgery**: Polyester and stainless steel sutures are used for tendon repairs and joint reconstructions requiring prolonged mechanical support [^116v4XRT].
- **Hernia repair**: Polypropylene sutures are commonly used for mesh fixation and abdominal wall closures [^113h8vGb].
- **Ophthalmic surgery**: Nylon and polypropylene sutures are used for corneal and scleral closures due to minimal tissue reaction and good tensile strength [^116VeYFi].

---

## Advantages and disadvantages

### Advantages

Advantages include **high tensile strength** with durable support, making these sutures suitable for long-term applications. Monofilament varieties (e.g. polypropylene, nylon) have a lower infection risk than multifilament materials, and braided options (e.g. silk, polyester) provide excellent handling and knot security [^116VeYFi] [^113nv3CV] [^111jQfLo].

---

### Disadvantages

Disadvantages include a **persistent foreign-body reaction** that can cause chronic inflammation or granuloma formation [^116VeYFi]. Multifilament sutures carry a higher infection risk and may promote bacterial colonization [^113nv3CV] [^111jQfLo]. Many nonabsorbable sutures require removal, which adds patient burden and the potential for discomfort [^115riCpS].

---

## Recent advancements

Recent developments include **antimicrobial-coated sutures** (e.g. triclosan-coated polypropylene) that reduce surgical site infections [^112TEvMp] [^115fkQjs] and barbed sutures that enable knotless closures with distributed tension and improved efficiency [^116VeYFi] [^1148FpAq]. Hybrid sutures combining nonabsorbable cores with absorbable coatings aim to balance strength with reduced tissue reaction.

---

Nonabsorbable sutures are essential in surgery for **long-term tissue support**, with material selection guided by tensile needs, infection risk, and handling preferences. Ongoing innovations continue to improve their performance and safety profiles.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^111CxfeL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review suggests that absorbable and non-absorbable sutures yield equivalent clinical outcomes in upper eyelid blepharoplasty. However, this finding is constrained by a limited, heterogeneous, and partially outdated body of evidence. The primary perceived advantage of absorbable sutures is the elimination of suture removal, thereby reducing logistical burden and patient discomfort; crucially, however, these benefits lack quantitative validation.

To resolve this uncertainty and inform evidence-based practice, there is a pressing need for contemporary, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials. These future studies must employ standardized outcome measures to directly compare suture types. Specifically, they should incorporate validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to quantify discomfort and rigorous health economic analyses to measure resource utilization (e.g. number of follow-up visits, cost, time burden). Until such high-quality data are available, the choice between suture types should be guided by patient preference, surgical context, and surgeon expertise, with the understanding that both options remain clinically viable.

### Absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures in the management of traumatic lacerations and surgical wounds: a meta-analysis [^116ZPxkM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To complete a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the cosmetic outcomes and complications of traumatic lacerations and surgical incisions closed with absorbable sutures versus nonabsorbable sutures.

Design/Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central to identify all RCTs comparing absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures that assessed cosmetic outcomes or complications. Reference lists of all identified trials were also searched. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts for eligibility, extracted study data, and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or a third party.

Results

Three hundred thirty-eight citations were retrieved, of which 7 met inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to specific interventions and outcome measures; sample sizes ranged from 44 to 166. There was no statistically significant difference between absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures in short- or long-term cosmetic score, scar hypertrophy, infection rate, wound dehiscence, and wound redness/swelling.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis suggests a lack of large, methodologically sound RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures. Although our analysis demonstrates that nonabsorbable sutures seem to be no better than absorbable sutures in the management of wound repair, a large methodologically sound RCT is needed to adequately answer this question.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis: Do absorbable or non-absorbable suture materials differ in cosmetic outcomes in patients requiring primary closure of facial wounds? [^112cWtqD]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Surgeons are often judged based on the cosmetic appearance of any scar after surgery rather than the functional outcome of treatment, especially when considering facial wounds.

Objective

We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine whether absorbable or non-absorbable suture materials result in different cosmetic outcomes for patients requiring primary closure of facial wounds.

Methods

An extensive systematic review was carried out to identify studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias in each study was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Data were extracted from those articles that met our inclusion criteria, and statistical analysis was carried out using the Cochrane RevMan.

Results

We found no significant difference in any aspect of our analysis including Visual Analogue Cosmesis scale, Visual Analogue Satisfaction scale, infection, dehiscence, erythema or stitch marks. Most authors concluded that they prefer to use absorbable sutures. However, the overall quality of evidence is poor, and significant variation exists regarding the methods of assessment between papers.

Conclusion

Use of absorbable suture material appears to be an acceptable alternative to non-absorbable suture material for the closure of facial wounds as they produce similar cosmetic results.

### Editorial commentary: what is the difference that makes the differences? The practical rationality of the all-suture anchor [^115JFp2V]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Suture anchor technologies are constantly being innovated in the quest for improved stability, biological integration and clinical outcomes. However, the decision about the choice of suture-anchor materials remain elusive. There are some factors, including reliability, effectiveness, simplicity, familiarity, and cost, that affect a surgeon's preference. The relative weights placed on different factors by different surgeons play decisive roles in individual choice. But decisions and choices are not arbitrary or merely subjective. Alternative options can be warranted or contested by rational argumentation. At the end, there may be losses and gains in the change of 1 suture anchor for another, but science does progress.

### Mesh fixation techniques in primary ventral or incisional hernia repair [^111y6Vva]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of a mesh in primary ventral or incisional hernia repair lowers the recurrence rate and is the accepted standard of care for larger defects. In laparoscopic primary ventral or incisional hernia repair the insertion of a mesh is indispensable. Different mesh fixation techniques have been used and refined over the years. The type of fixation technique is claimed to have a major impact on recurrence rates, chronic pain, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and complication rates.

Objectives

To determine the impact of different mesh fixation techniques for primary and incisional ventral hernia repair on hernia recurrence, chronic pain, HRQOL and complications.

Search Methods

On 2 October 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid MEDLINE(R)) Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R)), Ovid Embase, and two trials registries. We also performed handsearches, and contacted experts from the European Hernia Society (EHS).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with primary ventral or incisional hernia that compared different types of mesh fixation techniques (absorbable/nonabsorbable sutures, absorbable/nonabsorbable tacks, fibrin glue, and combinations of these techniques).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in standardised piloted tables, or if necessary, directly into Review Manager 5. We assessed risks of bias with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Two review authors independently selected the publications, and extracted data on results. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. For pooling we used an inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis or the Peto method in the case of rare events. We prepared GRADE 'Summary of findings' tables. For laparoscopic repair we considered absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks, and nonabsorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable sutures as key comparisons.

Main Results

We included 10 trials with a total of 787 participants. The number of randomised participants ranged from 40 to 199 per comparison. Eight studies included participants with both primary and incisional ventral hernia. One study included only participants with umbilical hernia, and another only participants with incisional hernia. Hernia size varied between studies. We judged the risk of bias as moderate to high. Absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks Recurrence rates in the groups were similar (RR 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.22; 2 studies, 101 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks and nonabsorbable tacks in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable sutures At six months there was one recurrence in each group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.79; 1 study, 36 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between nonabsorbable tacks and nonabsorbable sutures in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up and chronic pain is negligible. We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures No recurrence was observed at one year (very low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain was higher in the tacks group (VAS 0–10: MD -2.70, 95% CI -6.67 to 1.27; 1 study, 48 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures in early postoperative pain because the certainty of evidence was very low. The MD for late follow-up pain was -0.30 (95% CI -0.74 to 0.14; 1 study, 48 participants). We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Combination of different fixation types (tacks and sutures) or materials (absorbable and nonabsorbable) There were mostly negligible or only small differences between combinations (e.g. tacks plus sutures) compared to a single technique (e.g. sutures only), as well as combinations compared to other combinations (e.g. absorbable sutures combined with nonabsorbable sutures compared to absorbable tacks combined with nonabsorbable tacks) in all outcomes. It is uncertain whether there is an advantage for combining different fixation types or materials for recurrence, chronic pain, HRQOL and complications, because the evidence certainty was very low or low, or we found no study on important outcomes. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant The two studies showed different directions of effects: one showed higher rates for nonabsorbable tacks, and the other showed higher rates for fibrin sealant. Low-certainty evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Absorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant One recurrence in the tacks group and none in the fibrin sealant group were noted after one year (low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain might be slightly lower using tacks (VAS 0–100; MD -12.40, 95% CI -27.60 to, 2.80;1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). The pattern of pain and HRQOL course over time (up to 1 year) was similar in the groups (low certainty of evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Currently none of the techniques can be considered superior to any other, because the certainty of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.

### Absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for skin closure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116SuVGK]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Prior studies focused on skin closure using absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures involved small samples and produced conflicting results. The optimal method of skin closure still remains unclear.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the outcomes of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for skin closure.

Methods

A meta-analysis was performed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared outcomes of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for skin closure.

Results

A total of 1748 patients in 19 RCTs were analyzed. There was no significant difference between absorbable sutures and nonabsorbable sutures in the incidence of wound infections, cosmetic outcomes, scar formation, wound dehiscence, and patients' or patient caregivers' satisfaction. Better cosmetic results were achieved by using intradermal absorbable sutures compared with nonabsorbable sutures in subgroup analysis, but this result might be affected by insufficient follow-ups.

Conclusions

Absorbable sutures for skin closure were not inferior to nonabsorbable sutures. It should be recommended due to its great cost and time savings. Well-designed RCTs with sufficient follow-ups are needed to adequately clarify whether better cosmetic results can be achieved using intradermal absorbable sutures.

### Comparing the treatment outcomes of absorbable sutures, nonabsorbable sutures, and tissue adhesives in cleft lip repair: a systematic review [^111RUo2M]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine the literature and synthesize the available reports for the best possible option between absorbable, nonabsorbable, and tissue adhesives in cleft lip skin closure.

Design

We conducted systematic searches for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in PubMed, Cochrane, Ovid Medline, and OpenGrey databases. Identified studies were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. All statistical analyses were done with Revman, version 5.4.

Interventions

The intervention considered in this systematic review were techniques of cleft lip repair using resorbable sutures, nonabsorbable sutures, medical adhesives, or any combination of these.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes assessed in the trials had to include any combination of the following: wound healing cosmesis and wound healing complications. While secondary outcomes considered were quality of life, direct and indirect costs to patients and health services, and participant satisfaction.

Results

Only 6 studies met all inclusion criteria and were selected for qualitative analysis. A more favorable wound healing cosmesis was seen when nonabsorbable suture was used in cleft lip repair compared to absorbable sutures and tissue adhesives (CI, 0.65–4.35). This advantage was overshadowed by the significantly higher prevalence of postoperative complications when nonabsorbable sutures are used.

Conclusion

Although the results point to more favorable cosmesis with nonabsorbable sutures and an overall more favorable outcome with either absorbable sutures or tissue adhesives, the 6 selected studies were assessed at an unclear risk of bias; therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution and regarded as low-certainty evidence.

### Comparison of incision closure in hand plastic surgery using non-absorbable versus absorbable sutures: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^11259vCa]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgeons prioritize scar appearance after surgery, making suture choice crucial. Traditionally, non-absorbable sutures were standard but require removal, causing patient discomfort and extra visits. Absorbable sutures, while offering convenience, might raise concerns about scar quality. This study aims to provide an overview of the plastic surgery literature and clinically based evidence of the efficacy and outcome of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures.

Methods

A systematic review of search databases in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library was made to identify studies related to absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. The inclusion criteria for this study included RCTs comparing AS and NAS in plastic hand surgery, without any limitations of age or sex on recruited patients.

Results

A total of 532 hands were treated with a combined sample size of 517 patients undergoing plastic hand surgery. Two hundred seventy-three (51%) of patients had their wound closed with non-absorbable sutures, and 259 (49%) had absorbable sutures. Overall patient satisfaction among the studies that reported number of patients satisfied with the wound closure appearance was 64 (64%) in non-absorbable sutures cohort and 58 (59%) in absorbable sutures. Wound inflammation happened in 8 (3%) of wounds closed with non-absorbable sutures and in 9 (3.4%) of wounds closed with absorbable sutures.

Conclusion

In both patients cohorts, the overall patient satisfaction and complication rates were not significantly different. Non-absorbable sutures appeared to have slightly higher patient satisfaction rates. However, absorbable sutures may offer some benefits in terms of convenience with lower risk of wound dehiscence.

### Columellar scar following open rhinoplasty using absorbable suture versus nonabsorbable suture: a meta-analysis [^116Xwuht]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective: This meta-analysis seeks to determine whether a difference in long-term scar outcomes exists between absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures for closure of the columellar incision after open rhinoplasty. Review Methods: PubMed, OVID Medline, Conference Papers Index, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using terms including "suture", "sutures", "absorbable", "columella", "columellar", "transcolumellar", "trans-columellar", "rhinoplasty", "septorhinoplasty", "scar", "scars", and "scarring", as well as associated MeSH terms. Results: Six studies with 435 patients were included for systematic review and meta-analysis, with five studies included in meta-analysis for patient-reported outcomes, and six studies included for physician-reported outcomes. There was no significant difference in scar appearance between the absorbable suture group and nonabsorbable group among both patient-reported and physician-reported outcomes. Conclusion: This meta-analysis of six studies meeting inclusion criteria does not demonstrate a significant difference in long-term scar appearance based on suture type after open rhinoplasty.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^115iTSYL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results of data extraction and synthesis

We systematically extracted data from all studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria, focusing on direct comparisons of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin sutures in upper (and lower, if applicable) eyelid blepharoplasty, as well as studies examining suture-related outcomes in periocular plastic surgery. Our standardized extraction captured study design, sample size and demographics, suture details, outcome domains (scar quality, complications, patient discomfort, follow-up/resource use), follow-up metrics, and main results (including statistical data where reported). Given the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, synthesis was primarily qualitative, with quantitative details summarized where reported. For clarity, key study characteristics and primary findings are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Summary of included studies

Comparative clinical outcomes of absorbable vs. non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty

The comparative clinical outcomes of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures for cutaneous wound closure in upper eyelid blepharoplasty are consistently found to be equivalent in the robust studies available (Table 3). Randomized, split-eyelid and prospective comparative trials report no meaningful differences in final scar quality, wound healing, or overall aesthetic appearance between the two suture classes when modern materials and standardized closure protocols are used. Both absorbable and non-absorbable sutures yield similarly low rates of serious complications such as wound dehiscence, infection, and granuloma. Short-term differences — such as early edema or ecchymosis — appear to be more affected by suturing technique (e.g. interrupted vs. running) than by whether the suture is absorbable or not. Importantly, absorbable sutures offer the secondary benefits of obviating the need for suture removal and reducing associated discomfort, though quantitative data on this are limited.

While some studies suggest a slight aesthetic preference or marginal reduction in removal-related discomfort favoring absorbable sutures, these effects do not alter the overall equivalence in clinically important outcomes. Large observational case series and additional direct comparisons further reinforce this consensus, although detailed outcome data are limited by lack of full abstracts. In summary, with appropriate technique and follow-up, both suture types deliver safe, effective, and cosmetically acceptable results for upper eyelid blepharoplasty.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^111WUYQW]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Collectively, these findings suggest that the choice between absorbable and non-absorbable sutures for upper eyelid skin closure after blepharoplasty should be individualized, with particular attention to patient preference for follow-up convenience and suture removal discomfort. Clinical outcomes are essentially equivalent when either material is used appropriately, and specific suture techniques tailored to minimize edema/track marks and maximize early cosmesis may be most impactful. Future research should focus on the quantification of postoperative resource utilization, the application of validated patient-reported outcome measures for discomfort, and the comparative effectiveness of novel suture materials.

The strength of the conclusion regarding suture equivalence is tempered by several factors. First, the total number of patients across all included studies remains modest, limiting the statistical power to detect small but potentially clinically significant differences. Second, significant heterogeneity was observed in study designs (RCTs, prospective cohorts, retrospective analyses), follow-up durations, and outcome measurement tools, precluding meta-analysis. Third, some influential studies are now over two decades old, and their findings may not fully generalize to contemporary surgical settings and modern suture formulations. While the consistency of the 'no difference' finding across these varied studies is reassuring, the body of evidence as a whole must be considered preliminary and indicative rather than conclusive.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^115riCpS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact of suture type on postoperative Follow-Up burden and resource utilization

The type of suture used has a clear theoretical implication for postoperative follow-up burden, as non-absorbable sutures require a dedicated clinic visit for removal, while absorbable sutures do not. However, the available literature does not quantitatively measure this outcome. Non-absorbable sutures require patients to return for a dedicated clinic visit for suture removal — typically on postoperative day 5–7. It is therefore logical that this would increase both patient inconvenience and the utilization of clinical resources. Conversely, it is hypothesized that absorbable sutures, which dissolve spontaneously, could reduce follow-up demands. Notably, none of the retrieved studies provided explicit quantitative data on the number of follow-up visits, time expenditure, or associated costs. The requirement for a removal visit is inherent to non-absorbable sutures, but its quantitative impact on healthcare systems and patients remains unmeasured in the available literature on blepharoplasty.

Regarding patient discomfort, it is frequently suggested that absorbable sutures avoid the discomfort associated with suture removal, but this has rarely been measured quantitatively. While one prospective study indicated a qualitative preference for absorbables due to less discomfort, the actual magnitude was not reported. Similarly, none of the comparative studies detailed explicit cost/resource analyses. Therefore, while the theoretical advantages of absorbable sutures are clear, this review found no quantitative evidence to confirm a reduction in follow-up burden or resource utilization (Table 4).

### Closure methods for laparotomy incisions for preventing incisional hernias and other wound complications [^115Sa3mp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Surgeons who perform laparotomy have a number of decisions to make regarding abdominal closure. Material and size of potential suture types varies widely. In addition, surgeons can choose to close the incision in anatomic layers or mass ('en masse'), as well as using either a continuous or interrupted suturing technique, of which there are different styles of each. There is ongoing debate as to which suturing techniques and suture materials are best for achieving definitive wound closure while minimising the risk of short- and long-term complications.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to identify the best available suture techniques and suture materials for closure of the fascia following laparotomy incisions, by assessing the following comparisons: absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures; mass versus layered closure; continuous versus interrupted closure techniques; monofilament versus multifilament sutures; and slow absorbable versus fast absorbable sutures. Our objective was not to determine the single best combination of suture material and techniques, but to compare the individual components of abdominal closure.

Search Methods

On 8 February 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trials registries, and Science Citation Index. There were no limitations based on language or date of publication. We searched the reference lists of all included studies to identify trials that our searches may have missed.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared suture materials or closure techniques, or both, for fascial closure of laparotomy incisions. We excluded trials that compared only types of skin closures, peritoneal closures or use of retention sutures.

Data Collection and Analysis

We abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. We calculated a summary risk ratio (RR) for the outcomes assessed in the review, all of which were dichotomous. We used random-effects modelling, based on the heterogeneity seen throughout the studies and analyses. We completed subgroup analysis planned a priori for each outcome, excluding studies where interventions being compared differed by more than one component, making it impossible to determine which variable impacted on the outcome, or the possibility of a synergistic effect. We completed sensitivity analysis, excluding trials with at least one trait with high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADEpro guidelines.

Main Results

Fifty-five RCTs with a total of 19,174 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in the type of sutures used, methods of closure and patient population. Many of the included studies reported multiple comparisons. For our primary outcome, the proportion of participants who developed incisional hernia at one year or more of follow-up, we did not find evidence that suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.32, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.35, very low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35, moderate-quality evidence) resulted in a difference in the risk of incisional hernia. We did, however, find evidence to suggest that monofilament sutures reduced the risk of incisional hernia when compared with multifilament sutures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98, I² = 30%, moderate-quality evidence). For our secondary outcomes, we found that none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound infection, whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.17, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.57, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30, low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.34, moderate-quality evidence). Similarily, none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound dehiscence whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.61, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.64, moderate-quality evidence). Absorbable sutures, compared with non-absorbable sutures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.94, low-quality evidence) reduced the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation. None of the other comparisons showed a difference (slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.05 to 16.05, very low-quality evidence; mass versus layered, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.62, low-quality evidence; continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.61, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this moderate-quality body of evidence, monofilament sutures may reduce the risk of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures may also reduce the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation, but this finding is based on low-quality evidence. We had serious concerns about the design or reporting of several of the 55 included trials. The comparator arms in many trials differed by more than one component, making it impossible to attribute differences between groups to any one component. In addition, the patient population included in many of the studies was very heterogeneous. Trials included both emergency and elective cases, different types of disease pathology (e.g. colon surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, etc.) or different types of incisions (e.g. midline, paramedian, subcostal). Consequently, larger, high-quality trials to further address this clinical challenge are warranted. Future studies should ensure that proper randomisation and allocation techniques are performed, wound assessors are blinded, and that the duration of follow-up is adequate. It is important that only one type of intervention is compared between groups. In addition, a homogeneous patient population would allow for a more accurate assessment of the interventions.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^113Yq76o]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Despite its rigorous methodology, this review has several limitations. First, the heterogeneity in study designs, outcome measures, and reporting standards across included studies precluded a quantitative meta-analysis, necessitating a qualitative synthesis. Second, many studies lacked detailed quantitative data on postoperative follow-up burden, resource utilization, and patient discomfort, relying instead on qualitative descriptions. Third, the review primarily focused on older suture materials (e.g. catgut, polypropylene), with limited data on newer absorbable synthetics or advanced techniques (e.g. barbed sutures). Fourth, although our inclusion criteria initially required a direct comparison of suture materials, we made a post hoc decision to include three studies that compared only suturing techniques. This was done to provide the necessary context for interpreting the role of technique as a confounder. While this provides a broader understanding, it introduces an element of heterogeneity into the review. However, these studies are clearly differentiated from the primary evidence base in our synthesis. Additionally, the long-term outcomes beyond three months were underreported, and potential biases in smaller or non-randomized studies may affect the generalizability of the findings. Future research must address these gaps by employing standardized outcome measures, longer follow-up periods, and direct comparisons of emerging suture technologies in contemporary, adequately powered trials. Specifically, studies should be designed to quantitatively evaluate patient-reported discomfort and resource utilization, which remain the most significant unmeasured differentiators between suture types.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures for skin closure after carpal tunnel decompression surgery [^112UJJkt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common problem and surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel is the most effective treatment. After surgical decompression, the palmar skin may be closed using either absorbable or non-absorbable sutures. To date, there is conflicting evidence regarding the ideal suture material and this formed the rationale for our review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures for skin closure after elective carpal tunnel decompression surgery in adults on postoperative pain, hand function, scar satisfaction, wound inflammation and adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 30 October 2017: the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched two clinical trials registries on 30 October 2017.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing absorbable and non-absorbable sutures for skin closure after any form of carpal tunnel decompression surgery in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

The unit of analysis was the hand rather than the patient. We performed meta-analysis of direct comparisons to generate standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in pain scores and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes, such as wound inflammation. The primary outcome was postoperative pain. Secondary outcomes included hand function, scar satisfaction, scar inflammation and adverse events (complications). We assessed the quality of evidence for key outcomes using GRADE.

Main Results

We included five randomised trials (255 participants). The trials were all European (UK, Republic of Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands). Where quoted, the mean age of participants was between 48 and 53 years. The trials measured outcomes between one and 12 weeks postoperatively. Meta-analysis of postoperative pain scores for absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures at 10 days following open carpal tunnel decompression (OCTD) produced a SMD of 0.03 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.48; 3 studies, number of participants (N) = 137; I² = 43%); the SMD suggests little or no difference, but with a high degree of uncertainty because of very low-quality evidence. At 10 days following endoscopic carpal tunnel decompression (ECTD), the SMD for postoperative pain with use of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures was -0.81 (95% CI -1.36 to -0.25; 1 study; N = 54); although the SMD is consistent with a large effect, the very low-quality evidence means the results are very uncertain. Only the OCTD studies provided pain data at 6 weeks, when the SMD was 0.06 (95% CI -0.72 to 0.84; 4 studies; N = 175; I² = 84%), which indicates little or no evidence of difference, but with a high degree of uncertainty (very low-quality evidence). The RR for wound inflammation using absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures after OCTD was 2.28 (95% CI 0.24 to 21.91; N = 95; I² = 90%) and after ECTD 0.93 (95% CI 0.06 to 14.09; 1 study, N = 54). Any difference in effect on wound inflammation is uncertain because the quality of evidence is very low. One study reported postoperative hand function but found no evidence of a difference between suture types at two weeks (mean difference (MD) -0.10, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.33, N = 36), with similar findings at six and 12 weeks. Only the ECTD trial reported scar satisfaction, with 25 out of 28 people reporting a 'nice' result in the absorbable-suture group, versus 18 out of 26 in the group who received non-absorbable sutures (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.72, N = 54). These findings are also very uncertain as we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. All studies were at high risk of bias for most domains. No trials reported adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

It is uncertain whether absorbable sutures confer better, worse or equivalent outcomes compared to non-absorbable sutures following carpal tunnel decompression, because the quality of evidence is very low. Use of absorbable suture eliminates the need for suture removal, which could confer considerable savings to patients and healthcare providers alike. We need rigorously-performed, non-inferiority randomised trials with economic analyses to inform choice of suture.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^112jG7Gs]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper eyelid blepharoplasty is a high-volume aesthetic and functional surgical procedure that relies on subtle soft tissue handling and meticulous wound closure to achieve optimal results and patient satisfaction. Advances in suture technology have offered surgeons a range of materials for cutaneous closure, broadly categorized as absorbable (dissolvable) and non-absorbable (removable) sutures. Historically, non-absorbable options such as polypropylene and nylon were considered standard owing to their reliable wound support and handling properties; however, their need for postoperative removal mandates an additional clinic visit and introduces the potential for patient discomfort. Conversely, absorbable sutures — including fast-absorbing catgut and newer synthetic alternatives — dissolve within days, obviating suture removal and potentially streamlining postoperative care.

The comparative efficacy and safety of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty have been debated for decades. Multiple randomized, split-eyelid trials and prospective cohort studies have failed to identify significant differences in scar quality or complication rates between suture types when modern materials and protocols are used. Nevertheless, the discrete impact of suture selection on clinical outcomes such as wound healing, patient comfort, and aesthetic appraisal, as well as on health system factors such as postoperative visit burden and resource utilization, remains incompletely synthesized. Patient discomfort associated with suture removal — while frequently cited as a rationale for absorbable suture use — is often undermeasured or variably reported. Furthermore, studies rarely quantify the actual reduction in follow-up workload or clinic visits enabled by absorbable materials, representing a persistent gap in the literature.

### Absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for the arthroscopic treatment of anterior shoulder instability in athletes: a prospective randomized study [^113ifdG6]. Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to compare the functional results of arthroscopic treatment for traumatic anterior shoulder instability in 2 groups of athletes.

Methods

Fifty patients were randomly assigned to 2 different groups with comparable patient demographics. Group A was treated with anchors loaded with absorbable sutures, and group B was treated with the same type of anchors loaded with nonabsorbable sutures. The same type of absorbable anchor, surgical technique, and rehabilitation protocol was used in both groups. The outcomes were evaluated after a minimum postoperative period of 24 months. The Rowe score and the Athletic Shoulder Outcome Scoring System were applied, and statistical analysis was performed.

Results

The mean Rowe score was 83.8 in group A and 79.5 in group B. The mean values for the Athletic Shoulder Outcome Scoring System were 84 and 79.2, respectively. Good or excellent results were found in 90.5% of patients in group A and 87.5% in group B. We had 2 failures (9.5%) in group A and 3 (12.5%) in group B. No statistically significant difference was found in the comparison of the outcomes (P > .05).

Conclusions

The type of suture used, absorbable or nonabsorbable, did not influence the functional results of arthroscopic treatment for traumatic anterior shoulder instability in this series.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^114iNJX9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and synthesis

A standardized data extraction form was utilized to record the following information for each included study:

Study design, year, country, and setting.
Sample size and patient demographics.
Suture materials and techniques compared.
Outcome domains: scar quality (and grading methods), early complication rates, patient discomfort (quantitative and/or qualitative), and follow-up visit/resource metrics.
Duration and completeness of follow-up.
Main results and relevant statistical data.

Where feasible, outcome data were tabulated and summarized. Due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measurement, a qualitative synthesis was prioritized; however, key comparative effect sizes and significance levels were reported as presented in the original studies. Any quantitative pooling was conducted using appropriate paired or random-effects techniques, respecting intra-patient (split-eyelid) design where applicable.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty: a systematic review of clinical outcomes and follow-up burden [^112zSii3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review synthesizes evidence from comparative studies on suture materials in upper eyelid blepharoplasty. The consistent finding across the literature is that, when modern materials and protocols are used, absorbable and non-absorbable sutures yield equivalent clinical outcomes in terms of long-term scar quality and complication rates (e.g. wound dehiscence, infection, granuloma). Studies by Scaccia et al. Aydemir et al. and Greene et al. — utilizing robust split-eyelid and randomized designs — all reported no meaningful objective differences. It is critical to underscore, however, that this conclusion of equivalence is based on a limited, heterogeneous, and partially outdated body of evidence and should be interpreted as a tentative consensus rather than a definitive, high-strength recommendation.

The primary differentiator between suture types is their impact on postoperative logistics and the patient experience. Non-absorbable sutures necessitate a dedicated clinic visit for removal, increasing the burden on patients and healthcare systems. In contrast, absorbable sutures eliminate this visit, potentially reducing follow-up demands and enabling remote post-operative care. A secondary benefit is the avoidance of the specific, albeit often modest, discomfort associated with suture removal. It is important to note that these perceived advantages, while logically sound, are not substantiated by quantitative data in the current literature, as no included study formally measured the reduction in clinic visits, resource utilization, or patient discomfort using validated scales.

Suturing technique appears to impact early postoperative outcomes more than suture material class itself. Aydemir et al. performed a unique intra-patient comparison using both interrupted and running cutaneous techniques with both suture types. Their results indicate that interrupted closure resulted in less immediate postoperative edema and ecchymosis than running sutures, particularly within the first postoperative week. Importantly, the choice of absorbable versus non-absorbable material did not significantly affect scar outcomes at 3 months. This observation suggests that, for upper eyelid blepharoplasty, meticulous attention to surgical technique may contribute more substantially to short-term aesthetic outcomes than the selection of suture material.

### Dermatological surgery: an update on suture materials and techniques. part 1 [^113NyWUq]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Significant variation exists in the surgical suture materials and techniques used for dermatological surgery. Many wound-closure techniques are now practised, including use of sutures, staples and topical adhesives. The focus of our review article is to summarize the latest evidence relating to suture materials and wound-closure techniques, considering the following areas: scar/cosmesis, pain, patient satisfaction, cost, infection and wound complications. We searched the databases Medline, PubMed and Embase using the keywords 'skin surgery', 'dermatologic surgery', 'sutures', 'suture techniques', 'suturing techniques' and 'surgical techniques' to identify relevant English-language articles. Absorbable superficial sutures may be a preferred alternative to nonabsorbable sutures by both patients and surgeons. Subcuticular sutures may be preferable to simple interrupted sutures for superficial wound closure, and there may also be a role for skin staples in dermatological surgery, particularly on the scalp. However, there remains limited evidence specific to dermatological surgery supporting the use of particular suture materials and suturing techniques. Further high-quality research is required, including multicentre randomized trials with larger cohorts.

### Dermatological surgery: an update on suture materials and techniques. part 2 [^113bpkRE]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This is the second part of a two-part series summarizing the latest evidence related to suture materials and wound closure techniques in dermatological surgery. We critically appraised evidence focusing on the following consequences of suture choice: scar/cosmesis, pain, patient satisfaction, cost, infection and wound complications. We searched the databases MEDLINE, PubMed and Embase using the keywords 'skin surgery', 'dermatological surgery', 'sutures', 'braided sutures', 'monofilament sutures' and 'antibacterial sutures' to identify relevant English-language articles. This part of the review assesses the evidence for different types of buried sutures, including braided vs. monofilament sutures, longer-absorbing sutures and antibacterial sutures. The majority of trials were noted to be of poor quality, single-centre (thus lacking external validity) and underpowered, which presents challenges in comparing suture techniques in skin surgery. Future large-scale, multicentre, randomized trials are needed, with both surgeon and patient-assessed validated outcomes.

Results

Article selection

The initial literature search across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar yielded a total of 312 records. After removing 48 duplicates, 264 unique records remained for screening.

Title and Abstract Screening: Two independent reviewers evaluated the 264 records against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were excluded if they:

Did not involve cutaneous closure in upper (or lower) eyelid blepharoplasty.
Were non-comparative (e.g. single-arm studies, laboratory/animal research).
Focused on other periocular or facial procedures unrelated to blepharoplasty.
Compared only closure techniques (e.g. running vs. interrupted) without evaluating both absorbable and non-absorbable sutures.
Were case reports, reviews, commentaries, or editorials.

This step resulted in the exclusion of 231 records, leaving 33 articles for full-text assessment.

2 Full-Text Review: The 33 articles were thoroughly evaluated for eligibility. An additional 22 articles were excluded due to:

Lack of direct comparison between absorbable and non-absorbable sutures (n = 15).
Insufficient outcome data (n = 5).
Non-English full-text or incomplete abstracts (n = 2).

A total of 11 articles were included for data extraction and synthesis. The primary evidence base for comparing suture materials consists of 8 studies that provided a direct comparison of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures. Separately, three additional studies that compared only suturing techniques (e.g. running vs. interrupted) were included post hoc. These were incorporated solely to provide essential contextual data on the impact of suturing technique, which was identified as a major confounding variable during analysis. These technique-only studies do not contribute data to the primary suture material comparison but are vital for interpreting its results. Consequently, the results are synthesized in two distinct parts:

Primary Analysis: Direct comparison of absorbable vs. non-absorbable sutures.
Contextual Analysis: Impact of suturing technique on outcomes.

The PRISMA flow diagram (Fig. 1) summarizes the selection process, detailing the number of records identified, screened, and excluded at each stage.

The included studies comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and retrospective analyses, all of which provided direct comparisons of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty. Key outcomes such as scar quality, complications, patient satisfaction, and follow-up burden were extracted and synthesized to address the research questions.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria

Original clinical studies (including randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, or case series) directly comparing absorbable (dissolvable) and non-absorbable (non-dissolvable) skin sutures for upper eyelid blepharoplasty in humans.
Studies reporting at least one of the following outcomes: Scar quality or cosmesis (observer or patient-rated). Early postoperative complications (e.g. edema, infection, track marks, granuloma). Patient-reported discomfort or satisfaction. Quantitative or qualitative follow-up/resource burden (e.g. number of postoperative visits).
Post-Hoc Contextual Inclusion of Technique-Only Studies: Studies that compared only suturing techniques (e.g. running vs. interrupted) without a direct comparison of absorbable versus non-absorbable suture materials were initially excluded, as they did not address the primary research question. However, during the analysis, it became evident that the impact of suturing technique was a significant confounding variable in interpreting the outcomes of suture material choice. Therefore, a post hoc decision was made to include a limited number of key studies that provided high-quality evidence on the isolated effect of suturing technique. It is critical to note that these studies do not form part of the primary evidence base for the suture material comparison. They are included solely to provide context for interpreting the results of the direct material comparisons and are analyzed separately in the results synthesis.
Full-text or detailed abstract available in English.

Exclusion criteria

Studies not involving cutaneous (skin) closure in upper (or, if included, lower) eyelid blepharoplasty (e.g. exclusive focus on internal/buried sutures or transconjunctival techniques).
Non-comparative single-arm studies, laboratory, animal, or cadaveric research without clinical outcomes.
Comparative studies limited to other periocular or facial procedures not involving classic blepharoplasty.
Papers comparing only closure technique (e.g. running vs. interrupted) without including both absorbable and non-absorbable sutures.
Case reports, reviews, commentaries, and editorials.

### Influence of sutures on cartilage integrity: Do meniscus sutures harm cartilage? An experimental animal study [^111HH1gw]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate whether different suture materials in meniscal repair may harm cartilage.

Methods

A preloaded linear friction testing setup including porcine knees with porcine cartilage, porcine meniscus, and different suture materials (braided nonabsorbable, absorbable monofilament) was used. Five groups with different tribological pairs were tested: cartilage on meniscus (control), cartilage on cartilage (control No. 2), and cartilage on different meniscus sutures (3 groups). Cartilage integrity was analyzed macroscopically by the India ink method and histologically using Giemsa-eosin-stained undecalcified methyl methacrylate sections. Cartilage lesions were classified by using a quantitative scoring system.

Results

The control groups did not show cartilage damage, either macroscopically or histologically. Loading cartilage with sutured menisci led to significant damage of the superficial radial and transitional zones with braided nonabsorbable (P = 0.03) and absorbable monofilament (P = 0.02) sutures at final examination. Menisci sutured with braided nonabsorbable material resulted in deeper damage to the cartilage. However, there were no significant differences between the suture materials. Sutures oriented perpendicular to surface motion led to a larger defect than parallel-oriented sutures.

Conclusions

Braided nonabsorbable and absorbable monofilament suture materials cause significant damage to cartilage during long-term cyclic loading in vitro. The extent of damage depends on suture orientation.

Clinical Relevance

This study provides data on the extent to which different suture materials in meniscus repair may harm cartilage.

Contextual findings from studies on suture technique

To contextualize the findings from the primary suture material analysis, the influence of suturing technique was examined separately. As noted, three technique-only studies provided robust evidence on this relationship. It is important to reiterate that these studies did not compare suture materials but were included to assess technique as a potential confounder.

As shown in Table 5, Aydemir et al. (a study also included in the primary analysis) and others consistently found that while technique (e.g. interrupted vs. running) can significantly influence short-term outcomes like edema and ecchymosis, it does not result in significant differences in long-term scar quality or patient satisfaction. For instance, Told et al. and Vasović et al. both used non-absorbable sutures in all patients and found no difference in outcomes between different closure techniques. It demonstrates that the suturing technique is a more significant determinant of early healing than the choice of suture material. Therefore, the equivalent long-term outcomes observed between absorbable and non-absorbable sutures in the primary analysis are likely genuine and not masked by technical variations between studies.

Suture application varies for different tissues, different patients, and different circumstances. The large array of new sutures, staples, tapes, and topical adhesives can make the proper choice for closure a challenge. This review of the available materials for skin closure, and their biomechanical properties, advantages, and disadvantages, creates a structure for better understanding of the limitations, indications, and numerous choices to be considered before choosing a suture material.

### Abrasion resistance of two types of nonabsorbable braided suture [^1134hy4V]. Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to compare the abrasion resistance of different types of non-absorbable braided sutures under varying in vitro conditions of cyclic loading.

Type Of Study

Biomechanical study.

Methods

Two types of nonabsorbable braided sutures were used in this study, No. 2 Ethibond and No. 2 Fiberwire, combined with 5 different anchors: 5.0-mm Corkscrew anchor, 5.0-mm BioCorkscrew anchor, 3.0-mm BioFastak anchor, Panalok RC anchor, and 3.5-mm Panalok anchor. Twelve tests for each construct were performed. A custom-designed testing apparatus was constructed to evaluate the abrasion resistance of sutures through an anchor eyelet. The apparatus cycled the suture through the anchor eyelet at a rate of 84 revolutions per minute and a speed of 12.5 m/min. In addition to suture type, the effect of different suture-to-anchor angles and testing conditions (dry v wet testing) were evaluated. The number of cycles to failure and the mode of failure were recorded (suture breakage v eyelet breakage).

Results

Results showed that under all testing conditions No. 2 Fiberwire displayed abrasion resistance superior to No. 2 Ethibond (P < .002 in all cases). The mean number of cycles to failure was 5 to 51 times greater when using No. 2 Fiberwire than when using No. 2 Ethibond. Altering the suture-to-anchor angle from 0 degree (in-line) to 45 degrees decreased the abrasion resistance of both No. 2 Ethibond (69.8 cycles ± 26.5 cycles v 7.4 cycles ± 3.9 cycles; P < .000004) and No. 2 Fiberwire (918.3 cycles ± 417.4 cycles v 389.2 cycles ± 195.7 cycles; P = 0.001) when using the 5.0-mm Corkscrew anchor. Fiberwire performed equally well under both dry and wet conditions (P > .05) whereas Ethibond performed better under wet conditions (P = 0.0002) when using the 5.0-mm BioCorkscrew anchor. When using the Panalok RC anchor (mean failure, 11.2 cycles ± 1.3 cycles) or the 3.5-mm Panalok anchor (mean failure, 12.5 cycles ± 2.4 cycles), constructs failed at significantly lower cycles than other comparable anchor-suture constructs (P < .00007 in all cases). In addition, although the vast majority of failure modes for the other anchor-suture constructs was by suture breakage, the Panalok RC anchor and 3.5-mm Panalok anchor consistently failed by cutting of the suture through the biodegradable eyelet.

Conclusions

(1) Suture abrasion differs according to the suture type, anchor type, and testing conditions. (2) No. 2 Fiberwire showed superior resistance to abrasion when compared with No. 2 Ethibond under all conditions tested in the study. (3) The abrasion resistance of No. 2 Fiberwire is sufficiently high to eliminate, clinically, the theoretical concerns over weakening of suture from the anchor eyelet. (4) Suture eyelets formed of biodegradable materials can fail at low numbers of cycles by cutting of the suture through the biodegradable eyelet during cyclic loading.

Clinical Relevance

The study will help the surgeon to assess suture and suture anchor characteristics in order to optimize fixation of biologic tissues during surgical repair and reconstruction.

### The surgical suture [^116VeYFi]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgeons must select the optimal suture materials for tissue approximation to maximize wound healing and scar aesthetics. Thus, knowledge regarding their characteristics is crucial to minimize ischaemia, excess wound tension, and tissue injury. This article describes the selection of various suture materials available today and their intended design. Modern suture material should have predictable tensile strength, good handling, secure knot-tying properties, and could be enhanced with an antibacterial agent to resist infection. Tensile strength is limited by suture size. The smallest suture size that will accomplish the purpose should be chosen to minimize tissue trauma and foreign material within tissues. Monofilament suture has lower resistance when passed through tissues, whereas multifilament sutures possesses higher tensile strength and flexibility but greater tissue friction and pose risks of suture sinus and infection. Natural absorbable sutures derived from mammalian collagen undergo enzymatic degradation whereas synthetic polymers undergo hydrolysis. Collagen or polymer structures in the suture can be modified to control absorption time. In contrast, nonabsorbable sutures typically cause an inflammatory reaction that eventually encapsulates by fibrous tissue formation. Excess reaction leads to chronic inflammation, suboptimal scarring, or suture extrusion. More recently, barbed sutures have transformed the way surgeons approximate wounds by eliminating knots, distributing wound tension, and increasing efficiency of closure. Similarly, modern skin adhesives function both as wound closure devices as well as an occlusive dressing. They eliminate the need for skin sutures, thus improving scar aesthetics while sealing the wound from the external environment.

### Continuous versus interrupted skin sutures for non-obstetric surgery [^1156DMdX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Most surgical procedures involve a cut in the skin, allowing the surgeon to gain access to the surgical site. Most surgical wounds are closed fully at the end of the procedure; this review focuses on these closed wounds. There are many ways to close the surgical incision, for example, using sutures (stitches), staples, tissue adhesives or tapes. Skin sutures can be continuous or interrupted. In general, continuous sutures are usually subcuticular and can be absorbable or non-absorbable, while interrupted sutures are usually non-absorbable and involve the full thickness of the skin - although some surgeons do use absorbable interrupted sutures.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of continuous compared with interrupted skin closure techniques in participants undergoing non-obstetric surgery.

Search Methods

In August 2013 we searched the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared skin closure using continuous sutures with skin closure using interrupted sutures, irrespective of whether there were differences in the nature of the suture materials used in the two groups. We included all relevant RCTs in the analysis, irrespective of language of publication, publication status, publication year or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing binary outcomes between the groups, and calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing continuous outcomes. We performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included five RCTs with a total of 827 participants. Outcomes were available for 730 participants (384 participants randomised to continuous sutures and 346 participants to interrupted sutures). All the trials were of unclear or high risk of bias. The participants underwent abdominal or groin operations. The only outcomes reported in the trials were superficial surgical site infection, superficial wound dehiscence (breakdown) and length of hospital stay. Other important outcomes such as quality of life, long-term patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources were not reported in these trials. Overall, 6.5% (39/602 participants, four trials) developed superficial surgical site infections. There was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of participants who developed superficial surgical site infections (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.33). A total of 23 participants (23/625 (3.7%), four trials) developed superficial wound dehiscence. Twenty-two of the 23 participants belonged to the interrupted suture group. The proportion of participants who developed superficial wound dehiscence was statistically significantly lower in the continuous suture group compared to the interrupted suture group (RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.35). Most of these wound dehiscences were reported in two recent trials in which the continuous skin suture groups received absorbable subcuticular sutures while the interrupted skin suture groups received non-absorbable transcutaneous sutures. The non-absorbable sutures were removed seven to nine days after surgery in the interrupted sutures groups whilst sutures in the comparator groups were not removed, being absorbable. The continuous suture technique with absorbable suture does not require suture removal and provides support for the wound for a longer period of time. This may have contributed to the difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who developed superficial wound dehiscence. There was no significant difference in the length of the hospital stay between the two groups (MD -1.40 days; 95% CI -7.14 to 4.34).

Authors' Conclusions

Superficial wound dehiscence may be reduced by using continuous subcuticular sutures. However, there is uncertainty about this because of the quality of the evidence. Besides, the nature of the suture material used may have led to this observation, as the continuous suturing technique used suture material that did not need to be removed, whereas the comparator used interrupted (non-absorbable) sutures that did need to be removed. Differences in the methods of skin closure have the potential to affect patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources. Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary to determine which type of suturing is better.

### Patient and observer graded rhinoplasty scar outcomes: a randomized controlled trial of fast absorbing versus permanent columellar suture closure [^114bU8kg]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: When performing an open rhinoplasty, surgeons commonly use nonabsorbable skin sutures to close the columellar incision. These are believed to minimize scarring. However, removal can be associated with patient discomfort and outcomes may not be superior to using absorbable sutures. Objective: To compare difference in scar appearance for columellar closure after rhinoplasty with absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures. Methods: We performed a prospective randomized control trial with 61 patients. Forty-one patients completed follow-up and were included in final analysis: 23 whose columellar incision was closed with absorbable sutures and 18 with nonabsorbable sutures. A blinded surgeon performed Stony Brook Evaluation Scale (SBES) and a patient performed Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) was completed for each suture type. Results: Our results did not reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in SBES or PSAQ scores between absorbable and nonabsorbable suture types. Conclusions: No difference was detected in scar outcomes between absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures for closure of the columellar incision created during an open rhinoplasty as rated by both patients and blinded clinicians.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^1129kZMn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

Overall, we found no strong evidence of effect for either the use of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin suture, or closure versus non-closure if the subcutaneous fascia. There was very weak evidence to suggest that the combination of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with a non-absorbable skin suture was associated with a reduced risk of infection, but this finding should be interpreted with caution as no statistical adjustment has been made for multiple comparisons. Given low event rates and likelihood that any effect of the interventions is of small magnitude, future trials would have to be very large to properly investigate differences while accounting for any possible effect modification.

Comparison with published literature

We have shown that there is some weak evidence to suggest that the combined intervention of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin suturing with absorbable monofilament suture (Caprosyn™), is associated with an increased risk of postoperative wound infection, in comparison with subcutaneous fascia closure and skin suturing with non-absorbable monofilament suture (Prolene™). While previous studies have shown no statistically significant difference in wound infection rates when comparing the use of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin sutures, the combination of subcutaneous fascia closure (or non-closure) with different skin sutures has not been considered.

One possible reason for our findings is that the burden of absorbable suture material is related to the increased relative risk of wound infection, among women who underwent subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with absorbable suture. Both the suture used for subcutaneous fascia closure (Vicryl®), and the suture used for skin closure (Caprosyn™) are absorbable. Vicryl® is a poly-filament, braided absorbable synthetic suture, which is completely absorbed within 56–70 days. Caprosyn™ is a short-term absorbable monofilament suture, which is completely absorbed within 56 days. Whenever a foreign body such as a suture, is placed within tissue, it induces an inflammatory reaction. Absorption of absorbable suture material Vicryl® can cause tissue reactions that consist of free fluid, that may facilitate bacterial growth, and the congregation of macrophages and fibroblasts, lymphocytes and plasma cells, which gradually reduce in number and concentration postoperatively. Optimal wound healing requires an appropriate amount of tissue inflammation, however it is possible that the additive burden of concurrent tissue inflammatory responses is sufficient to result in excessive inflammation, decreased efficiency of removal of contaminating micro-organisms, and an increased risk of clinical wound infection.

### Does knot configuration improve tensile characteristics of monofilament suture materials? [^116XFGx9]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The effects of knot configuration used in surgical procedures are often overlooked when surgeons are looking for an ideal suture material. This study aimed to investigate the mechanical properties of monofilament suture materials used in oral and maxillofacial surgery under diverse knot configurations.

Materials and Methods

A custom-made experimental platform and a microtensile test device were used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the tested subjects. There were 2 predictor variables: suture material and knot configuration. Three types of nonabsorbable and monofilament suture materials with 4–0 gauge, including nylon, polypropylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene, were tested. Four different knot configurations-a surgeon's knot square plus a square knot (2 = 1 = 1), a surgeon's knot granny plus a square knot (2 × 1 = 1), a reverse surgeon's knot granny plus a square knot (1 × 2 = 1), and a reverse surgeon's knot square plus a square knot (1 = 2 = 1)-were also used with each of the suture materials. The tensile strength (N) and elongation (μm) of each sample were measured as the outcomes. The data were statistically analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference tests. The significance level was set at P < .05.

Results

Overall, 120 samples were tested. Statistical analysis revealed that the highest tensile strength (28.6 N) was found for nylon in the surgeon's knot square plus a square knot (P < .05). Polypropylene showed a similar high tensile strength value (24.7 N) in the reverse surgeon's knot granny plus a square knot (P > .05). Polytetrafluoroethylene demonstrated significantly lower values for both tensile strength in tested configurations (within the range of 5.2–8.5 N). Under diverse configurations, polypropylene suture samples offered the most stable tensile strength and elongation.

Conclusions

The present study demonstrated that different knot configurations might improve the mechanical profile of commonly used monofilament suture materials. The surgeon's knot square (2 = 1), commonly used by surgeons worldwide, proved to be the most beneficial knot configuration in this study in terms of tensile strength and elongation. Further research on optimal knot configuration may be just as important as seeking an ideal suture material.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^113x6DrA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Many RCTs have investigated incisional hernia rate, burst abdomen, and SSI for different suture materials. These relatively small and old studies were combined in a meta-analysisthat took into account only trials comparing different suture materials used with the same continuous or interrupted suturing technique. When the same closure technique was used, this meta-analysis failed to show superiority of one suture material over another for incisional hernia, burst abdomen or SSI.

Antimicrobial-coated sutures were introduced to reduce SSI and are now increasingly being used. No evidence was found for antimicrobial-coated sutures in preventing incisional hernia. Two high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses, examined the rate of SSI after fascial closure. Both found no difference in SSI with use of antimicrobial-coated slowly absorbable monofilament sutures, but they showed a reduced SSI rate for antimicrobial-coated multifilament fast-absorbing sutures. Since then, three RCTsof antimicrobial-coated suture for fascial closure have been published with contradictory results.

Fascial healing is a complex process that takes over a year to be complete. There is a rapid gain in strength from the eighth postoperative day (beginning of proliferative phase) up to the second month (around the end of collagen synthesis). After 2 months, the fascia has regained 50 per cent of its original strength. When choosing an absorbable suture for laparotomy closure, the mechanical properties of the suture should be taken into account. Tensile strength decreases over time when absorption takes place. After losing approximately 70–80 per cent of their strength, sutures will not be able to withstand forces on the healing fascia and will break. For multifilament fast-absorbing sutures, only 25 per cent of the original strength remains after 4 weeks, and complete absorption has taken place after 8–10 weeks. For monofilament slowly absorbable sutures, more than half of the tensile strength remains after 6 weeks and absorption is completed after 6–8 months. Given the reduction in tensile strength of fast-absorbing sutures, these are at high risk of breaking before the fascia has healed well enough. Slowly absorbable and non-absorbable sutures do not differ in terms of the occurrence of incisional hernia and burst abdomen. However, non-absorbable sutures have been linked to prolonged wound pain and suture sinus formation. The guideline group suggests the use of a slowly absorbable suture for closing the midline fascia of the abdominal wall in elective laparotomies.

Pain and type of fixation: suture or tacks?

The pain in laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair is related to mesh fixation with either tacks or sutures. The pain due to fixation differs from that at port sites.

Three RCTs (level 1b) studied the association of pain with the type of fixation. Wassenaar et al. [203] conducted an RCT of three fixation techniques (tacks with absorbable sutures, nonabsorbable sutures, and only tacks) and found no significant difference in VAS scores among the three techniques of mesh fixation at any time during a follow-up period of 3 months. On the other hand, Bansal et al. [106] reported higher pain scores in the tacks fixation group than in the suture fixation group during the early postoperative period, which became insignificant at 3 months and during further long-term follow-up assessment [167]. In an RCT during 211, Beldi et al. [105] also did not find any significant difference in VAS scores between tacks and suture fixations during 6 months of follow-up evaluation.

Three nonrandomized comparative studies (level 2b) reported chronic pain after suture and tacks fixation. Nguyen et al. [96] reported no significant difference between the two fixation groups in their nonrandomized comparative trial comparing suture and tacks. Beldi et al. [148] and Kurmann et al. [87] reported that pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is mostly at the transfixation suture site.

In four noncomparative trials (level 4) [6, 82, 84, 105] consisting of 2,649 patients and follow-up periods ranging from 1 to 120 months, the incidence of chronic pain was 16.4% in the suture groups and 12.7% in the tacks groups. Chronic pain was highest for patients in whom both tacks and sutures were used (Sharma et al. [82]). However, in a study by Chelala et al. [102] using transfascial suture fixation only, 97.5% of the patients were pain free. Seven of the patients (1.75%) reported chronic pain, which resolved gradually, and only three patients (0.75%) required excision of a neuroma at the suture fixation site.

### An experimental design to compare the compatibility of absorbable and nonabsorbable suture materials in the lateral canthus area [^116YBo4H]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) and polypropylene (Prolene) are common suture materials used in ophthalmic surgical procedures. However, there are limited studies assessing tissue reactions to different sutures in eyelid areas. In this study, these suture materials were used subcutaneously in 10 lateral canthi of 5 pigs. Clinical reactive score (CRS) was assessed 14 days and 60 days after surgery. On histology, subcutaneous tissue reactions were assessed by the presence of different inflammatory cells, and the aggregate tissue irritation score was calculated. CRS and the histology score did not differ between these sutures. None of the suture materials used were superior for use in the lateral canthi of pig eyes. Therefore, we recommend both of these sutures for use in the subcutaneous tissue of the eyelid area in animal experiments or clinical practice.

### Reduced postoperative chronic pain after tension-free inguinal hernia repair using absorbable sutures: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^115yHQHK]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair occurs in 16% to 62% of patients. The underlying mechanism probably involves sensory nerve damage and abnormal healing that might be influenced by the materials chosen for the procedure. We hypothesize that nonabsorbable sutures used for mesh fixation to the surrounding tissues are associated with higher rates of chronic groin pain after surgery.

Study Design

We conducted a single-blind randomized clinical trial to compare the effect of absorbable braided sutures (Vycril; Ethicon) and nonabsorbable monofilament sutures (Prolene; Ethicon) used in inguinal hernia repair on the rate of chronic pain. We assessed chronic pain using a 4-point verbal-rank scale during a 1-year postoperative follow-up period.

Results

Study groups included 100 patients in each group. No age, sex, or hernia-side differences were observed between the study groups. Chronic pain rate after surgery was higher in the nonabsorbable monofilament suture group compared with the absorbable braided suture group (37 vs 26 patients; p = 0.056). Time to pain disappearance was longer in the nonabsorbable monofilament suture vs the absorbable braided suture group (115.3 days; 95% CI, 88–142.7 vs 77.4 days; 95% CI, 54.3–100.3; p = 0.038, respectively). A 1-year age increment reduces the risk for chronic pain occurrence by 2.2% (odds ratio = 0.978%; 95% CI, 0.961–0.995; p = 0.013). The use of nonabsorbable sutures increases the risk for chronic pain in 94.9% compared with absorbable sutures (odds ratio = 1.949; 95% CI, 1.039–3.658; p = 0.038).

Conclusions

Nonabsorbable suture use in inguinal hernia repair is associated with a higher rate of chronic pain and a longer time to pain disappearance as compared with absorbable sutures.

### Technical aspects of uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic sleeve resections: where are the limits? [^111ETQuq]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

For a bronchial end-to-end anastomosis, different types of suture materials and techniques have been described in the literature, with all having shown to be reliable when the suture is tension free and the tissue is adequately vascularized. The decision to use a larger or smaller needle depends on personal preference. The use of a larger needle (26 mm) facilitates an easier rotation of the needle into the bronchus and allows suturing of both edges with a single movement.

For the first uniportal sleeve resection that our group described in the literature, the same principle as in open surgery was followed, that is, the use of interrupted sutures for the cartilaginous portion and a continuous suture for the membranous portion. However, the handling of many sutures for the interrupted portion by VATS was time consuming and not easy.

To simplify the procedure, we switched to a double-armed running suture (single thread with 2 needles). The idea is to perform a circumferential anastomosis of 360° with both needles (180° with each needle) and a single knot at the most anterior portion of the suture anastomosis. A single, monofilament, nonabsorbable, 3–0 double-armed suture for every bronchial sleeve anastomosis is normally used (a polydioxanone suture may be used as an alternative when available). This procedure is facilitated when dissection of the lymph node paratracheal and subcarinal stations are performed before the reconstruction.

A continuous suture can reduce the time required for the completion of the anastomosis, not only because additional sutures are not required, but also because tangling is minimized when using a single suture. The first bite is placed "inside-out" at the far border between the cartilaginous and membranous part of the proximal bronchial tree and then connecting it "outside-in" to the distal bronchial tree, progressing in a counter-clockwise fashion incorporating the entire bronchial wall (full-thickness).

### Abdominal wall plication and correction of deformities of the myoaponeurotic layer: focusing on materials and techniques used for synthesis [^112D8HnR]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The different types of sutures utilized in plications and for correction of diastasis during abdominoplasty are reviewed and discussed. Because correction of abdominal deformities also involves fascia and muscle advancement, this review also covers the suture materials used in muscle advancement. The selection of specific techniques to treat different types of abdominal wall deformity is also considered. This is important, because the outcome when correcting these deformities depends not only on suture materials but also on employing the optimum technique. A PubMed/Medline search was performed with the following search terms: rectus diastasis, diastasis recti, diastasis recti abdominis, correction of rectus diastasis, abdominoplasty. Relevant articles identifying the type of suture (rapidly absorbable, slowly absorbable, nonabsorbable), monofilament or multifilament sutures, antibiotic-coated sutures, and barbed sutures were evaluated. In addition, articles about surgical technique comparing continuous and interrupted sutures, in both the anterior and posterior aponeurosis, to correct rectus diastasis are discussed. Efficacy of suture materials was evaluated based on the long-term results and recurrence rates reported in these articles. The current literature provides sufficient data to recommend a single-layer continuous suture, with slowly absorbable sutures of 0 polydioxanone or 2–0 nylon, for correction of abdominal diastasis. An interrupted triangular suture is a good alternative to correct the vertical elongation of the myoaponeurotic layer that occurs after pregnancy.

### Absorbable sutures are equally efficacious to non-absorbable sutures in upper eyelid blepharoplasty for dermatochalasis: a comparative study [^111PXmBe]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper blepharoplasty for dermatochalasis is a common oculoplastic procedure worldwide, but postoperative suture removal can be uncomfortable or impractical for some patients.

Aims and Objectives

This study aimed to compare outcomes between absorbable and non-absorbable sutures used for upper eyelid blepharoplasty closure and to assess differences in complication rates.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed data from consecutive upper eyelid blepharoplasty procedures performed over a 3 year period. Patients were categorized based on the type of suture used for skin closure, with exclusion criteria including any prior eyelid or orbital surgery. Postoperative complications, outcomes, and aesthetic satisfaction scores (1–10) were compared between the two suture groups.

Results

The study included 149 patients: 69 with absorbable sutures and 80 with non-absorbable polypropylene sutures. Demographic variables were similar between groups. Operative time, estimated blood loss, return to work and follow-up duration were comparable. No significant differences in complication rates were observed (2.9% vs. 2.5%, p = 1.000), though a slight trend toward reoperation was noted in the absorbable suture group (8.7% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.570). Patient and surgeon satisfaction scores were similar.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that absorbable sutures are a viable and safe alternative to non-absorbable sutures for upper eyelid blepharoplasty, with no significant differences in postoperative outcomes or overall satisfaction.

### Suture lifting: a review of the literature and our experiences [^116dWZXZ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the past 5 years, several absorbable sutures for use in minimally invasive suture lifts have appeared on the market. These newer sutures were preceded by several iterations of nonabsorbable counterparts, all of which were eventually removed from the market because of complications.

Objective

This review will provide a history of suture lift experience, review the published evidence on the safety and efficacy of currently available absorbable suture lift materials, and detail the clinical experience of the authors using these products.

Materials and Methods

A review of relevant clinical terms was performed on PUBMED and MEDLINE databases. All articles were reviewed, and further studies examined from citations of selected articles. Articles that focused on suture lifting using extensive dissection were excluded.

Results

Twelve studies detailed the results of absorbable suture lifting largely through patient satisfaction surveys or retrospective chart review of cases. No randomized controlled studies were available.

Conclusion

Data on suture lifting are limited, with largely descriptive and retrospective case reports available in the literature entailed Oxford Centre evidence-based medicine Levels 2a to 5. Based on the available data, suture lifting appears to be safe and well tolerated, with patient satisfaction similar to or above that reported for other noninvasive lifting and tightening procedures. However, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, the authors give the suture lifting Strength of Recommendation Level C. Further controlled studies are necessary to determine efficacy, longevity, and safety of this technology.

### A modified incision closure for breast augmentation: remote-knot technique [^1164oJ3e]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Closure techniques for breast augmentation incisions can affect wound healing with significant consequences if the incision does not heal properly. Suturing methods and materials include absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures and interrupted and continuous techniques. These choices can affect wound healing, wound strength, and wound integrity, and postoperative care. The goal of long-term incision support during wound healing, eliminating a suture knot within the incision, and decreased risk of compromise of wound healing are desired. A closure method called the "remote-knot" technique, which can be applied to other incision types, has been developed.

### Mechanical testing of different knot types using high-performance suture material [^113qPNh2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This laboratory study aimed to evaluate the loop security, knot security, cyclic loading resistance and load-to-failure rate of three different knot types with establishing a new experimental set-up. Additionally, the mode of failure of each knot was evaluated.

Methods

With the use of nonabsorbable, braided polyethylene sutures, USP size No. 2 [Hi-Fi ®; ConMed Linvatec], the arthroscopic knot types Dines, SMC as well as the surgeon's knot were tested using a material testing machine. The knots were tied openly as well as arthroscopically. The set-up enables testing of knot configurations while eliminating friction between knot loop and its suspension points. Including all test procedures, a total of 216 knots were tested.

Results

All openly tied knot types and ten of each type of arthroscopically tied knots resisted against cyclic loading of 1,000 cycles. With subsequent load-to-failure testing, openly tied knot types achieved significantly higher values of tensile strength than arthroscopically tied knots. Regarding clinical failure, defined as an elongation of 3 mm, Dines knot reached highest loop as well as knot security. Knot slippage was the most common failure mechanism at an elongation of 3 mm, whereas suture breakage was evaluated most at an elongation of 6 mm.

Conclusions

The new experimental set-up confirms the loop security of arthroscopic knot types. Using a knot pusher clinically is a key factor to attain this as compared to openly hand-tied techniques. The Dines knot presented the highest reliability. It may provide a secure tissue healing during rehabilitation and consequently can be recommended for clinical application.

### Subcuticular sutures for skin closure in non-obstetric surgery [^115CCQgN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Following surgery, surgical wounds can be closed using a variety of devices including sutures (subcuticular or transdermal), staples and tissue adhesives. Subcuticular sutures are intradermal stitches (placed immediately below the epidermal layer). The increased availability of synthetic absorbable filaments (stitches which are absorbed by the body and do not have to be removed) has led to an increased use of subcuticular sutures. However, in non-obstetric surgery, there is still controversy about whether subcuticular sutures increase the incidence of wound complications.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and acceptability of subcuticular sutures for skin closure in non-obstetric surgery.

Search Methods

In March 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared subcuticular sutures with any other methods for skin closure in non-obstetric surgery were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials, extracted data and carried out risk of bias and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 66 studies (7487 participants); 11 included trials had more than two arms. Most trials had poorly-reported methodology, meaning that it is unclear whether they were at high risk of bias. Most trials compared subcuticular sutures with transdermal sutures, skin staples or tissue adhesives. Most outcomes prespecified in the review protocol were reported. The certainty of evidence varied from high to very low in the comparisons of subcuticular sutures with transdermal sutures or staples and tissue adhesives; the certainty of the evidence for the comparison with surgical tapes and zippers was low to very low. Most evidence was downgraded for imprecision or risk of bias. Although the majority of studies enrolled people who underwent CDC class 1 (clean) surgeries, two-thirds of participants were enrolled in studies which included CDC class 2 to 4 surgeries, such as appendectomies and gastrointestinal surgeries. Most participants were adults in a hospital setting. Subcuticular sutures versus transdermal sutures There may be little difference in the incidence of SSI (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.52; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether subcuticular sutures reduce wound complications (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.71; 1489 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures probably improve patient satisfaction (score from 1 to 10) (at 30 days; MD 1.60, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.88; 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Wound closure time is probably longer when subcuticular sutures are used (MD 5.81 minutes; 95% CI 5.13 to 6.49 minutes; 585 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures versus skin staples There is moderate-certainty evidence that, when compared with skin staples, subcuticular sutures probably have little effect on SSI (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01; 4163 participants); but probably decrease the incidence of wound complications (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98; 2973 participants). Subcuticular sutures are associated with slightly higher patient satisfaction (score from 1 to 5) (MD 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.30; 1232 participants; high-certainty evidence). Wound closure time may also be longer compared with staples (MD 0.30 to 5.50 minutes; 1384 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures versus tissue adhesives, surgical tapes and zippers There is moderate-certainty evidence showing no clear difference in the incidence of SSI between participants treated with subcuticular sutures and those treated with tissue adhesives (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.45; 869 participants). There is also no clear difference in the incidence of wound complications (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.11; 1058 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures may also achieve lower patient satisfaction ratings (score from 1 to 10) (MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.05 to -1.05; 131 participants) (low-certainty evidence). In terms of SSI incidence, the evidence is uncertain when subcuticular sutures are compared with surgical tapes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.27; 354 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or surgical zippers (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.08 to 8.48; 424 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little difference in the incidence of wound complications between participants treated with subcuticular sutures and those treated with surgical tapes (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34; 492 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether subcuticular sutures reduce the risk of wound complications compared with surgical zippers (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.04; 424 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether it takes longer to close a wound with subcuticular sutures compared with tissue adhesives (MD -0.34 to 10.39 minutes; 895 participants), surgical tapes (MD 0.74 to 6.36 minutes; 169 participants) or zippers (MD 4.38 to 8.25 minutes; 424 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported results for patient satisfaction compared with surgical tapes or zippers.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear difference in the incidence of SSI for subcuticular sutures in comparison with any other skin closure methods. Subcuticular sutures probably reduce wound complications compared with staples, and probably improve patient satisfaction compared with transdermal sutures or staples. However, tissue adhesives may improve patient satisfaction compared with subcuticular sutures, and transdermal sutures and skin staples may be quicker to apply than subcuticular sutures. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low; evidence for almost all comparisons was subject to some limitations. There seems to be no need for additional new trials to explore the comparison with staples because there are high-quality studies with large sample sizes and some ongoing studies. However, there is a need for studies exploring the comparisons with transdermal sutures, tissue adhesives, tapes and zippers, with high-quality studies and large sample sizes, including long-term assessments.

### Comparison of rapid absorbable sutures with nonabsorbable sutures in closing transcolumellar incision in septorhinoplasty: short-term outcomes [^116ETvgB]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Following open rhinoplasty, a postoperative scar at the columellar incision line is a common morbidity. The aim of this study is to compare absorbable and nonabsorbable suture materials which had been used for closing the transcolumellar incision, in the aspect of risk of postoperative infection, wound healing, postoperative columellar scar and patient satisfaction.

Method

A prospective, randomized, single-blind study was conducted between May 2017 and February 2018. Sixty-four rhinoplasty patients were randomly assigned to absorbable (n = 32) or nonabsorbable (n = 32) groups. The columellar incision was closed with 7 full-thickness skin sutures. Either nonabsorbable 6/0 polypropylene (Group 1) or absorbable 6/0 polyglytone 6211 (Group 2) sutures were placed at the columellar incisions. Polypropylene sutures were removed at the 7th postoperative day. A Mann-Whitney U test and Monte Carlo were used for statistical comparison. Photographs of the patients at the postoperative third month (Fig. 2) were evaluated and scored in terms of scarring, pigmentation, notching, level differences in the incision area by two different otorhinolaryngologists who did not know the randomization. Suture removing discomfort was assessed with visual analogue scale scores. A satisfaction survey was filled out by all the patients completing their third month after the operation.

Results

According to the results of both otorhinolaryngologists, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of pigmentation, level difference, notching, overall appearance and total score (p = 0.920, p = 0.498, respectively). The mean score on the Wong-Baker scale was 3.19 ± 1.67 in group 1. In the Satisfaction Survey, the average score of the group 1 was 6.90 ± 3.24, while the mean score of the group 2 was 7.062 ± 2.77. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.715).

Conclusions

Suturing inverted V transcolumellar incisions with rapid resorbable sutures caused significantly less discomfort but no difference in scarring compared to nonresorbable sutures as evaluated by patients and observers.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^112nwEDQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Type of suture used for fixation and pain

Only one study, an RCT, reported by Wassenaar et al. [286] investigated the influence that type of suture material used for transfascial suture fixation had on postoperative pain by comparing absorbable (Vicryl) and nonabsorbable (Mersilene) sutures. Their study showed no significant difference in postoperative pain assessed by VAS 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after surgery.

In another randomized study by Bellows et al. [183], patients were randomized to receive local infiltration anesthesia (0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine) in all layers of the abdominal wall to the level of the parietal peritoneum at suture fixation sites (nonabsorbable Gore-Tex sutures) immediately before suture placement compared with a control group that received no local anesthesia. The treated group experienced a statistically significant decrease in postoperative pain scores (VAS, 0–10) 1 h postoperatively (2.2 vs 6.4; p < 0.05). At the other time points (4 and 24 h), the mean pain scores, although lower in the treated group, were not significantly different.

Acute postoperative pain

The incidence of acute postoperative pain was analyzed from the data of four RCT 1B studies [181, 254, 286, 287] and one prospective 2B study [288] (Table 4). In the study of Wassenaar et al. [286] 172 patients were included and randomized into three procedure groups: absorbable sutures with tacks (n = 56), tacks in double-crown technique (n = 60), and nonabsorbable sutures with tacks (n = 56). No significant differences among the different fixation techniques in terms of pain were detected at any time point.

Table 4
Comparison of the incidence of acute postoperative pain in relation to different types of fixation in RCT's

Sut suture, FS fibrin sealant, RCT randomized controlled trial, SR resorbable suture, T tacks, SN nonresorbable suture, NS nonsignificant, S significant

The study of Bansal et al. [181] enrolled 68 patients and randomized them into two procedure groups: tacks (n = 36) and nonabsorbable sutures (n = 32). Tacks fixation resulted in significantly higher pain scores than suture fixation at 1.6 and 24 h and also at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively.

Beldi et al. [254] randomized 40 patients into two procedure groups: nonabsorbable sutures (n = 20) and tacks (n = 20). The transfascial suture group experienced significantly higher pain scores than the tacks group at 6 weeks, but these became nonsignificant at 6 months.

Nguyen et al. [288] reported on another RCT. In their study, pain assessment was studied in two procedure groups: sutures (n = 29) and tacks (n = 21). The two groups showed no significant difference at 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months postoperatively.

### Intraoperative surgical site infection control and prevention: a position paper and future addendum to WSES intra-abdominal infections guidelines [^115qhaJL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for surgical site infection, more specifically with respect to wound closure, sutures, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- triclosan-coated suture compared with non-coated sutures significantly reduces the rate of SSIs

- subcuticular continuous suture compared with interrupted sutures reduces the rate of superficial wound dehiscence

- continuous sutures compared with interrupted sutures show no significant difference in terms of SSI incidence and length of hospital stay.

### A comparison of cosmetic outcomes of lacerations on the extremities and trunk using absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures [^1151PmGX]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the cosmetic outcomes of traumatic trunk and extremity lacerations repaired using absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures. The secondary objective was to compare complication rates between the two groups.

Methods

This was a randomized controlled trial comparing wounds repaired with Vicryl Rapide and Prolene sutures. Pediatric and adult patients with lacerations were enrolled in the study. At a 10-day follow-up, the wounds were evaluated for infection and dehiscence. After 3 months, patients returned to have the wounds photographed. Two plastic surgeons blinded to the method of closure rated the cosmetic outcome of each wound using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Using a noninferiority design, a VAS score of 13 mm or greater was considered to be a clinically significant difference. We used a Student's t-test to compare differences between mean VAS scores and odds ratios (ORs) to compare differences in complication rates between the two groups.

Results

Of the 115 patients enrolled, 73 completed the study including 35 in the Vicryl Rapide group and 38 in the Prolene group. The mean (± SD) age of patients who completed the study was 22.1 (± 15.5) years, and 39 were male. We found no significant differences in the age, race, sex, length of wound, number of sutures, or layers of repair in the two groups. The observer's mean VAS for the Vicryl Rapide group was 54.1 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] = 44.5 to 67.0 mm) and for the Prolene group was 54.5 mm (95% CI = 45.7 to 66.3 mm). The resulting mean difference was 0.5 mm (95% CI = -12.1 to 17.2 mm; p = 0.9); thus noninferiority was established. Statistical testing showed no differences in the rates of complications between the two groups, but a higher percentage of the Vicryl Rapide wounds developed complications.

Conclusions

The use of absorbable sutures for the repair of simple lacerations on the trunk and extremities should be considered as an alternative to nonabsorbable suture repair.

### Biomechanical comparison of tendon coaptation methods with a meshed suture construct [^115jQHnf]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Tendon-to-tendon attachment constructs for tendon reconstructions or transfers need to be secure in order to allow early mobilization after surgery. The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare 2 common constructs secured with a novel mesh suture versus a nonabsorbable braided suture.

Methods

We used 100 cadaveric tendons to create 5 different tendon coaptation constructs (a to e) (10 coaptations per group): (a) Pulvertaft weave with a braided suture (PTe); (b) mesh suture (PTm); (c) single-pass, side-to-side (SP-STS) coaptation with 30-mm overlap using a mesh suture (SP-STS-30m); (d) SP-STS 50-mm overlap with a mesh suture (SP-STS-50m); and (e) SP-STS with 30-mm tendon overlap using a braided suture (SP-STS-30e). The tensile strength, bulk, gliding resistance, and failure type were compared.

Results

There was no difference between the various tendon constructs and the suture type in terms of coaptation bulk. All SP-STS constructs with mesh suture had higher peak gliding resistance than any of the PT constructs regardless of suture type. Compared with the PT constructs, the SP-STS constructs with mesh or braided suture had a higher peak load, peak load normalized to repair length, and stiffness. Within each tendon coaptation construct group, Pulvertaft or SP-STS, the suture type did not affect any of the investigated parameters.

Conclusions

The SP-STS constructs are significantly stronger and stiffer than the PT constructs. The SP-STS with mesh suture exhibited greater gliding resistance than the PT constructs and may result in greater gliding resistance through physiological tissue planes. However, the use of a mesh suture did not affect strength, bulk, gliding resistance, or failure type when compared within a construct group.

Clinical Relevance

The use of SP-STS constructs for tendon coaptations produces a stronger and stiffer construct than the PT weave; however, the use of a mesh suture may not provide any benefit over a braided suture.

### Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures in open rhinoplasty: analysis of columellar scarring [^111G8kYw]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Open rhinoplasty involving columellar incision has gained popularity since the 1930s. Many surgical incision techniques have been employed to obtain better results in terms of postoperative scarring. This study evaluated and compared the results of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures used in open technique rhinoplasty, assessed scar properties regardless of the techniques used, from the perspectives of patients and surgeons.

Objective

This study evaluated and compared the results of absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures used in open technique rhinoplasty from the perspectives of patients and surgeons.

Material and Methods

Study population included 70 patients who underwent primary open rhinoplasty between 2013 and 2018. Rhinoplasty Operations were performed in 2 different centers by a total of 2 rhinoplasty surgeons. Both surgeons used suture materials, which can be used for columellar closure, regardless of patients' skin characteristics. Columellar scars were assessed at an outpatient clinic at least 6 months postoperatively. Patients who could not come to the clinic were excluded from the study. Columellar Scars were assessed using the Turkish Patient Observer Scar Assessment Questionnaire. Patients were also asked to complete a Scar Assessment Analysis Questionnaire at the outpatient clinic, and were photographed from the front, basal, and right and left oblique sides. Three surgeons, who were not part of the research team but routinely performed rhinoplasty, completed the Observer Scar Assessment Questionnaire by examining patients in person at the clinic as well as their photographs.

Results

Observer Scar Assessment Questionnaire results; for the Vicryl group, surgeons ranked pigmentation of the scar as the best criterion (3.34 ± 0.97) and irregularity of the scar as the worst (3.82 ± 1.01). For the Prolene group, surgeons ranked irregularity as the best criterion (3.30 ± 0.97) and stiffness as the worst (3.54 ± 0.94). Although there was no statistically significant result between the two groups in the criteria, the mean scores of the Prolene group were less than the Vicryl group. (3.36 ± 0.46, 3.50 ± 0.65 respectively). Scar Assessment Analysis Questionnaire Results; patients in both the Vicryl and Prolene groups ranked pain as the least important factor (mean 2.9 ± 1.11 and 3.33 ± 1.35, respectively). The Prolene group scored lower than the Vcryl group in terms of overall scarring (3.49 ± 0.72, 3.66 ± 1.37, respectively, P > 0,05).

Conclusions

Absorbable sutures are a convenient alternative to nonabsorbable sutures.

Level Iv

Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention, such as case studies. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.

### FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^117RvVdH]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemostatic suturing technique as a second‐line strategy for control of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony is an effortless, fast, and conservative surgical procedure. It can be performed satisfactorily after a cesarean delivery or after a vaginal delivery. Complications related to its application have been identified but there are no reports of deaths related to compression sutures. Complications can include uterine synechia or ischemia, uterine necrosis, intrauterine infection, and strangulation of the intestinal loop and abdominal omentum when nonabsorbable stitches are used, but nonabsorbable sutures can be used if other types of sutures are not available.

While most births are uncomplicated, obstetricians are often faced with PPH at the time of vaginal or cesarean delivery. If initial management with fundal massage, manual uterine compression, or uterotonics (oxytocin, misoprostol, methergine, or carboprost tromethamine) does not adequately reduce bleeding, placement of compression sutures can be done to slow bleeding and stabilize the patient, avoid hysterectomy, and ultimately reduce maternal morbidity or death. The three most used compression suture techniques for PPH are B‐Lynch, Hayman, and Pereira. Other compression sutures are cited in the literature, such as Cho, Ouahba, Hackethal, and Massuba. If a Bakri balloon is available, the obstetrician can combine any of these three compression sutures with the placement of the balloon to tamponade bleeding. In some instances, expedient placement of an O'Leary stitch for temporary devascularization of the uterine arteries can decrease bleeding and allow additional time for placement of the compression sutures. As with the conduct of cesarean delivery, specific practical issues have to be considered. First, the obstetrician should be well versed in sterile pelvic vascular operative techniques, as placement of sutures will occur at the time of cesarean delivery or with laparotomy following vaginal delivery and PPH. Second, since time is critical to reducing maternal blood loss, an operative team with the technical skills for additional anesthesia, administration of blood products, and surgical assistance is crucial to the success of surgical management. Three commonly used compression sutures are described below and existing data are summarized on the effectiveness of each compression technique.

### Arthroscopic suture tying: a comparison of knot types and suture materials [^1133VKMv]. Arthroscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the structural properties of 3 arthroscopically tied knots using 2 different suture materials: the French knot, the Duncan loop knot, and the original Revo knot.

Type Of Study

Cohort analytic study.

Methods

The sutures used were No. 1 PDS II, an absorbent monofilament, and No. 1 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ), a braided nonabsorbent material. The resulting 6 suture-knot combinations were individually tested to failure in both open- and closed-loop configurations.

Results

The French knot showed the greatest strength compared with the Duncan loop and the Revo knot with both No. 1 Ethibond and No. 1 PDS II sutures (P < .05). The No. 1 Ethibond exhibited higher initial stiffness than the No. 1 PDS II for all 3 knot types (P < .05). Results were similar for both open and closed-loop configurations. Also, the French knot failed predominantly by suture breakage instead of knot slippage for both suture materials.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that, among the suture and knot combinations investigated in this study, the arthroscopic repair of musculoskeletal injuries should be performed using the French knot and No. 1 Ethibond suture.

### Monofilament vs multifilament suture for uterine closure at the time of cesarean delivery: a randomized clinical trial [^115BhJEf]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Different factors may influence the closure of the uterine wall, including suture material. Suture materials may indeed influence tissue healing and therefore the development of scar defects.

Objective

To test whether uterine closure using synthetic absorbable monofilament sutures at the time of cesarean delivery would reduce the rate of cesarean scar defects compared with uterine closure using synthetic absorbable multifilament sutures.

Study Design

Parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized clinical trial of women with singleton pregnancies undergoing cesarean delivery at term in a single center in Italy. The inclusion criteria were singleton pregnancy, first or second cesarean delivery, scheduled and emergent or urgent cesarean deliveries, and gestational age between 37 0/7 and 42 0/7 weeks. Eligible participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the monofilament group (polyglytone 6211 [Caprosyn]; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) or the multifilament suture group (coated polyglactin 910 suture with Triclosan [Vicryl Plus]; Ethicon, Inc, Raritan, NJ). The primary outcome was the incidence of cesarean scar defect at ultrasound at the 6-month follow-up visit. The secondary outcomes were residual myometrial thickness and symptoms.

Results

Overall, 300 women were included in the trial. Of the randomized women, 151 were randomized to the monofilament group and 149 to the multifilament group. However, 27 women were lost to follow-up: 15 in the monofilament group and 12 in the multifilament group. Of note, 6 months after delivery, the incidence rates of cesarean scar defect were 18.4% (25 of 136 patients) in the monofilament group and 23.4% (32 of 137 patients) in the multifilament group (relative risk, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–1.25; P = 0.31). The mean residual myometrial thicknesses were 7.6 mm in the monofilament group and 7.2 mm in the multifilament group (mean difference, +0.40 mm; 95% confidence interval, -0.23 to 1.03). There was no between-group substantial difference found in the incidence of symptoms, including pelvic pain, painful periods, and dyspareunia.

Conclusion

In singleton pregnancies undergoing primary or second cesarean delivery, the use of synthetic absorbable monofilament sutures at the time of uterine wall closure was not associated with a reduction in the rate of cesarean scar defect 6 months after delivery compared with the use of synthetic absorbable multifilament sutures.

### Absorbable suture materials for primary repair of episiotomy and second degree tears [^115EiFE2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 70% of women will experience perineal trauma following vaginal delivery and will require stitches. This may result in pain, suture removal and superficial dyspareunia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different suture materials on short- and long-term morbidity following perineal repair.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing different suture materials for perineal repair after vaginal delivery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 18 trials with 10,171 women; comparisons included: catgut with standard synthetic (nine trials), rapidly absorbing synthetic (two trials), and glycerol impregnated catgut sutures (two trials); and standard synthetic sutures with rapidly absorbing synthetic (five trials) and monofilament sutures (one trial). Compared with catgut, standard synthetic sutures were associated with less pain up to three days after delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.90); and less analgesia up to ten days postpartum (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87). More women with catgut sutures required resuturing (15/1201) compared with synthetic sutures (3/1201) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.74); while more women with standard synthetic sutures required the removal of unabsorbed suture material (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.24). Comparing standard synthetic with rapidly absorbing sutures, short- and long-term pain were similar; in one trial fewer women with rapidly absorbing sutures reported using analgesics at 10 days (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77). More women in the standard synthetic suture group required suture removal compared with those in the rapidly absorbed group (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.36). There was no evidence of significant differences between groups for long-term pain (three months after delivery) or for dyspareunia at three, or at six to 12 months. When catgut and glycerol impregnated catgut were compared, results were similar for most outcomes, although the latter was associated with more short-term pain. One trial examining monofilament versus standard polyglycolic sutures found no differences for most outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Catgut may increase short-term pain compared with synthetic sutures. There were few differences between standard and rapidly absorbing synthetic sutures but more women needed standard sutures removing. For other materials, there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions. Findings should be interpreted in the context of the related Cochrane review on suturing techniques.

### Suture complication rates and surgical outcomes according to the nonabsorbable suture materials used in vaginal uterosacral ligament suspension: polyester versus polypropylene [^1124u3Uy]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate suture complication rates and surgical outcomes according to the nonabsorbable suture materials used in vaginal uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) surgery. Multifilament polyester (polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) and monofilament polypropylene (PP) sutures were compared.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Single teaching hospital.

Patients

Total of 229 patients who underwent transvaginal USLS and completed a 1-year follow-up.

Interventions

Use of PET and PP sutures for transvaginal USLS procedures.

Measurements and Main Results

PP sutures were used in 149 patients, and PET sutures were used in 80 patients. The suture-related complication rates, including granulation tissue and suture erosion at the vaginal apex, were significantly higher in the PET suture group than in the PP suture group (46.3% vs 20.1%, p < .01). However, there was no significant difference in the rates of surgical failure (defined as the presence of vaginal bulging symptoms, apical descent ≥ half of the total vaginal length, anterior or posterior vaginal wall descent beyond the hymen, or retreatment for prolapse) between the 2 groups (p = .84).

Conclusion

Compared with the use of multifilament PET sutures, the use of monofilament PP sutures in transvaginal USLS may reduce suture-related complications without increasing surgical failure rates.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^113rJ8dJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for incisional hernia, more specifically with respect to abdominal closure techniques (laparotomy closure), AHS/EHS 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a specific suture material or continuous versus interrupted technique. Consider using the combination of a continuous small bites suturing technique with a slowly absorbable suture to reduce the risk of incisional hernia.

### Mesh-associated complications in minimally invasive ventral mesh rectopexy: a systematic review [^114HYbE1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Mesh characteristics and fixation

A synthetic mesh was inserted in 2963 consecutive patients, while in 294 patients only biological meshes were used. The remaining 6223 patients were either from a study where both, synthetic and biological meshes were used or no specification about the mesh was made. Generally, mesh-related complications are low, ranging from 0.5% with biological mesh was used, up to 1.9% from studies where the mesh type was not specified. Despite being one of the top three most commonly reported complications, mesh release was not reported following use of biological mesh. Over a third of mesh erosions occurred following a synthetic mesh implant. The group where both types of meshes were used contained the most erosions and fistulations (Table 6).

Table 6
Reported mesh complications in relation to mesh type

Regarding mesh fixation, the use of non-absorbable material was the favoured technique, followed by a combination of absorbable and non-absorbable material. Absorbable fixation alone was never used. Complication rates related to suture material were 1.5% or below (Table 7).

Table 7
Mesh complications in relation to mesh type and fixation material

Complication rates due to fixation technique, are described in Table 8. Different fixation techniques included sutures alone or sutures in combination with a tacker. The highest complication rate of 2% among 2519 patients was observed in the non-specified mesh group when only sutures were used. In the synthetic mesh group, a single-technique appeared slightly superior to a combination of tacker and suture.

### Mesh-fixation method and pain and quality of life after laparoscopic ventral or incisional hernia repair: a randomized trial of three fixation techniques [^113GiFQ2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent, activity-limiting pain after laparoscopic ventral or incisional hernia repair (LVIHR) appears to be related to fixation of the implanted mesh. A randomized study comparing commonly used fixation techniques with respect to postoperative pain and quality of life has not previously been reported.

Methods

A total of 199 patients undergoing non-urgent LVIHR in our unit between August 2005 and July 2008 were randomly assigned to one of three mesh-fixation groups: absorbable sutures (AS) with tacks; double crown (DC), which involved two circles of tacks and no sutures; and nonabsorbable sutures (NS) with tacks. All operations were performed by one of two experienced surgeons, who used a standardized technique and the same type of mesh and mesh-fixation materials. The severity of the patients' pain was assessed preoperatively and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively by using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated by administering a standard health survey before and 3 months after surgery. Results in the three groups were compared.

Results

The AS, DC, and NS mesh-fixation groups had similar patient demographic, hernia and operative characteristics. There were no significant differences among the groups in VAS scores at any assessment time or in the change in VAS score from preoperative to postoperative evaluations. The QoL survey data showed a significant difference among groups for only two of the eight health areas analyzed.

Conclusion

In this trial, the three mesh-fixation methods were associated with similar postoperative pain and QoL findings. These results suggest that none of the techniques can be considered to have a pain-reduction advantage over the others. Development of new methods for securing the mesh may be required to decrease the rate or severity of pain after LVIHR.

### ECLAPTE: effective closure of LAParoTomy in emergency-2023 World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines for the closure of laparotomy in emergency settings [^1162XWXC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Therefore, we conclude that there is no clear evidence for a recommendation about suture material, but some evidence about secondary outcomes suggest that non-absorbable suture may be avoided after emergency midline laparotomy.

2.2 Rapidly absorbable suture versus slowly absorbable suture

When using an absorbable suture for the closure of midline incisions in the emergency setting, we suggest choosing a slowly absorbable material (2A).

Randomized clinical trials and numerous systematic reviews reported a lower incisional hernia rate when closure of the midline incision is performed with a slowly absorbable suture, in both elective and emergency settings. Accordingly, Muysoms et al. (EHS 2015 guidelines) are not recommending the use of rapidly absorbable sutures — with a focus on the specific area of elective surgery —. Most recent data do not confirm strong evidence supporting the implementation of slowly absorbable sutures: a trend of fewer incisional hernia and wound complications is confirmed but without statistical significance.

So, we recommend, based on the high and moderate certainty of evidence, a slowly absorbable suture for the closure of midline emergency laparotomy.

2.3 Monofilament suture versus multifilament suture

We recommend a monofilament suture material (slowly absorbable monofilament suture) in the closure of midline laparotomies in the emergency setting as they may decrease the incidence of incisional hernia (1A).

Our literature research found evidence, suggesting that monofilament sutures are associated with a significantly lower risk of incisional hernia than multifilament sutures in both elective and emergency settings. On the other hand, no evidence specifically about wound complications — wound infections, wound dehiscence, wound sinus, and fistula formation — emerged from previous high/moderate certainty of evidence.

### Histologic change of the meniscus and cartilage tissue after meniscal suture [^117UXFm2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

The influence of suturing on cell infiltration into the meniscus and surrounding tissue is not well known. Histologic changes in the meniscus after suturing and prediction of histologic changes using magnetic resonance imaging were studied. Forty knees in 20 mongrel dogs were studied using four types of 4–0 suture material: nonabsorbable monofilament, nonabsorbable braided, absorbable monofilament, and absorbable braided. Each type of suture material was used for meniscal suture on eight knees each. The other eight knees were not subjected to meniscal suture. Specimens obtained at 1 and 3 months were studied by magnetic resonance imaging and light microscopic analysis. The maximum width of change of meniscal tissue was measured. Changes from the nonabsorbable suture group were smaller than that of the absorbable suture group in magnetic resonance imaging. Histologic changes as seen by light microscope were larger in the absorbable group than in the nonabsorbable group at 1 and 3 months after surgery. Injury was found in the articular cartilage of the femoral condyle in the nonabsorbable braided suture group. Histologic changes were significantly greater when changes in magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity were larger. The current study showed that non-absorbable monofilament suture material results in the least damage to the meniscus and surrounding tissue.

### Mersilene tape versus conventional sutures in transvaginal cervical cerclage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FmGNc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical incompetence is a significant contributor to spontaneous preterm birth, characterized by the inability of the cervix to sustain a pregnancy until full term. This condition can arise from either congenital factors or previous cervical damage.

Cerclage is a widely performed surgical procedure aimed at providing mechanical support to the cervix through the placement of suture material, thereby preventing cervical shortening and opening and reducing the risk of preterm birth(PTB) and second-trimester fetal loss. While the timing and technique of cerclage have been addressed in different guidelines, the impact of suture type on cerclage outcomes has received relatively little attention. Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal suture type for cerclage, and many surgeons may not consider suture type when performing the procedure.

Transvaginal cerclage commonly utilizes a variety of suture types, including Mersilene tape, a thick 5 mm braided polyester fiber; Ethibond, a thinner polyester thread; Prolene, a polypropylene non-braided monofilament; and Nylon. Mersilene tape is the most widely used suture type for cervical cerclage due to its high strength, resistance to breakage and ease of removal. Notably, a national survey conducted in the UK among Obstetrics and Gynaecology consultants revealed a strong inclination towards using Mersilene tape. However, the specific impact of Mersilene tape compared to other suture materials on pregnancy outcomes has not received adequate emphasis in current guidelines. It is crucial to recognize that the choice of suture material significantly influences surgical outcomes. In other surgical procedures, braided suture materials have been associated with an increased risk of infection. Given that infection is a significant underlying factor in cerclage failure, leading to adverse outcomes such as pregnancy loss or PTB, some surgeons opt for non-braided suture materials.

To address this research gap, we conducted a meta-analysis aiming to evaluate the effects of Mersilene tape versus other suture types on cerclage outcomes. Our objective is to provide valuable insights that can inform clinical practice guidelines and recommendations for optimizing cerclage procedures in the management of cervical incompetence.

### Effects of suture choice on biomechanics and physeal status after bioenhanced anterior cruciate ligament repair in skeletally immature patients: a large-animal study [^117CAjeh]. Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures in bioenhanced anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair in a skeletally immature pig model on suture tunnel and growth plate healing and biomechanical outcomes.

Methods

Sixteen female skeletally immature Yorkshire pigs were randomly allocated to receive unilateral, bioenhanced ACL repair with an absorbable (Vicryl) or nonabsorbable (Ethibond) suture augmented by an extracellular matrix-based scaffold (MIACH). After 15 weeks of healing, micro-computed tomography was used to measure residual tunnel diameters and growth plate status, and biomechanical outcomes were assessed.

Results

At 15 weeks postoperatively, there was a significant difference in tunnel diameter with significantly larger diameters in the nonabsorbable suture group (4.4 ± 0.3 mm; mean ± SD) than in the absorbable group (1.8 ± 0.5 mm; P < .001). The growth plate showed a significantly greater affected area in the nonabsorbable group (15.2 ± 3.4 mm(2)) than in the absorbable group (2.7 ± 0.8 mm(2), P < .001). There was no significant difference in the linear stiffness of the repairs (29.0 ± 14.8 N/mm for absorbable v 43.3 ± 28.3 N/mm for nonabsorbable sutures, P = 0.531), but load to failure was higher in the nonabsorbable suture group (211 ± 121.5 N) than in the absorbable suture group (173 ± 101.4 N, P = 0.002). There was no difference between the 2 groups in anteroposterior laxity at 30° (P = 0.5117), 60° (P = 0.3150), and 90° (P = 0.4297) of knee flexion.

Conclusions

The use of absorbable sutures for ACL repair resulted in decreased physeal plate damage after 15 weeks of healing; however, use of nonabsorbable sutures resulted in 20% stronger repairs.

Clinical Relevance

Choice of suture type for ACL repair or repair of tibial avulsion fractures may depend on patient skeletal age and size, with absorbable sutures preferred in very young, small patients at higher risk with physeal damage and nonabsorbable sutures preferred in larger, prepubescent patients who may place higher loads on the repair.

Saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) ligation with or without polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch — In a randomized controlled trial of 40 legs, the overall complication rate was 35% (11 legs) without a between-group difference, and at 2 years duplex showed neovascularization at the SFJ in 4 of 16 legs without a patch vs 5 of 16 with a patch (P = 1.0). We recommend double ligation of the SFJ with nonabsorbable suture (GRADE 1C), but we suggest against using a PTFE patch to cover the saphenous stump (GRADE 2C).

### Subcutaneous closure versus no subcutaneous closure after non-caesarean surgical procedures [^113G98kf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Most surgical procedures involve a cut in the skin that allows the surgeon to gain access to the surgical site. Most surgical wounds are closed fully at the end of the procedure, and this review focuses on these. The human body has multiple layers of tissues, and the skin is the outermost of these layers. The loose connective tissue just beneath the skin is called subcutaneous tissue, and this generally contains fat. There is uncertainty about closure of subcutaneous tissue after surgery: some surgeons advocate closure of subcutaneous tissue, as they consider this closes dead space and leads to a decrease in wound complications; others consider closure of subcutaneous tissue to be an unnecessary step that increases operating time and involves the use of additional suture material without offering any benefit.

Objectives

To compare the benefits (such as decreased wound-related complications) and consequences (such as increased operating time) of subcutaneous closure compared with no subcutaneous closure in participants undergoing non-caesarean surgical procedures.

Search Methods

In August 2013 we searched the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 29 August, 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to August Week 3 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations August 28, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 34); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 23 August 2013). We did not restrict studies with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing subcutaneous closure with no subcutaneous closure irrespective of the nature of the suture material(s) or whether continuous or interrupted sutures were used. We included all RCTs in the analysis, regardless of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing binary (dichotomous) outcomes between the groups and calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model and random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Six of the trials provided data for this review and all of these were at high risk of bias. Six trials randomised a total of 815 participants to subcutaneous closure (410 participants) or no subcutaneous closure (405 participants). Overall, 7.7% of participants (63/815 of participants) developed superficial surgical site infections and there was no clear evidence of a difference between the two intervention groups (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; very low quality evidence). Only two trials reported superficial wound dehiscence, with 7.9% (17/215) of participants developing the problem. It is not clear whether the lack of reporting of this outcome in other trials was because it did not occur, or was not measured. There was no clear evidence of a between-group difference in the proportion of participants who developed superficial wound dehiscence in the trials that reported this outcome (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.41; very low quality evidence). Only one trial reported deep wound dehiscence, which occurred in 8.3% (5/60) of participants. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants who developed deep wound dehiscence between the two groups (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.11; very low quality evidence). Three trials reported the length of hospital stay and found no significant difference between groups (MD 0.10 days; 95% CI -0.45 to 0.64; very low quality evidence). We do not know whether this review reveals a lack of effect or lack of evidence of effect. The confidence intervals for these outcomes were wide, and significant benefits or harms from subcutaneous closure cannot be ruled out. In addition, none of the trials assessed the impact of subcutaneous closure on quality of life, long-term patient outcomes (the follow-up period in the trials varied between one week and two months after surgery) or financial implications to the healthcare provider.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently evidence of very low quality which is insufficient to support or refute subcutaneous closure after non-caesarean operations. The use of subcutaneous closure has the potential to affect patient outcomes and utilisation of healthcare resources. Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary.

### Evaluation of bacterial colonization and clinical properties of different suture materials in dentoalveoler surgery [^111jQfLo]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to compare the effects of 10 different suture materials commonly used in dentoalveolar surgery on wound healing, their postoperative microbial colonization, and related clinical parameters.

Methods

A total of 172 suture samples from patients who had undergone extraction of impacted third molars were included in the study. The suture materials studied were poly-glycolide-colactide, fast absorbable poly-glycolide-colactide, poly-glycolic acid-cocaprolactone, polydioxanone, silk, polypropylene, polyvinylidene difluoride, polyamide, polyester, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The microbial colonization in all sutures and clinical parameters were evaluated after 1 week.

Results

Multifilament sutures had higher bacterial colonization compared with monofilament sutures (P < .001). No dental plaque accumulation was observed in any samples of polypropylene sutures. Polydioxanone, PTFE, and poly-glycolic acid-cocaprolactone sutures exhibited less postoperative slack compared with all other sutures after 1 week. Patients with silk, polyvinylidene difluoride, and PTFE sutures had less suture-related discomfort. According to the Landry index score, monofilament sutures demonstrated superior wound healing to multifilament sutures (P = 0.019). In addition, nonabsorbable sutures showed significantly better wound epithelization than absorbable sutures (P ˂ .001).

Conclusions

Bacterial colonization and tissue reactions due to the surface properties of the suture affected the wound healing after dentoalveolar surgery. Multifilament sutures should not be applied for prolonged periods because of their tendency for microbial colonization. The tissue reaction to the absorbable suture materials may adversely affect wound healing.

### The case for standardizing cesarean delivery technique: seeing the forest for the trees [^116XU5as]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Skin Closure

Previously, skin closure with either staples or subcuticular suture was recommended based on nine RCTs or systematic reviews. Since then, 19 RCTs and one systematic review have been performed addressing skin closure techniques. – These trials range in a variety of comparisons, including subcuticular suture compared with staples, different staple removal times, subcuticular suture compared with subcuticular staples, interrupted compared with running subcuticular suture, monofilament compared with multifilament suture, or subcuticular suture compared with glue. In a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs, subcuticular suture closure significantly reduced wound morbidity with no difference in pain, patient satisfaction, or cosmesis. In trials that included women with obesity, subcuticular suture was superior to staples. One trial demonstrated that monofilament suture reduced wound complications compared with multifilament suture.

Recommendation: subcuticular, absorbable monofilament suture.

### Cosmetic outcomes of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures in pediatric facial lacerations [^1112XfFr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to compare the long-term cosmetic outcomes of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for facial lacerations in children and to compare the complication rates and parental satisfaction in the 2 groups.

Design/Methods

Healthy patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department with facial lacerations were randomized to repair using fast-absorbing catgut or nylon suture. Patients were followed up at 5 to 7 days and at 3 months. Three blinded observers, using a previously validated 100-mm cosmesis visual analogue scale (VAS) as the primary instrument, rated photographs of the wound taken at 3 months. For this noninferiority study, a VAS score of 15 mm or greater was considered to be the minimal clinically important difference. Parents also rated the wound using the VAS and completed a satisfaction survey.

Results

Of the 88 patients initially enrolled, 47 patients completed the study: 23 in the catgut group and 24 in the nylon group. There were no significant differences in age, race, sex, wound length, number of sutures, and layered repair rates in the 2 groups. The observers' mean VAS for the catgut group was 92.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 89.1–95.4) and that for the nylon group was 93.7 (95% CI, 91.4–96.0), with a difference of the means of 1.4 (95% CI, -5.31 to 8.15), which was less than the minimal clinically important difference of 15 mm (power, > 90%). The mean parental VAS score for the catgut group was 86.3 (95% CI, 78.4–94.1) and that for the nylon group was 91.2 (95% CI, 86.9–95.4), with a difference of the means of 4.9 (95% CI, 2.41–7.41), also less than 15 mm. There were no significant differences in the rates of infection, wound dehiscence, keloid formation, and parental satisfaction.

Conclusions

The use of fast-absorbing catgut suture is a viable alternative to nonabsorbable suture in the repair of facial lacerations in children.

### Equal cosmetic outcomes with 5–0 poliglecaprone-25 versus 6–0 polypropylene for superficial closures [^117La3VG]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous sutures should provide an aesthetically pleasing result. After placing subcutaneous sutures, enough absorbable suture often remains for the superficial closure. Mohs surgeons often use a nonabsorbable suture to close the superficial layer to obtain cosmetically elegant results, but using this additional suture is less cost effective than using the remaining absorbable suture.

Objectives

To compare the cosmetic results of simple running sutures using an absorbable suture material (5–0 poliglecaprone-25) with those of a nonabsorbable suture (6–0 polypropylene) in primary closures of suitable facial Mohs defects.

Materials and Methods

Fifty-two patients with 57 facial Mohs surgery defects appropriate for multilayer primary repair had the defects prospectively randomized into a side-by-side comparison. After closure of the deep layers with 5–0 poliglecaprone-25 sutures, half of the wound was closed with a 5–0 poliglecaprone-25 simple running suture, and the other half of the wound was closed with a 6–0 polypropylene simple running suture. The investigators blindly determined the cosmetically superior side of the closure at 1 week and 4 months after suture removal.

Results

Forty-four patients (48 total defects) completed the study. At the 4-month follow-up, 85% (41/48) did not show any difference between poliglecaprone-25 and polypropylene, 4% (2/48) had better outcomes with poliglecaprone-25, and 10% (5/48) had better outcomes with polypropylene. There was no statistically significant cosmetic difference between the two closure types. Wound complications such as infection, hematoma, and dehiscence did not occur in any of the patients.

Conclusion

In primary closures of facial defects, using 5–0 poliglecaprone-25 or 6–0 polypropylene for the superficial closure did not affect the cosmetic result. Therefore, 5–0 poliglecaprone-25 provides a comparable and cost-effective alternative to nonabsorbable sutures for epidermal approximation in layered closures.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society [IEHS])-part 2 [^112mPLqA]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Studies using only transfascial suture fixation

Chelala et al. [102] analyzed 400 cases in which mesh was fixed with transfascial suture only. They also closed the hernia defect with nonabsorbable sutures. The mean operative time was 74 min, and no recurrent hernias were detected during a mean follow-up period of 28 months. Varghese et al. [181], reported that tacking of mesh to Cooper's ligament was not sufficient. Berger et al. [182] described a case involving dislodgement of tacks when tacks alone were used to fix mesh to the pubic symphysis.

No studies have compared recurrence rates and types of mesh.

Comments

The current data do not give precise rates of recurrence. The total number of patients is small, and the follow-up period is short. Theoretically, laparoscopic exploration allows us to inspect the entire previous incision and to cover it with a mesh, thus reducing the probability for a recurrent hernia. On the other hand, laparoscopic repair does not always include closure of the defect and therefore often relies solely on the strength of the mesh and its fixation. More studies are required to consider these issues.

### Non-absorbable running suture in coarctation repair in infants: a cross-sectional study [^115SLGxG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Suture deterioration

Polypropylene is actually not biodegradable but can deteriorate over time. Generally, the sutures have sufficient strength to endure the distracting forces present after anastomosis, but occasionally they may break. However, suture breakage is rarely documented because it is difficult to demonstrate in surgical histopathology. There are several reasons why sutures may break. One possibility is that the suture is subjected to an excessive load relative to its tensile strength, such as in instances of high blood pressure. Another possible mechanism is damage caused by surgical manipulation by the surgeon or nurse in the operating room. Following suture breakage, the circular constraint is lost, allowing growth at the anastomosis site.

### Interventions for trachoma trichiasis [^1123ooWw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

8. Absorbable (polyglactin‐910) compared to non‐absorbable (silk) sutures

One trial investigated this comparison (Rajak 2011b). 1300 participants with major trichiasis were randomised to absorbable polyglactin‐910 sutures or silk sutures and followed‐up at one year and two years.

8.1 Post‐operative trichiasis

Post‐operative trichiasis at one year and two years was similar between the two groups (Table 5).

5
Absorbable (polyglactin‐910) compared to non‐absorbable (silk) sutures

8.2 Visual acuity change

Change (deterioration of one or more lines) in visual acuity between baseline and two years was similar in the two groups (Table 5).

8.3 Corneal opacification change

There was less deterioration in corneal opacification between baseline and one year in the absorbable sutures group and more at two years but the confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (Table 5).

8.4 Acceptance of treatment

Not reported.

8.5 Adverse effects

Fewer granulomas were found in the absorbable sutures group at six months (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.99, 1187 eyes).

8.6 Quality of life

9. Sticking tape compared to epilation

One study reported this comparison and followed up to 3 months (Graz 1999). The study randomised 57 participants.

9.1 Post‐operative trichiasis

The use of sticking tape alone was significantly more effective at preventing eyelashes from touching the eye compared to epilation alone at three months (Table 6).

6

9.2 Visual acuity change

Snellen visual acuity was measured using the 'E' optotype, but outcomes were not reported.

9.3 Corneal opacification change

Not reported.

9.4 Acceptance of treatment

Attendance for treatment was not recorded but it was mentioned in the discussion that there may have been compliance issues.

9.5 Adverse effects

Not reported.

9.6 Quality of life

A patient questionnaire of six closed‐response questions was used to measure levels of discomfort; results were summarised as 'complaint' versus 'no complaint'. Patients found the less successful treatment of epilation significantly more uncomfortable than the sticking tape (P = 0.002); this was only reported on those with unilateral trichiasis.

### A randomized, prospective trial evaluating surgeon preference in selection of absorbable suture material [^111i76NZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

This study is the first double-blinded, randomized comparison of two absorbable sutures. To better understand product characteristics and surgeon preference, we conducted a study of two similar-appearing FDA-approved sutures, glyconate and poliglecaprone 25. Four dermatologic surgeons were enlisted. A total of 48 patients with 53 surgical sites were examined. One half of each surgical wound was closed with one type of suture and the other half with the other type. Each half was evaluated for product characteristics. There was no statistically significant difference in surgeon preference for glyconate versus poliglecaprone 25 (P = 0.64). Of the cohort preferring poliglecaprone 25, there was a correlation with speed of closure (P = 0.06). Of the surgeons that preferred glyconate, we found significantly better visibility (P = 0.03), reduced suture breakage during knot tying (P = 0.05), and correlation with better handling properties (P = 0.06) associated with that preference. The data from this study will enable products to be designed towards these needs and allow surgeons to select sutures that more precisely fit their particular requirements.

### Barbed suture strength in sacrocolpopexy: does pattern matter? [^114sqvY4]. Urogynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although barbed suture in sacrocolpopexy is becoming increasingly common, an accepted vaginal attachment pattern for barbed suture has not been established.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the structural properties of 3 different barbed suture attachment patterns used to fixate mesh to the vagina during sacrocolpopexy.

Study Design

Segments of type 1 polypropylene mesh (Restorelle; Coloplast, Humlebaek, Denmark) measuring 6 × 3 cm were affixed to rectus abdominis fascia from 5 fresh-frozen female cadavers. Barbed 6-inch 2–0 polydioxanone (Stratafix; Ethicon, Raritan, NJ) with 3 different attachment patterns and nonbarbed 2–0 polydioxanone were used for fixation. Barbed suture attachment patterns included circular, horizontal, and vertical patterns. Mechanical testing was carried out using a uniaxial tensile test to failure.

Results

Tensile testing resulted in similar mechanical properties across all suture attachment pattern groups. Analyses found no significant effect of suture attachment pattern stiffness or the extension at failure. One-way ANOVAs revealed a global effect of suture attachment pattern on the load at failure (P = 0.0188) and energy at failure (P = 0.0435), but this significance was eliminated after controlling for multiple comparisons. A significant (P = 0.0459) increase in ultimate load was found when comparing the horizontal attachment pattern to the vertical attachment pattern.

Conclusions

No difference was observed when comparing suture attachment patterns (circular, horizontal, and vertical). However, a statistically significant difference in ultimate load favored the horizontal attachment over the vertical attachment. Furthermore, there was no difference observed when comparing nonbarbed interrupted suture attachment to the 3 barbed suture attachment patterns.

### Delphi consensus on intraoperative technical / surgical aspects to prevent surgical site infection after colorectal surgery [^115fkQjs]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial sutures

Statement 8: Triclosan-coated or impregnated antimicrobial sutures (TCS) are associated with a reduced risk of SSI compared with non-antimicrobial sutures.

TCS work to inhibit bacterial colonization, prevent formation of suture-prosthetic biofilm, and kill bacteria associated with SSI through the antimicrobial properties of triclosan. In one meta-analysis of RCTs, TCS were shown to significantly reduce SSI compared with non-antimicrobial sutures after CRS (RR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.48–0.94). This was consistent with the largest overall meta-analysis of 21 RCTs assessing colorectal, abdominal, and other surgery types (n = 6,462) showing that TCS significantly reduced SSIs (RR = 0.72; 95% CI 0.60–0.86). Similar results were found in a propensity score–matched analysis in colorectal cancer surgery (4.3% vs. 16.1%; p = 0.007). Another RCT in emergency laparotomy, through a midline approach, showed that TCS lowered incisional SSI compared with conventional sutures (7.6% compared with 23.4%; p = 0.009). Guidelines from NICE, WHO, CDC, ACS/SIS, and WSES either recommended their use or consideration of their use with evidence derived from several systematic reviews and meta-analyses. -, An economic analysis demonstrated that TCS used for incision closure after colorectal surgery were projected to significantly reduce median payer costs by at least $809 per patient compared with non-antimicrobial sutures.

It is important that antimicrobial sutures are used for closure of all incisional wound layers to ensure a zone of microbial inhibition throughout the whole incision, mitigating the risk of wound contamination and SSI, particularly in obese patients. Antimicrobial polydioxanone sutures used for closure of the abdominal musculo-fascial layer are triclosan impregnated, not coated, and provide a prolonged antimicrobial effect which matches the slow resorption of polydioxanone. Triclosan-coated polyglactin sutures should be used for the subcutaneous layer and triclosan impregnated poliglecaprone for the subcuticular layer. Triclosan-coated sutures were shown in vivo and in vitro to be nontoxic, nonirritating, noncarcinogenic, and nonteratogenic. A 10-year clinical survey also showed no relationship between triclosan usage and antibiotic resistance.

### The origin and development of interrupted subcuticular suture: an important technique for achieving optimum wound closure [^111zVarX]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

A comprehensive search of PubMed was conducted to identify articles related to subcuticular suture techniques. The search terms included interrupted subcuticular suture, buried suture, and tension-reduction suture. The non-English language was the only exclusion criteria. The bibliographies of relevant articles were searched for additional references.

Origin of the Subcuticular Suture Technique

The subcuticular suture was invented at the end of the 19th century to reduce wound infection and promote wound healing. William S. Halsted first proposed the concept of buried sutures for treating inguinal hernias. Halsted's suture technique for skin closure over the repaired hernia cord involved burying interrupted sutures of fine silk in dogs, and these buried silk sutures were placed entirely within the lower layer of the skin without contacting contaminants on the skin surface(Figure 1 A, B). During the experiment, Halsted found that wound infection rates decreased notably with buried sutures. Until 1895, the subcuticular suture remained the same. Gradually, the subcuticular suture has been proven to reduce the width of scars because of their tension-reducing effects on wound edges, and doctors have started trying to use absorbable sutures instead of nonabsorbable sutures for subcuticular suture.

Comparison of everted and plane sutures. (A) Suture path of Halsted's buried sutures; (B) side view after buried suture with a planar wound; (C) suture path of buried vertical sutures; (D) ridge-like side view after buried vertical suture with wound edge eversion.

Evolution of the Subcuticular Suture Technique

Buried sutures are essentially planar closures with minimal skin edge eversion and tension-reduction effects. This is far from ideal for doctors who insist on avoiding "cosmetically unappealing scars". Since then, the development of the subcuticular suture technique is mainly to change the needle entry point, exit point, and the rivet point of the skin, in return for better effect of tension-reduction and skin edge eversion effects.

### A biomechanical analysis of suture materials and their influence on a four-strand flexor tendon repair [^116v4XRT]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Flexor tendon repair strength depends on the suture technique and the suture material used. Configurations that incorporate locking loops prevent sutures from pulling through the tendon but typically fail because of suture breakage. The choice of suture material therefore influences repair strength. This study investigated the mechanical properties of 5 nonabsorbable 4–0 suture materials (monofilament nylon, monofilament polypropylene, braided polyester, braided stainless steel wire, and braided polyethylene) and evaluated their performance when used in a locking 4-strand flexor tendon repair configuration.

Methods

Five samples of 2 strands of each suture type were tested mechanically to determine the material stiffness and ultimate load. In addition, 50 fresh porcine flexor tendons were divided and repaired with each of the 5 suture materials using a 4-strand single-cross technique. Gap force, ultimate strength, and stiffness were measured to compare biomechanical performance.

Results

All repairs failed by suture rupture at the locking loop. Fibrewire and stainless-steel sutures and repairs were significantly stronger and stiffer than the other suture types. The results for Prolene and Ethibond were similar in the tendon repair groups with respect to gap and ultimate forces although Ethibond provided significantly increased repair stiffness. Nylon sutures and repairs consistently produced the poorest mechanical performance in all outcome measures.

Conclusions

Suture material strongly influences the biomechanical performance of multistrand tendon repairs and is an important consideration for the surgeon. Fibrewire and stainless steel are the most biomechanically suitable suture materials for flexor tendon repair whereas nylon is the least suitable. Further developments in suture materials are important for advancements in flexor tendon repair strength.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^113jG5Fs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Rationale/background — suture technique context: Creation of vascular access is associated with a significant risk of primary failure, and suture techniques are among factors studied for their influence on arteriovenous (AV) access creation; vessel apposition by suturing can be performed in a continuous or an interrupted fashion, and studies have shown hemodynamic advantage for interrupted anastomosis in the presence of pulsatile flow; due to difficulties in execution and lack of adequate devices to perform interrupted anastomosis, continuous suturing is the most prevalent anastomotic technique, and Two new devices have been evaluated and may help surgeons to use interrupted suturing to perform vascular access anastomosis.

### Polyester 5–0 suture for porous implant placement after retinoblastoma enucleation: analysis of 120 sockets [^114XdZJU]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine polyester 5–0 sutures for locking the rectus muscles to the porous implant and their influence on the rate of exposure and other complications in retinoblastoma patients. It has been confirmed that the techniques used to suture the rectus muscles can influence the exposure rate. However, few comparisons of different sutures have been conducted for the subsequent exposure of porous polyethylene implants. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the application of polyester 5–0 sutures for orbital implants.

The incidence of unwrapped orbital implant exposure varies in the literature due to the use of different suture materials, including 5–0 polyester sutures (2.0–9.6%), 5–0 or 6–0 Vicryl sutures (5–46%), and 5–0 catgut sutures (53.0%). In this case series, the authors found a reduced exposure rate (5.8%) in the 5–0 polyester suture cases, which is consistent with a previous report.

Absorbable sutures, including Vicryl, polyglactin, and catgut sutures, are also used to lock the four rectus muscles to the anterior surface of implants. However, there are some disadvantages regarding absorbable sutures. Polyglactin 910 sutures are associated with implant extrusion or migration with absorbable sutures, partly because of the absorbable nature of the suture, which might lose its tensile strength, resulting in lower breaking points over time. Patients have also experienced the development of stitch abscesses. Therefore, most authors prefer to use braided nonabsorbable sutures to close surgical wounds. In contrast to absorbable sutures, polyester has an absolute higher breaking point. As a result, none of our patients experienced implant extrusion or migration with nonabsorbable 5–0 polyester sutures in our study.

### Single-blind, randomized study comparing clinical equivalence of trulene and prolene polypropylene sutures in elective primary coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^114ZwEZu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The traditional on-pump or the newer off-pump techniques are usually opted for CABG surgeries; both involves blood vessel harvesting from the chest, arm or leg. A registry-based study found similar short term (30 days) and mid-term (3 years) mortality rate along with incidence of MACCE in patients who underwent isolated CABG using either of the techniques. However, the cost-effective off-pump CABG was reported to be associated with shorter duration of hospital stays, lesser requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and reduction in intubation time. Median sternotomy is the gold standard approach for cardiac surgical procedures in children and adults, but without the cosmetic benefit that is achieved only by minimally invasive cardiothoracic surgery as in thoracotomy. Though the practice of minimally invasive CABG is increasing, but median sternotomy is primarily performed because of its technical ease in delicate vascular dissection and suturing, exposing multiple areas of the heart, arteries and aorta. In median sternotomy, left internal mammary artery is used as a conduit, along with other grafts viz. saphenous vein out of the lower extremities, right internal mammary artery, the radial artery, and the gastroepiploic artery depending on the location of the arteries. Radial artery graft and left internal mammary artery has longer patency (> 90%). Polypropylene monofilament is commonly used to anchor the graft at each end of the coronary arteriotomy that increases the patency of the proximal and distal coronary arterial lumens. Polypropylene suture is stronger than nylon and offers better overall wound security. An international, multi-centre, prospective cohort study by Ursulescu evaluated the performance of a polypropylene suture Optilene for anastomosis construction in CABG surgery with respect to the incidence of MACCE. However, no randomized study has compared two commonly used brands of nonabsorbable polypropylene sutures for anastomoses repair following CABG surgery in Indian population.

### A bioabsorbable mechanoelectric fiber as electrical stimulation suture [^112r7jVP]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In surgical medicine, suturing is the standard treatment for large incisions, yet traditional sutures are limited in functionality. Electrical stimulation is a non-pharmacological therapy that promotes wound healing. In this context, we designed a passive and biodegradable mechanoelectric suture. The suture consists of multi-layer coaxial structure composed of (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), polycaprolactone) and magnesium to allow safe degradation. In addition to the excellent mechanical properties, the mechanoelectrical nature of the suture grants the generation of electric fields in response to movement and stretching. This is shown to speed up wound healing by 50% and reduce the risk of infection. This work presents an evolution of the conventional wound closure procedures, using a safe and degradable device ready to be translated into clinical practice.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^113nv3CV]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Skin closure materials — synthetic, monofilament sutures have the lowest risk of harboring bacteria and this may contribute to a reduced risk of infection (Level of certainty: high). For skin closure in wounds at high risk for dehiscence, sutures are better than tissue adhesives for minimizing wound dehiscence (Level of certainty: low), and well-approximated wound edges during skin closure may decrease SSI (Level of certainty: moderate). Monofilament sutures should be considered instead of multifilament sutures for superficial skin closure, and if the risk of dehiscence is low, monofilament sutures may also be used for deep closure of contaminated wounds and in deep regions considered at high risk for infection (Evidence: grade C). The use of sutures or staples for skin closure does not appear to alter infection rates (Evidence: grade C). Selective use of tissue adhesives for skin closure, in the presence of optimal skin edge approximation, may be considered; however, it is unclear at present if there is an impact on SSI with the use of tissue adhesives, and if wound dehiscence is a concern, sutures would be the first option. Triclosan-coated sutures can be considered in patients at highest risk for SSI (Evidence: grade C).

### Could robotic-assisted surgery reduce mesh-related complications after ventral mesh rectopexy? Experience of a tertiary centre and systematic review of the literature [^113V5str]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

In the present review, the percentages of synthetic mesh use in both groups were very similar (87.9% vs. 91.6%). However, it is essential to emphasize that the percentage of polyester mesh used in the laparoscopy group was 27.7% while there was no report of polyester mesh use in the robotic group. Polyester mesh has a higher risk of erosion than polypropylene implants and our results were consistent with the literature [17/1102 (1.54%) vs. 15/2198 (0.68%), respectively]. However, in the two cases of mesh erosion after RVMR, van Iersel et al. used polyprolene mesh while the type of the mesh was not reported in the study of Laitakari et al.

Another important point that should be addressed is the type of suture material used to fix the mesh on the rectum. Tejedor et al. have compared the mesh erosion rate after LVMR, according to the type of suture in a case‐matched study and found that using PDS instead of polyester reduces the risk of mesh‐related complications. A consensus statement by the Pelvic Floor Society (an affiliate of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland) advised that rectal sutures should be PDS if a synthetic mesh is used. Therefore, it is noteworthy that all the reported suture material used in the cases of mesh erosion is nonabsorbable (Table 2). In the two cases of mesh erosion after RVMR, van Iersel et al. used polyester, while the type of the suture was not stated in the study of Laitakari et al.

### Arthroscopic fixation of tibial eminence fractures: a clinical comparative study of nonabsorbable sutures versus absorbable suture anchors [^112oGuY2]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare clinical outcomes of arthroscopic therapy for tibial eminence fracture with nonabsorbable suture and absorbable suture anchor.

Methods

Between February 2010 and September 2012, a total of 60 tibial eminence fracture patients were treated with nonabsorbable suture fixation or absorbable suture anchor fixation under arthroscopy. Patients with tibial plateau fractures and other significant injuries, including osteochondral lesions, meniscal tear, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or mutiligament injuries, were excluded from the study. Radiographs, anterior drawer test (ADT), Lachman test, Lysholm score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score were employed to evaluate clinical outcomes in follow-up.

Results

A total of 41 patients were analyzed. Among these patients, 22 were treated with nonabsorbable suture fixation and 19 with absorbable suture anchor fixation. According to the modified Meyers-McKeever classification, 15 cases were categorized as type II, 21 as type III, and 5 as type IV fractures. The mean time from injury to surgery was 7.1 days (range, 3 to 12 days). All patients were followed up for a median period of 33.7 months (range, 24 to 45 months). Radiographic evaluation showed optimal reduction immediately after operation and bone union within 3 months in all patients. At the final follow-up, there was no limitation of knee motion range in any patient. Grade II laxity was found in 2 cases from suture group and 1 from suture anchor group, showing no significant difference based on ADT (χ² = 0.538, P = 0.764) and Lachman test (χ² = 0.550, P = 0.760). Lysholm and IKDC 2000 subjective scores were significantly improved (P < .001). However, there were no significant differences in the improvement of Lysholm (t = 0.522, P = 0.604) and IKDC 2000 subjective scores (t = 0.644, P = 0.523) between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

Nonabsorbable suture fixation and absorbable suture anchor fixation are equivalent techniques in terms of the clinical efficacy of arthroscopic tibial eminence fracture treatment.

### Mersilene tape versus conventional sutures in transvaginal cervical cerclage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116NZXNZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

It appears that Mersilene tape does not offer any additional advantages compared to other suture types in terms of cerclage efficacy. The choice of suture type remains a matter of traditional practice or individual preference among obstetricians, as both Mersilene tape and other commonly used monofilament sutures have their own strengths and weaknesses. Mersilene tape, a synthetic, non-absorbable, braided polyester tape, possesses high tensile strength and excellent handling characteristics. In the Shirodkar procedure, the 5-mm-wide Mersilene tape suture is easier to visualize by ultrasound compared to the no. 2 nylon suture used in the McDonald procedure, making it easier to remove. Its design is specifically engineered to provide long-term support and stability when used for suturing purposes. Additionally, due to its non-absorbable nature, Mersilene tape remains in the body indefinitely without breaking down over time. As a result, it is well-suited for applications that require long-term tissue support, such as spinal deformity correction and pelvic organ prolapse surgery. However, the use of this braided, non-absorbable, multifilament tape has been discontinued in urogynecology and ophthalmology due to a higher risk of complications, including erosions and infections. On the other hand, monofilament sutures are less flexible and may pose challenges in tying knots, with their knots being more prone to loosening due to inferior knot security. Some obstetricians express concerns about the fine nature of monofilament sutures, speculating that they may cut through tissues more easily, and that removing them may require anesthesia due to difficulties in locating the threads. However, these claims lack substantial evidence in the context of cerclage and warrant further study.

### Polyester 5–0 suture for porous implant placement after retinoblastoma enucleation: analysis of 120 sockets [^111RAN6s]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite progress in globe-saving treatment modalities for retinoblastoma, enucleation and insertion of a primary orbital implant, is still the preferred treatment of choice for advanced cases to provide acceptable cosmesis. Overall enucleation rate in intraocular retinoblastoma was 42.7% in one large series. It's worth noting that enucleation was still the first line treatment in 21.4% intraocular disease, mainly (40.1%) in advanced stages (groups D/E). Meanwhile, secondary enucleation rate was reported as 27.2% following intravenous chemotherapy and/or focal treatments, 44.7% following intravenous and/or intra-arterial chemotherapy, and rare with naive bilateral eyes following intra-arterial chemotherapy. The ideal implant should be easy to surgically implant and have low complication rates. However, complications after enucleation such as socket contraction, migration, exposure or extrusion of the implant require revision surgery. Exposure is the most common postoperative complication. Approximately 4.9–18.0% of retinoblastoma patients experience implant exposure, even with porous polyethylene implants, which has theoretical advantages and a favorable outcome over nonporous implants. Thus, postoperative exposure is still a major problem following enucleation.

The techniques used to suture the rectus muscles can influence the exposure rate. While absorbable sutures have a lower tensile strength and remain for only approximately two to 3 weeks in tissue, patients might experience implant extrusion or migration. Therefore, most authors prefer to use nonabsorbable sutures to suture surgical wounds. Polyester sutures, as nonabsorbable sutures, have low tissue reactivity and excellent handling and tensile strength, and they retain suture strength in vivo for extended periods compared to other sutures. It has been reported that polyester sutures have been used to lock the four rectus muscles to the anterior surface of unwrapped hydroxyapatite orbital implants with a low exposure rate (2.0%). However, few comparisons of different sutures regarding the exposure of porous polyethylene implants have been conducted.

Hence, it seems worthwhile to evaluate the efficacy of polyester sutures for porous polyethylene implants in clinical use. In this study, we report the outcome of retinoblastoma in children who underwent enucleation and primary placement of porous polyethylene with polyester 5–0 suture to lock the rectus muscles to the anterior surface.

### Unveiling the invisible: complication of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy illuminated by transcervical injection of ICG [^11143hrY]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is widely considered the gold standard for advanced prolapse repair due to its efficacy and favorable long-term results. Although mesh complications are relatively rare, when they do occur, one in ten require interventions such as mesh removal.

The increasing use of synthetic mesh in urogynaecological and pelvic surgery has led to a parallel increase in mesh-related complications. Reported complications include mesh erosion (11%), mesh exposure (10.5%), infection (0.7–8%), recurrent prolapse (21% anatomical and 10.5% symptomatic), dyspareunia (9%), wound granulation (7.8%), and more serious problems such as organ perforation or bowel obstruction (6%), bladder and ureteral injury (< 3%).

The procedure used a monofilament macroporous polypropylene mesh as required for mesh in prolapse surgery. The sutures used were Ethibond multifilament sutures. As the procedure was originally performed in a remote hospital, we can only speculate that these materials were chosen based on availability and the specific surgical context. However, we acknowledge the potential risks associated with multifilament, nonabsorbable sutures, such as increased bacterial colonization, which could lead to complications such as fistula or abscess formation. Recent literature has examined the impact of suture selection in sacrocervicopexy. A randomized controlled trial comparing absorbable and permanent sutures in laparoscopic sacrocervicopexy found that while both types of sutures provided effective results, nonabsorbable sutures provided more durable fixation but carried a potential risk of infection-related complications. In terms of recommendations, monofilament nonabsorbable sutures such as polypropylene may be a viable alternative as they have a lower risk of bacterial adherence while maintaining long-term support. Ultimately, the choice of suture should be based on the patient's specific conditions, the surgeon's expertise, and institutional protocols.

### Comparison of various methods and materials for treatment of skin laceration by a 3-dimensional measuring technique in a pig experiment [^117TP8hP]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The ability to obtain an objective comparison of scar formations by reproducible and quantitatively measurable results have posed a longstanding problem. This was especially troublesome when conclusions were to be drawn about the materials and methods applied. Two-dimensional methods (photography) gave no plastic impression about the spatial coherences in an examined scar. However, a quantifiable and reproducible recording of volumes and a 3-dimesional visualization of scars should provide the basis of any evaluation of methods and materials.

Methods

The OPTOCAT 3-dimensional scanning technique that was used was provided by the Breuckmann GmbH Company (Meersburg, Germany), and it permits a 3-dimensional, contact-free recording of data. The experiment animal was the Goettinger minipig. A total of 10 animals were used to examine the process of wound healing and scar development in full skin incisions. Every animal was incised 20 times with a 10-cm long and 20 times with a 2-cm long wound. In our investigation, comparable suture materials (skin adhesive, absorbing and nonabsorbing suture materials) of the companies Braun (Histaocryl, Monosyn, Safil, Premilene) and Ethicon (Dermabond, Monocryl, Vicryl, Prolene) as well as various suture techniques were used (continuous, mattress suture, and over-and-over/interrupted suture; each once with and once without an intracutaneous suture). In the course of the trial, numerous images of all wounds-a total 1200-were taken. Thanks to the 3-dimensional software, the resulting scar volumes of lacerations, which received different wound management, were quantifiably recorded, compared, and evaluated.

Results

In total, dehiscence occurred in 2.5% of all treated wounds. The greatest share (15%) fell to wounds treated with Histoacryl skin adhesive. In the end, skin adhesive, mattress, and interrupted suture all delivered similar results. An additional intracutaneous suture had, with an increasing wound length, a positive effect on the intention/wound healing, especially in connection with the application of skin adhesive. Except the combination of continuous absorbable suture and intracutaneous suture, the scar volume dwindled over time and adapted to the surrounding skin level. Continuous sutures were, by comparison, more inclined to an increased scarring (absorbable suture > nonabsorbable suture). It did not escape our notice that in case of small wounds, all various suturing materials and methods led to almost identical results. With respect to scarring, no significant difference regarding the suturing material was proven.

Conclusions

If possible, the wound closure, treated with common suturing techniques and especially with skin adhesive, should be enhanced by an intracutaneous suture with an increasing length of the wound. Under certain circumstances, skin adhesive is an adequate substitute for common suturing materials and methods. The final decision about the method and material is as much closely related to the length and localization of the wound as to time exposure, efficiency, and the comfort of the patient.

Summary

For objective comparison of intention and scarring, a scanning technique was used that permits a quantifiable, contact-free, single-session recording of volume differences. For this purpose, various suture materials and methods were used. Altogether, it could be shown that, if possible, wound closure treated with common suturing techniques, and especially with skin adhesive, should be enhanced by an intracutaneous suture with an increase in wound length. At the same time and under certain circumstances, skin adhesive poses an adequate substitute for the common suturing materials and methods. In the end, however, the final decision about the choice of method and material should be made depending on the localization and expanse of the wound as well as on the comfort of the patient (eg, absorbable suture/nonabsorbable suture), the time of exposure (eg, skin adhesive vs suture), and the economic efficiency (eg, producer of suture material).

### An electrocoagulation fixation technique for one-piece intraocular lens scleral flapless fixation with sutures without knots [^114sfAX3]. Retina (2023). Medium credibility.

The methods of intraocular lens (IOL) scleral fixation can be divided into many types according to the presence or absence of sutures and scleral flaps. – At the same time, the implanted IOL can be classified into one-piece, three-piece, and four fenestrated haptics IOLsaccording to their characteristics. Conventional wisdom holds that the three-piece and four-loop IOLs have better stability and are, therefore, more suitable for scleral fixation. However, both types of IOLs are usually secured to the sclera with 10–0 nonabsorbable polypropylene sutures. As a result, IOL subluxation increases over time because of the very thin suture erosion or loosening. Therefore, we need to choose thicker polypropylene sutures to overcome this long-term complication.

Conversely, with the advancement of IOL manufacturing technology, one-piece IOL gradually replaces three-piece IOL. Consequently, most of the patients with IOL subluxation had previously had a one-piece IOL implanted. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a new technique for one-piece IOL scleral fixation, which can not only ensure the stability of the IOL but also overcome the long-term complications associated with a 10–0 suture. This article introduces a new technique for IOL scleral fixation with a one-piece IOL plus polypropylene nonabsorbable 8–0/7–0 sutures and investigates its efficacy and safety.

### Absorbable sutures repair without meniscopexy, results in superior outcomes for discoid lateral meniscus with meniscocapsular anterior detachment in children [^112EiLMG]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the fact that meniscocapsular anterior detachment is the most common location of instability in children with a Discoid Lateral Meniscus (DLM), there is a lack of consensus about the type of repair that should be utilized for stabilization. The aim of this study was to determine the best fixation method for anterior detachment of DLM in children. Our hypothesis was that excessive rigidity with fixation would restrict meniscal mobility and increase the rate of failure or prevent full knee flexion.

Methods

This study was a retrospective single-center study consisting of 51 consecutive knees (45 children) with menico-capsular anterior detachment that underwent stabilization and minimal saucerization of the meniscus between 2007 and 2018. We aimed to compare the need for revision surgery and knee flexion between the different types of fixations utilized; namely we compared meniscopexy using anchors on the tibia (n = 30) with outside-in arthroscopic soft tissue fixation (n = 21), and absorbable (n = 18) and nonabsorbable sutures (n = 33) were compared.

Results

The mean age at surgery was 10.4 years (3 to 17) with a mean follow-up of 52 months (18 to 148). The group of knees treated with absorbable sutures had a significantly better rate of full knee flexion (15/18) compared with the nonabsorbable group (17/33) (P = 0.03). Despite the absence of significance (P = 007), there was a lower rate of revision surgery due to suture failure in the soft tissue fixation group (0 revision operations) compared with the meniscopexy group (5 revision operations).

Conclusions

For anterior meniscocapsular detachment of DLM, it is recommended to perform soft tissue fixation with absorbable sutures, as this technique resulted in better knee flexion and a lower rate of revision surgery when compared with meniscopexy and nonabsorbable suture fixation.
