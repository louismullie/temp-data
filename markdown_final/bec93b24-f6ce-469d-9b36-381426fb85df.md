## Question

Which medications are FDA-approved for borderline personality disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are FDA-approved for borderline personality disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, recent guidelines and reviews that summarize regulatory status. Then, I should verify FDA labels for commonly used psychotropics to ensure none lists BPD as an indication. Next, I will examine the clinical trial landscape to see whether any recent positive trials could have led to an approval. Finally, I should conclude clearly and time-stamp the answer, while distinguishing off-label use from FDA-approved indications.

> Let me first confirm the consensus from high-credibility sources. The 2024 APA Practice Guideline states that medication use in BPD is off-label and that pharmacotherapy, when used, should be adjunctive and targeted to specific symptoms, not a core BPD indication [^117XSk8v]. The 2022 Cochrane review likewise notes that psychotropics are frequently prescribed despite the fact that medication use is off-label as a treatment for BPD [^114yTJqK]. A 2023 JAMA review is consistent with this, stating there is no evidence that any psychoactive medication consistently improves core BPD symptoms, which aligns with the absence of an FDA-approved BPD indication [^114SSj7a].

> Wait, let me verify by cross-checking actual FDA labels to avoid assumptions. Lithium's current FDA label is for bipolar I disorder and maintenance, with no BPD indication [^117R7oqb]. Brexpiprazole's (Rexulti) label covers schizophrenia and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, again without BPD [^115rc5kP]. Scanning other FDA labeling in the provided materials shows approvals for non-BPD conditions such as antimalarials or biologics unrelated to BPD, further underscoring that BPD is not an FDA-listed indication on these labels [^113VsK6E] [^115C8uSM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions just because some trials show symptom improvements. I need to check the RCT evidence that might have supported an FDA indication. Olanzapine trials have shown small-to-moderate symptom effects in BPD but with notable metabolic risks, and these findings did not translate into regulatory approval for BPD [^113UjRug] [^115WQgiY]. Ziprasidone failed to separate from placebo in a 12-week trial in BPD [^113cg2JH]. A large, rigorous trial found lamotrigine was not superior to placebo on the ZAN-BPD at 52 weeks, arguing against a labelable effect [^112RjjhH]. Even a recent phase 2 study of a novel TRPC4/5 inhibitor (BI 1358894) did not establish proof-of-concept versus placebo, which likewise provides no regulatory basis for approval in BPD [^112bymbs]. These mixed or negative findings are consistent with broader systematic reviews that have not identified a medication meeting the evidentiary bar for BPD approval [^114yTJqK].

> I should confirm the difference between frequent clinical use and regulatory approval. International prescribing data show high rates of antipsychotic use in BPD, especially quetiapine, but this remains off-label and not supported by robust, consistent RCT effects or FDA indications for BPD [^116DWKe5] [^114FFxaJ]. But wait, what if ongoing or recent programs led to new approvals? Trials of brexpiprazole and other agents have been or are being explored, yet there is no evidence of an FDA-approved BPD indication emerging from these efforts to date, so I should not conflate pipeline activity with regulatory endorsement [^113HdBZx].

> Let me reconsider the regulatory principles to ensure I'm not missing an edge case. FDA psychiatric indications are typically tied to specific diagnostic entities studied in pivotal trials, and without consistent, clinically meaningful effects demonstrated across outcomes, an indication is unlikely to be granted, which fits the current BPD landscape without any approved drug-class entries [^1144ydrg]. Historical and contemporary reviews repeatedly converge on the conclusion that we remain without any medication that has a specific indication for the treatment of BPD, reinforcing the absence of FDA-approved options for this disorder [^113C9ntZ].

> I should double-check the bottom line and make it precise. As of the latest major guideline and review updates, there are zero FDA-approved medications for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, and any pharmacotherapy used in BPD is, by definition, off-label and typically adjunctive to psychotherapy or aimed at comorbid conditions rather than BPD itself [^117XSk8v] [^114yTJqK] [^114SSj7a].

> Next, I should review practical clinical implications so the answer is complete yet scoped. Psychotherapy remains first-line for BPD, while medications may be considered short term for specific, measurable target symptoms or for co-occurring disorders, with regular review to deprescribe when not beneficial, which reflects guideline-based practice rather than FDA-endorsed BPD treatment indications [^112Cn7CJ] [^112MYdM4] [^113jZxQs].

There are **no FDA-approved medications** [^114SSj7a] for borderline personality disorder (BPD) [^114yTJqK]. Pharmacotherapy is used **off-label** [^114SSj7a] to target symptoms — such as affective instability, impulsivity, or aggression — and should be adjunctive to psychotherapy [^117XSk8v]. Psychotherapy, particularly dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) [^112Cn7CJ], is the first-line treatment for BPD.

---

## FDA-approved medications for BPD

Currently, there are **no FDA-approved medications** [^114SSj7a] specifically for BPD [^113C9ntZ]. For **off-label use** [^114yTJqK], medications may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms or comorbid conditions [^114SSj7a].

---

## Medications commonly used off-label for BPD

Although **no medications are FDA-approved** for BPD, several classes are used **off-label** [^114yTJqK] to target specific symptoms:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Target symptoms** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antidepressants | - SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline) [^114yTJqK] <br/> - SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine) | - Affective instability <br/> - Depression <br/> - Anxiety | Moderate |
| Mood stabilizers | - Lamotrigine [^112RjjhH] <br/> - Valproate [^113Gqf91] <br/> - Topiramate | - Impulsivity <br/> - Aggression <br/> - Mood swings | Moderate |
| Antipsychotics | - Quetiapine [^116DWKe5] <br/> - Olanzapine [^113UjRug] <br/> - Aripiprazole | - Impulsivity <br/> - Aggression <br/> - Cognitive-perceptual symptoms | Moderate |
| Omega-3 fatty acids | - Ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) [^111UHESx] | - Aggression <br/> - Depressive symptoms | Low [^111UHESx] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Psychotherapy first-line**: Psychotherapy, particularly DBT [^112Cn7CJ], is the primary treatment for BPD [^117XSk8v].

- **Adjunctive pharmacotherapy**: Medications should be used adjunctively [^117XSk8v], targeting specific symptoms, and regularly reviewed [^113jZxQs] for effectiveness and side effects.

- **Regular review**: Medications should be reviewed at least every six months [^113jZxQs] to assess effectiveness and identify those warranting tapering or discontinuation.

---

## Limitations and risks of pharmacological treatment

- **Limited evidence**: There is limited evidence [^114yTJqK] supporting pharmacotherapy for core BPD symptoms [^114SSj7a].

- **Side effects**: Medications can cause significant side effects, including metabolic changes, weight gain [^113UjRug], and increased risk of self-harm [^116DWKe5].

- **Polypharmacy**: Polypharmacy is common but often unsupported by evidence, increasing the risk of adverse effects [^114yTJqK].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research on **novel agents**, such as TRPC4/5 ion channel inhibitors [^112bymbs], is ongoing, although initial results have not shown efficacy. Future work may explore **personalized medicine** approaches targeting specific symptom clusters or genetic markers [^111763oR].

---

There are **no FDA-approved medications** for BPD [^114yTJqK]. Pharmacotherapy is used off-label to manage specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, and **psychotherapy remains the first-line treatment** [^112Cn7CJ].

### Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder [^114yTJqK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Among people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) who are engaged in clinical care, prescription rates of psychotropic medications are high, despite the fact that medication use is off-label as a treatment for BPD. Nevertheless, people with BPD often receive several psychotropic drugs at a time for sustained periods.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological treatment for people with BPD.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 14 other databases, and four trials registers up to February 2022. We contacted researchers working in the field to ask for additional data from published and unpublished trials and hand-searched relevant journals. We did not restrict the search by year of publication, language, or type of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment to placebo, other pharmacologic treatments, or a combination of pharmacologic treatments in people of all ages with a formal diagnosis of BPD. The primary outcomes were BPD symptom severity, self-harm, suicide-related outcomes, and psychosocial functioning. Secondary outcomes were individual BPD symptoms, depression, attrition, and adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We performed data analysis using Review Manager 5 and quantified the statistical reliability of the data using Trial Sequential Analysis.

### Borderline personality disorder: A review [^114SSj7a]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) affects approximately 0.7% to 2.7% of adults in the US. The disorder is associated with considerable social and vocational impairments and greater use of medical services.

- **Observations**: Borderline personality disorder is characterized by sudden shifts in identity, interpersonal relationships, and affect, as well as by impulsive behavior, periodic intense anger, feelings of emptiness, suicidal behavior, self-mutilation, transient, stress-related paranoid ideation, and severe dissociative symptoms (e.g. experience of unreality of one's self or surroundings). Borderline personality disorder is typically diagnosed by a mental health specialist using semistructured interviews. Most people with BPD have coexisting mental disorders such as mood disorders (i.e. major depression or bipolar disorder) (83%), anxiety disorders (85%), or substance use disorders (78%). The etiology of BPD is related to both genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences, such as sexual and physical abuse.

Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for BPD. Psychotherapy such as dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic therapy reduces symptom severity more than usual care, with medium effect sizes (standardized mean difference) between -0.60 and -0.65. There is no evidence that any psychoactive medication consistently improves core symptoms of BPD. For discrete and severe comorbid mental disorders, such as major depression, pharmacotherapy such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like escitalopram, sertraline, or fluoxetine may be prescribed.

### A dose comparison of olanzapine for the treatment of borderline personality disorder: a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113UjRug]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

To examine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine at low and moderate doses for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted. In this study, 451 outpatients aged 18–65 years with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder received olanzapine 2.5 mg/d (n = 150), olanzapine 5–10 mg/d (n = 148), or placebo (n = 153). The trial was carried out from February 2004 through January 2006 in 59 community-based and academic study centers across 9 countries: the United States, Italy, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Venezuela.

- **Primary efficacy measure**: Mean change from baseline to last-observation-carried-forward endpoint on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) total score.
- **Secondary measures**: The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Modified Overt Aggression Scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, and the Sheehan Disability Scale.

An overall mean baseline ZAN-BPD total score of 17.2 (SD = 4.9) indicated moderate symptom severity. Treatment with olanzapine 5–10 mg/d was associated with a significantly greater mean change from baseline to endpoint in ZAN-BPD total score relative to placebo (-8.5 vs -6.8, respectively; p = 0.010; effect size = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06–0.52). Response rates, indicated by a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in ZAN-BPD total score, were significantly higher for olanzapine 5–10 mg/d (73.6%) versus olanzapine 2.5 mg/d (60.1%; p = 0.018) and versus placebo (57.8%; p = 0.006).

### Management and effectiveness of psychopharmacology in emotionally unstable and borderline personality disorder [^113j9gnY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The article by Paton and colleagues on the use of psychotropic medication in patients with emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) in the issue of The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry is an important article. Assuming that EUPD, as defined by ICD-10 (F60.3), is reasonably equivalent to borderline personality disorder (BPD) as defined in the United States by DSM, provides some insight into how practitioners think about prescribing medications to people with EUPD/BPD. The article not only offers information as to the class of medication these practitioners are using but also provides reasons why, i.e. for what clinical signs and symptoms, the medications are being prescribed.

### Assessment and management of personality disorders [^1124HaGa]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with personality disorders are common in primary care settings; caring for them can be difficult and frustrating. The characteristics of these patients' personalities tend to elicit strong feelings in physicians, lead to the development of problematic physician-patient relationships, and complicate the task of diagnosing and managing medical and psychiatric disorders. These chronic, inflexible styles of perceiving oneself and interacting with others vary widely in presentation.

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, these styles are categorized into three clusters based on their prominent characteristics: cluster A, the odd or eccentric (e.g. paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal); cluster B, the dramatic, emotional, or erratic (e.g. antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic); and cluster C, the anxious or fearful (e.g. avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive).

Knowledge of the core characteristics of these disorders allows physicians to recognize, diagnose, and treat affected patients. The goal of management is to develop a working relationship with patients to help them receive the best possible care despite their chronic difficulties in interacting with physicians and the health care system. Effective interpersonal management strategies exist for these patients. These strategies vary depending on the specific diagnosis and include interventions such as the use of specific communication styles, the establishment of clear boundaries, limit setting on the patients' behavior and use of medical resources, and provision of reassurance.

### New frontiers in the role of hospitalization for patients with personality disorders [^1156XojY]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

The question of hospitalization in patients who suffer from a borderline personality disorder is very contentious. Through a case-based approach, this review article highlights the issues surrounding this controversy. It then reviews practice guidelines and examines the evidence for various forms of hospitalization. A synthesis of this information leads to practical recommendations for the management of this challenging population.

### The association between borderline personality disorder and chronic medical illnesses, poor health-related lifestyle choices, and costly forms of health care utilization [^114JKCot]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The physical health of patients with borderline personality disorder has not been well studied. This study aims to compare the physical health, lifestyle choices affecting physical health, and health care utilization of patients with remitted and non-remitted borderline personality disorder.

- **Method**: 200 patients who no longer met the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R) and DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder, along with 64 patients who still met study criteria for borderline personality disorder, were interviewed from June 1992 through December 2001. These interviews focused on their physical health, lifestyle choices, and use of medical care, six years after their initial participation in a larger study of the longitudinal course of borderline personality disorder.

- **Results**: Remitted borderline patients were significantly less likely than non-remitted borderline patients to have a history of a "syndrome-like" condition (i.e. chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, or temporomandibular joint syndrome) (p = .049). They were also less likely to have a history of obesity (p = .026), osteoarthritis (p = .025), diabetes (p = .001), hypertension (p = .028), back pain (p < .001), or urinary incontinence (p < .001). Additionally, remitted borderline patients were significantly less likely to report smoking a pack per day (p = .002), daily alcohol consumption (p = .003), lack of regular exercise (p = .006), daily use of sleep medications (p < .001), and sustained use of pain medications (p = .026).

### Olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of borderline personality disorder [^115WQgiY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used in clinical practice in managing borderline personality disorder (BPD), and a small but growing body of literature supports their efficacy. Here, we report the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine as a treatment for BPD.

- **Method**: Forty BPD patients (25 female, 15 male) were randomly assigned in equal numbers to olanzapine and placebo. Diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression were excluded. Olanzapine dosage was flexible, with a dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg/day, and most patients receiving 5 to 10 mg/day. No concomitant psychotropic medications were allowed. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in total score for the 9 BPD criteria on a 1-to-7 Likert scale, using the Clinical Global Impressions scale modified for borderline personality disorder (CGI-BPD), with an analysis of covariance model including baseline score as covariate. Data were collected from July 2000 to April 2002.

- **Results**: Olanzapine was found to be significantly (p < .05) superior to placebo on the CGI-BPD at endpoint, with separation occurring as early as 4 weeks. Similar results were found for the single-item Clinical Global Impressions scale. Weight gain was significantly (p = .027) greater in the olanzapine group.

- **Conclusions**: This study supports the efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of BPD.

### Coartem [^113VsK6E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (Patient Information).

- **Administration instructions**: Instruct patients to take Coartem Tablets with food. Patients who do not have an adequate intake of food are at risk for recrudescence of malaria [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Patients with known hypersensitivity to artemether, lumefantrine, or any of the excipients should not receive Coartem Tablets [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Prolongation of the QT interval**: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Also, patients should inform their physician if they are taking any other medications that prolong the QT interval, such as Class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents; antipsychotics (pimozide, ziprasidone); antidepressants; or certain antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Additionally, instruct patients to notify their physicians if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Prevalence of antipsychotic prescriptions among patients with anxiety disorders treated in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings [^116wExr2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

An increasing number of prescribers are using antipsychotics for the treatment of anxiety disorders, despite the lack of FDA-approved indications and mixed efficacy results from clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of antipsychotic prescription in psychiatric inpatients and outpatients with anxiety disorders.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study of de-identified data from patients with a DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorder diagnosis in an academic psychiatric setting in 2013. The final cohort, after excluding individuals with bipolar/psychotic comorbidity, includes 1,699 patients. Logistic regression models were used to explore associations between antipsychotic prescription and patient characteristics.

- **Results**: Among non-psychotic/non-bipolar patients with anxiety disorder, 53.6% of inpatients and 16.6% of outpatients received antipsychotic medication. Rates varied with the disorder. Outpatients with post-traumatic stress disorder (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.66–3.01) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.86–4.19) received antipsychotic prescriptions more often than those without these diagnoses. Comorbidity with depression was common, while comorbidity with borderline personality disorder was rare; both increased odds of receiving antipsychotic prescriptions (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16–2.12 for depression; OR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.42–4.88 for borderline personality disorder, respectively). Additionally, age was significantly associated with increased odds of being on an antipsychotic. Quetiapine and aripiprazole were the most prescribed.

### Safety and tolerability of emerging pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorder [^117WiTc4]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, numerous new agents have been examined for their efficacy in bipolar disorder (BPD). New antiepileptic agents and atypical antipsychotics currently form the bulk of these emerging agents. As the treatment options for BPD increase, it allows for the possibility of choosing drugs based on their tolerability as well as their efficacy, rather than on efficacy alone.

- **Methods**: Efficacy data for newer antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine, topiramate, gabapentin, and oxcarbazepine, and atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole, are briefly reviewed. The article focuses on the relative safety and tolerability of these agents.

- **Results**: In general, most of these newer agents have better side effect and tolerability profiles than older agents commonly used to treat BPD, such as lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine; however, these must be weighed against the efficacy demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials at the time of writing. Cognitive impairment is a concern with topiramate, weight gain and risk of diabetes with some of the atypical antipsychotic agents, and rash with lamotrigine.

- **Conclusions**: Side effects of newer emerging agents for the treatment of BPD can be effectively managed, and the risks reduced, by instituting practical strategies early in management.

### Medications in the treatment of borderline personality disorder 2006 [^111Cbcdb]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

This review covers all significant randomized controlled trials and open trials of medications for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. New developments in the effectiveness of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics are discussed. Differences were found in the effectiveness of medications based on the presence or absence of depression and significant anger symptoms. Medications continue to be recommended as adjuncts to psychotherapy. Most of the trials discussed require replication, and more trials that investigate the effectiveness of medications in combination with psychotherapy are recommended.

### Treatment of personality disorder [^111763oR]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

The evidence base for the effective treatment of personality disorders is insufficient. Most existing research focuses on the treatment of borderline personality disorder. However, the evidence is limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up periods in clinical trials, a wide range of core outcome measures used in studies, and poor control of coexisting psychopathology. Psychological or psychosocial interventions are recommended as the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder, with pharmacotherapy advised only as an adjunctive treatment.

The amount of research into the underlying abnormal psychological or biological processes leading to disordered personalities is increasing, potentially enabling more effective interventions. The interaction between psychotherapies and drugs in treating personality disorder, whether synergistic or antagonistic, should be studied in conjunction with their mechanisms of change throughout each intervention's development.

### The emerging field of psychedelic psychotherapy [^111mqU6N]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Aside from ketamine, no psychedelic treatments have yet been approved for therapeutic use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Both MDMA and psilocybin remain on Schedule 1 of the US Controlled Substances Act, which means that officially, they are still considered to lack legitimate medical uses. Should MDMA and psilocybin become FDA-approved, they would be reclassified into a less restrictive scheduling category. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have determined that, based on psilocybin's pharmacological characteristics, including its low abuse liability, it would be most appropriate for a Schedule 4 designation, placing it in the same category as commonly used benzodiazepines. Similar conversations about the appropriate scheduling level for MDMA are unfolding as research progresses.

Meanwhile, researchers are increasingly exploring the role of psychedelics in other psychiatric conditions. Ongoing or planned trials for psilocybin are exploring its ability to treat bipolar depression, suicidal ideation, depression associated with early Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, and mood disorders in early-stage cancer patients (as opposed to late-stage/life-threatening cancers). There has also been discussion in the research community on the prospect of using psilocybin to treat personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder. Research with MDMA has, for the most part, remained focused on its use in PTSD.

### Toward integrated treatment for co-occurring borderline personality disorder and eating disorders: A clinician perspective [^112tsUin]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder and eating disorders frequently co-occur and share some diagnostic features. Their co-occurrence leads to greater complexity and severity, requiring the involvement of specialist services that may not work in a coordinated manner. Clinicians familiar with treating both disorders consider emotion dysregulation and distress intolerance to be core shared components. Treatments with proven effectiveness for either disorder may be combined in a holistic approach to address the shared psychopathology of co-occurring BPD and ED.

### Hypnotic medications and suicide: Risk, mechanisms, mitigation, and the FDA [^116ahiY8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Insomnia is associated with an increased risk for suicide. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated that warnings regarding suicide be included in the prescribing information for hypnotic medications. The authors conducted a review of the evidence for and against the claim that hypnotics increase the risk of suicide.

- **Method**: This review focused on modern, FDA-approved hypnotics, beginning with the introduction of benzodiazepines, limiting its findings to adults. PubMed and Web of Science were searched, crossing the terms "suicide" and "suicidal" with each of the modern FDA-approved hypnotics. The FDA website was searched for postmarketing safety reviews, and the FDA was contacted with requests to provide detailed case reports for hypnotic-related suicide deaths reported through its Adverse Event Reporting System.

- **Results**: Epidemiological studies show that hypnotics are associated with an increased risk for suicide. However, none of these studies adequately controlled for depression or other psychiatric disorders that may be linked with insomnia. Suicide deaths have been reported from single-agent hypnotic overdoses. A separate concern is that benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics can cause parasomnias, which in rare cases may lead to suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior in persons who were not known to be suicidal. On the other hand, ongoing research is testing whether treatment of insomnia may reduce suicidality in adults with depression.

- **Conclusions**: The review findings indicate that hypnotic medications are associated with suicidal ideation.

### Association between quetiapine use and self-harm outcomes among people with recorded personality disorder in UK primary care: A self-controlled case series analysis [^112waKZA]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

There has been one randomized controlled trial of quetiapine for borderline personality disorder, for which results are available. This trial of 95 participants found that daily doses of 150 and 300 mg were associated with reduced psychological distress, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and hostility at 8 weeks compared to placebo. There was no clear difference between doses, but there were higher rates of adverse events in the group receiving 300 mg per day. There have also been a number of small open-label studies for the treatment of borderline personality disorder that suggest some effect on impulsivity and affective symptoms.

Self-harm is common in patients receiving a diagnosis of personality disorder, particularly borderline or emotionally unstable personality disorder. There are case series reporting improvements in self-harming behavior in adolescents treated with quetiapine. However, observational studies in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have not found quetiapine prescribing to be associated with reduced self-harm. We are aware of no studies that examine quetiapine's effects on self-harm in people with personality disorder diagnoses. However, it is postulated that quetiapine may alleviate symptoms of self-harm in people with personality disorder via effects on impulsivity and aggression. Trials of quetiapine as an anti-suicidal agent in personality disorder are likely to be prohibitive due to issues of power, follow-up, and risk, whereas observational designs such as the self-controlled case series (SCCS) can potentially address these challenges.

### The physician's unique role in preventing violence: a neglected opportunity [^113men64]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Although no drugs have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indication for violence, many therapeutic options have been tested in randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trials. Psychiatrists use various classes of drugs as treatment for violence, but treatment guidelines have not been established. This article aims to introduce existing therapeutic options rather than provide a detailed review of pharmacotherapy, which has been reviewed elsewhere.

Medication is not a panacea; not all types of violence are amenable to pharmacological therapy. For example, treatment with the classic anticonvulsant phenytoin was shown to reduce impulsive but not premeditated violence. Previous reviews have detailed the use of anticonvulsants, beta blockers, and atypical antipsychotic agents. For more than 40 years, lithium has been used in various populations to treat violence. While serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly used for depression, they can also be effective for reducing chronic anger. These inhibitors are often initially used at low doses to guard against any paradoxical exacerbating effects.

Since the use of all of these medications for reducing violence is "off-label", it is crucial to carefully monitor for any adverse effects, which can, in some instances, cause an increase in irritability and aggression.

- **Nutritional factors**: Essential omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are also considered in reducing violence and aggression.

### Psychopharmacology of borderline personality disorder [^114n5qi2]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Psychopharmacology is widely used in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. However, support for this form of treatment has been largely based on case reports, case series, and open-label clinical trials. This evidence-based review examines the most recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychopharmacology in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, with a goal of highlighting the most promising pharmacotherapy for use in clinical practice, as well as for future large-scale research testing.

The results and limitations of the RCT data are presented, along with case vignettes illustrating the complexity of the disorder and the heterogeneity of its treatment. At the time of writing, there is at least some evidence-based support for the use of antipsychotics (conventional and atypical), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for borderline personality disorder, specifically concerning initial assessments, the APA 2024 guidelines recommend including the following in the assessment of patients with potential borderline personality disorder:

- **The reason for evaluation**: Assess why the individual is seeking evaluation.

- **Patient's goals and preferences**: Consider the patient's goals and preferences for treatment.

- **Review of psychiatric symptoms**: Evaluate core features of personality disorders and commonly co-occurring disorders.

- **Psychiatric treatment history**: Review the patient's history of psychiatric treatment.

- **Assessment of physical health**: Conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's physical health.

- **Psychosocial and cultural factors**: Evaluate psychosocial and cultural factors impacting the patient.

- **Mental status examination**: Perform a comprehensive mental status examination.

- **Risk assessment**: Assess the risk of suicide, self-injury, and aggressive behaviors.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^116DWKe5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

International studies concordantly report antipsychotics being prevalently prescribed to individuals with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD), with rates ranging between 70% and 79% of inpatients and 35% and 60% of outpatients. Given the evidence, it is perplexing why quetiapine plays such a prominent role in BPD treatment. Among antipsychotic agents, quetiapine is most frequently prescribed to those with a diagnosis of BPD. Notably, it is also the single substance most often prescribed among all substance classes; in fact, nearly one-fifth to almost one-third of inpatients receive quetiapine.

At the time of writing, only one single randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been published that evaluated the effects of quetiapine in people with BPD. Additionally, we are aware of several RCTs involving quetiapine that have been completed, but their results have not yet been published. Another RCT involving the antipsychotic risperidone has been registered and was recruiting, though it is unclear if this trial has been completed or what the results might be. In our previous Cochrane review, we included eight placebo-controlled RCTs of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs; aripiprazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone), but did not find robust evidence of clinically relevant effects for any of these substances. Instead, significant adverse effects were observed for olanzapine, including metabolic changes and weight gain, and an increase in self-harming behavior. Since our Cochrane review in 2010, only one placebo-controlled RCT of any SGA has been published.

### Pharmacological interventions for borderline personality disorder [^115U4cAc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Drugs are widely used in borderline personality disorder (BPD) treatment, chosen because of properties known from other psychiatric disorders ("off-label use"), mostly targeting affective or impulsive symptom clusters.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of drug treatment in BPD patients.

- **Search strategy**: We searched bibliographic databases according to the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial, and Learning Problems Group strategy up to September 2009, reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised studies comparing drug versus placebo, or drug versus drug(s) in BPD patients. Outcomes included total BPD severity, distinct BPD symptom facets according to DSM-IV criteria, associated psychopathology not specific to BPD, attrition, and adverse effects.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data independently.

- **Main results**: Twenty-eight trials involving a total of 1742 trial participants were included. First-generation antipsychotics (flupenthixol decanoate, haloperidol, thiothixene); second-generation antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone), mood stabilisers (carbamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine, topiramate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, phenelzine sulfate, mianserin), and dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) were tested. First-generation antipsychotics were subject to older trials, whereas recent studies focused on second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilisers. Data were sparse for individual studies.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^116TPhY9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Recently published RCT data indicate that we did not identify any new full publication of a controlled study or RCTs testing antidepressants in people affected by BPD. Following the studies listed as ongoing in our previous review, we found data for two antidepressant RCTs. Both these trials investigated fluoxetine. Our calculations of available data did not show significantly different rates of serious adverse events (AEs) when fluoxetine was compared with placebo. In contrast, in the RCT comparing fluoxetine to dialectical behavioural therapy, we observed a significantly higher rate of suicide attempts in the medication-only group.

- **Unpublished RCTs**: When following up the references identified as ongoing in our 2015 review, we found that three were still unpublished. One RCT of escitalopram never started, while another was terminated due to difficulties in recruiting participants. A third RCT testing the MAO-I selegiline against placebo was completed, but despite our best efforts, we were unable to find any corresponding publication. The latter was the only industry-sponsored trial among the listed unpublished studies.

- **Ongoing RCTs**: We did not identify any ongoing RCT evaluating the effects of continued antidepressant treatment.

- **Critical judgement of evidence**: Given the high rates of antidepressant use in BPD, the lack of related evidence is startling. The most recent placebo-controlled RCT testing an antidepressant remains the one by Simpson and colleagues.

### Heritability of borderline personality disorder features is similar across three countries [^114k46KG]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Most of our knowledge about borderline personality disorder features has been obtained through the study of clinical samples. Although these studies are important in their own right, they are limited in their ability to address certain important epidemiological and aetiological questions, such as the degree to which there is a genetic influence on the manifestation of borderline personality disorder features. Family history studies of borderline personality disorder indicate genetic influences; however, there have been very few twin studies, and the degree of genetic influence on borderline personality disorder remains unclear.

- **Method**: Data were drawn from twin samples from The Netherlands (n = 3918), Belgium (n = 904), and Australia (n = 674). In total, data were available on 5496 twins between the ages of 18 and 86 years from 3644 families who participated in the study by completion of a mailed self-report questionnaire on borderline personality disorder features.

- **Results**: In all countries, females scored higher than males, and there was a general tendency for younger adults to endorse more borderline personality disorder features than older adults. Model-fitting results showed that additive genetic influences explain 42% of the variation in borderline personality disorder features in both men and women and that this heritability estimate is similar across The Netherlands, Belgium, and Australia. Unique environmental influences explain the remaining 58% of the variance.

- **Conclusion**: Genetic factors play a role in individual differences in borderline personality disorder.

### What's next after 50 years of psychiatric drug development: An FDA perspective [^1144ydrg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

This article discusses changes in psychiatric drug development from a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standpoint. It first examines how the regulatory process has influenced changes over time and then explores future FDA initiatives likely to impact psychiatric drug development. The FDA is responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety and efficacy of drug products introduced to the US market. It collaborates with drug sponsors during development and reviews safety, efficacy data, and proposed labeling when applications are submitted. The FDA also oversees drug advertising, promotion, and postmarketing surveillance.

Among the many changes in psychiatric drug development over the past 50 years, several have been particularly influenced by the FDA. The populations studied have expanded diagnostically and demographically, and approved psychiatric indications have become more focused on the clinical entities studied, including specific symptom domains of recognized syndromes. Trial designs have become increasingly complex and informative, and approaches to analysis have evolved to better model the reality of clinical trials.

- **Innovation at the FDA**: This article addresses two general areas of innovation at the FDA that will affect psychiatric drug development in the future.
	- **Critical path initiative programs**: Several programs under this initiative, such as biomarkers, adaptive design, end-of-phase 2A meetings, and data standards, are described.
	- **Safety initiatives**: Important safety initiatives, including Safety First, are discussed.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^115Tw1qJ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug treatments for people with borderline personality disorder that reported clinical outcomes. We did not consider studies that concentrated on neurobiological outcomes or tested the immediate effects of a once-administered substance. We searched the CENTRAL database of the Cochrane Library in March 2020 for relevant publications from 2015 to present. We also traced back references of study trial register records cited as ongoing studies in our 2015 review to identify corresponding full publications. Lastly, we searched trial registers: the EudraCT register using the term "borderline personality disorder", the ISRCTN registry (studies with inclusion criterion "borderline personality disorder"), "Borderline Personality Disorder AND interventional studies", and the WHO meta-register ICTRP ("borderline personality disorder").

If study results were posted on trial registries without statistical analysis, we statistically compared treatment groups by calculating either standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes or risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes from post-treatment values, data permitting.

### Olanzapine treatment of female borderline personality disorder patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^117VotQB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The intent of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus placebo in the treatment of women meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD).

- **Method**: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine in 28 female subjects meeting Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for BPD. The subjects were randomly assigned to olanzapine or placebo in a 2:1 manner. The treatment duration was six months. Primary outcome measures were self-reported changes on anxiety, depression, paranoia, anger/hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity scales of the Symptom Checklist-90.

- **Results**: Nineteen subjects were randomly assigned to olanzapine; nine to placebo. When random effects regression modeling of panel data was used, controlling for baseline level of severity, olanzapine was associated with a significantly greater rate of improvement over time than placebo in all of the symptom areas studied except depression (p < .05). Weight gain was modest in the olanzapine-treated group but was significantly higher than in those treated with placebo (p < .02). In addition, no serious movement disorders were noted.

- **Conclusion**: Olanzapine appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of women with criteria-defined BPD, significantly affecting all four core areas of borderline psychopathology (i.e. affect, cognition, impulsivity, and interpersonal relationships).

### How to mitigate risk in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder [^1154iHoU]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Clinicians treating patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience concerns about the risk for adverse events that can lead to litigation or complaints to administrative boards. This paper aims to outline steps to ensure the safety of both the patient and clinician.

- **Recent findings**: Review of available data confirms that psychiatry is a subspecialty with relatively low risk for malpractice litigation, but high risk for complaints to administrative agencies. Examination of litigation and complaints suggests that familiar challenges in working with patients with BPD are frequently cited. Risk management considerations have been impacted in recent years by changes in psychiatric training, health care delivery, and regulations about patient information transparency. Concurrently, empirically validated treatments for BPD have been refined and disseminated. Clinicians can address safety concerns by adapting established risk management guidance with an appreciation of key elements of BPD.

### Suicidality, depression, and the FDA: Health inequities and the ethical conduct of research [^115cSDLQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Persons with mental health disorders, including suicidality, are underrepresented in clinical trials, which undermines the generalizability of results and may contribute to health inequities. This report:

- **Documents the exclusion**: Persons with suicidality are often excluded from trials used to secure FDA approval for antidepressants.
- **Describes barriers to inclusion**: Various obstacles prevent the inclusion of individuals with suicidality.
- **Identifies steps for overcoming barriers**: The report suggests possible measures to enhance inclusion.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for efficacy trials for depression or major depressive disorder, as described on FDA labels for 14 antidepressants approved from 1991 through 2013, were studied by reviewing the FDA labels, publications described on labels, and ClinicalTrials.gov entries for registered trials. Labels for drugs approved in or before 1998 were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed on June 26, 2018. For drugs approved after 1998, labels are available on the FDA website. Publications based on the trials described on FDA labels were identified through a PubMed search conducted on October 23, 2018, using each drug name and "trial" or "study" as keywords, with no date limit.

For drugs approved from 1991 to 2000, out of 36 publications identified, 26 did not mention suicidality, 7 excluded persons with suicidality but did not describe assessing suicidality with an instrument, 2 excluded persons with suicidality and described assessing suicidality using at least one instrument, and 1 included persons with suicidality. For drugs approved from 2000 through 2013, of 28 publications identified, 4 did not mention suicidality.

### Impact of trait impulsivity and state aggression on divalproex versus placebo response in borderline personality disorder [^113Gqf91]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether specific pretreatment clinical characteristics could differentially predict a favorable treatment response to divalproex versus placebo for impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder.

Fifty-two outpatients with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive either divalproex (N = 20) or placebo (N = 32), in a double-blind manner, for 12 weeks. Trait impulsivity symptoms were measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, while state aggression symptoms were assessed using the Overt Aggression Scale adapted for outpatients. Affective stability was evaluated using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Analyses were conducted to identify possible baseline symptom domains that could predict treatment response.

The results showed that divalproex was superior to placebo in reducing impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder. Patients treated with divalproex responded better than those treated with placebo among individuals with higher baseline trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms. The effects of baseline trait impulsivity and state aggression appeared to be independent of each other. However, baseline affective instability did not influence the differential treatment response.

In conclusion, both pretreatment trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms predicted a favorable response to divalproex compared to placebo for impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder.

### Borderline personality disorder symptoms and exposure to violence as risk factors for opioid use in adulthood [^113TBhxq]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Low credibility.

Borderline personality disorder and exposure to violence are both risk factors for opioid use. While past research has identified these relationships, there has yet to be any study which investigates the potential that exposure to violence may help explain the relationship between borderline personality disorder symptoms and opioid use as a mediator. The present study used data from the Pathways to Desistance study to test these proposed relationships. Results indicated that greater levels of borderline personality disorder symptoms were associated with increased opioid use frequency. However, when exposure to violence variables were included in the model, the magnitude of this effect was attenuated by more than 20% and reduced to non-significance. These results indicate the importance of identifying and treating borderline personality disorder symptomatology and providing increased oversight of the environments which juvenile offenders are exposed to upon reentry. Doing so may help to address the opioid crisis in the United States.

### Renflexis [^115C8uSM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Patients or their caregivers should be advised of the potential benefits and risks of Renflexis. Physicians should instruct their patients to read the Medication Guide before starting Renflexis therapy and to reread it each time they receive an infusion. It is important that the patient's overall health be assessed at each treatment visit and that any questions resulting from the patient's or their caregiver's reading of the Medication Guide be discussed.

- **Immunosuppression**: Inform patients that Renflexis may lower the ability of their immune system to fight infections. Instruct patients on the importance of contacting their doctors if they develop any symptoms of an infection, including tuberculosis and reactivation of hepatitis B virus infections. Patients should be counseled about the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies while receiving Renflexis.

- **Other medical conditions**: Advise patients to report any signs of new or worsening medical conditions such as heart disease, neurological disease, or autoimmune disorders. Advise patients to report any symptoms of cytopenia, such as bruising, bleeding, or persistent fever.

### The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine in borderline personality disorder: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112RjjhH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The authors examined whether lamotrigine is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for people with borderline personality disorder.

This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. Between July 2013 and November 2016, 276 individuals aged 18 or over who met the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder were recruited. Individuals with coexisting bipolar affective disorder or psychosis, those already taking a mood stabilizer, and women at risk of pregnancy were excluded. A web-based randomization service was used to allocate participants randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an inert placebo or up to 400 mg/day of lamotrigine. The primary outcome measure was the score on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) at 52 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included depressive symptoms, deliberate self-harm, social functioning, health-related quality of life, resource use and costs, side effects of treatment, and adverse events.

A total of 195 (70.6%) participants were followed up at 52 weeks, at which point 49 (36%) of those in the lamotrigine group and 58 (42%) of those in the placebo group were taking study medication. The mean ZAN-BPD score was 11.3 (SD = 6.6) in the lamotrigine group and 11.5 (SD = 7.7) in the placebo group (adjusted difference in means = 0.1, 95% CI = -1.8, 2.0). There was no evidence of any differences in secondary outcomes. Costs of direct care were similar in the two groups.

The results suggest that treating people with lamotrigine does not significantly differ from placebo in terms of clinical or cost-effectiveness for individuals with borderline personality disorder.

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^114FFxaJ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Focusing on publication dates from 2015 to March 2020, we identified five full-text publications reporting on four different RCTs with clinical outcomes. One of these records reported additional data of the Black et al. 2014 RCT, which had already been included in the 2015 review. Two of these records referred to the same study.

By searching trial platforms, we identified new study data for five RCTs. One referred also to the Black 2014 RCT, whereas four related to RCTs that have not been published elsewhere. Table 1 provides an overview of the main characteristics of these studies.

- **Table 1: Randomised-controlled trials of drug treatments for borderline personality disorder published between 2015 and March 2020**

### Recovery and functional outcomes following olanzapine treatment for bipolar I mania [^113X42iM]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Typical experimental categorizations of treatment responses in bipolar disorder (BPD) patients may have limited relationships to clinical recovery or functional status, and there is inadequate research on such clinically important outcomes.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from a study of open continuation of olanzapine treatment following a 3-week placebo-controlled trial involving initially hospitalized adult subjects with DSM-IV BP-I mania to estimate rates and times to symptomatic remission (low scores on standardized symptomatic assessments) and clinical recovery (remission sustained ≥ 8 weeks), associated clinical factors, and functional outcomes.

- **Results**: During treatment with olanzapine for 27.9 ± 20.1 weeks, symptomatic remission was attained by 70% of subjects, half by 8 weeks (95% CI 6–10 weeks), and later lost by 82% of remitted subjects; remitted (versus non-remitted) subjects had slightly lower baseline clinical global impression scores and greater trial completion. Sustained clinical recovery was attained by only 40 of 113 (35%) of subjects, half by 36 weeks (95% CI 20–40 weeks), and later lost by 45%. Subjects with above-median (> 12) initial Hamilton-Depression rating scale depression scores were half as likely to recover (p = 0.016) and did so much later (36 versus 12 weeks) than those with lower scores. At final assessment, self-rated well-being (SF-36 psychosocial functioning scores) improved substantially more among recovered versus non-recovered subjects (mean changes: 87% versus 23%), and two-thirds of recovered subjects remained unemployed-for-pay.

### Toward integrated treatment for co-occurring borderline personality disorder and eating disorders: A clinician perspective [^113kYdzm]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

- **Features of effective treatment**: Participants from the specialist ED service emphasized the importance of allowing the client to own the process of weight restoration. Clinician 10 expanded on this: "assisting them to accept the need for health restoration… being supported in taking control of that themselves". Similar to BPD clinicians, ED clinicians discussed the value of distress tolerance. Clinician 9 stated, in relation to those who received BPD treatment prior to treatment for their ED: "there seems to be strong evidence that [DBT] has equipped them to be able to deal with inpatient admission in a more adaptive way, with less self‐harming behaviours and more distress tolerance. That seems to be a really important intervention".

	- Regarding CBT, specific elements such as food and thought diaries were perceived as foundational for improving clients' understanding of their behaviour. For example, Clinician 7 shared that "there's a grade of exposure with a CBT food and thought diary to help people understand and stay on track", which was corroborated by Clinician 10, who noted "self‐monitoring of food intake" as an important treatment element. ACT was also regarded as effective for this group, particularly "how they can live their life in a way consistent with their values… we'll look at awareness of their thoughts and cognitive defusion" (Clinician 6). Emphasis on trust and rapport was also expressed, with Clinician 8 indicating that "if they don't even have that basis, you know, there'll be no commitment to any of this". Clinician 7 reinforced this notion of consistency in building a therapeutic relationship.

### Psychopharmacology of personality disorders: Review and emerging issues [^111YXtnk]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Progress in developing models and general principles for the psychopharmacologic management of patients with personality disorders is reviewed. Recent research on mood stabilizers and novel antipsychotics is discussed. It is supported that these medications have an effect on impulsive aggressiveness, which is evident early and independent of their effects on mood, including depression. Research is necessary to explore other personality disorders beyond borderline personality disorder. Future studies must develop measurable outcomes and delineate the causal and temporal relationships between the psychopathologic features of personality disorders.

### Borderline personality disorder [^1127MiMh]. Lancet (2004). High credibility.

Borderline personality disorder is associated with various conditions such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and unstable interpersonal relationships. It can also be linked to experiences of child abuse, alcohol use disorder, self-harm, irritability, fears of abandonment, PTSD, substance use disorder, ADHD, suicidal ideation, hostility, anxiety, emotional abuse, and dissociative disorder. Additionally, sexual abuse, eating disorders, feelings of emptiness, emotional lability, the use of transitional objects, other personality disorders, and impulsivity may be present in individuals with borderline personality disorder.

### Association between quetiapine use and self-harm outcomes among people with recorded personality disorder in UK primary care: A self-controlled case series analysis [^111ti2Zg]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately 12% of the general population is estimated to meet the criteria for a personality disorder, characterized by maladaptive and inflexible personality traits that result in significant distress and functional impairment. A number of studies have highlighted the shortcomings of categorical distinctions between personality disorder subtypes. Consequently, these distinctions have been removed in the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).

Pharmacological approaches to managing symptoms associated with personality disorders are commonly implemented in clinical practice. However, these treatments are not supported by high-quality evidence regarding their effectiveness, and they are not routinely recommended in the majority of treatment guidelines for personality disorders. The United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines state that antipsychotic medication should not be used for the medium- to long-term treatment of antisocial or borderline personality disorder. We recently found that 25% of individuals in UK primary care with a personality disorder diagnosis (and no diagnostic code suggesting psychotic illness) have been prescribed antipsychotic medication. Quetiapine, a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist, and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, is the antipsychotic medication most commonly prescribed in this group.

### Effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for severe personality disorders: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^113v7wtP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

There has been little systematic attempt to validate pharmacologic treatment algorithms and guidelines for severe personality disorder.

- **Objective**: We evaluated studies on the effectiveness of psychoactive drugs on specific symptom domains for borderline and/or schizotypal personality disorder.

- **Data sources**: The literature was searched for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (PC-RCTs) on the effectiveness of psychopharmacologic drugs in personality disorder patients. The following databases were searched:
	- **Databases**: PubMed, PsychINFO, PiCarta, Cochrane, Web of Science
	- **Search terms**:
		- **Disorders**: borderline personality, schizotypal personality, personality disorder, cluster A, cluster B
		- **Treatment approaches**: treatment, drug, pharmacotherapy
		- **Types of medications**: antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood stabilizer
		- **Outcomes and research**: effect, outcome, review, meta-analysis

	Studies published between 1980 and December 2007 were considered, and references were identified from bibliographies from articles and books.

- **Study selection**: Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers were selected. Focus was on:
	- **Symptom domains**: cognitive-perceptual symptoms, impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, affective dysregulation
		- **Subdomains**: depressed mood, anxiety, anger, mood lability

	Participants included patients with well-defined borderline and/or schizotypal personality disorder, with studies primarily emphasizing the treatment of Axis I disorders excluded. Meta-analyses were conducted using 21 retrieved studies.

- **Results**: Antipsychotics have a moderate effect on cognitive-perceptual symptoms (5 PC-RCTs).

- **CNS depressant effects and next-day impairment**: Tell patients that BELSOMRA has the potential to cause next-day impairment, and that this risk is increased with higher doses or if dosing instructions are not carefully followed. Patients using the 20 mg dose should be cautioned against next-day driving and other activities requiring full mental alertness, as this dose is associated with a higher risk of impaired driving. Patients taking lower doses should also be cautioned about the potential for driving impairment because there is individual variation in sensitivity to BELSOMRA. Patients should not drive or engage in other activities requiring full alertness within 8 hours of dosing on BELSOMRA. Advise patients that increased drowsiness may increase the risk of falls in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Sleep-driving and other complex behaviors**: Instruct patients to inform their families that BELSOMRA has been associated with getting out of bed while not being fully awake, and tell patients and their families to call their healthcare providers if this occurs. Hypnotics, like BELSOMRA, have been associated with "sleep-driving" and other complex behaviors while not being fully awake (preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex). Tell patients and their families to call their healthcare providers if they develop any of these symptoms.

- **Suicide**: Tell patients to report any worsening of depression or suicidal thoughts immediately.

### Ziprasidone in the treatment of borderline personality disorder: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study [^113cg2JH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone in the treatment of adult patients with borderline personality disorder.

- **Method**: Sixty DSM-IV borderline personality disorder patients were included from March 2004 to April 2006 in a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The subjects were randomly assigned to ziprasidone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio following a 2-week baseline period. The Clinical Global Impressions scale for use in borderline personality disorder patients (CGI-BPD) was the primary outcome measure, and other scales and self-reports related to affect, behavior, psychosis, general psychopathology domains, and clinical safety were included.

- **Results**: Analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences between ziprasidone and placebo in the CGI-BPD. Nor were significant differences observed between groups in depressive, anxiety, psychotic, or impulsive symptoms. The mean daily dose of ziprasidone was 84.1 mg/day (SD = 54.8; range, 40–200). The drug was seen to be safe, and no serious adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusion**: This trial failed to show a significant effect of ziprasidone in patients with borderline personality disorder.

- **Trial Registration**: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00635921.

### Acute, chronic, and everyday physical pain in borderline personality disorder [^113ecJ4n]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Appropriate treatment for chronic pain is an especially important issue for those with BPD, given challenges specific to this population. Despite concerns about risks, prescription opioids remain a primary treatment option for chronic pain, particularly in the US. Frankenburg et al. found that participants with BPD (n = 264) were more likely to report prescription opioid use than comparison participants with another personality disorder (n = 63), which may be due to higher rates of co-occurrence of BPD with chronic pain conditions.

Additional evidence suggests that people with BPD may be at risk for problematic prescription opioid use. For instance, in a sample of outpatients who currently or have previously been prescribed pain medication (N = 185), BPD symptoms were associated with measures of prescription pain medication misuse. In college student samples, BPD features have been associated with negative reinforcement motives (coping and pain) for prescription opioid use (N = 594) and measures of misuse, including opioid consequences and dependence features (N = 606).

Finally, in samples in treatment for chronic pain (N = 147) and samples in treatment for substance use disorder (N = 208), BPD features have been associated with prescription opioid misuse, with particularly strong associations between measures of misuse and the identity disturbance and self-harm/impulsivity facets of BPD. It is important to note that these findings do not indicate that people with BPD cannot benefit from appropriate opioid therapy. However, patients with BPD and chronic pain may benefit from specific interventions tailored to their needs.

### Clinical outcome of ECT in patients with major depression and comorbid borderline personality disorder [^114MjEgs]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Previous research suggests that the comorbidity of major depression with a personality disorder, especially borderline personality disorder, is associated with a poorer response to ECT. The authors compared the acute outcome of ECT in depressed patients with borderline personality disorder, with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder, and with no personality disorder.

- **Method**: The study subjects were 139 patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar major depression and scores of at least 20 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Patients were treated with suprathreshold right unilateral or bilateral ECT in a standardized manner and were assessed with the Hamilton depression scale within 3 days and 4–8 days after completing ECT.

- **Results**: Compared to patients with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder (N = 42) and those with no personality disorder (N = 77), patients with borderline personality disorder (N = 20) had less symptomatic improvement assessed up to 8 days after ECT. Patients with personality disorders other than borderline personality disorder responded as well to ECT as those with no personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder patients were more likely to be female and to have medication-resistant depression than the patients in the two comparison groups; they were also younger. However, none of these differences accounted for the borderline personality disorder patients' poorer response to ECT.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with borderline personality disorder have a poorer acute response to ECT compared to others.

### A life span perspective on borderline personality disorder [^116vapp8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The term "borderline" was first coined by Adolph Stern in 1938 when he identified a "border line group of patients" who "fit frankly neither into the psychotic nor into the psychoneurotic group, and are extremely difficult to handle by any psychotherapeutic method". The acceptance of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 3rd edition in 1980 has stimulated both clinical and scientific attention. BPD is characterized by impulsivity, self-harm, suicidality, and emotional and interpersonal instability. DSM-5, like DSM-IV, allows diagnosing BPD under the age of 18, if the symptoms are pervasive, persistent, not limited to a particular developmental stage or another mental disorder, and if the symptoms have been present for at least 1 year.

The categorical DSM concept of BPD, and of personality disorders in general, has been criticized because of its heterogeneity, diagnostic overlap with other disorders, arbitrary threshold, low reliability, and poor empirical base. Factor analytic studies found support for one general factor of personality pathology underlying the nine criteria of BPD. Moreover, BPD presents with many comorbid disorders. Because of these limitations, a growing number of studies focus on dimensional models of personality disorders, such as the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) in the DSM-5 and the new personality disorder concept of the International Classifications of Diseases 11th Edition (ICD-11). Both models combine a severity dimension.

### Lamotrigine in psychiatric disorders [^115A1Y9G]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Owing to the prevalence of medication side effects and treatment resistance, prescribers often consider off-label uses of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for the treatment of persistent symptoms. The authors review the available literature on the FDA-approved and non-FDA-approved uses of lamotrigine in adults with psychiatric disorders.

- **Data sources**: We used PubMed, MEDLINE, and a hand search of relevant literature to find studies published between 1990 and 2012 and available in the English language. The following keywords were searched: lamotrigine, psychiatric, mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, side effects, and rash.

- **Study selection**: Data were selected from 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). When RCTs were not available, open-label trials (6), retrospective case reviews (10), and case series (4) were summarized.

- **Data extraction**: We extracted results of monotherapy and augmentation trials of lamotrigine on primary and secondary outcome measures.

- **Results**: Lamotrigine is generally well tolerated, with the best evidence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, particularly in prevention of depressive episodes. In acute bipolar depression, meta-analyses suggested a modest benefit, especially for more severely depressed subjects, with switch rates similar to placebo. In unipolar depression, double-blind RCTs noted benefit on subsets of symptoms and improved response in more severely depressed subjects. Data are limited but promising in borderline personality disorder.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^113qYUJC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Personality disorders can and do occur in people under 18, and no diagnostic criteria state they cannot. Patients often find having an accurate diagnostic label helpful; the correct diagnosis assists clinicians in providing appropriate treatments and leads to a more realistic prognosis. Making such a diagnosis is complex due to the intricacies of adolescence and is often more effectively done over multiple assessments. It is also easier if the adolescent is older. The majority of evidence on personality disorders pertains to emotionally unstable/borderline personality disorder (BPD).

There is no evidence that any medication is effective for the core symptoms of BPD in adults or adolescents. There is limited evidence that medication is effective for co-morbid mental illness in adults with BPD, and no evidence exists for adolescents. Instead, the mainstay of treatment for BPD (in all age groups) is complex and integrates psychological therapy programs. Dialectical behaviour therapy and mentalisation-based treatment have been found to be effective in adolescents with BPD. However, studies were limited by including mainly girls and only the subset of patients with BPD who were willing to participate in a treatment trial. It is also essential to address social factors (e.g. abuse, educational issues, stability of placement) in helping these patients.

### Omega-3 fatty acid treatment of women with borderline personality disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^111UHESx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) and placebo in the treatment of female subjects with borderline personality disorder.

- **Method**: The authors conducted an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of E-EPA in 30 female subjects meeting Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder.

- **Results**: Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to 1 g of E-EPA, and 10 subjects were given a placebo. Ninety percent of subjects in both groups completed all 8 weeks of the trial. Analyses using random-effects regression modeling and controlled for baseline severity showed E-EPA to be superior to placebo in diminishing aggression and the severity of depressive symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study suggest that E-EPA may be a safe and effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe borderline personality disorder.

### Rexulti [^115rc5kP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the proportions of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (< 100 mg/dL) to high (≥ 126 mg/dL) and borderline (≥ 100 and < 126 mg/dL) to high were similar in patients treated with Rexulti and placebo. In the long-term, open-label depression studies, 5% of adult patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift to high while taking Rexulti plus an antidepressant (ADT); 25% of patients with borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high. Combined, 9% of patients with normal or borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose during the long-term depression studies.

- **Schizophrenia (adults)**: In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with schizophrenia, the proportions of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (< 100 mg/dL) to high (≥ 126 mg/dL) or borderline (≥ 100 and < 126 mg/dL) to high were similar in patients treated with Rexulti and placebo. In the long-term, open-label schizophrenia studies, 8% of adult patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift from normal to high while taking Rexulti; 17% of patients with borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts from borderline to high. Combined, 10% of patients with normal or borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose during the long-term schizophrenia studies.

### Comparing the evidential strength for psychotropic drugs: A Bayesian meta-analysis [^116nisLz]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Data sources were not identified by a systematic search. Instead, we obtained data for psychotropic drugs approved by the FDA. We used data extracted from previous meta-analyses and supplemented it with data we extracted ourselves. Data on antidepressants for depression were obtained from Turner et al. and de Vries et al; data on antidepressants for anxiety disorders were obtained from de Vries, de Jonge, Van Heuvel, Turner, and Roest, as well as Roest et al; data on antipsychotics for schizophrenia were obtained from Turner et al.

We extracted additional data on medications for ADHD and antipsychotics for schizophrenia that were approved after the publication of Turner et al. from FDA reviews. No additional data extraction was necessary for depression or anxiety disorders, as no new antidepressants were approved for these indications after previous publications. We followed data extraction procedures originally proposed by Turner et al, described in detail elsewhere. In short, for each drug, we retrieved the corresponding FDA reviews from the FDA's website. Within the Drug Approval package, data relevant to the FDA's determination of drug efficacy were examined. Clinical phase II/III trials pivotal in the endorsement decision of the drug were eligible for inclusion, regardless of their outcome. Efficacy data were extracted preferably from the statistical review and, if necessary, from the medical review or team leader memos.

In total, we included data for 15 antipsychotics (number of trials = 43, n treatment = 9937, n control = 4303) and 16 antidepressants approved for depression (number of trials = 105, n treatment = 14,040).

### Pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder: An update of published, unpublished and ongoing studies [^113HdBZx]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020).

Two placebo-controlled RCTs are currently underway to evaluate the effects of brexpiprazole, an SGA which has been described as a serotonin–dopamine activity modulator (SDAM). It has been approved for the treatment of schizophrenia by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), but it is additionally approved as an adjunctive to antidepressants in major depressive disorder treatment in the United States. Another placebo-controlled RCT is underway in the UK where inpatients with BPD who did not experience an adequate clinical response to antipsychotic medications will receive clozapine.

Notably, we are also aware of another placebo-controlled RCT of aripiprazole for people with a diagnosis of BPD and auditory verbal hallucinations, but without schizophrenia or any psychotic disorder. This will be one of the first RCTs ever investigating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmaceutical treatments in adolescents with BPD, with a minimum age of 15 years and a maximum age of 25 years.

### Efficacy and safety of BI 1358894 in patients with borderline personality disorder: Results of a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group dose-ranging trial [^112bymbs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to provide proof-of-concept (PoC), dose-range finding, and safety data for BI 1358894, a TRPC4/5 ion channel inhibitor, in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD).

Methods: This was a phase 2, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive oral placebo or BI 1358894 (5 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, or 125 mg) once daily in a 2.5:1:1:1:2 ratio for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Zanarini Rating Scale for BPD (ZAN BPD) total score at Week 10. Secondary endpoints included a ≥ 30% ZAN-BPD reduction response from baseline at Week 10, changes from baseline at Week 10 in the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-16 item total, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Anxiety total, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity, and Patient Global Impression-Severity scores.

Results: Of 655 enrolled patients, 390 were randomized and 323 (82.8%) completed the trial. For primary and secondary endpoints, no differences were observed between treatment and placebo; therefore, PoC was not established. The proportion of patients with adverse events (AEs, BI 1358894 overall vs. placebo: 77.9% vs. 75.0%) and serious AEs (SAEs; 10.3% vs. 8.6%) was comparable between treatments. The proportion of patients with an SAE of suicidal ideation was 4.2% (BI 1358894 overall) and 6.3% (placebo).

Although the primary endpoint was not met, BI 1358894 was well tolerated with no increase in self-harm or suicidality. More targeted populations and alternative outcome assessments should be considered in future research.

### State of the art in the pharmacologic treatment of borderline personality disorder [^113C9ntZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most recent studies on the pharmacologic treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although research continues using randomized controlled trials with a placebo arm as well as active medication, meta-analyses and systematic reviews have revealed that the use of any specific medication or medication class in BPD remains at best uncertain and inconclusive. Studies indicate that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have fallen out of favor, and researchers have turned their attention to the study of mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics. Thus, it is not surprising that trends in prescribing appear to be shifting toward the use of these two classes over the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; yet we remain without any medication that has a specific indication for the treatment of BPD or an indication for any symptom that is seen as part of the BPD syndrome.
