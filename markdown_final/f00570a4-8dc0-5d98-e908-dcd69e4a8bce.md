## Question

Angioedema workup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the angioedema workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate airway and stabilization priorities. Then, I should classify the angioedema phenotype by presence or absence of urticaria. Next, I will obtain a targeted history and physical to separate histamine-mediated from bradykinin-mediated disease. After that, I will order initial screening labs, followed by confirmatory testing for C1 inhibitor deficiency and ACE inhibitor–related disease. Then, I should consider special populations and mimics, and finally outline when to image, how to monitor treatment response, and when to refer to specialists, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation come first, and I need to ensure I am not missing evolving laryngeal edema. In bradykinin-mediated angioedema, progression can be unpredictable, so early intubation or surgical airway should not be delayed if there are signs of impending airway compromise, and I should remember that epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids are not effective for bradykinin-mediated attacks, so I must avoid anchoring on allergic algorithms in this context [^111wyud5] [^113f7X92].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should classify the phenotype next because this dictates the entire diagnostic pathway. If angioedema occurs with urticaria, that points toward mast cell–mediated disease, whereas angioedema without urticaria should prompt evaluation for bradykinin-mediated etiologies such as hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, or ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema. I should double-check that I am not overlooking anaphylaxis, which can include angioedema with multisystem involvement and mandates epinephrine even if urticaria is absent [^114fWdpN] [^114YfbQ9].

> Next, I should review the history with a structured approach. I need to check for recurrence, duration of attacks, family history, medication exposures especially ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs, age of onset, and prodromal symptoms. I should confirm whether attacks are nonpruritic, nonpitting, and last 2–5 days, which are classic for HAE, and I must remember that up to a quarter of HAE cases have no known family history due to de novo mutations, so a negative family history does not exclude disease [^116NGYDH] [^112vpt7T] [^115P9Pj7].

> Wait, let me verify the physical examination priorities. I will examine the oropharynx and neck for edema, assess for nonpitting, nonpruritic swelling of the face, extremities, or genitalia, and look for erythema marginatum as a prodrome. I should also palpate the abdomen for tenderness or distension suggesting bowel wall edema and document any ascites or peritoneal signs that might mimic an acute abdomen, because abdominal attacks are common in HAE and can precede cutaneous or airway involvement [^117VhqEM] [^111tpScm].

> I will now examine the initial laboratory screening. C4 is the best first-line test for suspected C1 inhibitor deficiency because it is typically low between and during attacks. If C4 is low, I should proceed to C1 inhibitor antigen and function, and if C4 is normal during an attack, C1 inhibitor deficiency is unlikely, though I should confirm that testing was done correctly and consider repeating if suspicion remains high. I need to ensure I interpret results in the right clinical context and avoid false reassurance from a single normal C4 in a high-suspicion scenario [^114fWdpN] [^1149zx6a] [^114SxD8z].

> Let me think about confirmatory testing when C4 is low. I should order C1 inhibitor antigen and a functional assay using a chromogenic method for maximal sensitivity, and I should add C1q if acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is suspected, since C1q is low in acquired disease but normal in hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency. If results are discordant or equivocal, I should repeat testing to confirm the diagnosis, as recommended by WAO/EAACI guidelines, and I should remember that type I HAE has low antigen and function, whereas type II has normal antigen but low function [^114SxD8z] [^113sxFqQ] [^111m8iJt].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an ACE inhibitor. I should confirm ACE inhibitor use and discontinue it promptly because ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema is bradykinin-mediated and can occur at any time after initiation, sometimes years later. I should counsel that the propensity to swell can persist for weeks after stopping, and I should avoid substituting an ARB if there is a history of ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, even though ARB-associated angioedema is less common, until the risk is weighed carefully [^116qLh9s] [^114Qr6KX] [^116YpmQr].

> I need to ensure I consider special populations and mimics. In pediatrics, HAE often presents with abdominal pain and bowel wall edema, and median diagnostic delay is long, so a low threshold for C4 screening is warranted even without a family history. In older adults with new-onset recurrent angioedema, I should consider acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency and evaluate for lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmunity. I should also keep mimics in mind, such as acquired hemophilia presenting with tongue swelling, and remember that imaging during abdominal attacks may show bowel wall edema or ascites that resolve with the attack, supporting the diagnosis [^117VhqEM] [^11332Y1D] [^113sxFqQ] [^1159XosA] [^111tpScm].

> Hold on, I should verify when imaging is actually helpful. Routine imaging is not required for typical cutaneous or oropharyngeal attacks, but if there is severe unexplained abdominal pain or concern for bowel ischemia, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis during symptoms can demonstrate bowel wall edema, target sign, mesenteric vessel engorgement, or transient ascites, and repeating imaging after resolution can show complete remission of findings, which supports HAE. I should also remember the differential on imaging includes ischemia, vasculitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, so clinical correlation is essential [^111tpScm] [^113VRiVt] [^111cRHuN].

> Next, I should review how to monitor treatment response and when to pivot. For suspected HAE, failure to respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine strengthens the diagnosis and should trigger escalation to HAE-specific on-demand therapy such as C1 inhibitor replacement, a kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. For ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, resolution after drug withdrawal supports the diagnosis, though I should monitor for several weeks because recurrences can occur. For suspected mast cell–mediated disease, a structured trial of high-dose second-generation H1 antihistamines, with addition of montelukast and then omalizumab if refractory, helps confirm the mechanism by response [^113f7X92] [^114Qr6KX] [^115otxDb].

> I should double-check referral and longitudinal care. All patients with confirmed or strongly suspected HAE should be referred to an allergist or immunologist experienced in HAE management to establish a comprehensive plan including on-demand treatment, prophylaxis for procedures, and long-term prophylaxis when indicated. Family screening is essential given autosomal dominant inheritance, and patients should have access to HAE-specific on-demand agents at all times with an emergency action plan, as emphasized by WAO/EAACI and US HAEA guidance [^116iocJR] [^114SxD8z] [^115E1nd1].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with airway assessment, classify by urticaria presence, obtain a targeted history and exam, screen with C4, confirm with C1 inhibitor antigen and function plus C1q when indicated, evaluate for ACE inhibitor exposure and discontinue if present, consider age-specific etiologies and mimics, image selectively for abdominal disease, and confirm diagnoses by treatment response and, when needed, genetic testing. This stepwise approach aligns with contemporary guidelines and should reduce diagnostic delay and misclassification while prioritizing safety [^113Rp1nq] [^114fWdpN] [^116iocJR].

---

The angioedema workup should be **stepwise and mechanism-focused**, starting with a careful history to distinguish urticaria-associated (histamine-mediated) from isolated (bradykinin-mediated) angioedema, and identifying red flags such as airway involvement, ACE inhibitor use, or family history [^111T2q6G] [^114fWdpN]. Initial labs should include **C4, C1-INH antigen, and C1-INH function** to screen for hereditary or acquired C1-INH deficiency; if C4 is low or suspicion remains high, repeat testing and add C1q to distinguish acquired from hereditary forms [^113Rp1nq] [^113sxFqQ]. ACE inhibitor–related angioedema is diagnosed by temporal association and resolution after discontinuation; no specific labs confirm it [^114Qr6KX]. Imaging is reserved for unexplained abdominal pain or airway compromise to document bowel wall edema or airway swelling [^111tpScm] [^111cRHuN]. If initial tests are inconclusive but suspicion persists, consider HAE with normal C1-INH and pursue targeted genetic testing and specialist referral [^1155t7pd] [^112mXA86].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough clinical history and physical examination are **essential** to guide the diagnostic workup [^114Npm4r]. Key historical features include:

- **Presence or absence of urticaria**: Angioedema with urticaria suggests histamine-mediated disease, whereas isolated angioedema without urticaria suggests bradykinin-mediated disease [^111T2q6G] [^111pLSh7].
- **Medication history**: ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and certain antibiotics are common triggers [^115PGyLE] [^116YpmQr].
- **Family history**: HAE is autosomal dominant; a positive family history increases suspicion [^112vpt7T].
- **Attack characteristics**: Duration (> 24 hours), nonpruritic, nonpitting swelling, and recurrent attacks favor HAE [^1171pLGQ] [^116NGYDH].
- **Airway involvement**: Laryngeal edema is life-threatening and requires immediate attention [^111wyud5].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory testing should be **guided by clinical suspicion** and the suspected mechanism:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| C4 (complement component 4) | Initial screen for HAE | Low C4 suggests C1-INH deficiency; normal C4 makes HAE unlikely [^114fWdpN] [^1149zx6a] |
| C1-INH antigen | Confirm C1-INH deficiency | Low antigen confirms type I HAE; normal antigen with low function suggests type II HAE [^111NxVdr] [^1149zx6a] |
| C1-INH function | Confirm functional C1-INH deficiency | Low function confirms HAE [^113Rp1nq] [^1149zx6a] |
| C1q | Suspected acquired C1-INH deficiency | Low C1q suggests acquired C1-INH deficiency [^111m8iJt] [^113sxFqQ] |
| Genetic testing (SERPING1, F12, PLG, KNG1) | Suspected HAE with normal C1-INH | Identifies mutations in HAE with normal C1-INH [^1155t7pd] [^112mXA86] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is **not routinely required** but may be useful in specific scenarios:

- **Abdominal imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT or ultrasound can identify bowel wall edema in HAE, supporting the diagnosis in patients with unexplained abdominal pain [^111tpScm] [^113VRiVt].
- **Airway imaging**: CT or MRI may be used to assess airway compromise in severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of angioedema includes:

- **Histamine-mediated angioedema**: Urticaria-associated, allergic reactions, idiopathic [^111T2q6G] [^111pLSh7].
- **Bradykinin-mediated angioedema**: HAE, acquired C1-INH deficiency, ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema [^111pLSh7] [^114kaCZH].
- **Mimics**: Cellulitis, deep vein thrombosis, mucosal infections, autoimmune diseases [^notfound].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Specialist referral is **recommended** in the following situations:

- **Suspected HAE**: Referral to an allergist or immunologist for confirmation and management [^114kaCZH].
- **Acquired C1-INH deficiency**: Referral for evaluation of underlying conditions (e.g. lymphoproliferative disorders) [^11449PFm].
- **Refractory or idiopathic cases**: Referral for advanced diagnostics and management strategies [^115otxDb].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is **essential** to monitor disease control, adjust therapy, and assess for complications. Disease activity scores and patient-reported outcomes can guide management decisions [^113BatAi].

---

The angioedema workup should be **stepwise and mechanism-focused**, integrating history, targeted labs, and selective imaging to identify the cause and guide therapy. Early recognition of bradykinin-mediated disease enables timely, mechanism-specific treatment and reduces morbidity.

### The clinical evaluation of angioedema [^114Npm4r]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical evaluation of angioedema is reliant on obtaining a thorough patient and family history with an assessment of risk factors and presenting symptoms unique to each subtype. It is important to distinguish between angioedema with and without urticaria as a primary step in the evaluation; thereafter, laboratory parameters and investigations allow for subsequent stratification. There is a significant disease burden associated with angioedema and thus it is essential for health care practitioners to establish a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and a comprehensive care plan that addresses the patient's physical and mental well-being alike.

### Hereditary angioedema: imaging manifestations and clinical management [^116JYSTx]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a genetic disorder typically related to insufficient or dysfunctional C1-esterase inhibitor. Patients present with episodic swelling of various body parts, such as the face, neck, bowel, genitals, and extremities. Acute or severe symptoms can lead to patients presenting to the emergency room, particularly when the neck and abdominopelvic regions are affected, which is often accompanied by radiologic imaging evaluation. Patients with hereditary angioedema can pose a diagnostic challenge for emergency department physicians and radiologists at initial presentation, and the correct diagnosis may be missed or delayed, due to lack of clinical awareness of the disease or lack of its consideration in the radiologic differential diagnosis. Timely diagnosis of hereditary angioedema and rapid initiation of appropriate therapy can avoid potentially life-threatening complications. This article focuses on the spectrum of common and characteristic acute imaging manifestations of hereditary angioedema and provides an update on important recent developments in its clinical management and treatment.

### Practical algorithm for diagnosing patients with recurrent wheals or angioedema [^113ZjydN]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic urticaria is a common disorder characterized by recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both. Several differential diagnoses need to be considered in patients presenting with wheals and/or angioedema. These include rare diseases such as autoinflammatory syndromes and urticarial vasculitis in patients with recurrent wheals and bradykinin-mediated angioedema in patients with recurrent swellings. AIM AND RESULT: In order to not miss these conditions, we have developed a symptom-based diagnostic algorithm for the management of patients with wheals and/or angioedema.

Discussion and Conclusion

By asking the right questions and performing a limited diagnostic workup as suggested here, this algorithm may help to establish the right diagnosis and treat patients early and more effectively.

### Differential diagnosis of angioedema [^111vW4Mi]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

There are many conditions that may present with swelling that mimics angioedema. When swelling persists for greater than a few days or is unresponsive to treatment for urticaria/angioedema, other etiologies should be considered. In most instances, a thorough history and physical examination will define other etiologies. However, for more persistent conditions, further laboratory evaluation and a biopsy may be required to define the diagnosis. Rarely is a more aggressive approach required to make the diagnosis. Clinicians should remember that if the swelling does not act like angioedema, it more than likely is not angioedema.

Clinical Presentation

The clinical course and presentation of HAE vary. However, the hallmark symptoms of all forms of HAE include recurrent angioedema causing cutaneous swelling, abdominal symptoms from gastrointestinal angioedema, and respiratory symptoms due to airway involvement. In children, bowel wall edema with resultant abdominal pain and swelling of extremities are the most frequently reported initial symptoms. Hereditary angioedema is not associated with urticaria or pruritus, but patients can exhibit prodromal symptoms of erythema marginatum, an evanescent, nonpruritic macular rash. In contrast to histamine-induced angioedema, swelling due to HAE is protracted; untreated HAE symptoms often last 3 to 5 days from start to resolution. Protracted episodes are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality if not treated with effective medication. The lack of a clinical response to treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine should raise suspicion of HAE. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that can alert health care providers to the possibility of HAE. Figure 1 outlines the World Allergy Organization (WAO)/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) recommended diagnostic workup in patients suspected to have HAE.

Blood Testing

Measurement of C1-INH antigenic and functional levels is required to identify or exclude HAE-C1-INH. Measuring quantitative (antigenic) and functional activity of C1-INH and plasma complement protein 4 (C4) generally will be sufficient to establish a diagnosis. Although low C4 and C1-INH functional levels are clinically diagnostic, genetic mutation analysis is the ultimate confirmatory step; however, this last step is usually cost-prohibitive. A normal C4 test during an episode of angioedema excludes a diagnosis of HAE-C1-INH in most instances because C4 levels decrease further during episodes of swelling. Blood levels of C4 proteins and C1-INH are low at birth, so testing for these markers is recommended after 1 year of age.

### Clinical practice statement: what is the emergency department management of patients with angioedema secondary to an ACE-inhibitor? [^116qLh9s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema is a complication that has been reported in up to 1.0% of individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Importantly, the onset of angioedema can occur anywhere from hours to several years after initiation of therapy with ACE-Is. Although most cases of ACE-I-induced angioedema (ACE-I-AE) are self-limiting, a major clinical concern is development of airway compromise, which can potentially require emergent airway management. The underlying pathophysiology of ACE-I-AE is incompletely understood, but is considered to be due in large part to excess bradykinin. Numerous medications have been proposed for the treatment of ACE-I-AE. This article is an update to the 2011 Clinical Practice Committee (CPC) statement from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.

Methods

A literature search in PubMed was performed with search terms angioedema and ACE inhibitors from August 1, 2012 to May 13, 2019. Following CPC guidelines, articles written in English were identified and then underwent a structured review for evaluation.

Results

The search parameters resulted in 323 articles. The abstracts of these articles were assessed independently by the reviewers, who determined there were 63 articles that were specific to ACE-I-AE, of which 46 were deemed appropriate for grading in the final focused review.

Conclusions

The primary focus for the treatment of ACE-I-AE is airway management. In the absence of high-quality evidence, no specific medication therapy is recommended for its treatment. If, however, the treating physician feels the patient's presentation is more typical of an acute allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, it may be appropriate to treat for those conditions. Any patient with suspected ACE-I-AE should immediately discontinue that medication.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnosis and management algorithm — patients with a history suggestive of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are first assessed for angioedema; if present, "Consider medications, C1INH syndromes, or conditions that mimic angioedema". If not and the "history, review of systems, and physical examination" are not consistent, "Consider alternative diagnoses (see Differential Diagnosis Section)". When the history suggests a physical component, "Does the history suggest physical urticaria? Is there a physical component to the urticaria and/or" and the action is to "Consider appropriate challenge testing for physical urticaria". If vasculitis is suggested, "If skin biopsy diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis. If biopsy negative go to box 10". If "history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests" indicate an underlying cause, "Evaluate and manage specific conditions", otherwise proceed with "Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema" and ensure "Periodic reassessment for underlying etiology and response to therapy".

### Hereditary angioedema [^112vRaBu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usual results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

Diagnostic Algorithm for Diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH

The diagnosis of HAE should be considered in all patients with recurrent angioedema without hives. Proper diagnosis utilizes four modes of investigation: (1) clinical presentation (phenotype), (2) pathomechanism, (3) biomarkers, and (4) genetics. The diagnostic process is complicated by the reality that in clinical practice, many angioedema patients will have an unknown pathomechanism while validated biomarkers and genetic studies are either unavailable or uninformative. Thus, a combination of all the above parameters is highly desired but often not attainable. In the absence of helpful laboratory data, clinicians must assess the patients' responses over time to empiric treatment with medications targeting potential pathogenic pathways. This strategy can also be challenging as it requires prolonged patient engagement in a systematic stepwise treatment approach and may lack robust objective methods to assess efficacy. The algorithm below and Fig. 1 summarize the recommended approach for evaluating these patients. This approach may need to be further adapted according to the available expertise, testing facilities and resources. Patients presenting to an emergency department with an angioedema attack of unknown cause should be referred to a physician familiar with angioedema who can undertake this evaluation.

Step 1. Is the Diagnosis Tenable?

Confirm a clinical history of documented recurrent angioedema without hives. Photos and laryngoscopic and imaging evidence of angioedema are essential to differentiate true angioedema from factitious angioedema or patients who mistakenly believe they have angioedema based on non-angioedematous symptoms, both of which are common in patients (mis)diagnosed with HAE-nC1INH (Table 4). In the case of predominant gastrointestinal attacks, obtaining abdominal imaging during an attack can be useful to evaluate for bowel wall edema and intraperitoneal fluid. A detailed family history and medication history should be obtained in all patients with recurrent angioedema.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of angioedema and angioedema mimics

Step 2. Exclude C1INH Deficiency

Measure C4, C1INH antigen, and C1INH function (if available), even if the patient is taking a medication that may cause angioedema. If acquired C1INH deficiency is suspected based on age of symptom onset, C1q level and anti-C1INH antibodies should be measured. Sequencing of SERPING1 is not routinely required, but can be helpful to distinguish acquired C1INH deficiency from HAE-C1INH, especially in patients aged > 40 years.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^114fWdpN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria — evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria should prioritize excluding complement-mediated and drug-associated causes before labeling idiopathic; specifically, patients "should be evaluated for hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, or ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema before a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema is made", and when C1-inhibitor deficiency is suspected, "measurement of the C4 level is recommended as the best initial screening test", with "A normal C4 level during an episode of angioedema" strongly suggesting C1-inhibitor deficiency is unlikely; in contrast, for typical CU, "obtaining routine testing for C4 levels, C1-inhibitor levels, or functional assays is not appropriate".

### A consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema in the emergency department [^111yKS4p]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively common occurrence and life-threatening potential, the management of angioedema in the emergency department (ED) is lacking in terms of a structured approach. It is paramount to distinguish the different etiologies of angioedema from one another and more specifically differentiate histaminergic-mediated angioedema from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, especially in lieu of the more novel treatments that have recently become available for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. With this background in mind, this consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema attempts to provide a working framework for emergency physicians (EPs) in approaching the patient with angioedema in terms of diagnosis and management in the ED. This consensus parameter was developed from a collaborative effort among a group of EPs and leading allergists with expertise in angioedema. After rigorous debate, review of the literature, and expert opinion, the following consensus guideline document was created. The document has been endorsed by the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM).

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112fTbZk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Patients with undiagnosed HAE with GI symptoms are likely to present across many care settings, including both primary care and specialist clinics. Inclusion of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained severe and often recurrent abdominal pain, with or without skin manifestations, may improve the diagnosis rate of HAE. Careful history-taking and a physical examination along with selected imaging studies and laboratory testing are vital to making the diagnosis. By including HAE in the differential diagnosis, providers can make the appropriate referral to a physician experienced in managing HAE, thus shortening the time to diagnosis and effective treatment and reducing the burden of disease.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^111zrKrA]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

It is important to be aware of HAE as a cause of recurrent swelling in the absence of urticaria. The fact that 25% of patients do not have a family history is not an impediment to diagnosis because a C4 level and C1 inhibitor determination by protein and by function is diagnostic and has the potential to decrease the unnecessary lag time between clinical presentation and the initiation of appropriate therapy.

Hereditary angioedema cannot be cured, but effective treatments can reduce disease burden and improve QoL in children with HAE. Initial clinical symptoms of HAE typically occur in childhood. Early recognition by all health care professionals, particularly those caring for pediatric patients, reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality as well as unnecessary interventions. Alternative modalities, such as music therapy and other complementary therapies, can supplement medical management and improve a pediatric patient's treatment experience by facilitating administration and reducing the child's stress, anxiety, pain perception, and fear, and can relieve parental concerns about multiple injections. All these benefits contribute to an increased QoL for children with HAE.

Multiple therapies are available that can abort acute episodes of angioedema and therapy that can be administered regularly as prophylaxis to prevent them. These can be life-saving given the known mortality statistics when this disorder is untreated.

### Classification, diagnosis, and pathology of angioedema without hives [^116iW7Tq]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

A clear disease classification schema coupled with an understanding of the specific mechanisms involved in the different types of angioedema without hives informs the diagnostic assessment. The recommended approach involves several key steps. Foremost is the recognizing of the clinical clues which allow for the differentiation of mast cell-mediated disorders from bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Enhanced vascular permeability related to bradykinin is of critical importance to identify given the implications for disease morbidity and risk of mortality. The ability to efficiently categorize and diagnose all forms of angioedema results in improved patient outcomes.

### Angioedema. pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^117WxrqK]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a constellation of syndromes that present a great challenge to the clinician. The term "angioedema" describes the localized, transient, episodic edema of the deeper layers of the skin or of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Although angioedema may affect any part of the body, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are involved most commonly by far. Episodic abdominal pain arising from angioedema affecting any intra-abdominal organ may occur without skin angioedema; therefore, angioedema must be included in the differential diagnosis of intermittent, unexplained abdominal pain. Angioedema is caused by extravasation of plasma in the affected areas, which at times is accompanied by nonspecific, minimal cellular infiltrate. The most commonly identified causes of angioedema are medications, allergens, and physical agents, but most angioedema is idiopathic. Rare forms of angioedema associated with either hereditary or acquired faulty activation of the complement and kallikrein-kinin systems have been extensively described. Taking a comprehensive personal and family history, performing a physical examination, and compulsively monitoring the response to therapy are the most rewarding and cost-effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Diligent and knowledgeable follow-up by the attending physician spares patients costly and unnecessary tests as well as harmful treatment. The most effective treatment depends on the identification of the causative mechanism and — especially when the mechanism is not identified — on the clinician's knowledge and experience with innovative therapeutic regimens.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with angio-oedema [^117Dv8k2]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Angio-oedema is a common reason for attendance at the accident and emergency department and for referral to immunology/allergy clinics. Causative factors should always be sought, but a large proportion of patients have the idiopathic form of the disease. A minority of patients represent a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Failure to identify the more unusual causes of angio-oedema may result in life-threatening situations. Common and rare causes of angio-oedema will be discussed in this article, as well as the diagnostic and treatment pathways for the management of these patients. A comprehensive history and close monitoring of response to treatment are the most cost-effective diagnostic and treatment tools.

### Diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema: an emergency medicine perspective [^11685w3u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and often debilitating condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the absence of appropriate intervention. An underlying deficiency in functional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) protein induces a vulnerability to unchecked activation of the complement, contact, and coagulation/fibrinolytic systems. The clinical consequence is a pattern of recurring attacks of non-pitting, non-pruritic edema, the urgency of which varies by the affected site. Laryngeal edema can escalate rapidly to asphyxiation, and severe cases of abdominal swelling can lead to hypovolemic shock.

Objectives

This report reviews the emergency diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema and the impact of recently introduced treatments on treatment in the United States.

Discussion

Until recently, emergency physicians in the United States were hindered by the lack of rapidly effective treatment options for HAE attacks. In this article, general clinical and laboratory diagnostic procedures are reviewed against the backdrop of two case studies: one patient presenting with a known history of HAE and one with previously undiagnosed HAE. In many countries outside the United States, plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate has for decades been the first-line treatment for acute attacks. The end of 2009 ushered in a new era in the pharmacologic management of HAE attacks in the United States with the approval of two new treatment options for acute treatment: a plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate and a kallikrein inhibitor.

Conclusion

With access to targeted and effective treatments, emergency physicians are now better equipped for successful and rapid intervention in urgent HAE cases.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- disease severity is highly variable, as characterized by episodic rather than continuous swelling

- a precipitating cause for most attacks is unknown

- stress and trauma are recognized as precipitants

- HAE is characterized by relatively prolonged attacks

- attacks of swelling generally involve the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, or larynx and follow a stereotypical pattern in which the swelling worsens over 24 hours, peaks, and then slowly resolves over the following 48–72 hours

- attacks can be preceded by a prodrome

- onset of swelling in patients with HAE most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty

- HAE attacks are associated with significant potential morbidity and potential mortality.

### Angioedema with normal complement studies: what Do we know? [^111pLSh7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is generally readily recognizable clinically and is characterized by localized nonpitting edema involving subcutaneous, submucosal, or deep dermal tissue caused by increased vascular permeability and extravasation of intravascular fluid. It can occur via a variety of mechanisms. A number of clinical conditions (masqueraders) are occasionally mistaken for angioedema. Clinical classification of the various angioedema forms begins with noting the presence or absence of concurrent urticaria or wheals. Pathogenesis can be considered through two broad categories: mast cell-mediated with release of vasoactive mediators causing angioedema usually associated with urticaria or in the context of an anaphylactic reaction; and bradykinin (BK)-driven, in which increased vascular permeability is mediated by BK. BK-mediated angioedema does not occur with urticaria, nor does it respond to antiallergic medications. The various forms of hereditary angioedema are included in this category, requiring specific tests of C4 and C1 inhibitor level and function to confirm the diagnosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which impair the degradation of BK, account for up to a third of all patients with angioedema presenting to the emergency department. Finally, angioedema may occur by yet unknown mechanisms; under this circumstance, it is difficult to manage.

### How we manage persons with hereditary angioedema [^114DtjHT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous and mucosal swelling that can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Several novel therapies introduced since 2008 have dramatically transformed the approach to management. In this review we will discuss the current understanding of the pathophysiology of HAE, diagnostic evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria, and the therapeutic approach to HAE. We advocate taking an integrative approach to care in order to normalize the lives of affected patients.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111YvrEd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and angioedema — diagnostic algorithm (Fig 3) — defines CU when episodes persist for greater than 6 weeks, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. In 40% to 50% of patients with urticaria, angioedema will also be a part of the spectrum, and when angioedema occurs alone it can last for greater than 24 hours and be nonpruritic. If urticaria/angioedema is exclusively or primarily triggered by an external physical trigger, the work-up should proceed to Box 6; if only partially triggered by physical factors or not at all, the work-up should progress to Box 10. For suspected physical urticaria or angioedema, physical challenge procedures can be used to confirm the diagnosis, and if confirmed by challenge testing the condition should be managed with a combination of avoidance measures. If urticarial vasculitis is suspected — lesions often persist for greater than 24 to 48 hours — a biopsy is important for confirming the diagnosis; if the skin biopsy is diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis, and if negative, proceed to Box 10. In evaluating angioedema, for a patient taking an ACE inhibitor, drug discontinuation and replacement with an equally efficacious alternative agent should be considered.

Scientific and clinical progress together with the development of effective novel therapeutic options has engendered multiple important changes in the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE). We now update and extend the 2013 United States Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board guidelines for the treatment and management of HAE. The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence. Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, prophylactic treatment, special considerations for women and children, development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan, and assessment of burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor. Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

### Recognition, evaluation, and management of pediatric hereditary angioedema [^112nT3db]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, often underrecognized genetic disorder caused by either a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (type 1) or mutation (type 2). This leads to overproduction of bradykinin resulting in vasodilation, vascular leakage, and transient nonpitting angioedema occurring most frequently in the face, neck, upper airway, abdomen, and/or extremities. Involvement of the tongue and laryngopharynx has been associated with asphyxiation and death. Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal-dominant condition; therefore, there is a 50% chance an offspring will inherit this disorder. Any patient presenting with isolated angioedema should be screened with a C4 measurement, as 25% of cases have no family history of HAE. All patients with HAE will have a functional deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor. Contributors that delay the diagnosis of HAE include recognition delay by clinicians who confuse this condition with histaminergic angioedema, the disease's varied presentations, and limitations to timely testing. Pediatric emergency clinicians should be knowledgeable about how to distinguish between bradykinin- and histamine-mediated angioedema, as there are significant differences in the diagnostic testing, treatment, and clinical response between these 2 different conditions. Evidence indicates that early diagnosis and treatment of HAE reduces morbidity and mortality. Clinician recognition of the mechanistically different problems will ensure patients are appropriately referred to an expert for outpatient management.

### Recognition and differential diagnosis of hereditary angioedema in the emergency department [^114kaCZH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema (AE) is a clinical syndrome marked by localized swelling of the subcutaneous layer of the skin or the submucosal layer of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. While AE is commonly mediated by histamine (allergic AE), some types result from excessive bradykinin activity, including hereditary AE (HAE), acquired AE, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced AE. These are less common but important to consider given different treatment requirements and potentially serious outcomes, including death from laryngeal swelling.

Objective

This review describes the pathophysiology and clinical features of AE as well as the diagnosis and treatment of AE in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

Bradykinin-mediated AE does not respond to antihistamines and corticosteroids. By contrast, several targeted, effective therapies are available, including C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates, which replace the missing protein activity underlying some bradykinin-mediated AE, and medications that directly lessen bradykinin activity (eg, ecallantide and icatibant). Urticaria is generally absent in bradykinin-mediated AE and serves as a primary differentiating factor in the clinical diagnosis. Relevant laboratory assessments may include C1-INH levels, C1-INH function, and C4 complement. Patients with HAE or a family member can communicate their known diagnosis when presenting to the ED, and some may even bring their own medication(s) with them. Patients newly diagnosed with HAE in the ED should be referred for specialized outpatient care upon ED discharge.

Conclusions

There is a great need for ED clinicians to be aware of HAE, its differential diagnosis, and appropriate treatment to ensure that patients receive optimal and timely treatment.

### Chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema: clues to the mimics [^113Ym3Ep]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Urticaria and angioedema are experienced by up to 1 in 5 people, usually the result of common allergen or medication triggers and infections. Similarly, the majority of recurrent angioedema has an exogenous trigger, for example, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or is hereditary (type 1 and 2 hereditary angioedema); chronic spontaneous urticaria are most often autoimmune or autoallergic in routine clinical practice. There are, however, several skin and systemic conditions that can imitate the clinical appearance of either angioedema or urticaria, whereas there are several uncommon conditions that have chronic urticaria and/or recurrent angioedema as part of their disease manifestations. Correct diagnosis is paramount to ensuring subsequent tailored therapy for many of these conditions, and in many instances, diagnostic delay can be several years with morbid consequence. In this grand rounds article, we present 2 illustrative clinical cases as the backdrop to discussing a practical diagnostic approach for clinicians to recognize copycat phenotypes and "red flags" that should prompt further investigation of several uncommon mimics. We highlight key diagnostic features, epidemiology, and management for mimics where treatment is distinct from the common phenotypes of recurrent angioedema and chronic urticarias.

### Isolated angioedema: a review of classification and update on management [^116Ko4pV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the various types of angioedema including diagnosis and treatment.

Data Sources

PubMed search of articles in the English language of various types of angioedema.

Study Selections

Articles on the subject matter were selected and reviewed.

Results

Herein, a case-based approach is presented for discussing the major types of angioedema, including the following: hereditary angioedema types I and II and normal complement, acquired angioedema, angiotensin-converting enzyme-induced angioedema, and histaminergic and nonhistaminergic angioedema. Emerging treatments of hereditary angioedema including targets of prekallikrein, DNA vector technology replacing C1-INH protein, and CRIPSR technology targeting prekallikrein among many others are explored. In addition, other causes and mimickers of angioedema are briefly reviewed. Finally, a novel algorithm is proposed to help guide the treating physician through the workup and management of patients with suspected idiopathic angioedema unresponsive to conventional therapy with antihistamines.

Conclusion

Over the years, many strides have been made in both understanding the pathophysiology of various types of angioedema and expansion of treatment options. It is important for clinicians to be aware of current and emerging treatment options. We provide a novel practical algorithm to guide clinicians in challenging cases of idiopathic angioedema refractory to antihistamines.

### Radiologic manifestations of angioedema [^113VRiVt]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Angioedema attacks can last from 1 to 5 days without treatment, and intestinal angioedema typically subsides in 12–24 h. Recurrent episodes of unexplained acute abdominal pain (e.g. three or more episodes within 3–6 months) and the imaging finding of oedematous bowel wall thickening may warrant an initial workup for angioedema including detailed family and medication (e.g. ACE inhibitors) histories and laboratory evaluation of the complementary system. Although imaging follow-up may not usually be indicated, complete remission of abnormal imaging findings may support the clinical diagnosis of angioedema, and vice versa.

Differential diagnoses of gastrointestinal angioedema consist of other pathologies that may cause bowel wall oedema, including ischaemia, vasculitis, and hypoproteinaemia. Since there are numerous entities that may present as mural stratification or the halo sign, the diagnostic approach is based on the exclusion of other potential causes clinically and radiologically. For example, it is possible to suggest venous ischaemia based on the presence of mesenteric venous thrombus (Fig. 13). However, making the differential diagnosis of intestinal angioedema versus non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia may be difficult based solely on imaging findings because both entities show a halo sign without mesenteric fat stranding. In non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia, diffuse narrowing of mesenteric arterial branches may be recognised, and patients with non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia present clinically with hypovolaemia, hypotension, and low cardiac output. Associated skin findings may be recognised in patients with vasculitis such as lupus enteritis and Henoch-Schönlein purpura. In Crohn's enteritis, mesenteric fat stranding, engorgement of vasa recta (comb sign), luminal narrowing, and the degree of wall enhancement are more striking than intestinal angioedema (Fig. 14). Additionally, the presence of fistula, abscess, and findings to suggest coexisting chronic inflammation such as submucosal fatty infiltration and creeping fat may be helpful for the differential diagnosis. Furthermore, clinical history and laboratory data can exclude radiation enteritis, hypoproteinaemia, portal hypertensive enteropathy, and infection.

### Creating a comprehensive treatment plan for hereditary angioedema [^115mHBMw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has changed dramatically in recent years because of the availability of several HAE-specific medications. This paradigm shift in therapy provides the opportunity to dramatically improve the care of HAE patients, but has increased the complexity of treatment. Patient education and communication with health care providers is crucial. Early treatment of HAE attacks has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of rapid and reliable treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence for best practices in HAE management, and suggests practical steps toward developing a comprehensive treatment plan.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — clinical features and natural history — has relatively prolonged attacks involving the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, larynx, or combinations, with disease severity highly variable and episodic rather than continuous; onset most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty, and HAE is an autosomal dominant disease with most patients having a positive family history of angioedema. Attacks generally follow a stereotypical pattern in which swelling worsens over 24 hours and resolves over the following 48 hours, might be preceded by a prodrome, and are associated with significant potential morbidity and mortality; precipitants are often unknown, though stress and trauma are recognized.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^11332Y1D]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The median time from symptom onset to HAE diagnosis is estimated at 8.5 years. Diagnosis is often delayed, even among those with a family history of HAE. Diagnostic delays in pediatric patients may be due to the fact that HAE is a rare disorder and that many HAE symptoms can mimic those of more common conditions. Furthermore, 25% of patients have no family history of angioedema. Delays in diagnosis can defer effective treatment and result in inappropriate treatment or unnecessary surgical interventions.

Effective medications are available and approved to treat HAE in children. However, evidence informing use of these medications in pediatric clinical practice is limited because clinical trials of these agents have focused mostly on adults and have underrepresented pediatric patients.

Management plans are critical to optimize outcomes and should address treatment, on-demand treatment for acute attacks, and forestall potentially fatal laryngeal attacks. The plan should also comprise a holistic approach to address nonclinical aspects of HAE, including QoL and psychological issues.

The objective of this article is to provide an overview of HAE management principles that health care providers can apply to treat pediatric patients to improve their QoL.

### Acquired haemophilia A initially diagnosed as angioedema [^1159XosA]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acquired haemophilia (AH) is a bleeding diathesis caused by inhibitors to factor VIII. Patients developing AH may present with catastrophic bleeding episodes despite having no prior history of bleeding disorder. The authors report a patient with AH who presented with tongue swelling and was diagnosed with angioedema on presentation. However, the patient started bleeding spontaneously after presentation and was diagnosed with AH and the workup revealed haematoma of the tongue, which was the cause of tongue swelling. As previously reported in the literature, AH in this patient might have been precipitated secondary to exposure to an ear infection or exposure to the penicillin group of antibiotics. Laboratory examination was confirmatory for AH, which was appropriately treated with recombinant activated factor VIIa and immunosuppressive therapy with good outcomes. Understanding the pathophysiology of AH and appropriate management is important to prevent life-threatening bleeding.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^111tpScm]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 3
Factors for Consideration in Recognizing Patients With HAE

There are limited data on the prevalence of HAE among the various causes of chronic abdominal pain, but many patients will have episodes with isolated abdominal pain and angioedema in the absence of any skin or airway swelling. Over the course of a lifetime, however, it is very unusual to solely experience abdominal symptoms. Most patients will have recurrent cutaneous angioedema as well, but this may not occur with every episode. Thus, connecting recurrent skin symptoms with the recurrent abdominal pain (which may be occurring at different times) is a key clinical clue.

In the diagnostic evaluation, taking a comprehensive family history and asking about a personal history of cutaneous swelling or recurrent airway symptoms, along with clinical suspicion of HAE, can aid in differentiating HAE from other causes of abdominal pain. Health care providers should consider HAE in patients with severe abdominal pain even in the absence of a history of laryngeal or cutaneous swelling. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography or ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis during a symptomatic episode is recommended to evaluate for GI angioedema and transitory ascites if the cause of symptoms is unclear.–Imaging findings in a patient with an HAE attack may include intestinal wall edemaearly in an attack, whereas isolated ascites may be seen later in the course of an attack. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography may also show prominent mesenteric vessels during HAE attacks. However, the sensitivity of abdominal imaging in detecting abnormalities during HAE abdominal symptoms is unknown. Upon reimaging after the abdominal pain has resolved, complete remission of abnormal findings may support the diagnosis of HAE. Determining serum levels of C4 constitutes the principal screening test for HAE.C4 levels are persistently low in most individuals with HAE due to C1-INH deficiency, although a small subset of patients demonstrates only low C4 levels during a symptomatic episode. If C4 levels are low at baseline or during an attack, then testing for levels and activity of C1-INH is indicated. Patients who are suspected of having HAE by initial laboratory screen or imaging should be referred to an allergist, immunologist, or other physician familiar with managing HAE for confirmation of diagnosis.

### Angioedema [^116AGAwm]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening occurrence that is encountered by critical care providers. The mechanistic understanding of angioedema syndromes has improved in recent years, and novel medications are available that improve outcomes from these syndromes. This clinically focused review will describe the underlying genetics, pathophysiology, classification and treatment of angioedema syndromes, with an emphasis on the novel pharmacologic agents that have recently become available for acute treatment.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted with the MeSH terms angioedema, acquired angioedema, hereditary angioedema type III, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema.

Study Selection

Selected publications describing angioedema, clinical trials, diagnosis, management, and genetics were retrieved (reviews, guidelines, clinical trials, case series), and their bibliographies were also reviewed to identify relevant publications.

Data Extraction

Data from the relevant publications were reviewed, summarized and the information synthesized.

Data Synthesis

The data obtained were used to describe the current state of diagnosis and management of various angioedema syndromes.

Conclusions

Angioedema is a life-threatening syndrome with multiple subtypes, each with a distinct pathophysiology. We present an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and suggested management of various subtypes of angioedema. Securing the airway remains the most important intervention, followed by administration of both established and more novel pharmacologic interventions based on disease pathology.

### Radiologic manifestations of angioedema [^111cRHuN]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema was first described by J.L. Milton in 1876. First named angioneurotic oedema by Quinckein 1882, it is sometimes referred to as Quincke's oedema. There are various causes of angioedema. The incidence of angioedema varies with its causes. For example, the estimated incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is 0.1 to 1.0% and that of hereditary angioedema (HAE) ranges from 0.002 to 0.01%. It is clinically characterised as episodic localised and transient oedematous swelling, most commonly affecting superficial regions such as the face, genitals, and extremities. If angioedema only affected the superficial regions, imaging evaluation would not be necessary. Angioedema, however, may affect any part of the body, and intra-abdominal involvement can even occur without cutaneous involvement. Angioedema can also present with life-threatening respiratory distress when the upper airway is involved. Angioedema involving the gastrointestinal tract may present as an acute abdominal pain resulting in unnecessary laparotomy. Although the diagnosis of angioedema is clinical, awareness of this entity and its characteristic imaging findings by radiologists will aid in raising the suspicion for angioedema, which may warrant further clinical workup and prevent unnecessary surgery. Additionally, for patients with known previous history of angioedema who have abdominal pain, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the study of choice to evaluate for possible visceral involvement as well as to rule out other pathology.

The purpose of this pictorial review is to present imaging findings of angioedema involving the various organs. Differential diagnoses and complications of angioedema are discussed.

### US hereditary angioedema association medical advisory board 2013 recommendations for the management of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^113T3aCu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has undergone dramatic changes as newer medicines have become available in recent years. Optimal care of these patients requires a comprehensive management plan. Although several consensus papers have been published concerning the diagnosis and treatment of HAE, guidelines for a comprehensive management plan have not been developed.

Objective

To develop state-of-the-art recommendations for the treatment and management of HAE due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency in the United States.

Methods

Members of the US Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board began by reviewing the literature concerning treatment of HAE. Preliminary recommendations were developed based on the literature review, discussions in a face-to-face meeting, and refinements in a series of drafts. Final recommendations reflect the unanimous consensus of the medical advisory board and the US Hereditary Angioedema Association leadership.

Results

Recommendations are provided regarding a comprehensive care plan for HAE, including the following: development of an overall management plan, treatment of angioedema attacks, prophylactic treatment, and patient monitoring.

Conclusion

A comprehensive individualized management plan developed between an expert HAE physician and the patient, in collaboration with local medical providers and emergency departments, can provide patients with the best opportunity to lead a normal life.

### Angioedema as a predominant symptom ofinfection [^114aGJDS]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 41-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a 6-week history of severe angioedema, dyspnoea and coughing. Initial investigations focused on common causes of angioedema. Clinical presentation and resistance to treatment with antihistamines and steroids made histamine-mediated angioedema unlikely. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema, such as hereditary or drug-induced angioedema, was excluded by a thorough history investigation and laboratory testing for C1-esterase and C4. In rare cases, exogen pathogens cause angioedema. After profound testing for respiratory pathogens, Bordetella pertussis toxins IgA and IgG were found to be positive, indicating recent B. pertussis infection. Pertussis toxin may be responsible for increased vascular permeability causing angioedema. With adequate antibiotic treatment, the symptoms resolved quickly. This case is an example of an atypical presentation of B. pertussis infection in an unvaccinated adult. The recent resurgence of pertussis makes early diagnosis and disease prevention by vaccination crucial.

### Biomarkers in hereditary angioedema [^112rsS9f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

In daily practice, clinicians taking care of patients with HAE are faced with several challenges, such as (i) large inter- and intra-familial heterogeneity in the clinical manifestations of the disease; (ii) early diagnosis of unpredictable oncoming angioedema attacks; (iii) a differential diagnosis of HAE subtypes; and (iv) objective assessment of disease severity, which may guide therapeutic decisions. These challenges are the driving force behind the current efforts to identify measurable biomarkers of HAE. Finding such biomarkers could facilitate the diagnosis and prediction of an upcoming attack, as well as help to monitor disease activity, discriminate between high and low responders to a specific drug, or select the best candidates for a given treatment.

This review represents a clinician's perspective and constitutes an attempt to answer the question: to what extent biomarker discovery can help overcome the above challenges? In the broadest sense, any measurable parameter may serve as a biomarker, including clinical features or radiographic findings, but the scope of this review is to discuss only potential laboratory biomarkers that involve essential biological processes, from nucleic DNA to mediators of effector mechanisms.

Conclusion and Forward-Looking Statement

The ability to unambiguously diagnose HAE-nC1INH currently relies on excluding other causes and identifying any underlying mutation; however, clinicians may not have access to gene sequencing. Many if not most patients with possible HAE-nC1INH do not have a demonstrated pathologic mutation. Even without an identified mutation, a presumptive diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH made by an expert physician is sufficient. Since these patients are at risk of serious morbidity and mortality, treatment needs to be available even for a presumptive diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH.

The inability to make definitive diagnoses severely limits our ability to conduct clinical trials to elucidate treatment options. Thus, we recommend that concerted efforts be made to validate accurate biomarkers that can improve diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Since HAE-nC1INH is a rare disease, national or international registries will be essential for learning more about the natural history and response to treatment. The introduction of new techniques into genetic testing has increased the number of genes identified, and biorepositories create the means for analysis of recently identified genes in stored DNA samples of the patients.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — trigger identification and avoidance — Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by a detailed history and eliminated, if possible; management should focus on identifying specific triggers based on history with focused testing and symptomatic relief. A delayed syndrome has been recognized with acute urticaria/angioedema with a delay of 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of beef, pork, lamb, or venison. Medication-induced disease requires careful history: ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema after months or even years of therapy, and over-the-counter aspirin or NSAIDs (including aspirin-like remedies) can be associated with acute relapsing urticaria/angioedema; aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided, as feasible, with substitution of an equally efficacious alternative not commonly associated with urticaria.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112G2Qqu]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

WHEN SHOULD HAE BE SUSPECTED? PRACTICAL GUIDANCE

Evidence of the HAE-GI symptom overlap comes from both observationaland single-case studies,–(Table 2). HAE should be suspected when a patient presents with a history of recurrent cutaneous angioedema attacks. Secondary considerations include family history of HAE; onset of symptoms in childhood/adolescence; recurrent and painful abdominal symptoms; occurrence of upper airway edema; swelling that fails to respond to antihistamines, glucocorticoids, or epinephrine; presence of prodromal signs or symptoms before attacks; and the absence of urticaria. Once HAE is suspected, laboratory investigations (ie, C4, C1-INH level and function) should be carried out regardless of absence or presence of painful abdominal symptoms, as C1-INH levels (Type 1) and C1-INH function (Type 1 and 2) are consistently low during both asymptomatic and symptomatic periods. C4 levels are consistently low in most (> 85%) individuals with HAE and will be low in all patients during an angioedema attack. For a diagnosis of HAE, a history of recurrent cutaneous angioedema attacks, and a low (< 50% of normal) C1-INH result are required; a low C4 (at baseline or during attack) is also expected.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^116ySmwM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Early identification of HAE is critical to reducing mortality and morbidity and to developing an appropriate management plan. The first HAE episode may be a laryngeal attack, which can be fatal. An analysis of 70 patients with HAE who had asphyxiated during a laryngeal attack showed that mortality was higher in patients with undiagnosed HAE (63 cases) than in patients with diagnosed HAE (7 cases). Upper airway swelling is also more severe in pediatric patients due to the smaller diameter of the airway, which increases the risk of asphyxiation.

Barriers to early diagnosis include poor recognition of HAE symptoms by health care professionals, a lack of appropriate family screening tools, and a lack of access to simple laboratory tests to help establish a diagnosis.- Symptoms typically present in childhood, and delays in diagnosis can subject patients to inappropriate treatment and unnecessary medical interventions.

Despite its familial association, many family members of patients with HAE are not screened for the disorder. A survey of patients with HAE found that only 48% of immediate family members and 26% of extended family members had been tested for the condition. With the availability of effective therapies, screening of family members has increasingly been emphasized as a way to reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with HAE. Each child of a parent with HAE has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder; therefore, all infants with a family history of HAE should be considered to have the disorder until the diagnosis is ruled out.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^1149zx6a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) laboratory diagnosis — Two forms of HAE, which are indistinguishable clinically, can be diagnosed by laboratory findings (A): type I HAE presents with low C1INH antigenic and functional levels, whereas type II HAE presents with normal C1INH antigenic levels but decreased C1INH functional levels. Diagnosis of type I or type II HAE requires evidence of low C1INH antigenic or functional levels, as well as decreased C4 levels and generally normal C1q levels (A). C1INH function should be measured with a chromogenic assay to achieve the greatest sensitivity in detecting C1INH functional deficiency. Measuring complement C4 levels is recommended as the initial screening test to exclude a diagnosis of HAE; in a study assessing screening tests, all 20 patients with untreated C1INH deficiency had a low level of C4, although C4 levels can be normal, particularly if the patient is already being treated.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) clinical phenotype and attack course are characterized by episodic swelling with variable severity and potential mortality: Disease severity in patients with HAE is highly variable and characterized by episodic rather than continuous swelling; a precipitating cause for most episodes is unknown, although stress and trauma have been recognized; attacks generally involve the extremities, abdomen, genitourinary tract, face, oropharynx, or larynx and follow a stereotypical pattern in which swelling worsens over 24 hours, peaks, and then slowly resolves over the following 48 hours; attacks might be preceded by a prodrome; HAE attacks are associated with significant potential morbidity and potential mortality.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^113sxFqQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) and acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency — diagnostic workup using complement testing: In patients with recurrent angioedema and a low C4, the possibilities include type I HAE, type II HAE, and acquired C1INH deficiency, and the first step is to determine whether the C1INH antigenic level is low or normal; if the antigenic level is normal, a C1INH functional level is required, and if both antigenic and functional levels are normal, C1INH deficiency is excluded and other causes (including idiopathic angioedema, allergic angioedema without urticaria, or HAE with normal C1INH levels) should be reconsidered. Type II HAE shows decreased C1INH functional levels with normal antigenic C1INH levels, C1INH function should be measured with a chromogenic assay, and clinically type I and type II HAE cannot be distinguished; approximately 15% of patients with HAE have type II HAE. If the C1INH antigenic level is low, type I HAE versus acquired C1INH deficiency should be considered; type I HAE usually presents in the first 2 decades of life; 50% of patients begin swelling by age 10 years and often have a positive family history, whereas acquired C1INH deficiency generally presents in middle-aged or older subjects without a strong family history, and when the history is unclear, the C1q level can be obtained because it is typically low in acquired C1INH deficiency but normal in type I HAE. The other 85% of patients with HAE have type I HAE, acquired C1INH deficiency is not associated with a positive family history, and all middle-aged or older patients with isolated recurrent angioedema should have the possibility of an acquired C1INH deficiency considered; if not C1INH deficiency, consider idiopathic angioedema, which is encountered much more frequently than C1INH deficiency syndromes.

Angioedema triage by urticaria phenotype — when to evaluate for C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency: The pattern of swelling, particularly whether angioedema occurs with or without urticaria, is diagnostically important, urticaria is not a feature of HAE, patients with recurrent angioedema without coexisting urticaria merit evaluation for C1INH deficiency, and most cases of recurrent angioedema with concomitant urticaria or pruritis are responsive to antihistamines, are histamine mediated, and are best considered within the spectrum of chronic urticaria, with episodes lacking a consistent temporal association possibly considered a separate condition.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria: the devil's itch [^112mTAGF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is defined as the presence of urticaria for a period exceeding 6 weeks, assuming symptoms for most days of the week. It is divided into chronic inducible urticarias and chronic spontaneous urticaria, previously termed chronic idiopathic urticaria. The latter designation emphasizes that patients can experience urticaria independent of any exogenous stimulus even if one can define circumstances that may worsen symptoms. A search for such an external "cause" is fruitless because the underlying abnormality is "intrinsic", whether it is autoimmune, or some unknown process. Approximately 40% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria report accompanying episodes of angioedema, whereas 10% have angioedema as their primary manifestation. In most cases, it is a self-limiting disorder, persisting for 2 to 5 years in most cases, although 20% of patients suffer for more than 5 years. The treatment that has evolved is largely empiric, based on double-blind, placebo-controlled studies whenever possible, but is not yet targeted to any particular pathogenic mechanism. In this article, we review the current status regarding pathogenesis, discuss the diagnostic workup, and update the approach to treatment including consideration of published guidelines, our own experience, and guideline updates that are being prepared.

### Differences and similarities in the mechanisms and clinical expression of bradykinin-mediated vs. mast cell-mediated angioedema [^116VNMHs]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions, Open Questions and the Need for Further Studies

Here, we reviewed the similarities and differences of the mechanisms and clinical expression of BK-AE and MCM-AE. Knowledge of these differences, together with differences in laboratory markers, which are reviewed elsewhere, can help to reduce the rates of misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis.

We are still lacking information on some important features and characteristics of AE, both for MCM-AE, BK-AE. Little is known, for example, about the histological features of BK-AE, the kinetics of cellular infiltration, and the cellular composition of the infiltrate. Other features are well characterized for both types of AE but are difficult to compare, based on the available information. Studies are available on MCM-AE and BK-AE and its association with other comorbidities, burden of disease, impact on sleep, and social, mental, and sexual health. More studies are required to compare these entities, controlling patients for age, gender, genetic background, and other important confounders, by using tools that are suitable for all AE patients such as the angioedema activity score (AAS) or the angioedema control test (AECT)). Ideally, such studies should be performed in a global setting and by professional networks, such as that of angioedema centers of reference and excellence (ACARE).

One of the biggest challenges in AE management in clinical practice is AE of unknown cause, i.e. AE in patients who do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of known MCM-AE or BK-AE types. AE profiling by international guidelines, established AE type-specific biomarkers, may help to guide the diagnostic workup and advance the quality of treatments for affected patients.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^1173m7ES]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children < 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States. The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

Step 7. Consider a Short Course of a Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonist

In the absence of a known pathogenic variant, patients with a reliable positive family history of angioedema are classified as HAE-UNK while those without a family history are classified as INMA. For both, a prompt and durable response to a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist or another approved HAE on-demand treatment (if available) early in an attack is evidence helping to support the diagnosis of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. However, lack of such a response does not necessarily exclude HAE. A short course of a second on-demand HAE medication or a long-term prophylactic treatment such as tranexamic acid may be considered.

Step 8. Screening of Family Members

When a diagnosis of any type of HAE is made, all related family members should be screened by clinical history for HAE, including whether female family members encountered swelling during states of elevated estrogen. Targeted genetic screening should be done on family members, irrespective of whether or not they have experienced angioedema, when HAE-nC1INH with a known pathogenic variant is identified.

Not all physicians will have access to the testing suggested above. In addition, some of the steps in the algorithm can lead to inconclusive results. Therefore, we recommend that patients being considered for a diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH or INMA have a physician experienced in the diagnosis with access to modern testing be involved in the case.

### Global frequency, diagnosis, and treatment of hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor [^112mXA86]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HAE largely focus on HAE-C1INH Types 1 and 2, while recommendations specific to HAE-nC1INH have not been fully developed. This is because of the challenges associated with confirming a diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH, as standardized, validated biochemical diagnostic tests are lacking, and genetic tests for the fraction of cases with known disease-causing mutations are not widely available. The 2021 World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines recommended the following for differential diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH: suspicion of HAE should prompt laboratory testing to assess C1INH function, C1INH protein levels, and C4 levels; and patients who are suspected to have HAE and have normal C1INH levels and function should undergo genetic testing for known mutations underlying HAE-nC1INH. Additionally, these guidelines state that diagnostic procedures (eg, genetic testing) should be used where available and that other options should be considered where recommended procedures are not available. The guidelines note that family history is an important tool for identifying patients with HAE-nC1INH. Unlike HAE-C1INH Types 1 and 2, treatment of HAE-nC1INH has not been established by randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

A recent survey of real-world practice provided estimates of HAE-nC1INH prevalence and described diagnoses and management strategies in the United States leveraging claims data; however, these may not be globally representative. To address this gap, HAE-treating physicians in certified Angioedema Centers of Reference and Excellence (ACAREs)located in multiple countries were surveyed online. The objectives of this study were: (1) to assess the global frequency of HAE-nC1INH; (2) to describe the diagnostic pathway of patients with HAE-nC1INH, such as referral patterns, testing, and time to diagnosis; and (3) to explore current patterns for on-demand and prophylactic treatment of HAE-nC1INH. Additionally, physicians provided insights into the unmet needs regarding management of people with HAE-nC1INH.

Step 3. Exclude Medication-Associated Angioedema

Stop the suspected medication and assess response, which may take 1–2 months or longer depending on the frequency of the episodes.

Step 4. Genetic Screening for Pathogenic Variants

A detailed family history for evidence of recurrent angioedema or a diagnosis of HAE in other family members is essential in all patients with recurrent angioedema. If the patient has a strong family history of angioedema or known relatives with HAE-nC1INH, then consider targeted gene sequencing (see step 6 below).

Step 5. Exclusion of Mast Cell–Mediated Angioedema (AE-MC)

Evaluate for mast cell–mediated angioedema based on clinical symptoms (Table 2) as well as response to mast cell–directed therapy. This must include an adequate trial of daily second-generation H1 antagonist (fourfold times the standard dose assuming lower doses fail to prevent angioedema attacks) for a duration sufficient to clearly determine the treatment effect. When H1 antihistamines fail as a single treatment, daily montelukast is added unless there is a contraindication. If unresponsive to high-dose antihistamines plus montelukast, a course of omalizumab (4–6 months) is warranted. Most cases of AE-MC respond well to omalizumab. Response to any of these medications suggests the diagnosis of mast cell–mediated angioedema. If no response, we strongly recommend seeking assistance of an angioedema expert prior to proceeding with the next steps.

Step 6. If Unresponsive to Step 5, Targeted Gene Sequencing

Targeted sequencing (next-generation sequencing [NGS] or Sanger sequencing), for known HAE pathogenic variants is recommended if accessible. If a pathogenic variant is found, the diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH is established. A novel variant in one of the known genes needs to be considered a variant of unknown significance (VUS) and not a cause of HAE-nC1INH until confirmed by further research. Depending on the availability and cost of sequencing, this step may best be undertaken prior to a course of omalizumab (step 5). If sequencing is not available, the clinician can proceed with step 7.

### Hereditary angioedema: diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^1149KeUP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in, or a dysfunction of, C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, of which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition. Effective management of HAE must consider routine/long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, eg, surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms, but progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated development of treatments, such as C1 inhibitor therapy, or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.

### Angioedema due to bradykinin dysregulation [^1157HdBt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Angioedema is an acute swelling of the deeper layers of the skin or mucosa resulting from a transient increase in vascular permeability. Angioedema can occur in the absence or presence of hives, be hereditary or acquired, and be caused by various potential mediators, including histamine and bradykinin. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema can be difficult to diagnose but is responsible for a disproportionate percentage of the serious morbidity and mortality associated with angioedema. Our understanding of the basic biology of angioedema has dramatically expanded over recent years. The classification of angioedema has correspondently undergone major changes. Optimal management of patients with angioedema requires that an accurate diagnosis be established and that treatment be tailored to the patient's specific form of angioedema. In this article, we review the biology of bradykinin-mediated angioedema as well as the clinical approach to the evaluation of angioedema with a focus on bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Recognizing how the underlying pathophysiology and mechanisms of bradykinin dysregulation contribute to angioedema can help guide the clinical approach to the patient.

For CU, "Skin biopsy can be performed in patients with refractory CU and should be performed when vasculitis is suspected or when other nonurticarial immunologic skin diseases are a consideration", whereas "Routine skin biopsies are not required in most cases of CU".

### Risk factors associated with severe and recurrent angioedema: an epidemic linked to ACE-inhibitors [^116C4eos]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To evaluate the etiology and risk factors for severe manifestation and recurrent episodes of angioedema; to evaluate efficacy of short-term and long-term management strategies for angioedema among a high-risk population.

Study Design

Institutional review board-approved retrospective review of a large, urban population.

Methods

Data from 875 adult patients treated from January 2008 to December 2013 with the diagnosis of angioedema were obtained using the Clinical Looking Glass utility and review of medical records. Demographic and clinicopathologic risk factors were recorded. The major outcomes evaluated were hospital admission, need for airway intervention, and recurrent episodes of angioedema following the first presentation. Initial treatment strategy and follow-up recommendations were also recorded.

Results

The most common cause of angioedema was angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)-induced (496 [56.6%]). Significant risk factors for severe cases of angioedema included older age, Hispanic race, ACEi-induced angioedema type, American Society of Anesthesiologists class III or above, coexistent cardiopulmonary disease, and a positive smoking history. A total of 17.2% of patients experienced recurrent attacks of angioedema; of those patients, 25.9% were still taking an ACEi at subsequent presentation. Risk factors for recurrent episodes included older age, idiopathic angioedema type, and coexistent cardiopulmonary disease. Only 54.1% of patients who experienced ACEi-induced angioedema had electronic medical record documentation of these allergies.

Conclusions

Knowledge of risk factors for severe and recurrent episodes of angioedema and improved education for both healthcare providers and patients, specifically related to ACEi use and allergy documentation, may significantly decrease the burden and morbidity of angioedema among high risk populations.

Diagnostic testing if patient history suggestive of C1‐INH‐HAE, but negative family history

Negative family history does not rule out C1‐INH‐HAE. Clinical suspicion of C1‐INH‐HAE‐like symptoms at any age is an indication for screening regardless of the presence or absence of family history. C1‐INH‐HAE screening includes functional and antigenic C1‐INH levels and C4. If screening is suggestive of C1‐INH‐HAE, a second test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If C1‐INH‐HAE is suggested by testing, then all first‐degree relatives in the ascending line should be screened (including symptom‐free individuals). As with many autosomal dominant disorders, 25% of cases may be a de novo mutation which may then be passed onto future descendants 76. SERPING1 gene sequencing may be helpful to confirm the C1‐INH‐HAE in this setting 64, 66. If screening is negative for C1‐INH deficiency, angioedema with acquired C1‐INH deficiency is also excluded, but HAE with normal C1‐INH function, which is very rare in pediatric patients, is not ruled out (Fig 1 B).

Diagnosis and management of C1‐INH‐HAE are best achieved through comprehensive care clinics (level III evidence).

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^116tceJr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has been recognized for almost 150 years. The newest form of HAE, where C1 inhibitor levels are normal (HAE-nC1INH), was first described in 2000. Over the last two decades, new types of apparent non-mast cell–mediated angioedema with normal quantity and activity of C1INH have been described, in some cases with proven genetic pathogenic variants that co-segregate with angioedema expression within families. Like HAE due to C1INH deficiency, HAE-nC1INH patients are at risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Therefore, proactive management and treatment of HAE-nC1INH patients after an expert physician diagnosis is critically important. The underlying pathophysiology responsible for the angioedema has also been clarified in some of the HAE-nC1INH types. While several clinical guidelines and practice parameters including HAE-nC1INH have been published, we have made substantial progress in our understanding encompassing diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes. HAE International (HAEi) and the US HAE Association (HAEA) convened a symposium of global HAE-nC1INH experts to synthesize our current knowledge in the area. Given the paucity of high-level evidence in HAE-nC1INH, all recommendations are based on expert opinion. This review and expert opinion on the best practice approach to diagnosing and treating HAE-nC1INH will support physicians to better manage patients with HAE-nC1INH.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack characteristics — HAE is characterized by relatively prolonged attacks of angioedema involving the extremities, genitourinary tract, abdomen, face, oropharynx, or larynx (C). Patients typically present with discrete episodes of nonpruritic, nonpitting angioedema at these sites; HAE attacks are usually distinguished from allergic or idiopathic angioedema by their longer duration and lack of response to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. The typical HAE attack tends to progressively worsen for 24 hours and then slowly remit over the following 48 to 72 hours, although attacks can occasionally last longer, particularly if the swelling moves from site to site.

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to patients with acquired angioedema, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to diagnose acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency based on the following features:

- reduced C1 inhibitor function

- activation of complement

- reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1).

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — acute attack management — states that epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE, and neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs provide reliably effective treatment for acute attacks. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating HAE attacks but might acutely exacerbate some attacks, and caution is required; management can involve symptomatic treatment based on the region of swelling. Guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and randomized trials demonstrate efficacy and safety for treatment of attacks with C1INH concentrate, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

### Emergency department management of patients with ACE-inhibitor angioedema [^111aHQyf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are one of the most prescribed medications worldwide. Angioedema is a well-recognized adverse effect of this class of medications, with a reported incidence of ACEI angioedema of up to 1.0%. Of importance to note, ACEI angioedema is a class effect and is not dose dependent. The primary goal of this literature search was to determine the appropriate Emergency Department management of patients with ACEI angioedema.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search from January 1990 to August 2012 and limited to human studies written in English for articles with keywords of ACEI angioedema. Guideline statements and non-systematic reviews were excluded. Studies identified then underwent a structured review from which results could be evaluated.

Results

Five hundred sixty-two papers on ACEI angioedema were screened and 27 appropriate articles were rigorously reviewed in detail and recommendations given.

Conclusion

The literature search did not support any specific treatment protocol with a high level of evidence due to the limited — and limitations of the — available studies.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) inheritance and onset — HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and most patients with HAE have a positive family history of angioedema (A). Each child of an affected patient has a 50% chance of having HAE, and although approximately 75% report an affected parent, the remaining 25% presumably have a de novo mutation. Onset of swelling most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty (C); Fifty percent of patients with HAE begin swelling at less than 10 years of age, although some do not show evidence until their late teens or early adulthood, rare patients never experience angioedema, and some continue to experience HAE attacks throughout their lives.

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to patients with acquired angioedema, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to treat patients with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency similar to patients with HAE, recognizing the following significant differences:

- increased efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents

- decreased efficacy of C1 inhibitor replacement

- the need to treat an underlying condition associated with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency.
