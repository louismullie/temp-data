## Question

After a total knee replacement surgery has been done and chronic pain has been sustained for two years post surgery, can a second surgery be done?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a second surgery can be performed for chronic pain that has persisted for two years after total knee replacement, and under what circumstances it would be appropriate and beneficial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "second surgery" means in this context and whether we are talking about revision arthroplasty versus other procedures. Then, I should verify the prevalence and etiologies of chronic pain after TKA to frame expectations. Next, I will review the diagnostic workup required before any revision is considered. After that, I need to examine the indications, outcomes, and risks of revision surgery by cause, including infection, loosening/instability, and unexplained pain. Finally, I should consider non-surgical options and synthesize a practical decision framework with counseling points and a bottom-line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate procedures. "Second surgery" after TKA could mean revision arthroplasty (one-stage or two-stage), patellar resurfacing or component exchange, arthroscopic lysis of adhesions for stiffness, or denervation procedures. Given the question's context of chronic pain, the most relevant is revision arthroplasty aimed at correcting a mechanical, infectious, or technical cause of pain, though I should keep in mind that some patients are offered neuromodulatory or denervation options when no correctable source is found.

> I need to check the baseline epidemiology to set expectations. Approximately 15–20% of patients report chronic pain after TKA at 3–12 months, and a meaningful fraction remains symptomatic at two years, so persistent pain at 24 months is not rare. Importantly, many cases are multifactorial and not due to a single mechanical fault, which constrains the yield of revision unless a specific cause is identified [^111CaFTd] [^111wyALK] [^117S3gTS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery before a structured diagnostic workup. I should confirm that the standard approach is a comprehensive evaluation: detailed history and exam, review of operative notes and implants, weight-bearing radiographs of the knee and entire limb, and targeted labs including ESR/CRP with aspiration if infection is suspected; advanced imaging such as CT or bone scan may be needed if the diagnosis remains unclear, and revision without a clear diagnosis risks poor results [^117S3gTS] [^116z7fAs].

> Next, I should review the major etiologic categories that are actionable. Mechanical causes include aseptic loosening, malalignment, instability, and patellofemoral problems; infection remains a critical reversible cause; and a substantial minority have persistent pain without a clear structural source, often reflecting central sensitization, neuropathic features, or psychosocial drivers, which respond poorly to purely mechanical revision [^112cSppQ] [^111CaFTd] [^116z7fAs].

> Let me consider infection first because it is a leading and time-sensitive indication for revision. If deep infection is confirmed or strongly suspected, two-stage exchange arthroplasty is the conventional standard, though highly selected patients may be candidates for single-stage revision in specialized centers; success varies by pathogen and host factors, and re-revision risk is nontrivial, so I should double-check that infection has truly been excluded before attributing pain to other causes [^112Wo1bn] [^112j9YjD] [^115jJtbu].

> Now, for aseptic mechanical failure, I should verify that revision can be effective when a specific lesion is identified. Registry and cohort data show that revision for aseptic loosening or instability generally improves pain and function, though outcomes are inferior to primary TKA; conversely, revision for unexplained pain has among the poorest patient-reported outcomes and lowest responder rates, reinforcing the principle that surgery must target a verified problem [^112cSppQ] [^113Mw9TJ].

> Wait, let me verify the risk of repeat revision because that affects counseling. National registry analyses demonstrate that each subsequent revision carries a higher risk of re-revision and shorter implant survival, with approximately 20% of revisions requiring another revision within 5–13 years. This risk escalates with younger age and male sex, and the time between revisions shortens with each episode, which should temper enthusiasm for reoperation without a compelling indication [^113ZfLN9].

> I should also review non-surgical options because not all persistent pain has a surgical solution. Multidisciplinary programs that combine exercise-based rehabilitation with pain neuroscience education can help a subset, though a recent randomized trial found no superiority of adding neuromuscular exercise to education alone; nonetheless, about one-third of participants improved meaningfully, suggesting that a trial of structured rehabilitation and pain management is reasonable before committing to revision, especially when no clear mechanical cause is found [^114idGPj].

> But wait, what if the pain is neuropathic or reflects complex regional pain syndrome features. I need to ensure we screen for neuropathic pain and central sensitization using validated tools, because such phenotypes predict poorer response to mechanical revision; in carefully selected refractory cases, targeted neuromodulatory interventions may be considered, though evidence is limited and patient selection is key [^116z7fAs] [^113WngBz].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework and sanity-check it against the evidence. Yes, a second surgery can be done two years after TKA, but it should be reserved for patients with a confirmed, revision-amenable diagnosis such as infection, aseptic loosening, instability, or malalignment, after a thorough, guideline-concordant workup; conversely, revision for unexplained pain should generally be avoided given markedly inferior outcomes and the escalating cascade of re-revisions, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^117S3gTS] [^112cSppQ] [^113ZfLN9].

> I should double-check that my counseling aligns with outcomes data. Patients must be informed that revision surgery, while sometimes necessary and beneficial for the right indication, carries higher complication rates, lower improvement in pain and function compared with primary TKA, and a meaningful risk of needing additional surgeries. Shared decision-making should explicitly weigh these trade-offs, especially when the pain etiology is uncertain [^112cSppQ] [^113Mw9TJ].

> Bottom line, after verifying the diagnostic pathway and indications: yes, a second surgery can be performed for chronic pain two years after TKA, but it should be an evidence-based, diagnosis-driven revision targeting a specific problem such as infection, loosening, instability, or malalignment. If no correctable source is identified, revision is unlikely to help and non-surgical pain management should be prioritized, with careful counseling about the limited and riskier role of surgery in unexplained persistent pain [^117S3gTS] [^112cSppQ] [^114idGPj].

A second surgery can be performed for persistent pain 2 years after total knee replacement, but only after a thorough evaluation to identify a **treatable cause** [^111CaFTd] (infection, loosening, malalignment, instability, or neuropathic pain). Revision surgery is indicated when a specific cause is found, but outcomes are **generally poorer than primary TKA** [^113Mw9TJ] and risks include infection, instability, and persistent pain [^114EWLqS]. If no clear cause is identified, **non-surgical management** [^115mG9YU] (multimodal pain therapy, neuromodulation, psychological support) should be prioritized. Shared decision-making is essential to balance potential benefits and risks [^113UcEpD].

## Indications for second surgery after TKA

Revision surgery is considered only when a **specific cause of pain** is identified [^117S3gTS]:

- **Infection**: Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a leading cause of revision [^112Wo1bn].

- **Aseptic loosening**: Implant loosening or failure [^115xaHJY].

- **Malalignment or instability**: Technical errors causing abnormal joint mechanics [^115xaHJY].

- **Neuropathic pain**: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or nerve injury [^116z7fAs].

- **Implant wear or failure**: Polyethylene wear, metallosis, or component fracture [^113868G3].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation before second surgery

A **comprehensive evaluation** is essential to identify the cause of persistent pain:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history, physical examination, and review of surgical records [^117S3gTS].

- **Imaging studies**: X-rays, CT, MRI, or bone scans to assess implant position, loosening, or infection [^117S3gTS].

- **Laboratory tests**: ESR, CRP, and synovial fluid analysis to rule out infection [^117S3gTS].

- **Pain phenotyping**: Identification of neuropathic pain components [^114fxYZC].

---

## Surgical options for second surgery

Several **surgical options** exist, depending on the identified cause:

| **Surgical option** | **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Revision TKA | - Infection <br/> - Loosening <br/> - Malalignment <br/> - Instability | Removal and replacement of components; may be one-stage or two-stage [^112Wo1bn] [^115xaHJY] |
| Explantation with spacer | Infection | Two-stage revision with antibiotic spacer [^115jJtbu] |
| Neuromodulation | Neuropathic pain | Spinal cord stimulation or peripheral nerve stimulation [^116z7fAs] |
| Arthroscopic debridement | Soft tissue impingement or synovitis | Minimally invasive removal of inflamed tissue |

---

## Outcomes and risks of second surgery

Revision surgery can improve pain and function, but outcomes are **generally inferior to primary TKA** [^113Mw9TJ]. Risks include infection, instability, persistent pain, and a higher likelihood of additional revisions [^113ZfLN9].

---

## Non-surgical alternatives

If no clear cause is identified, **non-surgical management** is recommended:

- **Multimodal pain management**: Medications, physical therapy, and psychological support [^116z7fAs].

- **Neuromodulation**: Spinal cord stimulation or peripheral nerve stimulation [^116z7fAs].

- **Pain education and coping strategies**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based interventions [^115xe51Z].

---

## Patient selection and timing

Patient selection and timing are critical. Younger patients, those with identifiable causes of pain, and individuals with good overall health are **better candidates** for revision surgery. Surgery is typically considered after **6–12 months** of conservative management.

---

## Conclusion

A second surgery can be performed for persistent pain 2 years after TKA, but only after a thorough evaluation identifies a **treatable cause** [^117S3gTS]. Revision surgery carries **higher risks and poorer outcomes** than primary TKA, so careful patient selection and shared decision-making are essential [^114EWLqS]. If no clear cause is found, non-surgical management should be prioritized [^117S3gTS].

### Effectiveness of later-stage exercise programs vs usual medical care on physical function and activity after total knee replacement: a randomized clinical trial [^114qRDYt]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Total knee replacements (TKRs) are highly prevalent, with more than 4 million US adults living with a TKR, and by 2030 greater than 3 million are projected annually. Although TKRs are successful at reducing pain and improving quality of life, many of the long-term mobility limitations due to the chronic joint disease that existed for decades before surgery do not spontaneously resolve after TKR. Exercise therapy is a simple solution for alleviating these persistent mobility limitations and enhancing TKR outcomes.

Current rehabilitation care in TKR typically consists of discharge from supervised exercise within 2 to 3 months after surgery. However, during these first few months (early stage), patients after TKR are still healing from the surgical insult, and exercises cannot be performed with sufficient intensity to reduce the mobility limitations. To succeed in reversing long-lasting mobility limitations, exercise programs should specifically address mobility deficits germane to patients after TKR and be sufficiently dosed (ie, duration, frequency, and intensity) to promote adaptive responses, which may not be tolerated by most patients until the later stage of rehabilitation (> 2 months) after TKR.

Clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conclude that there is limited evidence to recommend supervised exercise during later-stage rehabilitation after TKR and called for additional research. We designed a study to inform patients and clinicians about the benefits of exercise programs for the later stage after TKR and to provide evidence to tailor interventions according to patient characteristics. The study compared the outcomes of physical function, activity, and safety and explored heterogeneity of treatment effects.

DISCUSSION

The present study examined characteristics of people reporting pain 10 to 13 weeks after TKR. We used the validated OKS questionnaire pain component threshold to identify patients with pain in the first 3 months after TKR. Using this standardized pain definition, 30% of patients reported pain in their replaced knee 10 weeks after surgery. Of the 553 patients who completed a second OKS questionnaire by telephone (12 weeks after TKR), 30% reported an improvement in their OKS pain score from the 10‐week measurement. However, for the majority (70%), the pain was still present at 3 months. Applying the OKS pain threshold allowed an in‐depth evaluation of the characteristics of patients with pain 3 months after TKR. We found that more than half of the patients reported pain with neuropathic characteristics, one‐fourth of the patients reported probable depression or anxiety, and 17% reporting both depression and anxiety. Despite still having problems with pain, three‐fourths of these patients were satisfied with their TKR outcome. Patients with more severe knee pain at 3 months were likely to have poorer general health, poorer physical health, higher pain worry (measured as pain catastrophizing), and lower satisfaction with the outcome of surgery. Patients with greater functional limitations were more likely to have higher levels of depression, higher pain worry, lower satisfaction with the outcome of surgery, and higher levels of acceptance of the pain's insolubility.

Previously, the lack of a robust approach to screening has been a barrier to the implementation of new services to improve care for patients with pain after TKR. Our study demonstrated that early screening using the OKS questionnaire definition of chronic pain as a standardized approach to identify patients with pain is achievable. In our large multicenter trial, one‐third of patients met our definition of pain at 10 weeks; this is not unexpected, as TKR has a long recovery period and individual patients' recovery trajectories vary. One‐third of patients with pain at 10 weeks had improved by 12 weeks, demonstrating that patients can experience rapid recovery during this early postoperative period. However, 70% of responding patients with pain at 10 weeks still had pain at 12 weeks, and for some, this pain is likely to persist for the long term. Early screening to identify patients with pain at 3 months could facilitate targeted care delivery (e.g. through transitional pain clinics) to prevent the transition of acute pain to chronic pain.

### Rest pain and movement-evoked pain as unique constructs in hip and knee replacements [^112Ej77b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee is characterized by pain and reduced mobility. In 2012, 76,448 total hip replacements (THRs) and 76,497 total knee replacements (TKRs) were performed in England and Wales 1. Joint replacement can be a successful operation for providing pain relief and improving function; however, pain after surgery is common. On the first postoperative day, approximately 50% of patients report moderate or severe pain in their replaced joint 2. In the longer term, 7–23% of THR patients and 10–34% of TKR patients report moderate to severe pain following surgery 3. Chronic postsurgical pain can be distressing 4 and has a considerable socioeconomic cost 5.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

Understanding why and predicting which patients are likely to experience chronic pain following surgery may facilitate the development of effective interventions that reduce chronic pain postsurgery. Previous studies have indicated that there is an association between preoperative pain and long‐term pain in joint replacement following surgery 6, and that severe acute postsurgical pain is associated with chronic postsurgical pain in a wide variety of surgical disciplines 7. However, we are currently unaware of any study that has formally explored the mediating effect of acute postsurgical pain between preoperative pain and chronic long‐term pain following total joint replacement.

Furthermore, within the surgical literature, there is a growing recognition of the importance of distinguishing between pain‐at‐rest and pain‐on‐movement due to differing mechanistic pathways and clinical implications, such as differential effectiveness of pharmacologic therapies and impact on functional recovery 8, 9. It has therefore been argued that the assessment of acute postoperative pain‐on‐movement is more important than assessing pain‐at‐rest because of the potential for interference with postoperative mobilization 10. In the context of OA, pain‐on‐movement is often more severe than pain‐at‐rest 11 and has an earlier onset in the disease course. However, the mediating pathways between preoperative, acute postoperative, and chronic postoperative pain‐at‐rest and pain‐on‐movement remain unclear.

The aim of this analysis was to formally explore and understand the associations between preoperative pain, acute postsurgical pain, and chronic postsurgical pain after THR and TKR, comparing the differences between pain‐at‐rest and pain‐on‐movement.

Outcomes/Revision Surgery

Large database and population-based studies have demonstrated total knee arthroplasty is a safe and common procedure which results in marked improvements in quality of life, pain relief, and function. Factors that have been associated with improved patient outcome scores and implant survival outside of patient modifiable risk factors include age, sex, socioeconomic status and surgeon experience/volume.

However, even when these factors are controlled for, revision total knee arthroplasty surgeries historically have not demonstrated the same degree of improvements subjectively or objectively as their primary counterparts. Despite an almost 9% decrease in patient-reported outcomes with revision TKA compared to primary TKA, good results are still obtainable with modern bone augmentation and fixation techniques.

Bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty vs. staged — workgroup opinion and strength: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) could be performed vs. staged (> 90 days) bilateral TKA in appropriately selected patients but should be performed with caution and should be avoided with patients who are at high risk of cardiopulmonary complications. Quality of evidence is Low and the strength of option is Consensus (downgraded), and in the absence of reliable evidence, the guideline work group is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. This recommendation has been downgraded due to the potential harms to the patient.

### What is the risk of repeat revision when patellofemoral replacement is revised to TKA? An analysis of 482 cases from a large national arthroplasty registry [^114oUzbo]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral replacements (PFRs) have a higher rate of revision than unicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA. However, there is little information regarding why PFRs are revised, the components used for these revisions, or the outcome of the revision procedure. Some contend that PFR is a bridging procedure that can easily be revised to a TKA with similar results as a primary TKA; however, others dispute this suggestion.

Questions/Purposes

(1) In the setting of a large national registry, what were the reasons for revision of PFR to TKA and was the level of TKA constraint used in the revision associated with a subsequent risk of rerevision? (2) Is the risk of revision of the TKA used to revise a PFR greater than the risk of revision after a primary TKA and greater than the risk of rerevision after revision TKA?

Methods

Data were obtained from the Australian Orthopaedic Association Joint Replacement Registry through December 31, 2016, for TKA revision procedures after PFR. Because revisions for infection may be staged procedures resulting in further planned operations, for the revision analyses, these were excluded. There were 3251 PFRs, 482 of which were revised to TKA during the 17-year study period. The risk of second revision was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship for PFRs revised to TKAs, and that risk was compared with the risk of first revision after TKA and also with the risk of a second revision after revision TKA. Hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare second revision rates among the different levels of prosthesis constraint used in the index revision after PFR (specifically, cruciate-retaining versus cruciate-substituting).

Results

The main reasons for revising a PFR to TKA were progression of disease (56%), loosening (17%), and pain (12%). With the numbers available for analysis, there was no difference in the risk of a second revision when a PFR was revised to a cruciate-retaining TKA than when it was revised to a cruciate-substituting TKA (HR, 1.24 [0.65–2.36]; p = 0.512). A total of 204 (42%) of the PFR revisions had the patella component revised when the PFR was converted to a TKA. There difference in rates of second revision when the patella component was revised or not revised (HR, 1.01 [0.55–1.85]; p = 0.964). When we eliminated the devices that ceased to be used before 2005 (older devices), we found no change in the overall risk of repeat revision. The risk of a PFR that was revised to a TKA undergoing a second revision was greater than the risk of TKA undergoing a first revision (HR, 2.39 [1.77–3.24]; p < 0.001), but it was less than the risk of a revision TKA undergoing a second revision (HR, 0.60 [0.43–0.81]; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

The risk of second revision when a PFR is revised is not altered if cruciate-retaining or posterior-stabilized TKA is used for the revision nor if the patella component is revised or not revised. The risk of repeat revision after revision of a PFR to a TKA was much higher than the risk of revision after a primary TKA, and these findings did not change when we analyzed only devices in use since 2005. When PFR is used for the management of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis, patients should be counselled not only about the high revision rate of the primary procedure, but also the revision rate after TKA. Further studies regarding the functional outcomes of these procedures may help clarify the value of PFRs and subsequent revisions.

### Resuming elective hip and knee arthroplasty after the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: the European Hip Society and European knee associates recommendations [^113868G3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

ESSKA guidelines advise giving priority treatment to younger patients (< 60), requiring fewer than 3 days of hospitalisation and delaying elective surgery for patients with co-morbidities.
3 What are the priority indications for elective adult hip and knee reconstruction? Statement There is universal agreement regarding the indications for urgent hip and knee arthroplasty procedures, such as femoral neck fractures, periprosthetic fractures, dislocations and acute infection, even in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, priority indications for non-emergency procedures in primary and revision hip and knee arthroplasty are lacking and should be clarified.

EHS and EKA priority indications for elective adult hip and knee arthroplasty:
Acute fractures requiring hip and knee arthroplasty (periprosthetic fractures, THA/hemi-arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures)
First-stage explantations for acute PJI (periprosthetic joint infection)
Amputation in cases of failed arthroplasty
One-stage revision for acute PJI
Revision surgery required for massively failed arthroplasty: imminent fracture, massive osteolysis at risk of implant migration, implant breakage, pending fractures because of osteolysis or instability, severe adverse reaction to metal debris (ALTR or ARMD)
Osteonecrosis with joint collapse, avascular head necrosis (AVN)
Patient with severe articular deformity and/or instability
First-stage explantations for chronic PJI
One-stage revision for chronic PJI
Patient with severe arthritic condition and/or pain forced to stop working (rapid progressive osteoarthritis)
Total joint arthroplasty reconstruction after bone sarcoma resection
Second stage for treatment of an infected joint arthroplasty
Conversion from osteosynthesis to total joint arthroplasty
Operations required because prolonged delay could prevent the appropriate surgery from being performed adequately
Patient with severe functional impairment compromising autonomy and ability to walk
Patient with inability to walk and requiring important technical aid (wheelchair, home care, human assistance)
Patient with chronic severe arthritic pain requiring opioid use

### Outcome of a second two-stage reimplantation for periprosthetic knee infection [^112j9YjD]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Recurrent or persistent infection after two-stage exchange arthroplasty for previously infected total knee replacement is a challenging clinical situation. We asked whether a second two-stage procedure could eradicate the infection and preserve knee function. We evaluated 18 selected patients with failed two-stage total knee arthroplasty implantation treated with a second two-stage reimplantation between 1999 and 2005. Failure of treatment was defined as recurrence or persistence of infection. The minimum followup was 24 months (mean, 40 months; range, 24–83 months). Recurrent or persistent infection was diagnosed in four of 18 patients, two of whom were successfully treated with a third two-stage exchange arthroplasty. Knee Society score questionnaires administered at the last followup showed an average Knee Society knee score of 73 points (range, 24–100 points) and an average functional score of 49 points (range, 20–90 points). The data suggest repeat two-stage exchange arthroplasty is a reasonable option for eradicating periprosthetic infection, relieving pain, and achieving a satisfactory level of function for some patients.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^1155VGqG]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Data extraction

A standardized data extraction form was used to extract data from eligible articles and data were entered into a Microsoft Access database. The data extracted included the study objective, study design, setting, country of the first author, number of study participants recruited, timings of assessments, and outcome measures that contained pain items. All screening and data extraction were performed by 1 reviewer with postgraduate qualifications in the field of pain after joint replacement (VW). Because of the large volume of articles that were identified in the literature search, it was impractical to perform duplicate screening and data extraction on all studies; however, we acknowledged that single data extraction is associated with the probability of an increased number of errors. Therefore, blind duplicate screening was performed (AB) on a 10% subsample of the references retrieved (n = 851), which found that the primary reviewer missed 1 eligible article, suggesting that few eligible studies may have been missed. Thereafter, blind duplicate data extraction was performed (KE) on a 5% subsample of full-text articles (n = 63); full agreement was found between the primary and secondary reviewers on the type and content of the outcome measures that assessed pain.

Where data could not be extracted from the full-text article because the article was unobtainable, data were extracted from the abstract. Attempts were made to contact the authors of these studies to verify the accuracy of the extracted data. Data were extracted from 184 abstracts and the research team successfully traced contact details for 84 authors. These authors were e-mailed and asked to complete a validation form or return a copy of the full-text article. Replies were received from 36 authors (14 authors returned a completed validation form and 22 authors provided full-text copies of their article).

### Cost effectiveness of revision total knee arthroplasty [^112q6D2P]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Total knee arthroplasty now exceeds total hip arthroplasty as the most commonly performed joint replacement. Projections suggest the need for revision knee arthroplasty in the future will produce an immense economic burden. The excellent cost effectiveness of primary knee arthroplasty has been well established. This article explores the cost effectiveness of revision knee arthroplasty, and makes a comparison of costs between different international health care systems. While revision knee arthroplasty is more costly, technically difficult, and complicated than primary knee arthroplasty, it is still a cost effective means of improving function, pain relief, and quality of life. The role of national arthroplasty registries will be important in guiding decision making toward reducing the requirements for revision surgery.

### Screening to identify postoperative pain and cross-sectional associations between factors identified in this process with pain and function, three months after total knee replacement [^113TogTn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Design

The data analyzed in the present study are from the Support and Treatment After Joint Replacement (STAR) trial, a multicenter randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of a care pathway for patients with chronic pain at 3 months after TKR. Screening data included in the analyses of the present study were collected before randomization and were analyzed as observational data. Study methods relevant to these analyses were described and reported following the Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidance (see Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at).

Patient and public involvement

This research was conducted in collaboration with the Patient Experience Partnership in Research STAR group, which is a specialized group comprised of 5 patients who have experienced chronic pain after TKR. Through regular group meetings, patient representatives contributed to project design and management.

Participants

Between September 2016 and May 2019, eligible patients were recruited into the STAR trial from 8 NHS orthopedic centers in Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Mansfield, Oswestry, Wrightington, Leicester, and Birmingham. Inclusion criteria included adults who received a primary TKR for osteoarthritis and reported pain in their replaced knee 12 weeks postoperatively. Exclusion criteria included lack of capacity to provide informed consent, previous study participation for the contralateral knee, or participation in another project that interfered with the STAR trial. The STAR trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Southwest–Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee (16/SW/0154) and the Health Research Authority. All participants provided written informed consent in 2 stages: 1) for the screening study only, comprising OKS measurements at 10 and 12 weeks after TKR and 2) for the main STAR trial, comprising a detailed baseline questionnaire at 13 weeks after TKR. Identification of patients with pain after TKR began 10 weeks postoperatively to ensure timely identification of those with pain that persisted 3 months postoperatively. We reported our findings of screening procedures and the cross‐sectional analysis of associations with pain and function 13 weeks after TKR surgery.

### Interventions to manage pain catastrophizing following total knee replacement: a systematic review [^115xe51Z]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Fortunately, a recent review found strong evidence that pain catastrophizing is a modifiable characteristic that is responsive to intervention. Results from this review found an overall moderate benefit, but much larger effects on pain catastrophizing in interventions that specifically targeted those with higher pain catastrophizing pre-surgery. In addition, interventions yielding the greatest benefits utilized cognitive behavioral therapy, multimodal treatment and acceptance and commitment therapy. Likewise, a randomized controlled trial in individuals with chronic low back pain succeeded in reducing pain catastrophizing by treatment elements that do not directly target cognitive factors, indicating that increasing physical activity alone may be enough to modify fear-avoidance beliefs. Psychological and functional outcome-based interventions have also been effective at reducing the disability associated with pain catastrophizing.

While TKR generally follows a period of long-term pain, it also represents an acute event from which the individual expects to improve and experience both reduced pain and improved mobility. This differs from the kind of inoperable chronic pain that has been the focus of the reviews completed to date. It may be that pain catastrophizing is more responsive to intervention following surgery versus those who are seeking to cope with chronic pain. However, to date, there has been no systematic review investigating pain catastrophizing in conjunction with TKR. Given the rising incidence of TKR, potential for poor surgical outcomes, and the rates of chronic pain following surgery, there is a critical need to provide effective treatment. Thus, this review has two aims: (1) to systematically review and describe clinical trials that measure pain catastrophizing in TKR patients peri surgically and (2) compare the effect of interventions on pain catastrophizing.

Background

Osteoarthritis is associated with a strong biomechanical component. Persistent pain in the index knee after total knee arthroplasty could lead to pain in the contralateral knee. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether a change in the natural history of pain in the contralateral knee was related to postoperative pain in the index knee.

Methods

Seven hundred and seventy-two patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty with use of the Kinemax prosthesis for the treatment of osteoarthritis comprised the cohort (Kinemax Outcomes Study cohort). Patients were assessed preoperatively and were followed for twenty-four months after surgery with use of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). We collected separate WOMAC pain scores for the index knee and the contralateral knee. Our primary outcome measure was the WOMAC pain score (rescaled to 100, with 100 being the best score) for the contralateral knee at three, twelve, and twenty-four months. We examined whether within-subject changes in the WOMAC pain score for the contralateral knee were predicted by the WOMAC pain score for the index knee at three months with use of linear regression and multilevel models after adjustment for sex, age, country, body mass index, income, and mental well-being.

Results

Improvement in terms of pain was observed in both the index and contralateral knees between baseline and three months. Subsequently, there was a modest deterioration of 3.5 units per year (standard deviation, 9.8 units per year) in the contralateral knee (p < 0.001), which was not predicted by pain in the index knee shortly after surgery (p > 0.6).

Conclusions

Pain in the index knee at three months after total knee arthroplasty did not appear to predict a symptomatic increase in pain in the contralateral knee over two years of follow-up in our cohort. The contralateral knee did not require any additional clinical surveillance over and above the patients' reports on their symptoms.

### Chronic pain diagnosis before total knee arthroplasty leads to higher readmission risk, lower patient-reported outcome measures, and dissatisfaction at one year: an analysis of 13, 894 patients [^115gftN6]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who have chronic pain may experience worse outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), yet its impact on postoperative metrics remains unclear. This study evaluated the prevalence of chronic pain diagnoses and their association with healthcare utilization, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and satisfaction.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 13,894 primary unilateral TKAs performed from 2016 to 2022 at a tertiary center was conducted. Chronic pain diagnoses were identified via International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision (ICD-9) (338.2, 338.4) and 10 th Revision (ICD-10) (G89.2, G89.4) codes. Outcomes were compared using multivariable logistic regression. The PROMs included Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain, Physical Function Shortform (PS), Joint Replacement (JR), and Veterans RAND 12-Item Mental Component Score (VR-12 MCS). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) thresholds were assessed.

Results

Chronic pain was present in 23.4% (3,258 of 13,894) of patients. These patients had higher odds of 90-day readmission (OR [odds ratio] 1.27, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.1 to 1.46; P < 0.001), but were less likely to have a length of stay ≥ two days (OR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.95; P = 0.004). There was no significant association found with non-home discharge (P = 0.301). Patients who had chronic pain had increased odds of failing to reach MCID in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) JR (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.43; P = 0.049) and VR-12 MCS (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.29; P = 0.01). They were also more likely to fail PASS thresholds in KOOS Pain (OR 1.25; P < 0.001), PS (OR 1.22; P < 0.001), and JR (OR 1.28; P < 0.001). Additionally, chronic pain patients had higher odds of dissatisfaction at one year (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.32; P = 0.011).

Conclusion

Chronic pain was independently associated with increased 90-day readmission risk and poorer postoperative outcomes, including failure to reach clinically relevant pain relief, functional improvement, and satisfaction. These findings highlight the need for targeted preoperative optimization strategies for chronic pain patients undergoing TKA.

### Association of early postoperative pain trajectories with longer-term pain outcome after primary total knee arthroplasty [^114LXgnV]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Studies to date have not comprehensively examined pain experience after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Discrete patterns of pain in this period might be associated with pain outcomes at 6 to 12 months after TKA.

Objectives

To examine patterns of individual post-TKA pain trajectories and to assess their independent associations with longer-term pain outcome after TKA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study combined data from a national US TKA cohort with ancillary pain severity data at 2 weeks and 8 weeks after the index TKA using a numeric rating scale. All participants received primary, unilateral TKA within the Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement (FORCE-TJR) national network of community sites in 22 states or at the lead site (University of Massachusetts Medical School). Participants had a date of surgery between May 1, 2013, and December 1, 2014. The data analysis was performed between January 13, 2015, and July 5, 2016.

Exposures

Pain trajectories in the postoperative period (8 weeks).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Index knee pain at 6 months after TKA using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain scale. Group-based trajectory methods examined the presence of pain trajectories in the postoperative period (8 weeks) and assessed whether trajectories were independently associated with longer-term pain (6 months).

Results

The cohort included 659 patients who underwent primary TKA with complete data at 4 points (preoperative, 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks). Their mean (SD) age was 67.1 (8.0) years, 64.5% (425 of 659) were female, the mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30.77 (5.66), 94.5% (613 of 649) were white, and the mean (SD) preoperative 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical component summary and mental component summary scores were 34.1 (8.2) and 53.8 (11.4), respectively. Two pain trajectory subgroups were identified at 8 weeks after TKA: patients who experienced fast pain relief in the first 8 weeks after TKA (fast pain responders, composing 72.4% [477 of 659] of the sample) and patients who did not (slow pain responders, composing 27.6% [182 of 659] of the sample). After adjusting for patient factors, the pain trajectory at 8 weeks after TKA was independently associated with the mean KOOS pain score at 6 months, with a between-trajectory difference of -11.3 (95% CI, -13.9 to -8.7).

Conclusions and Relevance

The trajectory among slow pain responders at 8 weeks after surgery was independently associated with improved but greater persistent index knee pain at 6 months after TKA compared with that among fast pain responders. Early identification of patients with a trajectory of slow pain response at 8 weeks after TKA may offer an opportunity for interventions in the perioperative period to potentially improve the long-term pain outcomes after TKA.

### The STAR care pathway for patients with pain at 3 months after total knee replacement: a multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial [^115mG9YU]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Approximately 20% of people experience chronic pain after total knee replacement, but effective treatments are not available. We aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new care pathway for chronic pain after total knee replacement.

Methods

We did an unmasked, parallel group, pragmatic, superiority, randomised, controlled trial at eight UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. People with chronic pain at 3 months after total knee replacement surgery were randomly assigned (2:1) to the Support and Treatment After Replacement (STAR) care pathway plus usual care, or to usual care alone. The STAR intervention aimed to identify underlying causes of chronic pain and enable onward referrals for targeted treatment through a 3-month post-surgery assessment with an extended scope practitioner and telephone follow-up over 12 months. Co-primary outcomes were self-reported pain severity and pain interference in the replaced knee, assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain severity and interference scales at 12 months (scored 0–10, best to worst) and analysed on an as-randomised basis. Resource use, collected from electronic hospital records and participants, was valued with UK reference costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated from EQ-5D-5L responses. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN92545361.

Findings

Between Sept 6, 2016, and May 31, 2019, 363 participants were randomly assigned to receive the intervention plus usual care (n = 242) or to receive usual care alone (n = 121). Participants had a median age of 67 years (IQR 61 to 73), 217 (60%) of 363 were female, and 335 (92%) were White. 313 (86%) patients provided follow-up data at 12 months after randomisation (213 assigned to the intervention plus usual care and 100 assigned to usual care alone). At 12 months, the mean between-group difference in the BPI severity score was −0.65 (95% CI −1.17 to −0.13; p = 0.014) and the mean between-group difference in the BPI interference score was −0.68 (−1.29 to −0.08; p = 0.026), both favouring the intervention. From an NHS and personal social services perspective, the intervention was cost-effective (greater improvement with lower cost), with an incremental net monetary benefit of £1256 (95% CI 164 to 2348) at £20 000 per QALY threshold. One adverse reaction of participant distress was reported in the intervention group.

Interpretation

STAR is a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention to improve pain outcomes over 1 year for people with chronic pain at 3 months after total knee replacement surgery.

### Persistent opioid use following total knee arthroplasty: a signal for close surveillance [^1135SNe7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged opioid use following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has not been extensively studied.

Methods

A cohort study of primary TKA for osteoarthritis using an integrated healthcare system and Total Joint Replacement Registry (January 2008-December 2011) was conducted. Opioid use during the first year after TKA was the exposure of interest and cumulative daily oral morphine equivalent (OME) amounts were calculated. Total postsurgical OME per 90-day exposure periods were categorized into quartiles. The end point was aseptic revision surgery. Survival analyses were conducted and hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for age, gender, prior analgesic use, opioid-related comorbidities, and chronic pain diagnoses.

Results

A total of 24,105 patients were studied. After the initial 90-day postoperative period, 41.5% (N = 9914) continued to use opioids. Also, 155 (0.6%) revisions occurred within 1 year and 377 (1.6%) within 5 years. Compared to patients not taking any opioids, patients using medium-low to high OME after the initial 90-day period had a higher adjusted risk of 1-year revision, ranging from HR = 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.3–4.5) to HR = 33 (95% confidence interval, 10–110) depending on the OME and time period.

Conclusion

Patients who require opioids beyond 90 days after TKA warrant close follow-up.

### How long does a knee replacement last? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports with more than 15 years of follow-up [^114EWLqS]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common and potentially debilitating condition. The mainstay of treatment for end-stage disease is knee replacement, and this procedure has been shown to be effective in most cases. Depending upon the extent of disease, replacement surgery can take the form of total knee replacement (TKR), unicondylar knee replacement (UKR), or patellofemoral replacement (PFR). In TKR, all the articular surfaces of the tibiofemoral joint are replaced (with or without the articulating surface of the patella). UKR and PFR are suitable for disease confined to one compartment and only that compartment is replaced. TKR, UKR, and PFR are now some of the most common surgical procedures worldwide with a marked secular increase.

The aim of knee replacement surgery is the long-term relief of pain and restoration of function. Unfortunately, knee replacements fail for a variety of reasons, including loosening, infection, persistent pain, and instability, and might require revision within the lifetime of the recipient. Knowing what the long-term failure rates are is important to facilitate resource planning, medicolegal assessment, benchmarking of different implants, and the provision of informed consent to patients. Given enough time, all knee replacements will fail and need to be revised. Revision is expensive, and results in worse outcomes than primary surgery.

The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence set a UK benchmark in 2014, which stated that individual hip replacement components are only recommended if 5% or fewer need revision at 10 years, but no equivalent benchmark exists for knee replacement in either the medium (10 years) or long term.

### Does the preoperative radiographic degree of osteoarthritis correlate to results in primary total knee arthroplasty? [^1137uZvd]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2001). Low credibility.

The preoperative radiographs of 1,888 patients undergoing 2,759 consecutive total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) performed for osteoarthritis (OA) were retrospectively reviewed to test the hypothesis that patients with less severe OA changes experience less pain relief and lower function scores after TKA. Age at surgery averaged 70.6 years, and follow-up averaged 2.5 years. Preoperatively, pain was independent of an arthritis grade, and this likewise was noted at ≥ 3 years after surgery. Patients with severe and mild radiographic changes of OA eventually experienced the same degree of function and pain relief after TKA.

### Total knee arthroplasty: the need for better patient selection [^112zp3SW]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a widely performed surgical intervention designed to relieve pain and restore function in patients with severe knee joint degeneration, most commonly due to osteoarthritis. This procedure involves replacing the damaged knee joint with a prosthetic implant, providing significant improvements in mobility and quality of life. While TKA is beneficial for many, the individuals who stand to gain the most are those with advanced knee arthritis unresponsive to conservative treatments, typically aged 60 and above, experiencing activity-related pain and functional limitations. Identifying patients with the highest potential for positive outcomes is critical to maximizing the benefits of this transformative surgery. Goal of this editorial is to give a critical view on today's common practice of arthroplasty surgery.

### The STAR care pathway for patients with pain at 3 months after total knee replacement: a multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial [^115ZpqN6]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Added value of this study

This study identifies a multifaceted and personalised care pathway for chronic pain after knee replacement that is effective and cost-effective. The Support and Treatment after Replacement (STAR) intervention identifies and assesses patients with ongoing pain at 3 months after total knee replacement and directs them to the most appropriate treatment or management. We found evidence that the STAR intervention is effective in reducing the severity of chronic pain and its interference with daily activities after total knee replacement. The intervention is acceptable to patients and cost-effective. Implementation of this intervention into routine health care could provide relief from early chronic pain after knee replacement.

Implications of all the available evidence

The diverse possible causes of chronic pain require personalised interventions with multiple treatment and management options. The STAR intervention is, to the best of our knowledge, the first clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for chronic pain after knee replacement.

Currently, preoperative identification of individuals at high risk of chronic pain after total knee replacement to allow for targeted, preventive intervention is challenging. Therefore, the postoperative recovery period provides an important window to intervene to prevent pain chronicity. Early identification of individuals with chronic post-surgical pain is an important component of intervention, because addressing pain in a timely manner is likely to reduce the risk of long-term persistence.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and within-trial cost-effectiveness of a novel, personalised, and multifaceted care pathway, incorporating early postoperative assessment and referral for targeted treatment compared to usual care for people with chronic pain after total knee replacement.

### Divergent roles of immune cells and their mediators in pain [^115pFmRM]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain-related problems are the main reason for physician consultations. Chronic pain affects > 20% of the population. Current therapies to relieve pain (e.g. NSAIDs, opioids) often fail or produce treatment-limiting side effects. Different causalities may be at the root of chronic pain development. Inflammation causes inflammatory pain (e.g. RA, IBD), while nerve injury as a consequence of an operation or trauma, metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetic mellitus) or auto-immune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis) may cause neuropathic pain. Moreover, cancer itself or its treatment (chemotherapy) may result in painful neuropathies.

RA and OA are common causes of chronic pain and combined account for ∼42% of the chronic pain patients in Europe. Although inflammation and damage are closely linked to pain, chronic pain may not be the direct consequence of ongoing inflammation or damage because arthritis pain does not correlate well with the magnitude of inflammation or joint damage. Moreover, in a substantial proportion (ranging from 12 to 70%) of RA patients, pain persists even with minimal disease activity or with sustained remission. Finally, ∼20% of OA patients with total knee replacement surgery report severe or extreme pain 3–4 years after the operation.

### Many patients with persistent pain 1 year after TKA report improvement by 5 to 7 years: a mixed-methods study [^116cYkwZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Participants and Setting

This follow-up study was part of a longitudinal study of pain, symptoms, and health-related quality of life during the first postoperative year in patients who underwent TKA for osteoarthritis in a high-volume joint reconstruction unit. The inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older; the ability to read, write, and understand Norwegian; and patients who were scheduled to undergo primary TKA. Patients were excluded if they underwent unicompartmental or revision surgery. The anesthesia, surgery, and postoperative pain management procedures were standardized, and all patients received the hybrid Profix cruciate-retaining prosthesis (Smith & Nephew) without patellar resurfacing. This follow-up study used purposive sampling to recruit patients from the subgroup comprising 22% (45 of 202) of patients identified in the longitudinal study. They were classified as nonimprovers based on their trajectories of self-reported pain interference with walking scores from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at 12 months postoperatively. Of the total study sample (n = 202), the improvers had a mean score on interference with walking of 5.6 ± 2.2 preoperatively and a score of 1.58 ± 14 at 12 months (interference with walking). The nonimprovers (22% [45 of 202]) had a higher mean score on pain interference with walking preoperatively (6.9 ± 2.0) as well as at 12 months (6.9 ± 1.4), as reported by Lindberg et al. The 31 patients who had the same characteristics as nonimprovers were invited to participate in this follow-up study if they attended their 5-year follow-up at the hospital and lived within a 2-hour drive from the hospital. Eight patients declined or was unable to participate due to illness or death (Fig. 2). The theoretical model of information power was employed to evaluate sample size. According to this model, sufficient information power is generated when a study has a narrow study aim, includes participants who have characteristics that are highly specific for the study aim, and has an interview dialogue that enables the participants to share and describe their specific experiences. Thus, a smaller sample is required. Based on preliminary analyses during the data collection and evaluation of information power, we increased the sample size from 15 to 23 participants to acquire a richer data set. Thirteen women and 10 men accepted the invitation to participate (Fig. 2) and were interviewed.

### Contralateral total knee arthroplasty more than one year apart: Do patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization differ after each surgery? [^115UUw5P]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to evaluate healthcare utilization and patient-reported outcomes between the first and second asynchronous contralateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgeries performed more than one year apart.

Methods

A cohort of 573 patients undergoing contralateral primary TKA (> one year between surgeries) from 2016 to 2021 was analyzed. The PROMs included Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain (KOOS-Pain), Physical Function (KOOS-PS), Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR) scores, as well as Veterans Rand-12 (VR-12) mental component score (MCS). Achievement of Minimum Clinically Important Differences (MCID) and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) was assessed for each outcome score. Healthcare utilization outcomes included discharge disposition (DD), length of stay (LOS), and 90-day readmission rates.

Results

The mean time from 1 st surgery to 2 nd surgery was 609 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 439 to 893). Mean baseline KOOS-Pain (39 versus 44, P < 0.001), PS (52 versus 54, P < 0.001), and JR (42 versus 47, P < 0.001) were significantly lower before the 1 st surgery compared to the 2 nd surgery. The difference in all KOOS domains between baseline and 1-year postoperative score was significantly larger following the 1 st surgery. More patients achieved an MCID for KOOS-PS after the 1 st surgery (89 versus 83%, P = 0.012); however, there was no significant difference in MCID and PASS threshold achievement for the remaining KOOS domains. The achievement of 1-year satisfaction between the first and second surgery (94 versus 92%, P = 0.4) was not significantly different. The length of stay (LOS) was significantly shorter following the 2 nd surgery (1.7 versus 1.4 days, P < 0.001), whereas there was no difference in DD or 90-day readmission between the 1 st and 2 nd TKA surgeries.

Conclusion

In contralateral TKA with over one year of difference between procedures, patients are likely to have a poorer baseline status before the first surgery as well as greater improvement after this procedure. However, meaningful clinical improvements can be expected after both surgeries, and healthcare utilization may be lower following the second surgery.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^113bWT52]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

This review found that the AKSS was overwhelmingly the most commonly used outcome measure to assess chronic pain after TKR. This is true for other interventions, with reviews finding that the AKSS has been one of the tools most commonly reported upon in orthopedic studies. The AKSS includes only a single question on pain with multiple response options; the scale involves a clinician-conducted assessment and calculation of a composite score based on pain, functional ability, and measurements such as range of motion and joint stability. Although it is widely used, the AKSS was not formally validated during its development and subsequent studies assessing its psychometric properties have identified limitations such as a low correlation between items and poor inter- and intraobserver reliability. Furthermore, clinician-administered tools have been widely criticized because of the recognized discordance between the views of patients and clinicians. It is therefore apparent that, despite its extensive use, the AKSS has a limited utility in the assessment of pain-related postoperative outcome. This suggests that continued use of the AKSS represents a conservative approach to outcome assessment in orthopedics, with convention hindering progression. However, our review identified a slight reduction in the use of the AKSS over time accompanied by an increased use of the WOMAC, which may herald a change due to an increased awareness of the importance of assessing outcome from the perspective of the patient. In the UK, this change is reflected in the national patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) initiative, which collects Oxford Hip and Knee Scores on all patients undergoing elective primary lower extremity replacement in the NHS. In the US and other countries, PROMs are increasingly promoted as an appropriate way to collect information about patient outcomes. Future research will be required to explore if this early trend away from clinician-administered tools and toward PROMs continues in orthopedics. Additionally, future research could explore the trends in data collection methods (e.g. postal or online questionnaire versus data collected during clinic appointments) and the cost implications of these different methods.

### Patient-relevant outcomes following first revision total knee arthroplasty, by diagnosis: an analysis of implant survivorship, mortality, serious medical complications, and patient-reported outcome measures utilizing the national joint registry data set [^112cSppQ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to investigate patient-relevant outcomes following first revision total knee arthroplasties (rTKAs) performed for different indications.

Methods

This population-based cohort study utilized data from the United Kingdom National Joint Registry, Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care, National Health Service Patient-Reported Outcome Measures, and the Civil Registrations of Death. Patients undergoing a first rTKA between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2019, were included in our data set. Patient-relevant outcomes included implant survivorship (up to 11 years postoperatively), mortality and serious medical complications (up to 90 days postoperatively), and patient-reported outcome measures (at 6 months postoperatively).

Results

A total of 24,540 first rTKAs were analyzed. The patient population was 54% female and 62% White, with a mean age at the first rTKA of 69 years. At 2 years postoperatively, the cumulative incidence of re-revision surgery ranged from 2.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9% to 3.4%) following rTKA for progressive arthritis to 16.3% (95% CI, 15.2% to 17.4%) following rTKA for infection. The mortality rate at 90 days was highest following rTKA for fracture (3.6% [95% CI, 2.5% to 5.1%]) and for infection (1.8% [95% CI, 1.5% to 2.2%]) but was < 0.5% for other indications. The rate of serious medical complications requiring hospital admission within 90 days was highest for patients treated for fracture (21.8% [95% CI, 17.9% to 26.3%]) or infection (12.5% [95% CI, 11.2% to 13.9%]) and was lowest for those treated for progressive arthritis (4.3% [95% CI, 3.3% to 5.5%]). Patients who underwent rTKA for stiffness or unexplained pain had some of the poorest postoperative joint function (mean Oxford Knee Score, 24 and 25 points, respectively) and had the lowest proportion of responders (48% and 55%, respectively).

Conclusions

This study found large differences in patient-relevant outcomes among different indications for first rTKA. The rate of complications was highest following rTKA for fracture or infection. Although rTKA resulted in large improvements in joint function for most patients, those who underwent surgery for stiffness and unexplained pain had worse outcomes.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^117F9aG6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Given the burden and distress related to chronic pain after TKR, there is a clear need to identify and consider measures that provide an appropriate assessment of pain. The purpose of this study was to undertake a comprehensive and systematic review of contemporary studies to identify measures used to assess chronic pain after TKR. Our review aimed to determine which pain instruments and broader health-related measures incorporating pain items were used in original epidemiologic and experimental research articles published over a 10-year period. Within these articles, we explored geographic and contemporaneous trends in the use of pain-related data collection instruments.

Significance & Innovations

This systematic review identifies that there is wide variation in the methods used for pain assessment after knee replacement.
This systematic review highlights the need to improve consistency and quality in the assessment and reporting of chronic pain after total knee replacement.

### Many patients with persistent pain 1 year after TKA report improvement by 5 to 7 years: a mixed-methods study [^113ohM8r]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 20% of patients report pain 12 months after TKA. No studies have investigated patients' experiences of living with persistent postsurgical pain 5 to 7 years after TKA by combining a qualitative and quantitative methodology.

Question/Purpose

In a mixed-methods study, we explored patients' experiences of living with persistent pain up to 7 years after primary TKA. We asked: In a subgroup analysis of patients who reported persistent pain 1 year after TKA surgery, how do patients live with persistent pain at the 5- to 7-year postoperative timepoint?

Methods

This follow-up study was part of a longitudinal study of pain, symptoms, and health-related quality of life in patients who underwent TKA for osteoarthritis. The present study targeted a subgroup of patients (22% [45 of 202]) identified in the longitudinal study who reported no improvement in pain interference with walking at 12 months after surgery. Inclusion criteria were: all 31 patients in this subgroup who attended their 5-year follow-up at the hospital and lived within a 2-hour drive from the hospital. Eight patients declined or were unable to participate due to illness or death. Hence, the final sample consisted of 23 patients (13 women and 10 men). The participants' mean age at surgery was 66 ± 10 years. There were no differences in sociodemographic baseline data between the 23 included and the 22 excluded participants. A mixed-methods approach was employed, in which the quantitative data were followed up and investigated with qualitative interviews. Instruments used were the Brief Pain Inventory preoperatively, 12 months, and 5 years after surgery, as well as a semistructured interview guide. The individual interviews were conducted at one timepoint 5 to 7 years postsurgery to capture how pain was experienced at that timepoint. The interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Meaning units were identified, condensed, and sorted into subthemes that were interpreted and abstracted into themes, guided by the research question. With a small sample, the quantitative analysis focused on descriptive statistics and nonparametric statistics when comparing demographics of included and nonincluded patients. In addition, two multivariate mixed models for repeated measures were employed to estimate within-patient and between-patient variations as well as to assess the effect of time on the pain outcomes.

Results

Pain with walking decreased from 12 months to 5 years postoperatively (estimated mean score 7 versus 4, difference of means -3 [95% CI -5 to -2]; p < 0.001). Pain with daily activity decreased from 12 months to 5 years postoperatively (estimated mean score 6 versus 3, difference of means -3 [95% CI -4 to -1]; p < 0.001). Pain intensity (average pain) decreased from 12 months to 5 years postoperatively (estimated mean score 5 versus 4, difference of means -1 [95% CI -3 to 0]; p = 0.03). The results are presented as point estimates rounded up to whole numbers. The qualitative data analysis yielded three themes: persistent limitations after TKA, regained wellness over time, and complexity in physical challenges. Intermittent pain with certain movements resulted in limitations with some activities in everyday life and seemed to persist beyond 5 years. Multiple painful body sites and presence of comorbidities seemed to interfere with regained wellness over time.

Conclusion

In this subgroup of patients experiencing postsurgical persistent pain 12 months after primary TKA, persistent postsurgical pain still limited certain activities for the participants, although pain seemed to be less influential in their everyday lives after 5 years to 7 years. Clinicians may use these findings to inform and guide patients with delayed improvements in pain into more realistic expectations for recovery, rehabilitation, and strategies for coping with pain and impaired function. However, it is imperative to rule out other reasons for pain in patients reporting pain 12 months and longer after surgery and to be attentive of possible changes in pain over time.

### How long does a knee replacement last? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports with more than 15 years of follow-up [^116Pa3sr]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed a predefined protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018105188) and adhered to PRISMA guidelines. We did one systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and cohort studies reporting survival outcomes of knee replacements and a second meta-analysis of national joint replacement registries with more than 15 years of follow-up.

We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase for case series and cohort studies that reported survival outcomes of knee replacements, published between commencement of each database and July 21, 2018. The search was done through the Ovid SilverPlatter platform and contained keywords relating to knee replacement, survival, and medical subject heading terms (see appendix for details of exact search terms used). Bibliographies of all included articles, as well as review articles, were manually screened for additional citations (JTE). Nine studies were excluded because they were not written in English. Studies were included if they involved patients undergoing any type of knee replacement (TKR, UKR, or PFR) for osteoarthritis or a predominantly unselected patient group (eg, studies that investigated only one or two indications, such as rheumatoid arthritis, were excluded). Survival reports of specific implants with a mean or median follow-up of more than 15 years were required. Articles that reviewed specifically complex primary surgeries or revisions were excluded, because these types of procedures have different survivorship of the implants. Some articles reported survivorship from registry data; we excluded these studies because their inclusion would lead to duplication of data identified from the second data source. Systematic reviews were retrieved, and citations searched, but pooled data from the reviews themselves were not included because their inclusion would result in duplication.

The first national joint replacement registry was founded in Sweden in 1975; at the time of writing, six registries have more than 15 years of potential follow-up for knee replacement (those in Australia, Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden). For the analysis of data from national joint replacement registries, we reviewed websites and the most recent annual reports of national joint replacement registries with 15 years of follow-up at the time of data collection (July 21, 2018) for 15 year or longer survival data on TKR, UKR, or PFR constructs. These national registries collect data on all patients undergoing knee replacements in both public and private hospitals and aim to include all joint replacements in their cohort.

Knee Joint Arthroplasty

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an incredibly popular solution for painful end-stage knee arthritis that has developed significantly over the last 50+ years. As early at the mid-19th century, physicians discussed soft tissue interposition grafting to alleviate knee pain but with little success. The idea of artificial replacement of the tibia and condyles came into focus in the 1950s, likely first attempted by Dr McKeever. The 1970s saw several biomechanical versions of knee replacement including condylar replacement, hinged replacement and resurfacing all with high component failure rates and high rates of infection. Modern implant designs come from further focus on knee kinematics after replacement. Dr Insall proposed adding a cam-post to knee replacement to aid in femoral roll back and allow an increased degree of flexion. Continued improvement of metallurgy, polyethylene wear rates. and kinematic designs have yielded high functioning prosthesis, and currently total knee arthroplasty is among the most performed orthopedic procedure worldwide.

Total knee arthroplasty is a well-described treatment for painful knee arthritis that has failed appropriate conservative therapy. The goal of arthroplasty is to alleviate pain and improve function secondary to pain alleviation. Correction of limb deformity secondary to structural progression of arthritis is also a relative indication for joint replacement surgery. Appropriate conservative therapy can include non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, weight loss, activity modification, bracing, physical therapy, walking aids, and intraarticular injections. Outside of the above indications, age, weight, or other medical cutoffs are debated across the literature. Contraindications include active sepsis, active local joint infection, or a medically unstable patient, while relative contraindications include neuropathic joint, morbid obesity, active smoking, or severe peripheral vascular disease.

### The painful total knee arthroplasty [^117S3gTS]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

There are many causes of residual pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Evaluation and management begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination, followed by radiographic evaluation of the replaced and adjacent joints, as well as previous films of the replaced joint. Further workup includes laboratory analysis, along with a synovial fluid aspirate to evaluate the white blood cell count with differential as well as culture. Advanced imaging modalities may be beneficial when the diagnosis remains unclear. Revision surgery is not advisable without a clear diagnosis, as it may be associated with poor results.

### Screening to identify postoperative pain and cross-sectional associations between factors identified in this process with pain and function, three months after total knee replacement [^11553Cnm]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Recruitment, screening, and participant flow

An overview of participant flow through the study is provided in Figure 1. Screening questionnaires to identify patients with pain after TKR were sent to 5,036 patients who had a TKR at 1 of 8 orthopedic centers. Completed screening questionnaires were returned postoperatively by 3,058 patients (61%) at a mean ± SD of 10 ± 2 weeks. Of these patients, 907 (30%) reported pain in their replaced knee at 10 weeks, of whom 553 (61%) completed a second telephone OKS to confirm pain status at a mean ± SD of 12 ± 2 weeks. The mean ± SD age of the 553 patients who completed a telephone questionnaire was 67.7 ± 8.6 years, with 56% of the patients being female. Those who did not complete a telephone questionnaire at 12 weeks (n = 354) were slightly older, with a mean ± SD age of 69.4 ± 10.4 years, and 62% were female. Patients who completed the 12‐week telephone‐administered OKS questionnaire had a slightly higher mean ± SD OKS score (18.2 ± 5.4) than those who did not complete a telephone OKS questionnaire (17.2 ± 5.7), indicating less pain and better function in responders compared with nonresponders at 12 weeks. A total of 363 of 553 patients (66%) completed a detailed questionnaire at a mean ± SD 13 ± 2 weeks.

### "It's not my knee": understanding ongoing pain and discomfort after total knee replacement through Re-embodiment [^113vjYcK]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Total knee replacement aims to reduce pain and restore function for people with advanced arthritis. Each year the number of knee replacements performed in the UK is approximately 102,000 and in the US 713,000. Total joint replacement has been described as one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, but this idea of success is often based on technical parameters, implant survival, or procedural outcomes such as appearance on a radiograph. Decades of advancement in surgical technique and prosthesis technology have improved recovery outcomes, with fewer complications, greater pain relief, and longer implant survival, but approximately 20% of people still report ongoing pain and dissatisfaction after knee replacement. This proportion is similar across the world, including in the UK, Sweden, and Canada. There is often no obvious procedural or mechanical explanation for poor outcomes and dissatisfaction after joint replacement, and Lape et al suggest that investigating the "embodied experience" of joint replacement, that is, further understanding the relationship between the altered body and the self, may provide further insight into why some people struggle with continued pain and functional limitations.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

This is the first empirical qualitative study to our knowledge to focus on understanding poor outcomes after knee replacement through an embodiment framework.
For people with chronic postsurgical pain after total knee replacement, sensations of pain and discomfort may indicate a lack of effective incorporation of the prosthesis.
We have identified a previously unreported sensation of limb tightness or squeezing, which needs further investigation.
Future research should focus on identifying how best to manage sensations of otherness to modify a person's relationship to the new joint and to achieve full incorporation or re‐embodiment.

Typically, the assessment of patient‐reported outcomes after joint replacement focuses on functional outcome and pain relief as the main determinant of satisfaction. This narrow perspective is compounded by poor definitions of satisfaction after surgery, and there is little research on how and why some patients express dissatisfaction with joint replacement and what they are dissatisfied about. In their study of the meaning of satisfaction after hand surgery, Hudak et al found that some participants spoke about their hand as if it were an object separate from their self ("the hand was useless to me practically"). This finding led the authors to suggest that a person's experience of dissatisfaction (or satisfaction) with treatment outcome was linked to their experience of their own body.

### Is the proportion of patients with "Successful" outcomes after two-stage revision for prosthetic joint infection different when applying the musculoskeletal infection society outcome reporting tool compared with the Delphi-based consensus criteria? [^115jJtbu]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are a variety of criteria for defining successful treatment after two-stage exchange arthroplasty for prosthetic joint infection (PJI). To accurately assess current practices and improve techniques, it is important to first establish reliable, clinically relevant, reproducible criteria for defining persistent infection and "successful" outcomes.

Question/Purpose

Is the proportion of patients considered to have successful management of PJI after two-stage resection arthroplasty smaller using 2019 Musculoskeletal Infection Society Outcome Reporting Tool (MSIS ORT) criteria than when using a Delphi-based criterion?

Methods

Patients were retrospectively identified by Current Procedural Technology codes for resection arthroplasty with placement of an antibiotic spacer for infected THA or TKA between April 1, 2011 and January 1, 2018 at a tertiary academic institution. The initial review identified 180 procedures during this time period. Nine patients had documented transition of care outside the system, 16 did not meet the MSIS criteria for chronic PJI, and 34 patients were excluded for lack of documented 2-year follow-up. The mean follow-up duration of the final cohort of 121 procedures in 120 patients was approximately 3.7 ± 1.7 years. Forty percent (49 of 121) of the procedures were performed on the hip and 60% (72 of 121) were performed on the knee. The mean time from primary THA or TKA to explantation was 4.6 years. The mean age of the patients at the time of explantation was 66 years. The mean time from spacer placement to replantation was 119 days. The final 121 patient records were reviewed by a single reviewer and outcomes were subsequently assigned to "successful" and "unsuccessful" outcomes based on the MSIS ORT and Delphi-based consensus criterion, two previously published and validated multidimensional definition schemes. Chi-squared and t-test analyses were performed to identify differences between "successful" and "unsuccessful" outcomes with respect to patient baseline characteristics using each outcome-reporting criterion.

Results

Overall, the MSIS ORT classified a smaller proportion of patients as having a "successful" treatment outcome after two-stage exchange arthroplasty for PJI than the Delphi-based consensus method did (MSIS: 55% [63 of 114], Delphi: 70% [71 of 102]; relative risk 0.79 [0.65–0.98]; p = 0.03). However, there were no differences when stratified by hips (MSIS: 55% [26 of 47], Delphi: 74% [29 of 39]; relative risk 0.74 [0.54–1.02]; p = 0.07) and knees (MSIS: 55% [37 of 67], Delphi: 67% [42 of 63]; relative risk 0.83 [0.63–1.09]; p = 0.19). Notably, the disease of 16% of the patients (19 of 121) was not classifiable per the Delphi method because these patients never underwent reimplantation.

Conclusion

The present study demonstrated that the MSIS criteria detect fewer instances of "successful" infection management after two-stage resection arthroplasty for PJI than the Delphi method in this cohort. Based on these findings, researchers and surgeons should aim for standardized reporting after intervention for PJI to allow for a better comparison of outcomes across different studies and ultimately allow for improved techniques and approaches to the treatment of PJI.

### Impact of total knee replacement practice: cost effectiveness analysis of data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^116L7dLK]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in pain, structural changes in the bone and joint space, and limitation of motion. Disease onset is gradual and usually begins after the age of 40. Osteoarthritis of the knee has a variable prognosis. Once present, improvement of joint structure is rare when assessed by radiography, but abatement of joint pain and disability occurs frequently. About 12% of adults in the US are affected. The annual rate of total knee replacement in the US has doubled since 2000, especially in those aged 45–64. This disproportionate increase in this practice has been attributed to expansion of eligibility to people with less severe symptoms. The total number of procedures performed each year now exceeds 640 000, at a total annual cost of about $10.2bn (£8.3bn, €9.6bn).

The potential benefit of total knee replacement in patients with knee osteoarthritis should outweigh the associated costs. A recent randomized controlled trial looked at replacement compared with non-surgical management alone in 95 patients and showed large improvements in pain and physical limitations and significant increases in quality of life at 12 months. The trial population predominantly included patients with severe preoperative symptoms, as shown by low mean quality of life utility values at baseline. Many previously published uncontrolled before-after studies showed similarly large effects. In particular, the systematic review by Shan and colleagues described 19 studies that showed substantial improvements from baseline status, both in the intermediate and long term, for disease specific and generic health related quality of life across a broad range of domains. It is estimated, however, that up to a third of recipients of total knee replacement experience chronic pain postoperatively, and the health benefits of the procedure are assumed to be higher in those with poor physical functioning before surgery. This would imply that patients undergoing the procedure because of the recently expanded practice in the US might show less significant improvement in symptoms. Yet, the effectiveness of total knee replacement has been understudied in patients who are representative for the current practice population.

We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) to estimate the effect of total knee replacement according to patients' functional status by looking at longitudinal health outcomes of patients with knee osteoarthritis with heterogeneous symptoms who underwent the procedure compared with those who did not. We subsequently performed a decision modeling study to evaluate the impact of the procedure on lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) while varying its use by level of symptoms.

### The design and methods of genetic studies on acute and chronic postoperative pain in patients after total knee replacement [^115s5g3t]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Total knee replacement (TKR) is the treatment option of choice for the millions of individuals whose osteoarthritis pain can no longer be managed through non-invasive methods. Over 500,000 TKRs are performed annually in the United States. Although most patients report improvement in pain and functioning following TKR, up to 30% report persistent pain that interferes with daily function. However, the reasons for poor outcomes are not clear. To best determine which patients are at risk for pain post TKR, a detailed and comprehensive approach is needed. In this article, we present the methodology of a study designed to identify a set of genetic, proteomic, clinical, demographic, psychosocial, and psychophysical risk factors for severe acute and chronic pain post TKR.

Design

Prospective longitudinal observational study.

Setting

University Hospital System.

Subjects

Patients scheduled for unilateral TKR with a target number of 150.

Methods

Prior to surgery, we collect demographic, psychosocial, and pain data. Biological data, including blood samples for genetic analyses, and serum, urine, and joint fluid for cytokine assessment are collected intraoperatively. Pain assessments as well as medication use are collected during each of the three days postsurgery. Additionally, pain and psychosocial information is collected 6 and 12 months following surgery.

Conclusions

This study, for the first time, captures the information on both genetic and "environmental" risk factors for acute and chronic pain post-TKR and has the potential to lead to the next step-multicenter large-scale studies on predictors and biomarkers of poor TKR outcomes as well as on tailored interventions and personalized medicine approaches for those at risk.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^114LbF4a]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Literature search

We used systematic review methods in accordance with the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology proposal for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies (see Supplementary Appendix A, available in the online version of this article at). MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases were searched for articles published from January 1, 2002 to November 22, 2011. The study design filters were not applied to the search strategies in order to maximize the number of hits obtained. The search strategies were modified for different bibliographic databases. No language restrictions were applied. The search terms included combinations of terms, such as "arthroplasty, replacement, prosthesis, implant, knee, pain, outcomes". Truncation terms and synonyms were used to maximize the efficiency of the search. Full details of the search terms can be found in Supplementary Appendix B (available in the online version of this article at).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Published original research articles reporting data from all study designs were eligible for inclusion if they assessed pain at a minimum of 3 months after primary TKR. Studies were excluded if they were case studies (or if they recruited fewer than 10 participants), conference abstracts, PhD theses, reviews, editorials, or any publication that did not present original primary data. Studies that assessed a mixed cohort of patients (e.g. knee and hip replacement patients) were included in the review and only data relevant to the TKR patients were extracted.

Eligibility screening

All articles identified in the search were imported and stored in EndNote X5 (Thomson Reuters). Abstracts or full-text articles were screened by a member of the research team (VW) to determine if they met the eligibility criteria. The reasons for excluding articles were recorded as free text in EndNote X5.

### Many patients with persistent pain 1 year after TKA report improvement by 5 to 7 years: a mixed-methods study [^113DaqwE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Approximately 20% of patients report pain 12 months after TKA. No studies have investigated patients' experiences of living with persistent postsurgical pain 5 to 7 years after TKA by combining a qualitative and quantitative methodology.

Question/purpose

In a mixed-methods study, we explored patients' experiences of living with persistent pain up to 7 years after primary TKA. We asked: In a subgroup analysis of patients who reported persistent pain 1 year after TKA surgery, how do patients live with persistent pain at the 5- to 7-year postoperative timepoint?

Methods

This follow-up study was part of a longitudinal study of pain, symptoms, and health-related quality of life in patients who underwent TKA for osteoarthritis. The present study targeted a subgroup of patients (22% [45 of 202]) identified in the longitudinal study who reported no improvement in pain interference with walking at 12 months after surgery. Inclusion criteria were: all 31 patients in this subgroup who attended their 5-year follow-up at the hospital and lived within a 2-hour drive from the hospital. Eight patients declined or were unable to participate due to illness or death. Hence, the final sample consisted of 23 patients (13 women and 10 men). The participants' mean age at surgery was 66 ± 10 years. There were no differences in sociodemographic baseline data between the 23 included and the 22 excluded participants. A mixed-methods approach was employed, in which the quantitative data were followed up and investigated with qualitative interviews. Instruments used were the Brief Pain Inventory preoperatively, 12 months, and 5 years after surgery, as well as a semistructured interview guide. The individual interviews were conducted at one timepoint 5 to 7 years postsurgery to capture how pain was experienced at that timepoint. The interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Meaning units were identified, condensed, and sorted into subthemes that were interpreted and abstracted into themes, guided by the research question. With a small sample, the quantitative analysis focused on descriptive statistics and nonparametric statistics when comparing demographics of included and nonincluded patients. In addition, two multivariate mixed models for repeated measures were employed to estimate within‐patient and between‐patient variations as well as to assess the effect of time on the pain outcomes.

Results

Pain with walking decreased from 12 months to 5 years postoperatively (estimated mean score 7 versus 4, difference of means -3 [95% CI -5 to -2]; p < 0.001). Pain with daily activity decreased from 12 months to 5 years postoperatively (estimated mean score 6 versus 3, difference of means -3 [95% CI -4 to -1]; p < 0.001). Pain intensity (average pain) decreased from 12 months to 5 years postoperatively (estimated mean score 5 versus 4, difference of means -1 [95% CI -3 to 0]; p = 0.03). The results are presented as point estimates rounded up to whole numbers. The qualitative data analysis yielded three themes: persistent limitations after TKA, regained wellness over time, and complexity in physical challenges. Intermittent pain with certain movements resulted in limitations with some activities in everyday life and seemed to persist beyond 5 years. Multiple painful body sites and presence of comorbidities seemed to interfere with regained wellness over time.

Conclusion

In this subgroup of patients experiencing postsurgical persistent pain 12 months after primary TKA, persistent postsurgical pain still limited certain activities for the participants, although pain seemed to be less influential in their everyday lives after 5 years to 7 years. Clinicians may use these findings to inform and guide patients with delayed improvements in pain into more realistic expectations for recovery, rehabilitation, and strategies for coping with pain and impaired function. However, it is imperative to rule out other reasons for pain in patients reporting pain 12 months and longer after surgery and to be attentive of possible changes in pain over time.

Incidence

Knee pain is a common reason for patients to present to primary care physicians and pain medicine specialists alike. An estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 55 have constant knee pain, and the most common underlying etiology is osteoarthritis. Knee osteoarthritis is more common in the geriatric population with increasing incidence with age. Up to one in five people over the age of 50 reports severe difficulty with physical function due to knee pain even without a formal diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Extrapolating this to the United States population reveals that up to 21 million Americans are suffering with reduced ability to function due to knee pain.

As we see a rise in the aging population and obesity rates, the incidence and prevalence of knee pain is expected to rise. For the most common culprit of knee pain, knee osteoarthritis, the incidence and prevalence are difficult to accurately define, given knee osteoarthritis can exist radiographically without symptoms or clinically due to symptomatic pathology. The pooled global incidence of knee OA was 203 per 10,000 person-years in individuals aged 20 and over. Not all patients with knee pain suffer from symptomatic osteoarthritis, however. With the rise in access to healthcare and surgery, the incidence of persistent post-surgical knee pain after total knee arthroplasty is also a source of chronic knee pain. Despite good outcomes for most patients who undergo total knee arthroplasties, approximately 20% of the patients experience chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Among the post-arthroplasty population, the incidence of neuropathic post-surgical pain, concerning for CRPS, can be as high as 34%. Ultimately, the rising prevalence of chronic knee pain will present challenges within our healthcare systems as well as economic costs associated with them. These guidelines hope to provide evidenced-based decision support to physicians and other healthcare providers to improve the quality and efficiency of care.

### Persistent pain after knee replacement: do factors associated with pain vary with degree of patient dissatisfaction? [^112MRWPr]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Up to 20% of patients experience long-term pain and dissatisfaction following knee replacement. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with persistent pain following knee replacement and their implications for patient satisfaction.

Design

A case-controlled analysis compared patients with established persistent pain with patients who were pain-free. 2:1 frequency matching for age, gender, time from surgery and prosthesis was performed. 1310 patients were approached and 100 patients with persistent pain and 200 matched pain-free controls were included. Variables assessed included mechanical, biological, psychosocial and generalised factors.

Results

The study found that the degree of dissatisfaction experienced by the patient with persistent pain following knee replacement affected the factors associated with pain. In the most dissatisfied patients, pain was associated with instability in the coronal plane (OR 19.8, 95% CI 3.8–104.0), stiffness (OR 6.4, 95% CI 2.3–18.4) and negative social support (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1–10.0). In patients who were less dissatisfied, pain was associated with patellofemoral problems (OR 10.3, 95% CI 3.6–29.6), elevated BMI (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4–5.7) and reduced local pain thresholds (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.0–9.6). Depression (OR 13.6, 95% CI 1.9–96.6) and presence of proximal tibial tenderness (OR 23.5 95% CI 7.8–70.7) were strongly associated with pain regardless of level of satisfaction.

Conclusions

Patients with persistent pain after knee replacement are dissatisfied. This study identifies factors associated with the worst pain outcomes, which lead to the greatest levels of dissatisfaction. Particular efforts with a holistic multidisciplinary approach should be focused towards these "red flag" factors in order to minimise persistent pain after knee replacement.

### Many patients with persistent pain 1 year after TKA report improvement by 5 to 7 years: a mixed-methods study [^112HEZea]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Comorbidity as a Confounding Factor for Regaining Wellness?

Most patients in our sample had comorbidities and multiple painful body sites, which is known to be associated with higher levels of pain 12 months after TKA. Variation and nuances among our participants may, to some extent, be explained by their medical histories before and after surgery. Several participants reported having pain in other body sites than the knee, which had contributed to physical inactivity. Some of these conditions were successfully treated, while others still had painful conditions that influenced everyday life 5 to 7 years postoperatively. Thus, comorbidity and more painful sites may have interfered with the recovery process after the TKA surgery for these patients.

Posttraumatic arthritis is known to predict worse outcomes after TKA. One participant in our study had secondary osteoarthritis caused by severe knee trauma. In the interview, this patient said they still had pain, but they experienced a decrease in pain after the 12-month follow-up. These participant quantitative data at the 5-year follow-up were missing.

Two patients had pain trajectories that differed from the rest (Fig. 3) and illustrate the complexity of the topic and results. These two are addressed in the limitations of the study.

Implications for Further Research

In line with a recent study, our study indicates improvement beyond 12 months after TKA. We suggest including patient-reported outcome measures at 5 years in national arthroplasty registers, which could facilitate larger studies to increase our understanding of the dynamics of persistent pain in patients who undergo TKA. Patients in our study expressed that comorbidities and painful body sites elsewhere interfered with regained wellness over time and prolonged the recovery period. Interestingly, studies with other designs found that these factors were associated with higher levels of pain at 12 months. Comorbidities and a history of more painful sites as possible risk factors warrant more research and would be an interesting topic for further longitudinal studies. In this study, we conducted individual interviews at one timepoint with each patient. However, conducting interviews at several timepoints could be interesting for further research for comparing qualitative results in pain trajectories over time, enabling patient participation in discussions on changes, and also reduces a possible recall bias in the participants. This study did not explore coping mechanisms. However, some of the patients in this study may have learned to better accommodate their new state either by changing their mental perspective or by adapting to their limitations. Coping mechanisms can be viewed as modifiable risk factors. Understanding coping mechanisms may be helpful when advising other patients with persistent postsurgical pain and when developing and testing interventions to facilitate more helpful coping mechanisms in these patients.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^116vkhsV]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

There are numerous tools available to assess general health and functional outcomes after TKR, but there is no agreement on which tool provides the optimal assessment of pain. A key finding of this review was that, despite a growing interest in investigating the burden, characteristics, and impact of chronic pain after TKR, the assessment of pain has been inconsistent. The gaps in pain assessment involve 3 main areas. First, many studies reporting outcomes after TKR failed to include any assessment of pain; a total of 1,188 articles were excluded from the review because they did not include any assessment of pain beyond 3 months postsurgery. In light of the current evidence about the prevalence of chronic pain after TKR, this is highly problematic. Second, the most commonly used multi-item tools include only a small number of questions about pain; this is because the primary focus of many of these tools is the assessment of function or general health. Although readily available, few studies have used established pain assessment tools such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire or the Chronic Pain Grade to capture the intensity, characteristics, and limitations associated with chronic pain after TKR. These and other pain assessment tools provide comprehensive mapping of pain characteristics, and omission of these tools from studies means that chronic pain after TKR remains poorly quantified and characterized. Third, the pain tools used were predominantly oriented toward assessing pain severity and there was little assessment of other key aspects of pain, such as temporality and quality, as recommended by the IMMPACT. While we acknowledge that 222 (19%) of the articles included in this review predate the release of the IMMPACT guidelines in 2005 and that a similar number published in 2006–2007 may have been designed prior to dissemination of the guidelines, the majority of studies published after 2007 did not assess the pain domains recommended by the IMMPACT. Although the IMMPACT guidelines were developed to provide guidance for the assessment of chronic pain within clinical trials, a comparison of the IMMPACT recommendations with wider clinical and epidemiologic TKR literature highlights that commonly used measurement methods fail to capture the broader postoperative pain experience. Along with understanding the causes of pain, a comprehensive assessment of pain is central to the development and evaluation of interventions and improvements to clinical practice. Most TKR procedures are conducted as a way of managing osteoarthritis (OA), and recent developments in OA pain assessment may signal the start of interest in more comprehensive assessments of pain before and after TKR. For example, the assessment of qualities of OA pain may assist in the identification of pain of a neuropathic nature, which may prove useful in informing future assessments of chronic pain after TKR. In addition, more comprehensive OA pain measures have been developed and are starting to be used (e.g. the measure of Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain).

### Predictive validity and patterns of change over time of the sensitivity to pain traumatization scale: a trajectory analysis of patients seen by the transitional pain service up to two years after surgery [^112UXKJD]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is a common complication, with incidence rates ranging from 10% to 50%. The transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain is complex, with interacting biopsychosocial risk factors across the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. Recently, there has been an increased recognition of psychological factors in CPSP. Given that surgery can expose the patient to traumatic medical procedures and stress, a particular interest is the presence of perioperative post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), one of the diagnostic requirements for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders.

Pain and trauma are frequently comorbid in clinical settings, with rates of PTSD in pain clinics estimated at between 9.5 and 33%. After surgery, probable PTSD diagnosis as identified by self-report is estimated between 15 and 20% after cardiac surgery, breast cancer, and total knee replacement surgery. Furthermore, the impact of PTSS on health-related quality of life may become increasingly important as time elapses post-surgery: in a sample of 47 patients who underwent lateral thoracotomy, Katz et alfound that the PTSS symptom of "emotional numbing" accounted for 4% of the variance in concurrent pain disability scores six months after surgery, and increased to 20% at 12 months after surgery. These results suggest that the relative impact of emotional numbing on quality-of-life indices such as pain disability becomes stronger as time from surgery increases.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^116yBYix]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Single-item questions

Single-item questions were used 333 times in 228 studies to assess chronic pain after TKR. The aspects of pain assessed by the single-item questions on the basis of the framework provided by the IMMPACT are shown in Table 3. Pain severity was the most frequently assessed aspect of pain, with 68% of single-item questions providing a measurement of pain severity. The pain VAS was the most commonly used question format to assess pain severity. Only a small percentage of the single-item tools assessed pain medication use, pain quality, temporal aspects of pain, emotional functioning, or participant ratings of global improvement.

### Comparison of functional outcomes between the first and second knee in staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty with diverse intervals between stages [^114NUBQd]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of the study was to analyze if the length of interval time between stages influenced functional and quality of life outcomes in patients with staged bilateral primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods

This is a retrospective comparative study between 93 patients with an interval between stages of 6–8 months (6-month group), 112 of 12–14 months (1-year group), and 108 of 24–26 months (2-year group). Outcome variables were Knee Society scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities, Short Form, and patient satisfaction.

Results

Overall, the mean follow-up for the first TKA was 8.2 (range, 7–10) years, and for the second TKA, 6.7 (range, 5–10) years. At last follow-up, functional and patient-related outcomes were similar for both knees, regardless of the interval. However, mental score and patient satisfaction were significantly better for the second than for the first TKA in the 2-year group. Age did not correlate significantly with the functional scores but was significantly correlated with the mental score.

Conclusion

The performing staged bilateral TKA with a wide interval between surgeries provided equivalent functional outcomes and quality of life for both knees. Postoperative outcomes were not affected by the length of the time interval between procedures or age. Our results can help the surgeon to inform the patients reliably about what they can expect in the delay of a second knee replaced. Thus, patients could make an informed decision.

### Patient-reported outcomes can Be used to identify patients at risk for total knee arthroplasty revision and potentially individualize postsurgery follow-up [^111Aefoc]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patient-reported outcomes are increasingly used as complementary measures to clinical outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, their prognostic importance has yet to be established. We aimed to determine whether the long-term revision risk in TKA relates to pain and Knee Society Score (KSS) measures at baseline, 1, and 2 years.

Methods

This was a registry-based study of primary TKA procedures at a large tertiary care institution between 1995 and 2010. Patients completed pain and KSS questionnaires both preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years of follow-up. Clinical information including revision outcomes and mortality was collected and recorded by trained registry personnel. Age and gender-adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess the association between pain and KSS measures and revisions and mortality as outcomes.

Results

Both the 1-year and 2-year pain and KSSs were significantly associated with the risk for revisions (P < .0001 for trend). The risk for revision was 50%-100% higher among individuals reporting poor or fair KSS at 1 year. Similarly, ≥ 10 points worsening on the KSS was associated with about 2-fold higher risk for revision (hazard ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–5.47). The predictive power of the 1- and 2-year KSS diminished but persisted for revisions that occurred furthest from the reporting time points. The results with pain scores were similar but stronger than the KSS.

Conclusion

Patient-reported outcomes in TKA have long-term prognostic importance and should be taken into account when planning frequency of aftercare of TKA patients.

### How long do revised and multiply revised knee replacements last? An analysis of the national joint registry [^113ZfLN9]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Knee replacements are common and effective operations but patients that undergo this intervention are at risk of needing subsequent costly and often complex revision surgery with poorer outcomes than primary surgery. The treatment pathway over the life of the patient in terms of risk of revision and re-revision(s) is poorly described. We aim to provide detailed information on the longevity of revision surgery.

Methods

This was a retrospective observational registry-based study of the National Joint Registry. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to determine the cumulative probability of revision and subsequent re-revision(s) following primary knee replacement. Analyses were stratified by age and gender and the influence of time from first to second revision on the risk of further revision was explored.

Findings

There were 33,292 revision knee replacements with a linked primary episode. Revision rates of revision knee replacements were higher in males and younger patients. 19.9% of revisions were revised again within 13 years, 20.7% of second revisions were revised again within 5 years and 20.7% of third revisions were revised again within 3 years. A shorter time between revision episodes was associated with earlier subsequent revision.

Interpretation

Males and younger patients are at higher risk of multiple revisions. Patients who undergo a revision have steadily increasing risk of further revision the more procedures they undergo, and each subsequent revision lasts for approximately half the time of the previous one.

Funding

This study was supported by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston National Health Service Foundation Trust and the University of Bristol.

### Recommendations of the OARSI FDA osteoarthritis devices working group [^113dFZ4r]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis and a major cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain and functional disability. While both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities are recommended in the management of OA, when patients with hip or knee OA do not obtain adequate pain relief and/or functional improvement, joint replacement surgery or other surgical interventions should be considered. Total joint arthroplasties are reliable and cost-effective treatments for patients with significant OA of the hip and knee. Evidence from cohort and observational studies has confirmed substantial improvements in pain relief with cumulative revision rates at 10 years following total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasties (TKA) at 7% and 10%, respectively. Joint replacements have been used in most every synovial joint, although results for joints other than hip and knee replacement have not been as successful. The evolution of new device designs and surgical techniques highlights the need to better understand the risk to benefit ratio for different joint replacements and to identify the appropriate methodology for evaluating the efficacy and optimal outcomes of these new devices, designed to treat OA joints.

### How long does a knee replacement last? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports with more than 15 years of follow-up [^113JNAtR]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The question of how long does a knee replacement last is frequently asked by patients, and to date, we have not had a generalisable answer. The implant itself is fundamental to the survival outcome of surgery and each individual series should be considered as a different patient cohort. We have used individual estimates for each implant to synthesise a single pooled estimate, weighting the estimates according to standard error. This type of analysis, which derives an overall estimate according to how frequently each implant has been used, is unique to our study. The pooled registry data presented here show that 82.3% of TKRs and 69.8% of UKRs last 25 years. Only one case series reported the 25 year survival of UKRs (72.0%, 95% CI 58.0–95.0) and no TKR series provided 25 year results. Case series at 20 years of follow-up suggest better survival of TKR and UKR than comparable registry data. Although survival of a knee replacement prosthesis is important, it is not the only measure of success. One in five patients who undergo TKR for osteoarthritis reports an unfavourable pain outcome after surgery, and given our results, not all these patients seem to undergo revision surgery. The age of the patients in our study is similar to that reported by the largest national registries, such as the National Joint Registry for England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man (NJR) and the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR), suggesting that our data are likely to be generalisable. The proportion of female patients appears to be higher in the Finnish Arthroplasty Register than in the Australian registry or the pooled results of the case series, and this high proportion might affect the generalisability of the results. Given the secular changes in the sex distribution of patients receiving knee replacements seen in the SKAR, we expect this effect to be small. In the NJR, the median age of patients undergoing knee replacement surgery is 70 years and 57% are women, and similarly the SKAR reports the mean age of patients having knee replacements in 2016 to be 69 years and 57% of patients to be women.

### "It's not my knee": understanding ongoing pain and discomfort after total knee replacement through Re-embodiment [^11671sSw]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Up to 20% of people who undergo total knee replacement surgery have ongoing pain and discomfort. The aim of this study was to understand what role the concepts of embodiment (of both having a body and experiencing the world through one's body) and incorporation (integrating something into one's body) might have in understanding experiences of pain and discomfort after total knee replacement.

Methods

We conducted semistructured interviews with 34 people who had received total knee replacement at either of 2 National Health Service hospitals in the UK, and who had chronic postsurgical pain (n = 34, ages 55–93 years). Data were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically.

Results

Two main themes were identified: 1) when describing chronic postsurgical pain, some participants also described sensations of discomfort, including heaviness, numbness, pressure, and tightness associated with the prosthesis; 2) participants reported a lack of felt connection with and agency over their replaced knee, often describing it as alien or other, and lacked confidence in the knee.

Conclusion

Participants' experiences indicate that some people do not achieve full incorporation of the prosthesis. Our study emphasizes the importance of physicians treating patients as whole people and moving beyond clinical and procedural ideas of success. Our findings suggest that to optimize postoperative outcomes, rehabilitation must focus not only on strengthening the joint and promoting full recovery to tasks but on modifying a person's relationship to the new joint and managing sensations of otherness to achieve full incorporation of the joint or re‐embodiment.

### Two knees or not two knees? Patient costs and outcomes following bilateral and unilateral total knee joint replacement surgery for OA [^112GeyLq]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

This study aims to address medical and non-medical direct costs and health outcomes of bilateral and unilateral total knee replacement from the patients' perspective during the first year post-surgery.

Methods

Osteoarthritis patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee or bilateral total knee replacement (TKR) surgery at three Sydney hospitals were eligible. Patients completed questionnaires pre-operatively to record expenses during the previous three months and health status immediately prior to surgery. Patients then maintained detailed prospective cost diaries and completed SF-36 and WOMAC Index each three months for the first post-operative year.

Results

Pre-operatively, no significant differences in health status were found between patients undergoing unilateral TKR and bilateral TKR. Both unilateral and bilateral TKR patients showed improvements in pain, stiffness and function from pre-surgery to 12 months post-surgery. Patients who had bilateral TKR spent an average of 12.3 days in acute hospital and patients who had unilateral TKR 13.6 days. Totally uncemented prostheses were used in 6% of unilateral replacements and 48% of bilateral replacements. In hospital, patients who had bilateral TKR experienced significantly more complications, mainly thromboembolic, than patients who had unilateral TKR. Regression analysis showed that for every one point increase in the pre-operative SF-36 physical score (i.e. improving physical status) out-of-pocket costs decreased by 94%. Out-of-pocket costs for female patients were 3.3 times greater than for males.

Conclusion

Patients undergoing bilateral TKR and unilateral TKR had a similar length of stay in hospital and similar out-of-pocket expenditures. Bilateral replacement patients reported better physical function and general health with fewer health care visits one year post procedure. Patients requiring bilateral TKR have some additional information to aid their decision making. While their risk of peri-operative complications is higher, they have an excellent chance of good health outcomes at 12 months and are not going to be doubly "out-of-pocket" for the experience.

### Radiofrequency techniques to treat chronic knee pain: a comprehensive review of anatomy, effectiveness, treatment parameters, and patient selection [^115FMMZN]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Knee pain has a lifetime prevalence rate of ~45%, and represents a source of significant disability and reduced quality of life. Risk factors for the development of knee pain include a history of prior injury or surgery, obesity, and advancing age. The most common cause of chronic knee pain is osteoarthritis (OA), which is characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage, with other etiologies including rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, crystal arthropathies, and persistent postsurgical pain.

Available treatments for knee pain vary depending on the etiology and diagnosis, but broadly include physical therapy, oral medications, injections, and surgery. Injections for knee pain consist of several types, and may be directed to the soft tissues of the knee joint or the intra-articular joint space. Intra-articular injections encompass a wide range of medications to include anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, pro-inflammatory prolotherapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) solutions, viscosupplements, and stem cell preparations.–All intra-articular injections require the presence of an intact joint, and are therefore not applicable following total arthroplasty. Knee surgery is similarly heterogeneous and ranges from minimally invasive arthroscopic procedures to open partial or total arthroplasties. Pain due to severe OA is not reliably responsive to conservative therapies, and chronic pain may persist in over 40% of patients who undergo joint replacement, being characterized as severe in 15% of cases.–Delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy to the knee's nerve supply is a relatively new intervention that can be safely done in the presence of an artificial joint, and may offer an alternative to surgery or surgical revision.

### Prevalence of pain 6 months after surgery: a prospective observational study [^114omDVS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This single center clinical study was conducted at the Department of Anaesthesiology at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany. Data presented here are a subset of a larger data set evaluating outcome variables after major surgery (MOPS-study, Mainz Outcome Predictor Study). Ethical approval for this study [Ethical Committee N° 837.519.11 (8061)] was provided on 3rd January 2012 by the Regional Ethics Committee of Rhineland-Palatinate, Mainz, Germany. The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01488617). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. From January 2012 to August 2013 a total of 821 patients undergoing elective surgery were eligible, from whom 644 (78.4%) agreed to participate (dropout reasons see Fig. 1, CONSORT-diagram). Surgical interventions included joint surgery (total knee or hip replacement), back surgery (spinal cord decompression with discectomy or hemilaminectomy), and urological surgery (cystectomy, nephrectomy, radical prostatectomy). Urological surgery was predominantly due to cancer.

Fig. 1
CONSORT-diagram

Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years, were able to read, understand German language and were capable to complete questionnaires.

During preoperative consultation prior to surgery, patients completed a set of questionnaires including socio-demographic and pain variables. Pain intensity was assessed on a numerical rating scale (NRS 0–10 with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain) before surgery, on the second postoperative day, and 6 months after surgery. Pain duration like chronic preoperative pain was defined as pain ≥ 3/10 NRS for at least 6 months. Pain at 6 months after surgery was defined as at least 3/10 on a NRS, corresponding to moderate pain with a potential impact on physical or emotional functioning. Clinical information was collected from medical records and obtained with structured questionnaires and by telephone interviews in the follow-up period at 6 months after surgery.

Future research — long-term cost-effectiveness using both surgical modalities is required, with investigational venues that should account for costs and outcomes of conversion total knee arthroplasty (TKA) after each modality including the incidence of infection, early failure, and patient reported outcomes after the conversion surgery; this is critical given that TKA is the final common pathway after either procedure, and further research is also warranted into the comparative utilization rates of each procedure over the last decade and their respective projected volumes.

### Interventions to manage pain catastrophizing following total knee replacement: a systematic review [^112jAP2T]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to focus on reductions in pain catastrophizing in TKR patients using any type of intervention. Our related aims included: (1) to compare the effect of different interventions on pain catastrophizing and (2) to systematically review and describe clinical trials that measure catastrophizing in TKR patients peri-surgically. Our study included 10 peer-reviewed articles representing 574 subjects who were pre or post TKR. While all included pain catastrophizing as an outcome, only five targeted pain catastrophizing as a primary outcome. This is likely the product of pain catastrophizing mainly being viewed as a process variable that explains the experience of pain, rather than a primary outcome variable. However, all studies did calculate change in pain catastrophizing. Most studies found a moderate effect, indicating that targeting pain catastrophizing is a potentially efficacious strategy to reduce the incidence of chronic pain following TKR. This finding reflects the extant literature that has consistently found pain catastrophizing to be a modifiable characteristic in other surgical populations.

### Screening to identify postoperative pain and cross-sectional associations between factors identified in this process with pain and function, three months after total knee replacement [^114fxYZC]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Detailed study questionnaire at 13 weeks afterfor patients with pain

Participants who gave their consent to the trial completed a third OKS questionnaire as part of a more detailed study questionnaire prior to randomization. If questionnaires were not returned within 1 week, the participant was offered support on the telephone with a researcher.

The outcomes assessed in the questionnaire administered 13 weeks postoperatively reflected the 8 domains of the core outcome set for chronic pain after TKR. Pain severity and pain interference were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (subscale scores range 0–10 [best to worst]). Knee pain and function were measured using the OKS questionnaire.

Pain with neuropathic features was assessed using 2 questionnaires. First, we used the PainDETECT, which can be analyzed as a continuous score (range –1 to 38, with a higher score indicating greater likelihood of neuropathic pain) or categorized into nociceptive pain (range –1 to 12), possible neuropathic pain component (range 13–18), or probable neuropathic pain component (range). Second, the Dolour Neuropathic scale (DN4), with scores ranging from 0–7 (best to worst) and a score of ≥ 3 indicating neuropathic pain characteristics, was used. Single questions evaluated the frequency of pain in the past 24 hours and 4 weeks and how this pain compared to preoperative pain.

### Pain after knee arthroplasty: an unresolved issue [^113FwP6A]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Despite the recent advances in the understanding of pain mechanisms and the introduction of new drugs and new techniques in the postoperative management, pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is still an unresolved issue. It affects the quality of life and rehabilitation of an important percentage of patients undergoing TKA. The aim of this narrative review was to give an overview on pain mechanisms and multimodal pain management.

Methods

A review of all peer-reviewed articles on pain after knee arthroplasty was performed by two reviewers. Recent articles on incisional pain mechanisms were included because of their importance in the understanding of postsurgical pain. Search was performed in Pubmed, Cochrane and Google Scholar data bases.

Results

Postsurgical pain mechanisms are based on both local and systemic inflammatory reactions. Peri-operative pain management starts with the anaesthetic technique and resides on a multimodal analgesia regimen. New concepts, drugs and techniques have shown their efficacy in reducing the severity of acute postoperative pain and the risk of developing chronic pain after TKA.

Conclusion

This narrative review offers a clear overview of pain mechanism after knee arthroplasty and an understanding on how multimodal pain management can reduce the intensity and duration of pain after knee arthroplasty.

### Risk factors and mechanisms for persistent postsurgical pain after total knee replacement (PPP-TKA) [^1117KnHs]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview Osteoarthritis is the single most common cause of disability in mid and late life. About 27 million people in the United States suffer from this incurable process and 10 million have OA of the knee. Total knee replacement is a reliable treatment option for patients disabled by knee OA who have failed non-operative treatment; 58% of these surgeries are performed on patients 65 years or older. Despite the overall success of TKR in most cases, persistent postsurgical pain of the operated knee remains a common and often difficult to treat postoperative outcome affecting 13–20% of all patients at 6 months post-TKR, which amounts to 65, 000–100, 000 patients/year in the USA. Important secondary outcomes of PPP are restricted physical mobility and poor quality of life, especially in older patients.

Recent findings spanning the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods suggest that the development of PPP after TKR is a multi-factorial process, comprised of both neurophysiologic and psychosocial factors. Likely determinates include preoperative thermal pain sensitivity, anxiety, pain catastrophizing; and postoperative area of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia. The proposed project is a single-site, prospective study of 300 OA patients aged 18–85 yrs undergoing primary TKR. The study is designed to identify factors from the pre-, intra- and postoperative phases of TKR that contribute to PPP at 6 months. Specific risk factors were selected because they are potentially modifiable, and therefore may be amenable to intervention. Patients will be assessed from pre-surgery to 6 months post surgery. The proposed multi-factorial and prospective approach to investigating risk factors is a vital next step towards understanding the complex phenomenon of PPP.

These risk factors are preoperative thermal pain sensitivity, pain anxiety and catastrophizing; postoperative area of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia and pain intensity. PPP for this study will be defined as "pain in the operated knee at six months after TKR, with other causes of pain excluded and reported intensity on 0–10 Numerical Response Scale scale of ≥ 4". The study will also evaluate the relationship of PPP incidence with the severity of functional impairment. This is a single-site prospective clinical investigation of 300 consented OA patients undergoing primary, unilateral TKR.

Initial postal screening to identify patients with pain 10 weeks after

Patients who received a primary TKR due to osteoarthritis 8 weeks previously were sent a study information leaflet, consent form, and short initial screening questionnaire, including the OKS and sociodemographic questions. Nonresponders received a single reminder. The OKS is a joint‐specific measure of pain and function consisting of 12 items with 5 ordinal response options for each item. There is evidence of validity and reliability, with the OKS being reported as the best performing site‐specific patient‐reported outcome measure in a psychometric review of 32 measures used in hip and knee replacement surgery. It has an overall score ranging from 0–48 (worst to best). Two subscales can be calculated, including a 5‐item OKS function component (raw score of 0–20) and a 7‐item OKS pain component (raw score of 0–28). Patients with a score of 0–14 on the raw OKS pain component were considered to have pain that was likely to negatively impact health‐related quality of life. It is recommended that the component scores are standardized to a 0–100 scale (worst to best) for analysis.

Second telephone screening to confirm ongoing pain 12 weeks after

All responding patients who reported an OKS pain score of ≤ 14 at 10 weeks were contacted by telephone at 12 weeks and invited to complete a second screening questionnaire that repeated the OKS questionnaire, in order to confirm their pain status. Those still reporting clinically meaningful pain (defined as an OKS pain score of ≤ 14) at 12 weeks were eligible for invitation to enter the trial.

### Prevalence and predictors of chronic pain with two-year follow-up after knee arthroplasty [^111wyALK]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can effectively improve the function of knee and patients' quality of life, with improvement rate reported 85% and 90% respectively. Reduce pain caused by knee joint degeneration is the main appeal of patients undergoing TKA surgery. Many patients state that pain can be relieved within 6 to 12 weeks (3 months) after TKA, however, there is still 8–70% chronic pain occurs after surgery, some of which need to use analgesics after surgery on a long-term basis. Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a persistent pain at least 2 months after the intervention, meanwhile other causes for the pain have been excluded. Chronic pain after TKA is the main predictor of dissatisfaction after TKA, and it is estimated that the annual volume of primary TKA procedures in the US would increase by 401%, from 680,150 in 2014 to 3416,000 by 2040and the annual expenditure on chronic pain in the United States is up to $560 billion to $635 billion. Although the issue of CPSP after TKA has been extensively reported in the literatures, the predictive effects of these independent variables on CPSP have not been studied systematically. Meanwhile, the association of acute-postoperative pain (APSP) with CPSP has also been widely discussed, but the effect observed in studies is inconsistent. Risk factors that have been reported to be associated with CPSP following TKA, include: preoperative pain, preoperative joint function, socio-economic factors, surgical technical factors, acute postoperative pain (within 1–8 days after surgery), postoperative functional level, medical comorbidity, psychological factors (preoperative or postoperative anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing), as well as demographic factors (gender, age, race, obesity).

Post-Surgical Knee Pain (PSKP)

Background: PSKP can be a difficult condition to diagnose, especially in the acute phase, as reports of pain after surgery are to be expected – it is not until several weeks, or even months, into the postoperative period that a practitioner will begin to suspect something is "wrong". Even then, once any complications with the surgery (ie, infection, prosthesis malfunction, fracture, etc) have been ruled out, the usual assumptions are either malingering or drug seeking. For these reasons, PSKP tends to be underdiagnosed and its true incidence is difficult to measure as many patients reporting symptoms of PSKP are simply taken back to the operating room for subsequent surgeries. For example, many patients who undergo arthroscopic knee surgeries for knee OA eventually undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A systematic review reports the overall incidence of TKA after knee arthroscopy is 2.62% and increases to 3.98% when selecting for older patients. The mean and median time from arthroscopy to TKA was 3.4 and 2.0 years, respectively. Annual revision rates of TKA are 0.49%, compared to revision rates of medial unicompartmental arthroscopy (1.07%), lateral unicompartmental arthroscopy (1.13%), and patellofemoral arthroscopy (1.75%). Nearly 20% of the patients experience suboptimal results following TKA, and residual post-TKA pain is a common complaint. Predictors of increased residual post-TKA pain include other pain sites, catastrophizing, and depression.
Etiology: Post-TKA pain can be caused by intrinsic or extrinsic etiologies. Table 8 outlines the possible causes.
Diagnostic criteria: Assessment of residual post-TKA pain includes detailed history, review of surgical reports, and physical exam. Acuity, onset, nature, exacerbating factors can help distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic causes. Physical exam includes visual inspection including joint alignment, palpation, range of motion, patellar tracking and stability in coronal/sagittal planes during range of motion, gait, and exam of the hip and spine. Preoperative and postoperative radiologic images should be reviewed. Obtain weight bearing anterior-posterior, lateral, and merchant views of the knee. Additionally, weightbearing films of the entire leg, hip, and ankle will assess varus or valgus abnormalities. Diagnostic intra-articular local anesthetic injection will support diagnosis of intra-articular source if pain is relieved within a few minutes of injection.
Treatment: Treating knee pain secondary to surgery can be extremely complicate given the fact that it may not be readily apparent what the pain is consequential to. Is it merely postsurgical discomfort that is taking longer than expected to heal, is it the result of a nerve injury (ie, CRPS Type II), a new pathology created by the surgery itself, or something else entirely? An unfortunate confounding factor that negatively impacts these situations is the presence of opioids as these patients will all inevitably be taking due to their having just had a surgical procedure. As such, multimodal analgesia is the optimal perioperative pain control regimen and reduces long-term opioid use with improved patient outcomes. This includes a combination of preemptive analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia, peripheral nerve blockade, patient controlled analgesia, local infiltration analgesia, and oral opioid/non-opioid medications. Yu et al report discontinuing patient-controlled analgesia and femoral nerve blocks from the multimodal regimen and replacing them with liposomal bupivacaine resulted in less overall opioid consumption, with no difference in functional recovery or reported pain control. In patients with centrally sensitized knee pain prior to TKA, duloxetine should be considered to minimize post-TKA pain. For patients with persistent post-TKA pain, physical therapy, range of motion, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are conservative measures that are effective. Interventional therapies to consider include nerve blockade, peripheral nerve neuromodulation, and dorsal root ganglion neuromodulation.

### Prevalence and predictors of chronic pain with two-year follow-up after knee arthroplasty [^115PoZof]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Predictors of Interest and Covariates

(1) Demographic characteristics: age (categorized as ≤ 60, > 60–70, > 70–80, > 80), gender, and BMI was categorized as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 24 kg/m²), overweight (BMI 24.0–27.9 kg/m²), obese 1 (BMI 28–29.9 kg/m²), obese 2 and above (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), according to the standards of the Working Group on Obesity in China.

(2) Preoperative clinical variables: Preoperative clinical variables were extracted from the Hospital Information Manage System. And preoperative diagnosis was categorized as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or combined with knee injury (the injury aggravated knee pain, MRI showed a meniscus tear, knee ligament tear); comorbidities for each patient included the most common disease groups of interest that we hypothesized might potentially be related to CPSP were recorded, including hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. The absolute number of comorbidities was used as a variable, and there was no attempt to qualify the actual contribution to CPSP from each comorbidity for each patient, except for hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and COPD. Additionally, history of contralateral knee arthroplasty was assessed by preoperative routine full-length radiographs of the lower limbs.

(3) Surgery variables: Intraoperative data collected include surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, anesthesia method, operation time, surgery site, estimated intraoperative blood loss, with or without intraoperative blood transfusion, and patient-controlled analgesia after surgery.

(4) Preoperative pain: Evaluation were conducted the day before surgery, and each patient was asked about the average pain intensity over the past week, and a four-descriptor verbal rating scale (VRS) measuring pain intensity was used, with the words none, mild, moderate, and severe.

(5) Acute postsurgical pain: APSP was defined as pain within the first 72 hours postoperatively, and it was assessed by trained clinical nurses at 14:00 every day, using the instrument of VRS. Each patient answered two questions: the average pain-at-rest (sitting or lying) over the last 24 hours, the average pain-on-movement (movement from sitting to standing up, walking, standing or using stair) over the last 24 hours. Finally, the maximum value of the measurement in 3 days was set as an independent variable.

### Interventions to manage pain catastrophizing following total knee replacement: a systematic review [^114AViVB]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Pain catastrophizing was introduced by Albert Ellisand adapted by Aaron Beckto describe a maladaptive cognitive strategy that is associated with the magnification of threat from painful sensations and the anticipation of painand has been found to affect the experience of pain in both healthy individuals and those with chronic pain. Individuals who engage in pain catastrophizing exaggerate the threat of a painful stimulus and perceive a lack of control over the experience that results in excessive fear and avoidance behaviors. These emotional and behavioral responses predict both the response to pain and experience of future pain. While pain catastrophizing has been widely studied with non-surgical chronic back pain, it has received less attention in on-going pain that have a surgical solution, eg, joint replacement procedures. The possibility of a surgical solution would be expected to provide a greater sense of control and an outcome with reduced pain. Thus, it may be that pain catastrophizing has a distinct set of outcomes for pain that has a surgical solution. This study is designed to fill this void and will examine the effect of interventions on pain catastrophizing for patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR).

Long-term changes in the knee can lead to chronic pain and eventually osteoarthritis. A common treatment for knee osteoarthritis is TKR. In 2009, 686,000 TKR procedures were performed in the United States, with this number predicted to increase by 110% by 2025 and by over 400% by 2040. A recent study showed that 58% of patients undergoing total knee replacement experienced a fear of pain associated with the surgical procedure. Additionally, pain catastrophizing pre-surgery is associated with ongoing pain 3 to 6 months post-operatively. As predicted by the fear-avoidance model of pain, it is not surprising that an estimated 20% of patients continue to experience chronic pain after TKR. Modifiable risk factors for chronic pain after TKR include a greater number of preoperative pain sites, greater preoperative pain, lower preoperative function, depression, anxiety, and increased pain catastrophizing.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^112pxkYR]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Total knee replacement (TKR) is one of the most common elective surgical procedures, with 81,979 operations performed in the NHS during 2010. The procedure is performed to provide pain relief and restore physical functioning; it can also improve health-related quality of life and enable some people to return to social, leisure, and sporting activities. Although TKR is successful in providing pain relief for the majority of patients, ∼20% of patients continue to experience chronic pain in their replaced knee. The potential burden of this pain is considerable, particularly given recent evidence suggesting a trebling in rates of TKR surgery within the UK over a 16-year period.

Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is defined as pain that occurs after a surgical procedure and lasts for at least 2 months. However, the International Association for the Study of Pain recognizes that the timeframe in the definition of CPSP may vary according to surgery type. Pain severity generally plateaus at 3 months after TKR and therefore for the purposes of this research, chronic pain after TKR was defined as pain that is present 3 months after surgery.

The expectation of pain relief is a primary reason why patients elect to undergo TKR, and it is crucial that research assesses whether this expectation has been met. For clinical trials investigating efficacy of chronic pain treatments, the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommends that outcome assessment should include domains that reflect the multidimensional nature of pain (pain, physical functioning, emotional functioning, participant ratings of global improvement, symptoms and adverse events, and participant disposition). According to the IMMPACT guidelines, the assessment of pain should encompass pain severity, pain medication usage, pain quality, and the temporal aspects of pain.

Currently, there is no agreement among studies in the literature on which measures should be used to assess chronic pain after TKR. One recent systematic review identified outcome measures used in 53 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TKR and found extensive variation in the tools that were employed. However, this review included only trials published in English over a 7-year period and focused on functional outcome measures rather than pain specifically. The use of many different outcome measures renders comparisons across studies and meta-analyses problematic. An agreement on core outcomes would allow comparative research and facilitate the development of multicenter clinical databanks or repositories.

### Screening to identify postoperative pain and cross-sectional associations between factors identified in this process with pain and function, three months after total knee replacement [^115fnwj8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Primary total knee replacement (TKR) is a common operation, with over 100,000 operations performed in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) in 2019. The main indications for TKR are chronic pain and functional limitations, which are predominately related to osteoarthritis. Although the operation is successful for many, 10–34% of patients experience ongoing pain in the months and years after surgery. Despite its prevalence, knowledge about the onset and postoperative trajectory of chronic pain after TKR is not well understood. The evidence base for treatment and management is sparse, and referrals for assessment and care are inconsistent. There is no preoperative model as yet that can accurately predict who will have chronic pain after surgery. People with chronic pain after TKR can feel abandoned by health care services and struggle to understand ongoing pain.

Significance & Innovations

Our study demonstrated good uptake to early postoperative screening of pain and function after total knee replacement (TKR).
Half of the patients with pain at 3 months after TKR reported neuropathic pain symptoms.
One‐fourth of the patients with pain at 3 months after TKR report depression and/or anxiety.
Multiple factors, such as quality of life, physical and mental health outcomes, and acceptance of pain, are associated with more severe pain and functional limitations after TKR, which highlights the need for multidisciplinary interventions.

The improvement trajectory following TKR is variable; however, most pain relief occurs within the first 3 months postoperatively. Persistent pain at 3 months could be due to slower recovery or an early indication of long‐term chronic pain. Chronic pain is difficult to treat once established and the identification and characterization of pain early in the recovery trajectory could facilitate the delivery of targeted interventions to support recovery and improve long‐term pain outcomes. Hence, there is potential for early identification of these patients to explore whether intervention is warranted.

### Factors associated with a second opioid prescription fill in total knee arthroplasty [^116cq6Z8]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) creates a relatively large degree of nociception, making it a good setting to study variation in pain intensity and pain alleviation. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors associated with a second prescription of opioid medications within 30 days of primary TKA.

Methods

Using an insurance database, we studied 1372 people over a 6-year period with no mental health comorbidities including substance misuse and no comorbid pain illness at the time of TKA. Factors associated with a second prescription of opioid medication within 30 days of TKA were sought among patient demographics and the overall prescription morphine milligram equivalents. Patient and prescription-related risk factors were evaluated utilizing logistic relative risk regression. We reserved a year of data, 222 people, to evaluate the performance of the derived model.

Results

More than half the patients filled a second prescription for opioids within 30 days of TKA. Factors associated with a second prescription of opioid medication within 30 days of TKA included age (P < .01), current smoker (P = 0.01), and the total morphine milligram equivalents of the initial prescription (P < .01). Applied to the 222 people we reserved for validation, the model was 81% sensitive and 14% specific for a second prescription within 30 days, with a positive predictive value of 74%, and a negative predictive value of 20%.

Conclusion

People that are given more opioids tend to request more opioids, but our model had limited diagnostic performance characteristics indicating that we are not accounting for the key factors associated with a second opioid prescription. Future studies might address undiagnosed patient social and mental health opportunities, factors known to associate with pain intensity and satisfaction with pain alleviation.

### The STAR care pathway for patients with pain at 3 months after total knee replacement: a multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial [^1168dmTE]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings indicate that the STAR care pathway is a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for reducing pain severity and interference over a 1-year period for people with pain at 3 months after total knee replacement surgery. The intervention was designed to provide people who have chronic pain after total knee replacement with personalised care through a multifaceted treatment approach. The intervention addresses the need for clear pathways and referral processes to facilitate patients' access to targeted care matched to their individual pain characteristics. This model of care integrates aspects of optimal care for people with chronic pain into a post-surgical orthopaedic context. Our trial contributes to the existing evidence by providing the first robust evaluation of a multifaceted and personalised intervention for individuals with pain at 3 months after total knee replacement.

Strengths of this trial include the pragmatic design and inclusion of multiple hospitals, increasing the relevance and generalisability of the findings. We used a robust and standardised approach for early identification of patients with pain. The demographics of the trial sample, in terms of ethnicity (92% White), median age (67 years), and sex (60% female), broadly reflects the national population of individuals undergoing total knee replacement at the time of the study (95% White, mean age 69 years, 57% female). Our choice of outcomes comprised items from a core outcome set, ensuring that the priorities of patients and health-care professionals are reflected in the findings. The intervention was developed and refined through a comprehensive series of studies and patient involvement activities, and patient adherence to the intervention was high, with 96% of participants in the intervention group attending the STAR clinic. However, 29% of patients attended clinic 4 months or more after surgery, highlighting potential challenges in care delivery within the target timeframes. A limitation of our study was that the postal screening process might have missed people with pain, as nearly half of patients did not return the screening questionnaire. Given the pragmatic nature of trial processes, this reflects the likely uptake of the intervention if implemented into routine care. Another potential weakness of the trial was that it was not possible to mask participants to treatment allocation due to the nature of the intervention, which could potentially have contributed to an overestimation of the treatment effect. There were missing outcome data, but our sensitivity analyses involving the use of multiple imputation indicated that these missing data did not substantially affect the results. Missing questionnaire data were also an issue for the cost-effectiveness analysis, which meant it was not appropriate to conduct a complete case analysis. However, the main cost driver was related to hospital admissions, for which we had 93% complete data.

### Screening to identify postoperative pain and cross-sectional associations between factors identified in this process with pain and function, three months after total knee replacement [^113WngBz]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of neuropathic pain after TKR and other types of surgery differs in the literature, likely due to variation in definition and measurement. This warrants further research and suggests a potential role for routine screening and treatment of neuropathic pain after TKR. A systematic review by Finnerup et al has identified inadequate response to pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain, which relates to modest efficacy, high placebo rates, and poor phenotyping. Further work could examine the development of targeted interventions including nonpharmacologic treatments. For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence currently recommends trials comparing the effectiveness of combination therapy versus monotherapy for neuropathic pain. Another potential target for intervention is depression and anxiety, reported by one‐fourth of participants in our study. Given the known association between mental health and chronic pain, concurrent treatment of both conditions may improve outcomes for patients.

RESULTS

Characteristics of the included studies

A total of 8,486 articles were identified in the study search and screened for eligibility, with 1,164 (13.7%) meeting the selection criteria. The reasons for excluding articles are shown in Figure 1. Of the 1,164 included studies, 775 were cohort studies, 198 were RCTs, and 191 were cross-sectional studies. The duration of postoperative followup ranged from 3 months to 18 years. The number of TKR patients recruited could be determined for 1,149 studies (99%), with a total of 316,247 patients recruited (range 10–13,627 patients). In the 1,164 articles, the outcome measures that assessed pain were used 1,990 times. The studies used a variable number of outcome measures that incorporated pain items (range 1–14), with 658 studies (57%) using 1 measure, 304 (26%) using 2 measures, 138 (12%) using 3 measures, and 64 (5%) using ≥ 4 measures. Multi-item tools containing pain questions were used 1,657 times, and single-item pain tools were used 333 times.

### Exercise and pain neuroscience education for chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty… [^114idGPj]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03886259 End-stage knee osteoarthritis is commonly treated with total knee arthroplasty. 1 In 2018, more than 715 000 TKAs were performed in the US, 2 and the number is expected to rise to 1. 9 million annually by
2030. 3 Most patients undergoing TKA surgery will experience a positive outcome in terms of pain relief and improved functional performance, but 15% to 20% of patients will develop chronic pain after TKA. 4, 5 Chronic pain after TKA is defined as pain present for at least 3 to 6 months following surgery.
6. Studies have evaluated the inclusion of early postoperative exercises to avoid patients developing chronic pain after TKA but have not found this approach effective. 11, 12 However, a combination of exercise and education treatment modalities could induce beneficial treatment effects in patients with chronic pain after TKA, 13 but to our knowledge, this has never been investigated.

To our knowledge, the NEPNEP trial is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating exercise and education for patients with chronic pain after TKA. Our results revealed that neuromuscular exercise and PNE were not superior to PNE alone for the primary outcome KOOS4 in patients with chronic pain after TKA or for any of the secondary outcomes. Studies evaluating the effect of treatments introduced in the early postoperative period32–37 have not considered that patients who undergo TKA often experience spontaneous improvements in pain between 3 and 9 months after surgery. 38 Hence, the observed treatment effects could have been influenced by the natural course of improvement after TKA and are therefore not generalizable to patients with chronic pain more than 1 year after TKA. Our findings contribute insight into the treatment of the patients who do not experience spontaneous improvements postoperatively and still experience chronic pain for at least 1 year after their TKA surgery.

Therefore, the findings could represent fluctuations in pain intensity over time. Long-term follow-up studies have observed that some patients experience pain fluctuations after TKA, whereas other patients' chronic pain remains stable over time.
38. The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that neuromuscular exercises and PNE were not superior to PNE alone for the primary outcome on pain, symptoms, function, and knee-related quality of life or any of the secondary outcomes in participants with chronic pain after TKA. The study demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in approximately one-third of the participants, regardless of intervention group.

### Why knee replacements fail in 2013: patient, surgeon, or implant? [^115xaHJY]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Previous studies of failure mechanisms leading to revision total knee replacement (TKR) performed between 1986 and 2000 determined that many failed early, with a disproportionate amount accounted for by infection and implant-associated factors including wear, loosening and instability. Since then, efforts have been made to improve implant performance and instruct surgeons in best practice. Recently our centre participated in a multi-centre evaluation of 844 revision TKRs from 2010 to 2011. The purpose was to report a detailed analysis of failure mechanisms over time and to see if failure modes have changed over the past 10 to 15 years. Aseptic loosening was the predominant mechanism of failure (31.2%), followed by instability (18.7%), infection (16.2%), polyethylene wear (10.0%), arthrofibrosis (6.9%) and malalignment (6.6%). The mean time to failure was 5.9 years (ten days to 31 years), 35.3% of all revisions occurred at less than two years, and 60.2% in the first five years. With improvements in implant and polyethylene manufacture, polyethylene wear is no longer a leading cause of failure. Early mechanisms of failure are primarily technical errors. In addition to improving implant longevity, industry and surgeons must work together to decrease these technical errors. All reports on failure of TKR contain patients with unexplained pain who not infrequently have unmet expectations. Surgeons must work to achieve realistic patient expectations pre-operatively, and therefore, improve patient satisfaction post-operatively.

### Knee replacement [^112EcHcK]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Knee-replacement surgery is frequently done and highly successful. It relieves pain and improves knee function in people with advanced arthritis of the joint. The most common indication for the procedure is osteoarthritis. We review the epidemiology of and risk factors for knee replacement. Because replacement is increasingly considered for patients younger than 55 years, improved decision making about whether a patient should undergo the procedure is needed. We discuss assessment of surgery outcomes based on data for revision surgery from national joint-replacement registries and on patient-reported outcome measures. Widespread surveillance of existing implants is urgently needed alongside the carefully monitored introduction of new implant designs. Developments for the future are improved delivery of care and training for surgeons and clinical teams. In an increasingly ageing society, the demand for knee-replacement surgery will probably rise further, and we predict future trends. We also emphasise the need for new strategies to treat early-stage osteoarthritis, which will ultimately reduce the demand for joint-replacement surgery.

Arthritis Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for knee osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to total knee arthroplasty (timing), AAHKS/ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to consider performing elective knee arthroplasty without delay rather than delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions in patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe OA and bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability or with a neuropathic joint.

### Successful management of chronic postsurgical pain following total knee replacement [^112qRwxj]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We report reversal of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) along with functional restoration after total knee replacement (TKR) in two patients, using a combination therapy that included ultrasonography-guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) of nerves supplying the knee to provide pain relief, along with dry needling (DN) to relax myofascial triggers/bands that caused painful stiffness and restricted movement of muscles acting across the knee. Both patients showed demonstrable pain relief, as evidenced by changes in pain as assessed on the Numeric Rating Scale (patient 1: 4–9/10 [pre-treatment] to 0–3/10 [6 months post-treatment]; patient 2: 5–9/10 to 0–4/10), Oxford Knee Score (patient 1: 17 to 40; patient 2: 12 to 39), Self-Administered Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs score (patient 1: 16 to 0; patient 2: 18 to 0), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (patient 1: 17 to 2; patient 2: 20 to 2). The selection of the PRF-and-DN combination for treating post-TKR CPSP was based on a new idea that CPSP is a neuromyopathic phenomenon involving both sensory and motor neuropathy. It has evolved from our experience of 8 years. Physiotherapy worked synergistically with DN, optimizing muscle performance and pain relief.

### Less pain reported 5 years after cementless compared to cemented unicompartmental knee replacement: an analysis of pain, neuropathy, and co-morbidity scores [^114GYMnB]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that at 5 years, both cemented and cementless UKR have remarkably low pain levels compared to TKR scores reported in literature. The cementless implant had significantly less pain than the cemented, with most patients experiencing no pain at all and no patients experiencing more than moderate pain. The physiological origin of chronic pain experienced after UKR remains unclear but at least some of the pain may not originate from the knee.

### Comparison of postoperative pain in the first and second knee in staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty: clinical evidence of enhanced pain sensitivity after surgical injury [^116z8QBi]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

Staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may provide an ideal clinical model for the study of central sensitization. In staged TKA, hyperalgesia may be induced as a result of repeated surgical injury possibly via central sensitization, which can decrease functional outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that in staged bilateral TKA, patients would have greater pain in the second operated knee than in the first. Thirty patients undergoing staged bilateral TKA at a 1-week interval were enrolled. Postoperative pain, which was reported on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS; primary outcome) at rest and at maximum knee flexion, and the amount of patient-controlled analgesic (i.v. fentanyl) and rescue analgesic (i.v. ketoprofen; secondary outcomes) administered during the 48 h after the operation, were compared between the first and second TKA. VAS scores at rest and at maximum knee flexion were greater on the second operated knee (P < .001 and P < .01, respectively). The cumulative amounts of patient-controlled analgesic and the rescue analgesic were greater in the second than in the first TKA (P < .001 and P < .05, respectively). Patients undergoing staged bilateral TKA experience greater postoperative pain in the second operated knee than the first. This suggests extension of hyperalgesia beyond the initially injured site to remote regions after surgical injury, in which central sensitization may be involved. Therapeutic approaches to reduce such hyperalgesia induced in the course of staged operations are required.

### The STAR care pathway for patients with pain at 3 months after total knee replacement: a multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial [^111CaFTd]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Primary total knee replacement is a common surgical procedure, with more than 100 000 operations done annually in the UK. The principal aim of surgery is to reduce pain and improve function, which in 97% of patients relates to a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. However, approximately 20% of people report chronic pain after total knee replacement, with chronic pain after surgery defined as pain that occurs or increases in intensity at 3 months or longer after surgery. People with ongoing pain at 3 months after surgery are often disappointed with their outcome and struggle to make sense of their ongoing pain. Despite the high prevalence and impact of chronic pain after total knee replacement, there is little evidence available on how best to treat it.

Chronic pain after total knee replacement is multifactorial, with biological, mechanical, and psychosocial contributing factors. Biological causes can include the sensitising impact of long-term pain from osteoarthritis, development of complex regional pain syndrome, inflammation, infection, and localised nerve injury. Mechanical causes can include prosthesis loosening, malalignment, and instability. Psychological factors, such as pain catastrophising and depression, can also influence outcomes. Although interventions that target each of these factors might be available, they often cannot be accessed through any single, coordinated care pathway. This highlights a need for personalised management approaches that account for these factors. Evaluations of multifaceted interventions tailored to individuals, including those that improve access to existing treatments, are needed. However, no such interventions have yet been evaluated for people with chronic pain after total knee replacement.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

20% of people experience chronic pain after knee replacement surgery. Our previously published systematic reviews did not identify any multifactorial interventions for chronic pain after knee replacement or other surgeries. On Oct 27, 2021, we updated all searches with terms relating to large joint arthroplasty, post-surgical pain, and randomised controlled trials. Systematic reviews and trial registry records were checked. After screening and evaluation by two reviewers, we identified four published randomised evaluations of interventions for chronic pain after knee replacement, and eight further registered studies. No published study was at high risk of bias according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Published studies each evaluated a single intervention component: intra-articular botulinum toxin injection, neurolysis or denervation therapy, or topical lidocaine. No completed evaluations of multifaceted and personalised interventions were identified.

### Many patients with persistent pain 1 year after TKA report improvement by 5 to 7 years: a mixed-methods study [^113bzGFZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this subgroup of patients experiencing persistent postsurgical pain 12 months after surgery, most participants experienced a decrease in pain between 1 year and 5 to 7 years after surgery. The mixed-methods approach revealed more layered and complex experience for the participants. Although persistent postsurgical pain still caused certain limitations for the participants, pain seemed to be less influential in their everyday lives 5 years to 7 years after primary TKA. Clinicians may use these findings to inform and guide patients with delayed improvements in pain into more realistic expectations for recovery, rehabilitation, and strategies for coping with pain, comorbidity, and function. It is, however, imperative to rule out other reasons for pain in patients reporting pain 12 months and longer after surgery and be attentive of possible changes in pain character over time.

### The STAR care pathway for patients with pain at 3 months after total knee replacement: a multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial [^116td7k7]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Approximately 20% of people experience chronic pain after total knee replacement, but effective treatments are not available. We aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new care pathway for chronic pain after total knee replacement.

Methods

We did an unmasked, parallel group, pragmatic, superiority, randomised, controlled trial at eight UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. People with chronic pain at 3 months after total knee replacement surgery were randomly assigned (2:1) to the Support and Treatment After Replacement (STAR) care pathway plus usual care, or to usual care alone. The STAR intervention aimed to identify underlying causes of chronic pain and enable onward referrals for targeted treatment through a 3-month post-surgery assessment with an extended scope practitioner and telephone follow-up over 12 months. Co-primary outcomes were self-reported pain severity and pain interference in the replaced knee, assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain severity and interference scales at 12 months (scored 0–10, best to worst) and analysed on an as-randomised basis. Resource use, collected from electronic hospital records and participants, was valued with UK reference costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated from EQ-5D-5L responses. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN92545361.

Findings

Between Sept 6, 2016, and May 31, 2019, 363 participants were randomly assigned to receive the intervention plus usual care (n = 242) or to receive usual care alone (n = 121). Participants had a median age of 67 years (IQR 61 to 73), 217 (60%) of 363 were female, and 335 (92%) were White. 313 (86%) patients provided follow-up data at 12 months after randomisation (213 assigned to the intervention plus usual care and 100 assigned to usual care alone). At 12 months, the mean between-group difference in the BPI severity score was -0.65 (95% CI -1.17 to -0.13; p = 0.014) and the mean between-group difference in the BPI interference score was -0.68 (-1.29 to -0.08; p = 0.026), both favouring the intervention. From an NHS and personal social services perspective, the intervention was cost-effective (greater improvement with lower cost), with an incremental net monetary benefit of £1256 (95% CI 164 to 2348) at £20000 per QALY threshold. One adverse reaction of participant distress was reported in the intervention group.

Interpretation

STAR is a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention to improve pain outcomes over 1 year for people with chronic pain at 3 months after total knee replacement surgery.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^1152s2rg]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Approximately 20% of patients experience chronic pain after total knee replacement (TKR), yet there is no consensus about how best to assess such pain. This systematic review aimed to identify measures used to characterize chronic pain after TKR. Methods. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases were searched for research articles published in all languages from January 2002 to November 2011. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they assessed knee pain at a minimum of 3 months after TKR, yielding a total of 1,164 articles. The data extracted included the study design, country, timings of assessments, and outcome measures containing pain items. The outcome measures were compared with domains recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials(IMMPACT) for inclusion in the assessment of chronic pain–related outcomes within clinical trials. Temporal trends were also explored.

Results

The review found use of a wide variety of composite and single-item measures, with the American Knee Society Score the most common. Many measures used in published studies did not capture the multidimensional nature of pain recommended by the IMMPACT; of those commonly used, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Oxford Knee Score were the most comprehensive. Geographic trends were evident, with nation-specific preferences for particular measures. A recent reduction in the use of some clinically administered tools was accompanied by an increased use of patient-reported outcome measures.

Conclusion

There was wide variation in the methods of pain assessment alongside nation-specific preferences and changing temporal trends in pain assessment after TKR. Standardization and improvements in assessment are needed to enhance the quality of research and facilitate the establishment of a core outcome set.

### Prevalence and predictors of chronic pain with two-year follow-up after knee arthroplasty [^112SfRqw]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

And, no relationship was found between whether to undertake professional rehabilitation after discharge and occurrence of chronic pain in present study. Overall satisfaction was classified as dissatisfied (0–60%), natural (70–80%) and Satisfied (90–100%), and our results revealed that 72%(n = 437) of patients claimed that they were satisfied or very satisfied, 17% (n = 101) of patients were neutral, while 11% (n = 67) were very dissatisfied or dissatisfied, expressing their regret having surgery.

### Knee replacement [^116aBm6x]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Knee replacement surgery is one of the most commonly done and cost-effective musculoskeletal surgical procedures. The numbers of cases done continue to grow worldwide, with substantial variation in utilisation rates across regions and countries. The main indication for surgery remains painful knee osteoarthritis with reduced function and quality of life. The threshold for intervention is not well defined, and is influenced by many factors including patient and surgeon preference. Most patients have a very good clinical outcome after knee replacement, but multiple studies have reported that 20% or more of patients do not. So despite excellent long-term survivorship, more work is required to enhance this procedure and development is rightly focused on increasing the proportion of patients who have successful pain relief after surgery. Changing implant design has historically been a target for improving outcome, but there is greater recognition that improvements can be achieved by better implantation methods, avoiding complications, and improving perioperative care for patients, such as enhanced recovery programmes. New technologies are likely to advance future knee replacement care further, but their introduction must be regulated and monitored with greater rigour to ensure patient safety.

### Pain after total knee arthroplasty: a narrative review focusing on the stratification of patients at risk for persistent pain [^1164b2Bn]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The patient with a painful arthritic knee awaiting total knee arthroplasty (TKA) requires a multidisciplinary approach. Optimal control of acute post-operative pain and the prevention of chronic persistent pain remains a challenge. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether stratification of patients can help identify those who are at particular risk for severe acute or chronic pain. Intense acute post-operative pain, which is itself a risk factor for chronic pain, is more common in younger, obese female patients and those suffering from central pain sensitisation. Pre-operative pain, in the knee or elsewhere in the body, predisposes to central sensitisation. Pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee may also trigger neuropathic pain and may be associated with chronic medication like opioids, leading to a state of nociceptive sensitisation called 'opioid-induced hyperalgesia'. Finally, genetic and personality related risk factors may also put patients at a higher risk for the development of chronic pain. Those identified as at risk for chronic pain would benefit from specific peri-operative management including reduction in opioid intake pre-operatively, the peri-operative use of antihyperalgesic drugs such as ketamine and gabapentinoids, and a close post-operative follow-up in a dedicated chronic pain clinic.

### Is single-stage revision according to a strict protocol effective in treatment of chronic knee arthroplasty infections? [^112Wo1bn]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite the relatively low rates of PJIs after TKAs, they remain a leading cause of revision surgery as a result of an ever increasing number of knee arthroplasties performed yearly for an aging population. In contrast to two-stage revisions, single-stage surgery may offer a shorter hospital stay, the avoidance of complications associated with a second operation, improved postoperative function and pain, and lower cost; however, whether infection control is sacrificed for these endpoints remains controversial, and if it is, a single-stage approach would likely not be justified. In this study, we therefore determined (1) the degree to which our protocol of a highly selective single-stage revision approach achieved infection control compared with a two-stage revision approach to TKA infections; and (2) Knee Society scores and radiographic evidence of implant fixation between the single-stage and two-stage patients who were treated for more complicated infections.

Our study is associated with some limitations. First, a single-stage revision procedure was applied in a highly selected patient population using the indications we have defined (Table 1) and is not suitable for "all comers". Second, patients undergoing two-stage procedures tend to have been more complicated taking into consideration that they had undergone multiple revision procedures and had less bone stock to start off with, which may account for the more complex reconstructions and the higher observed Knee Society scores in the single-stage patients. Third, 3 years of followup is not sufficient to know that these patients will remain without infections; there is a risk of infection recurring, and hence our close followup continues for this cohort of patients. Fourth, infection control after knee arthroplasties can be affected by a number of risk factors, including age, sex, time from operation, duration of symptoms, patient comorbidities, and the pathogen causing the infection. Because of the small number of patients within each subgroup, the heterogeneity of the study population (type of original operation, number of previous surgeries, and type of surgery performed) and the observational nature of this study, we were unable to perform a multivariate analysis to further investigate the effect of those risk factors on infection control outcome. Fifth, despite no recurrence of infection in the single-stage group of patients, the numbers included in this study remain small. This, however, reflects the difficulty of finding large numbers suitable for a single-stage revision even at a tertiary center dealing with significant numbers of periprosthetic infections.

### Assessment of chronic postsurgical pain after knee replacement: a systematic review [^116miiyE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

International variation in the use of multi-item tools was found, with some of the more popular tools used more frequently in some countries than others. These trends for nation-specific preferences for particular tools to assess TKR outcomes are similar to those of studies found in the general orthopedic literature. For example, the US published the highest percentage of studies using the AKSS, while the UK published the highest percentage of studies using the OKS. The greater use of tools in the countries that developed them is not unexpected, although it could pose difficulties for international comparisons of outcomes in meta-analyses. The finding of international variation in the use of tools suggests that standardization of pain assessment on an international level may prove difficult; however, an alternative could be the promotion of national standardization through the merging of large cohort data sets to create registries or data repositories. This is one of the aims of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative, which promotes the standardization of outcomes assessment through the establishment of core outcome sets.

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this review when interpreting the results. First, although contact with authors yielded some full-text articles and data extraction validation, extraction of data from abstracts alone represented 13% of the data set. This may have led to an underestimation of the number of tools used to assess pain because data may not have been reported in the abstract. Second, it is also possible that we underestimated the number of studies and tools used to assess pain; some studies may have assessed but not reported pain data (reporting bias). Third, because of the high volume of studies, it was not feasible to analyze the assessment of pain according to study quality.

The strengths of this review were the wide inclusion criteria that enabled scrutiny of a high volume of original epidemiologic and experimental research articles, systematic and rigorous methods used to search and screen eligible articles, and attempts to contact authors. The inclusion of literature published over a 10-year period in all languages enabled comparisons of temporal and geographic trends in the use of pain-related outcome measures. This systematic review highlights that the assessment of chronic pain after TKR could be improved. Future research is needed to develop a consensus and standardization on which pain domains should be assessed after TKR; this can be achieved by working to establish a core outcome set and subsequent guidance on the most suitable outcome measures for assessment of the core pain domains after TKR.

### "It's there and I' M stuck with it": patients' experiences of chronic pain following total knee replacement surgery [^114SUZFd]. Arthritis Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To gain insight into patients' experiences of adjustment to chronic pain following recovery from total knee replacement (TKR) surgery.

Methods

Participants were purposively sampled and comprised 28 individuals, 18 women and 10 men, ages 57–87 years, who had undergone a TKR between 2 and 5 years previously. Semistructured interviews explored participants' perceptions of their condition and its impact, including its causes and consequences. Thematic analysis, using the constant comparison technique, was used to identify and analyze patterns and themes from the transcripts.

Results

Although some individuals expressed acceptance of their continuing pain, others reported that it caused them considerable distress. Variation in expressed acceptance and distress was not related to self-reported pain severity. Various factors relating to adjustment emerged, including perceived improvement or deterioration in circumstances since TKR, surgeon input pre- and postsurgery, and beliefs about pain in the context of an individual's life. Participants described a sense of abandonment following TKR and discussed the support they felt they should have received.

Conclusion

The data suggest that adjustment to chronic pain following recovery from TKR surgery is influenced by biomedical and psychosocial factors, including an individual's pain-related illness cognitions, beliefs, and their perceptions of their condition in a social context. Patient care could be improved by clinicians utilizing a biopsychosocial framework to acknowledge the impact of osteoarthritis of the knee as a multidimensional health condition.

### Screening to identify postoperative pain and cross-sectional associations between factors identified in this process with pain and function, three months after total knee replacement [^116pPYme]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the screening and recruitment process of a randomized trial and evaluate associations with knee pain and function 3 months after total knee replacement (TKR).

Methods

In order to screen for a multicenter trial, a total of 5,036 patients were sent the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) questionnaire 10weeks post-TKR. Patients who reported pain in their replaced knee (score of ≤ 14 on the OKS pain component) completed a second OKS questionnaire 12weeks post-TKR. Those patients who were still experiencing pain 12weeks post-TKR completed a detailed questionnaire 13weeks post-TKR. These data were used to characterize pain in a cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable regression was performed in order to identify factors associated with pain and function at 13weeks post-TKR.

Results

We received OKS questionnaires from 3,058 of 5,063 TKR patients (60%), and 907 of the 3,058 (30%) reported pain in their replaced knee 10weeks post-TKR. By 12weeks, 179 of 553 patients (32%) reported improved pain (score of > 14 on the OKS pain component). At 13weeks, 192 of 363 patients (53%) who completed a detailed questionnaire reported neuropathic pain, 94 of 362 (26%) reported depression symptoms, and 95 of 363 (26%) anxiety symptoms. More severe pain at 13weeks postoperatively was associated with poorer general health, poorer physical health, more pain worry, and lower satisfaction with surgery outcome. More severe functional limitation was associated with higher levels of depression, more pain worry, lower satisfaction with surgery outcome, and higher pain acceptance.

Conclusion

Screening after TKR identified individuals with pain. We identified several potential targets (physical and mental health outcomes, acceptance of pain, and quality of life) for tailored intervention to improve outcomes for patients. Future trials of multidisciplinary interventions warranted.

### Determining who should be referred for total hip and knee replacements [^111dBkpy]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Total hip and total knee replacements (THR and TKR respectively), the definitive treatments for end-stage arthritis, are both safe and extremely successful in relieving pain and improving function. However, physicians who care for patients with chronic hip and knee arthritis are often the 'gatekeepers' to total joint replacement (TJR) procedures as they select patients for referral to an orthopaedic surgeon to be considered for arthroplasty. Currently, no evidence-based criteria exist to guide physicians in this decision-making process, and this situation raises the possibility that conscious or unconscious biases may influence referral patterns, potentially leading to systematic inequities regarding which patients are eventually offered TJR. This article reviews why TJRs are particularly important procedures, and highlights common misperceptions among physicians regarding TJR risk assessment. This article also underscores the benefits of ongoing discussion regarding TJR with all patients with moderate-to-severe chronic hip or knee pain and disability.
