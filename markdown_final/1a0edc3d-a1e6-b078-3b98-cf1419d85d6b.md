## Question

Can a pontine stroke cause suppressed TSH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a pontine stroke can cause suppressed TSH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy of the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis and whether the pons participates in its regulation. Then, I should verify what pontine strokes actually disrupt and whether those pathways plausibly suppress TSH. Next, I will review the literature for direct or indirect evidence linking pontine infarction to TSH suppression. After that, I need to consider alternative explanations for suppressed TSH in stroke patients, such as non-thyroidal illness syndrome and exogenous thyroid hormone. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline what tests would help distinguish mechanisms if TSH is suppressed after a pontine stroke.

> Let me first confirm the neuroanatomy. The HPT axis is a hierarchical circuit: hypothalamic TRH neurons project via the median eminence to the anterior pituitary to drive TSH, which stimulates the thyroid to produce T4 and T3. T4/T3 then feed back negatively at the pituitary and hypothalamus to modulate TSH, so true TSH suppression arises from increased thyroid hormone action or impaired central drive, not from a peripheral lesion alone [^1287c444] [^37c9872e]. Wait, let me verify the brainstem's role: TRH neurons are in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and while brainstem catecholaminergic inputs modulate hypothalamic activity, the pons is not a primary node of the HPT axis, so a focal pontine lesion would not be expected to directly suppress TSH via canonical HPT circuitry [^d050a7fd].

> Next, I should review what pontine strokes typically damage and whether that overlaps with HPT control. Pontine infarcts commonly involve corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, pontine nuclei, and cranial nerve nuclei, producing motor and cranial nerve deficits; they do not typically disrupt hypothalamic nuclei or the pituitary stalk, which are the critical structures for TSH regulation [^b3c0ec1d] [^bb1b90b1]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: large posterior circulation events can occasionally affect diencephalic structures, but isolated pontine infarcts are not described as causing central hypothyroidism in the literature, and guidelines that recommend screening for central hypothyroidism after stroke do not single out pontine lesions as a specific risk substrate [^56e91104] [^4e30ff86].

> I will now examine the literature for direct evidence. I need to check whether any studies or case series report suppressed TSH after pontine infarction. Scanning the provided sources, I do not find reports of pontine stroke causing TSH suppression; instead, stroke literature emphasizes low T3 (non-thyroidal illness) and, in some studies, elevated or inappropriately normal TSH in the context of pituitary or hypothalamic injury, which is the opposite of suppression and reflects central hypothyroidism rather than suppression of TSH drive [^31f1e76f] [^97b15ce9] [^bc868df4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I saw a pontine case with suppressed TSH, but on rechecking, the thyroid steal syndrome cases involve cerebellar infarcts and hyperthyroidism with goiter, not pontine lesions, so that does not support a pontine mechanism for TSH suppression [^94b6e443] [^65c58824].

> But wait, what if the suppressed TSH is not from the pontine lesion itself? I should double-check for common alternative explanations in stroke patients. Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (euthyroid sick syndrome) is frequent in acute illness and stroke, characterized by low T3 and sometimes low TSH early on, though TSH can recover or even rise later; this is a stress-related adaptation rather than a focal pontine effect, and it resolves with clinical recovery, so I need to ensure we do not misattribute NTIS to pontine pathology [^94f88fad] [^5813fa7a]. I also need to consider exogenous thyroid hormone exposure, which is a common iatrogenic cause of suppressed TSH, and subclinical hyperthyroidism from endogenous overproduction, both of which can coexist with stroke and should be screened for systematically [^55bc3a9d] [^e93ad3f6].

> Let me synthesize the mechanistic plausibility. Suppressed TSH reflects either increased thyroid hormone feedback or reduced TRH/TSH secretion; a focal pontine infarct does not directly increase circulating T3/T4 and does not disrupt TRH neurons or the pituitary stalk, making a direct causal link biologically implausible in isolated pontine disease. By contrast, pituitary or hypothalamic injury can cause central hypothyroidism with low T4 and inappropriately low or normal TSH, which is a different endocrine pattern than TSH suppression [^1287c444] [^bc868df4]. Hold on, I should verify that no indirect pontine–hypothalamic pathway convincingly suppresses TSH; the modulatory brainstem inputs to hypothalamic TRH neurons exist, but there is no evidence that a focal pontine lesion selectively downregulates TSH secretion without hypothalamic or pituitary damage, reinforcing that pontine stroke alone should not cause TSH suppression [^d050a7fd].

> Clinically, I need to ensure a structured approach if TSH is suppressed after a pontine stroke. First, repeat thyroid function tests to confirm persistence, because TSH can fluctuate in acute illness. Second, measure free T4 and free T3 to distinguish subclinical hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH with normal free hormones) from overt hyperthyroidism or non-thyroidal illness patterns. Third, review medications and supplements for exogenous thyroid hormone. Fourth, assess for symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. And fifth, if central etiologies remain a concern, broaden imaging to include the hypothalamic–pituitary region rather than attributing causality to the pontine lesion [^5813fa7a] [^55bc3a9d] [^4dab0ba3].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Based on neuroanatomy and available clinical evidence, a pontine stroke does not directly cause suppressed TSH; if TSH is suppressed in such a patient, I need to look for non-thyroidal illness syndrome, exogenous thyroid hormone, or primary thyroid disease, and reserve evaluation for central causes for those with clinical or imaging evidence of hypothalamic–pituitary involvement rather than attributing it to the pontine infarct itself [^1287c444] [^94f88fad] [^55bc3a9d].

---

A pontine stroke **does not directly suppress TSH**; TSH is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis, which is not located in the pons. However, a pontine stroke can cause **non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)** [^94f88fad], in which TSH may be transiently low or inappropriately normal despite low T3, reflecting central dysregulation rather than true hypothyroidism. NTIS is common after acute stroke and typically resolves with recovery; persistent TSH suppression should prompt evaluation for other causes such as exogenous thyroid hormone, subclinical hyperthyroidism, or pituitary/hypothalamic injury [^55bc3a9d].

---

## Anatomical and physiological considerations

- **Hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis**: TSH is secreted by the anterior pituitary in response to TRH from the hypothalamus; the pons is not part of this axis [^1287c444].
- **Pontine anatomy**: The pons contains cranial nerve nuclei, reticular formation, and ascending/descending tracts, but not hypothalamic or pituitary structures.
- **Direct suppression**: There is no known direct pontine mechanism that suppresses TSH secretion.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

- **Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)**: Acute stroke, including pontine stroke, can cause NTIS, characterized by low T3, low or inappropriately normal TSH, and normal or low T4 [^94f88fad].
- **Transient TSH changes**: In NTIS, TSH may be low or normal due to central dysregulation, not primary pituitary or thyroid disease [^94f88fad].
- **Resolution with recovery**: NTIS typically resolves as the acute illness improves, with TSH normalizing within weeks to months.

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Recognition of NTIS**: Clinicians should recognize NTIS in acute stroke patients and avoid overdiagnosing true thyroid disease [^94f88fad].
- **Monitoring**: Repeat thyroid function tests after recovery to distinguish NTIS from persistent thyroid disease [^94f88fad].
- **Persistent suppression**: If TSH remains suppressed after recovery, evaluate for other causes such as exogenous thyroid hormone, subclinical hyperthyroidism, or pituitary/hypothalamic injury [^55bc3a9d].

## Summary of evidence

| **Mechanism** | **Effect on tsh** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) | Transiently low or inappropriately normal TSH | Common after acute stroke, including pontine stroke |
| Direct pontine lesion | No direct suppression of TSH | No evidence supporting direct suppression |
| Persistent TSH suppression | Evaluate for other causes | Persistent suppression after recovery |

---

A pontine stroke **does not directly suppress TSH**, but it can cause NTIS with transient TSH changes that resolve with recovery. Persistent TSH suppression warrants further evaluation for alternative causes.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis

Tightly controlled by a precise feedback loop known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, thyroid hormones affect metabolism, development, and growth, influencing virtually every cell in the human body. The HPT axis is as follows: thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TSH) generated in the hypothalamus causes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in the hypophysis, precipitating T3 and T4 synthesis in the thyroid gland at a 1:14 ratio. T4 is converted to the more biologically active T3 by deiodinase enzymes in extrathyroidal tissues. Many studies investigating interplay between thyroid hormones and stroke outcome have been conducted. One meta-analysis revealed an overall association between poor mRS scores and low T3 levels. Decreased T3 has also been associated with increased 1-year mortality and worse NIHSS scores (~ 2–4 weeks). Thus, T3 appears to be neuroprotective in acute cerebrovascular disease. Regarding other HPT hormones, high T4 is prognostic for long-term disability and although individual studies report mixed findings regarding the effects of TSH on ISFO, a meta-analysis found that initially elevated TSH levels improved 1-month and 3-month mRS scores.

DIO3

Given the impact thyroid hormones have on IS outcome, genetic variants affecting their transport and activity were postulated to influence poststroke disability. Deiodinase 3 (DIO3) is an enzyme that inactivates T3 in neurons — a process induced by hypoxic conditions. One group found that DIO3 SNP rs945006 TT was associated with improved ISFO at 1-year follow up (mRS). The mechanisms by which rs945006 affects intraneural DIO3 activity are currently unknown.

OATP1C1

Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) is a transmembrane protein specific for thyroid hormone transport in the brain and animal models indicate that inflammation reduces OATP1C1 mRNA expression in cerebral blood vessels. One group reported a relationship between rs10770704 CC and increased disability 1-year poststroke (mRS), despite multiple studies reporting no direct effect of the SNP on thyroid hormone levels.

### Hypothyroidism as a protective factor in acute stroke patients [^480b466e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

It has been reported that hypothyroidism is associated with better survival in elderly persons. We investigated possible associations of thyroid status with clinical outcome in patients with acute stroke.

Design

Retrospective analysis.

Patients

Consecutive patients (median age 70 years) admitted for acute stroke.

Measurements

Total T3, T4 and TSH levels. Stroke severity evaluation using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Handicap and survival assessment over 12 months.

Results

Of 744 patients where thyroid function tests were available within the first 24 h of stroke, 13 had elevated TSH (≥ 10 microU/ml; range 10–42 microU/ml) (hypo-group), 51 had mildly elevated TSH (3.3–9.9 microU/ml) and 680 had nonelevated TSH < 3.3 microU/ml. In the hypo-group transient ischaemic attacks (TIA's) were more prevalent (46.2%) compared to the groups of mildly elevated TSH (11.8%) and nonelevated TSH (12.4%, P < 0.002). Hypo-group had more frequently an adequate level of consciousness (GCS 14–15 = fully alert): 92.3%vs 74.5% and 63.7% (P = 0.033), a milder neurological deficit (SSS score 45–58) 76.9%vs 39.2% and 38.7% (P = 0.02) compared to the other two groups, respectively, and a tendency for lower glucose levels on admission. One year outcome tended to be better with respect to survival and handicap.

Conclusions

Acute stroke patients with laboratory findings compatible with pre-existing hypothyroidism on admission, appear to have better clinical presentation and outcome; we speculate that a reduced response to stress and previous TIA's, possibly related to endogenous 'preconditioning', may contribute to this phenomenon.

### Favorable functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients with subclinical hypothyroidism [^ee9916a2]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the protective effects of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) on ischemic stroke severity and its functional outcome.

Methods

Seventy-three consecutive patients admitted for first-ever cerebral ischemic stroke who met the inclusion criteria of this study were included. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured for all patients. Stroke severity was recorded for each patient on admission using the NIH Stroke Scale. The patients were followed, and their functional outcomes were evaluated at 1 and 3 months after stroke using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Barthel Index. All values were compared between patients with and without SCH (serum TSH in the range of 2.5–10 mIU/L, with normal thyroid function test results).

Results

Of the patients, 49 (67.1%) had normal serum TSH, and 24 (32.8%) had SCH. Patients with higher levels of serum TSH tended to have a milder stroke on admission with a significantly better outcome, described as a mRS score of 0 or 1, at 1 (p = 0.029) and 3 (p = 0.048) months of follow-up. Mortality was also found to be lower in the group of patients with SCH (p = 0.008, at 3 months of follow-up).

Conclusions

This study showed a significant protective association of SCH with better outcomes and lower mortality after cerebral ischemic stroke. Possible explanations for this association are ischemic preconditioning, reduced adrenergic tone, and hypometabolic state.

CASE PRESENTATION

A 37-year-old man was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism in 2003. He was regularly treated with medication and regularly followed up at the endocrine clinic of our hospital. In April 2021, he was hospitalized in our hospital due to a headache. Three thyroid antibodies were examined: TPOAb: 363.50 IU/mL, and 5 thyroid function items were within the normal range. Brain magnetic resonance imaging plain scan showed cerebral infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere (subacute stage) (Fig. 1 A). Head computed tomography plain scan showed cerebral infarction with lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Computed tomography angiogram of the head and neck showed local small, shallow, and arteriosclerosis in the V1 segment of the right vertebral artery (Fig. 1 B). In March 2022, he visited our hospital again due to recurrent headaches for 10 days with aggravation for 5 days. Physical examination showed bilateral exophthalmology, bilateral thyroid Ⅱ degree enlargement, no vascular murmur, and no neurological defects. A function 5 items: (1) T3: 0.68 nmol/L (reference range: 0.92–2.38 nmol/L), (2) T4: 18.42 nmol/L (reference range: 69.71–163.95 nmol/L), (3) FT3: 2.77 pmol/L (reference range:), (4) FT4: 2.96 pmol/L (reference range: 7.98–16.02 pmol/L), and (5) thyroid-stimulating hormone 3 (TSH3): 45.78 miU/L (reference range: 0.56–5.91 miU/L). Thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse thyroid lesions, with no obvious enlarged lymph nodes in the bilateral neck. Head magnetic resonance imaging plain scan showed cerebral infarction of the right cerebellar hemisphere and brachions (subacute stage) (Fig. 1 C). Total cerebrovascular angiography showed malformed vessels at the distal end of the bilateral thyroid cervical trunk and the left vertebral artery was slender. PICA was underdeveloped, and no obvious abnormalities were observed in the whole brain arteries and veins. Bilateral renal arteriography showed no obvious abnormalities (Fig. 1 D–F). Methimazole was used to treat hyperthyroidism, and follow-up was planned in the department of endocrinology and neurology after discharge.

### A case of masked toxic adenoma in a patient with non-thyroidal illness [^94f88fad]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-thyroidal illness (NTI) or euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) is defined as a change in thyroid function during starvation or illness including a central reduction in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion, decreased plasma triiodothyronine (T 3) levels and decreased thyroxine (T 4) and T 3 binding in serum. It is a relatively common syndrome, affecting about 70% of hospitalized patients and may occur with virtually any illness. Abnormalities in thyroid function can occur within hours of acute illness, and the magnitude of reduction in thyroid hormone levels correlates with disease severity and mortality. Serum T 3 and free T 4 levels are independent predictors of survival, and low levels of T 3 are a poor prognostic factor of short- and long-term survival in patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction or acute stroke outside the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. The pathophysiological mechanism responsible for NTI is complex and changes in the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis are the effect of various factors. Treatment of NTI with thyroid hormone is controversial, and abnormalities in thyroid function tests usually resolve after clinical recovery. Primary thyroid dysfunction can be accompanied by NIT, and a follow-up thyroid function test is essential after recovery from illness to ascertain normalization. Here, we present a case of a woman with NTI who was later diagnosed with primary hyperthyroidism.

### Treatment of borderline elevated thyrotropin level… [^bdc779d9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In Reply Braithwaite and Moore have correctly identified in their recent letter that development of a suppressed thyrotropin level following initiation of levothyroxine therapy may occur due to subsequent development of hyperthyroidism including Graves or toxic multinodular goiter rather than simply overtreatment. The conversion of autoimmune hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism does occur; the exact frequency of this event is unknown but likely to be rare, and such events are still reported in the "unusual" case literature. 1 They are therefore right to highlight that both adequate long-term TSH monitoring during levothyroxine therapy and patient education on the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are needed to reduce the risk of TSH suppression. However, we believe that subsequent development of noniatrogenic hyperthyroidism would only account for a small proportion of the suppressed TSH levels observed in our data set.

Our data set excluded anyone who ever had a diagnosis of Graves disease, multinodular goiter, or thyroiditis, as well as anyone who ever required antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, or surgery, even after levothyroxine therapy initiation. Therefore, any individual developing noniatrogenic hyperthyroidism after levothyroxine therapy initiation would have had to have been unrecognized by health professionals over several years and therefore is likely to represent only a small number of individuals.

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^4dab0ba3]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Hyperthyroxinemia with non-suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) — diagnostic steps during COVID-19 include actively seeking assay interference and targeted pituitary imaging when visual symptoms suggest optic chiasmal compression. Laboratories should assess for spurious TSH results, and in patients with visual disturbance plus genuine hyperthyroxinemia with non-suppressed TSH, pituitary imaging should be performed (either magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or dedicated pituitary computed tomography [CT]) to confirm a macroadenoma with suprasellar extension. If there is no visual pathway compromise or associated hypopituitarism, a local decision should determine whether to proceed with further investigation or defer until the pandemic subsides, in which case empiric treatment should be considered.

### Comment: does L-thyroxine prevent or cause stroke in hypothyroidism? [^9dd2ea7b]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The association between overt hypothyroidism and atherosclerotic risk factors, especially hypertension and dyslipidemia, is clear. To date, only a few small and methodologically flawed epidemiologic studies have investigated the relationship between hypothyroidism and stroke, precluding definitive conclusions. In the current issue of Neurology®, Karch and Thomas(1) present a large well-designed case-control study investigating this relationship. They compared 34,907 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis on treatment with l-thyroxine and 149,632 matched individuals without autoimmune thyroiditis from a UK primary care electronic health record system. They found a slight increase in the risk of stroke in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (adjusted relative risk = 1.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.01–1.20) compared with controls. Some of this increased risk of stroke was independent of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and the risk of stroke events and fatal stroke: an individual participant data analysis [^c4fafaf1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine the risk of stroke associated with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Published prospective cohort studies were identified through a systematic search through November 2013 without restrictions in several databases. Unpublished studies were identified through the Thyroid Studies Collaboration. We collected individual participant data on thyroid function and stroke outcome. Euthyroidism was defined as TSH levels of 0.45–4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as TSH levels of 4.5–19.9 mIU/L with normal T4 levels.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We collected individual participant data on 47 573 adults (3451 subclinical hypothyroidism) from 17 cohorts and followed up from 1972–2014 (489 192 person-years). Age- and sex-adjusted pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for participants with subclinical hypothyroidism compared to euthyroidism were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–1.21) for stroke events (combined fatal and nonfatal stroke) and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.80–1.42) for fatal stroke. Stratified by age, the HR for stroke events was 3.32 (95% CI, 1.25–8.80) for individuals aged 18–49 years. There was an increased risk of fatal stroke in the age groups 18–49 and 50–64 years, with a HR of 4.22 (95% CI, 1.08–16.55) and 2.86 (95% CI, 1.31–6.26), respectively (p trend 0.04). We found no increased risk for those 65–79 years old (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.86–1.18) or ≥ 80 years old (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.79–2.18). There was a pattern of increased risk of fatal stroke with higher TSH concentrations.

Conclusions

Although no overall effect of subclinical hypothyroidism on stroke could be demonstrated, an increased risk in subjects younger than 65 years and those with higher TSH concentrations was observed.

### Thyroid function within the reference range and the risk of stroke: an individual participant data analysis [^e76930ad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

The currently applied reference ranges for thyroid function are under debate. Despite evidence that thyroid function within the reference range is related with several cardiovascular disorders, its association with the risk of stroke has not been evaluated previously.

Design and Setting

We identified studies through a systematic literature search and the Thyroid Studies Collaboration, a collaboration of prospective cohort studies. Studies measuring baseline TSH, free T 4, and stroke outcomes were included, and we collected individual participant data from each study, including thyroid function measurements and incident all stroke (combined fatal and nonfatal) and fatal stroke. The applied reference range for TSH levels was between 0.45 and 4.49 mIU/L.

Results

We collected individual participant data on 43 598 adults with TSH within the reference range from 17 cohorts, with a median follow-up of 11.6 years (interquartile range 5.1–13.9), including 449 908 person-years. Age- and sex-adjusted pooled hazard ratio for TSH was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.95 across the reference range of TSH) for all stroke and 0.83 (95% CI 0.62–1.09) for fatal stroke. For the free T 4 analyses, the hazard ratio was 1.08 (95% CI 0.99–1.15 per SD increase) for all stroke and 1.10 (95% CI 1.04–1.19) for fatal stroke. This was independent of cardiovascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking, and prevalent diabetes.

Conclusion

Higher levels of TSH within the reference range may decrease the risk of stroke, highlighting the need for further research focusing on the clinical consequences associated with differences within the reference range of thyroid function.

### Recurrent cerebellar infarction caused by rare thyroid steal syndrome: a patient report [^94b6e443]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In 1982, the first case of TIA in hyperthyroidism was reported, which was confirmed by cerebral angiography to be the dilation of the thyroid-supplying artery, but the TIA stopped after treatment with antithyroid drugs. We have reason to believe that the TIA symptoms of that patient were caused by thyroid hormone disorder. There are very few reported cases of TSS, primarily caused by goiter, and cerebral angiogram showed an enlarged thyroid artery blood supply, which was possibly due to the development of goiter, leading to more blood flow to the thyroid and a decrease in intracranial blood flow. In 2022, Harrison Humphries and colleagues reported the first case of TSS caused by active hyperthyroidism in a patient who did not have high levels of TSH or goiter, but had high levels of thyroid receptor antibodies that mimic the effects of TSH.

Our patient had a high TSH level, a large goiter, and obvious enlargement of the thyroid artery. Therefore, we hypothesized that the patient's repeated cerebellar infarction and uncontrolled hyperthyroidism symptoms were due to TSS. The patient's cerebral angiography showed no obvious intracranial vascular lesions, which further confirmed our hypothesis.

In previously reported cases, TSS was treated by surgical excision of the enlarged thyroid gland.–However, in our case, bilateral thyroid enlargement was obvious in the patient and the blood-supplying arteries of the thyroid were also significantly enlarged. Hence, surgical removal of the thyroid would have caused hypothyroidism. Therefore, we decided to restore intracranial blood supply by interventional embolization of the thickened thyroid-supplying artery and retaining part of the normal thyroid-supplying artery, so as to improve the patient's symptoms and preserve the thyroid function.

In the case of transient neurological symptoms in young patients with hyperthyroidism, clinicians need to consider TSS and investigate for goiter or thyroid hormone disorder and conduct early diagnosis and medical treatment to avoid the progression of cerebral infarction that will affect the patient's quality of life.

### Depressed TSH level as a predictor of poststroke fatigue in patients with acute ischemic stroke [^3099efbf]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether thyroid function profiles can predict poststroke fatigue (PSF) in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

Patients with stroke were consecutively recruited within 3 days of onset in Jinling Hospital. Serum levels of thyroid hormones, thyroid antibodies, hematologic indexes, and biochemical indexes were measured on admission. Fatigue was scored using the Fatigue Severity Scale. Associations were analyzed with multivariate regression and restricted cubic splines.

Results

Of the 704 patients with stroke, 292 (41.5%) were diagnosed with fatigue in the acute stage and 224 (35.3%) 6 months after the index stroke. The serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were inversely associated with the risk of PSF in both the acute phase and at follow-up evaluations after adjusting for potential confounders (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.24–0.37 in the acute phase, and odds ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.58–0.84 at follow-up). The subgroup analysis indicated that in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, TSH was associated with severity of PSF in the groups with euthyroidism (β = -0.70, p < 0.001), subclinical hypothyroidism (β = -0.44, p < 0.001), and low-T 3 syndrome (β = -0.34, p = 0.008). Higher TSH was associated with better Fatigue Severity Scale scores in patients with low-T 3 syndrome 6 months after the index stroke (β = -0.35, p = 0.01). Furthermore, in the group with low-T 3 syndrome, FT 3 serum level could also indicate a higher risk of PSF (β = -2.54, p < 0.001 in the acute phase, and β = -2.67, p < 0.001 at follow-up).

Conclusion

Thyroid function profiles may predict fatigue after acute ischemic stroke, suggesting that neuroendocrine responses could have a role in PSF.

### Thyrotropin alfa (Thyrogen) [^e75b5c04]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	THYROGEN-Induced Hyperthyroidism

When given to patients who have substantial thyroid tissue still in situ or functional thyroid cancer metastases, THYROGEN is known to cause a transient (over 7 to 14 days) but significant rise in serum thyroid hormone concentration. There have been reports of death in non-thyroidectomized patients and in patients with distant metastatic thyroid cancer in which events leading to death occurred within 24 hours after administration of THYROGEN. Patients with residual thyroid tissue at risk for THYROGEN-induced hyperthyroidism include the elderly and those with a known history of heart disease. Hospitalization for administration of THYROGEN and postadministration observation in patients at risk should be considered.

5.2	Stroke

There are postmarketing reports of radiologically-confirmed stroke and neurological findings suggestive of stroke unconfirmed radiologically (e.g., unilateral weakness) occurring within 72 hours (range 20 minutes to three days) of THYROGEN administration in patients without known central nervous system metastases. The majority of such patients were young women taking oral contraceptives at the time of their event or had other risk factors for stroke, such as smoking or a history of migraine headaches. The relationship between THYROGEN administration and stroke is unknown. Patients should be well-hydrated prior to treatment with THYROGEN.

5.3	Sudden Rapid Tumor Enlargement

Sudden, rapid and painful enlargement of residual thyroid tissue or distant metastases can occur following treatment with THYROGEN. This may lead to acute symptoms, which depend on the anatomical location of the tissue. Such symptoms include acute hemiplegia, hemiparesis, and loss of vision one to three days after THYROGEN administration. Laryngeal edema, pain at the site of distant metastasis, and respiratory distress requiring tracheotomy have also been reported after THYROGEN administration.

Pretreatment with glucocorticoids should be considered for patients in whom tumor expansion may compromise vital anatomic structures.

5.4	Risks Associated with Radioiodine Treatment

If THYROGEN is administered with radioiodine (RAI), the warnings and precautions for RAI, apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the RAI prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for RAI.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^55bc3a9d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Neuroendocrine changes in patients with acute space occupying ischaemic stroke [^31f1e76f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate neuroendocrine changes in critical care patients with acute space occupying hemispheric stroke.

Methods

22 patients with acute space occupying hemispheric stroke were studied (mean age 57.7 years; five women, 17 men). Plasma levels of prolactin, thyrotropin (TSH), total thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (FT4), and total triiodothyronine (T3) were measured on admission and thereafter on days 3, 5, 7, and 9. Cortisol and ACTH levels were analysed at 8.00, 16.00, and 24.00 hours each day. A TRH stimulation test with measurements of TSH and prolactin was done on day 3.

Results

Nine patients underwent decompressive craniectomy and nine were treated with moderate hypothermia. All patients received vasopressor drugs because of arterial hypotension. Plasma ACTH and cortisol values were abnormally low despite systemic hypotension and acute systemic illness, and remained low throughout the observation period. The diurnal rhythm of cortisol was not preserved. Prolactin levels increased during the observation period, and were well above normal on day 9. Thyroid function was slightly suppressed until day 7. TRH stimulation of plasma TSH and prolactin was low.

Conclusions

Patients with an acute space occupying cerebral infarct show profound neuroendocrine changes. The central regulation of adrenal and thyroid function and prolactin release is impaired, which may compromise the clinical course of affected patients and have implications for therapeutic management.

### What is the impact of acute endocrine and metabolic alterations on long-term ischemic stroke prognosis: a prospective study [^f2800ed1]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a threatening stressor and an increasingly major cause of death and disability, accounting for the leading criminal of hospitalization for neurologic diseases. In the acute early stage, profound alterations of the autonomic, endocrine, metabolic, and immune systems could provide an advantage to balance homeostasis due to the central nervous system's (CNS) response to the life-threatening insult. Neuroendocrine and subsequent metabolic cross-talks are essential for mounting an effective response to stroke. The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis is a typical representative of those cross-talks. After a stressful stroke, decreased circulating levels of T3 are often observed, of which degrees of changes can reflect the severity of illness. Additionally, metabolic changes such as stress hyperglycemia are a universal reaction to stress hormones and proinflammatory cytokines.

The neuroendocrine response to a threatening stroke follows a biphasic pattern, with potentially conflicting protection effects between acute and later phases. Except it activates a stroke-specific chain of survival, poststroke stress alterations may, in turn, aggravate the progression of ischemic brain injury, which accounts for the substantial impact of systemic complications on stroke outcomes, such as cognitive impairment, depression, infection etc. Adaptation regulation and dysregulation may be two sides of the same coin. Previous studies have primarily focused on the relationship between stroke and stress-related changes in single systems, with stress hyperglycemia and thyroid parameters being the most commonly used stress markers. However, measurements of single-system stress changes can be easily influenced by underlying diseases. For instance, stress-induced hyperglycemia predicts higher in-hospital mortality and poorer recovery in nondiabetic stroke patients but not in diabetics, while lower free triiodothyronine is associated with worse outcomes in clinically euthyroid patients but not in those with thyroid dysfunction. Combining multiple system indicators to quantify stress levels may offer greater objectivity and adaptability, but corresponding studies are scarce. Besides, previous studies have also shown inconsistent conclusions. While higher stress hyperglycemia may increase the occurrence of poor stroke outcomes, including mortality, neurological deficit, HT, and infectious complications, it is not independently associated with mortality or disability when stroke severity, as well as an inflammatory component, are taken into account. Furthermore, the reference ranges for thyroid function in relation to stroke outcomes are debated, as it remains unclear whether pre-disease states are related to changes in the acute phase of the disease that affect ischemic stroke prognosis at discharge or in the long term.

Baseline endocrine and metabolic parameters. A: Comparing healthy controls to patients with stroke; B: Comparing patients with minor stroke (baseline NIHSS ≤ 3) to patients with severe stroke (baseline NIHSS > 3); C: Comparing patients with good one-year stroke prognosis (mRS ≤ 2) to patients with poor one-year stroke prognosis (mRS > 2).

As shown in Table 2, after adjusting for age, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lymphocyte count, and baseline NIHSS, greater acute endocrine and metabolic alterations are associated with worse ischemic stroke prognosis (mRS > 2) at 3 months (Group 4 versus Group 1: adjusted OR = 3.417, P = 0.001), 6 months (Group 4 versus Group 1: adjusted OR = 4.033, P < 0.001), and 1 year (Group 4 versus Group 1: adjusted OR = 4.231, P = 0.001). However, for 1-year all-cause mortality, no significant association was found (Group 4 versus Group 1: adjusted OR = 1.632, P = 0.465).

### What is the impact of acute endocrine and metabolic alterations on long-term ischemic stroke prognosis: a prospective study [^44310ced]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of the mechanisms through which stress modulates neuron function could lead to improved treatment of stroke. Lower levels of thyroid functions and higher levels of glucose may induce prolonged residual inflammation that further compromises the quality of life. Most triiodothyronine (80–90%) in peripheral blood is converted from thyroxine by deiodinase, which can be inhibited in a clinical stress state as adaptions to spare energy, and thyroid hormones may promote post-stroke recovery by regulating several pathways of neuro repair, such as neuronal plasticity, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis, which has been confirmed in some cell and animal studies. Besides, acute hyperglycemia could accelerate neuronal damage in hypoxic brain tissue through stimulating coagulation, and increases oxidative response and inflammation levels, thereby leading to decreased reperfusion and possibly neuron damage. In our subgroup analysis, despite reports that infarctions not involving the posterior cerebral artery and very elderly individuals typically have worse stroke prognosis, no interaction effects were found between stress status and either arterial involvement or age segment. However, the relationships between admission stress and long-term ischemic stroke prognosis were more pronounced in patients with non-large-artery atherosclerosis and severe stroke (baseline NIHSS > 3). This suggests that the mechanisms may be more specific to stroke etiology and severity, warranting further precision studies.

Cerebral infarction is mainly caused by cerebrovascular disease, but can also occur when increased extracranial shunt causes the reduced blood flow in the cerebral circulation, often presenting with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in milder symptoms, known as thyroid steal syndrome (TSS). Thyroid steal syndrome is characterized by transient cerebral ischemia and patients usually present with multiple TIAs. Only 5 cases of TSS have been reported to date, among which 3 cases were secondary to goiter.–Herein, we reported a case with recurrent cerebellar infarction secondary to goiter, which has not been previously reported.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^fe61ed3c]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^54e70265]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical context

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use. Other causes are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1
Causes of central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis e.g. pituitary apoplexy. In other situations a low morning cortisol level in an at risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed (see below).

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones with GH being the most common pituitary hormone affected followed by gonadotrophins and culminating in loss of ACTH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). ACTH however can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids.

Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism is important as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Testing for central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the HPA axis is performed as part of a formal screening process for hypopituitarism in patients with organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease such as those with sellar/parasellar tumours, post pituitary surgery or apoplexy, history of cranial irradiation or traumatic brain injury. In other situations the assessment may be triggered by suggestive symptoms such as fatigue, unexplained weight loss, spontaneous hypoglycaemia or hyponatraemia.

Timing of assessment

ACTH suppression from exogenous steroids

ACTH suppression and subsequent cortisol deficiency can result from chronic glucocorticoid use, can be unpredictable regardless of dose and duration of glucocorticoid and recovery can take weeks to years. Patients on long-term glucocorticoids for inflammatory conditions are frequently referred to specialist endocrine services for assessment of possible ACTH suppression. As prednisone can cross-react with the cortisol assay we suggest waiting until the patient is tapered to a dose of 5 mg at which point they are switched to an equivalent dose hydrocortisone 10 mg twice daily and a dynamic test can be carried out with the dose held the afternoon before and morning of the test.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^119ef6e3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Fig 1
Hazard ratios with 95% CIs for each of seven outcomes for different thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) categories relative to 2–2.5 mIU/L reference category. TIA = transient ischaemic attack

In the adjusted model, we observed no association between risk of atrial fibrillation and the lowest or highest TSH categories. However, we found a marginal protective effect at TSH concentrations of 0.1–0.4 mIU/L (hazard ratio 0.86 (0.74 to 1.00; P = 0.05) (fig 1 and supplementary table E).

We obtained similar results in age (≤ 65 and > 65 years) and sex stratified analyses (supplementary tables B-E). The association between the highest TSH concentration and increased risk of heart failure persisted in all subgroups, whereas the association with increased risk of ischaemic heart disease remained significant only in patients aged 65 years or under. The association between the lowest TSH categories and reduced risk of heart failure remained significant only in women and patients aged over 65 years. The protective effect on stroke/transient ischaemic attack of TSH concentrations of 3–10 mIU/L was evident only in women and patients aged over 65 years. TSH below 0.4 mIU/L was protective for atrial fibrillation in women, and TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L was protective for atrial fibrillation in patients aged 65 years or under.

All cause mortality

In the adjusted model, both the lowest and highest TSH concentrations were associated with increased mortality compared with the reference TSH category (hazard ratio 1.18 (1.08 to 1.28; P < 0.001), 1.29 (1.22 to 1.36; P < 0.001), and 2.21 (2.07 to 2.36; P < 0.001) for TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, 4–10 mIU/L, and > 10 mIU/L (fig 1 and supplementary table F).

In sex stratified subgroup analysis, the associations between the lowest and highest TSH concentrations and increased mortality remained significant in both men and women. We observed some evidence of reduced mortality in men with TSH 3–3.5 mIU/L (hazard ratio 0.88 (0.77 to 0.99). In age stratified analysis, the association between increased mortality and highest TSH remained in both the younger and older subgroups, but the association with lowest TSH became non-significant.

### Anterior pituitary axis hormones and outcome in acute ischaemic stroke [^ca5eb958]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Early and accurate prediction of outcome in acute stroke is important and influences risk-optimized therapeutic strategies. Endocrine alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are amongst the first measurable alterations after cerebral ischaemia. We therefore evaluated the prognostic value of cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and growth hormone (GH) in patients with an acute ischaemic stroke.

Methods

In an observational study including 281 patients with ischaemic stroke, anterior pituitary axis hormones (i.e. cortisol, T3, fT4, TSH and GH) were simultaneously assessed to determine their value to predict functional outcome and mortality within 90 days and 1 year.

Results

In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the prognostic accuracy of cortisol was higher compared to all measured hormones and was in the range of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Cortisol was an independent prognostic marker of functional outcome and death [odds ratio (OR) 1.0 (1.0–1.01) and 1.62 (1.37–1.92), respectively, P < 0.0002 for both, adjusted for age and the NIHSS] in patients with ischaemic stroke, but added no significant additional predictive value to the clinical NIHSS score.

Conclusion

Cortisol is an independent prognostic marker for death and functional outcome within 90 days and 1 year in patients with ischaemic stroke. By contrast, other anterior pituitary axis hormones such as peripheral thyroid hormones and GH are only of minor value to predict outcome in stroke.

### Thyroid hormone therapy and incident stroke [^697b21c9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and there is a need to identify modifiable risk factors.

Objective

We aimed to determine the relationship between thyroid hormone treatment intensity and incidence of atrial fibrillation and stroke.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Veterans Health Administration between 2004 and 2017, with a median follow-up of 59 months. The study population comprised 733 208 thyroid hormone users aged ≥ 18 years with at least 2 thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) measurements between thyroid hormone initiation and incident event (atrial fibrillation or stroke) or study conclusion (406 030 thyroid hormone users with at least 2 free thyroxine [T4] measurements).

Results

Overall, 71 333/643 687 (11.08%) participants developed incident atrial fibrillation and 41 931/663 809 (6.32%) stroke. In multivariable analyses controlling for pertinent factors such as age, sex, and prior history of atrial fibrillation, higher incidence of stroke was associated with low TSH or high free T4 levels (ie, exogenous hyperthyroidism; eg, TSH < 0.1 mIU/L; OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.24–1.43; free T4 > 1.9 ng/dL, OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06–1.30) and high TSH or low free T4 levels (ie, exogenous hypothyroidism; eg, TSH > 5.5 mIU/L; OR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.26–1.33; free T4 < 0.7 ng/dL; OR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22–1.35) compared with euthyroidism (TSH > 0.5–5.5 mIU/L and free T4 0.7–1.9 ng/dL). Risk of developing atrial fibrillation and stroke was cumulative over time for both patients with exogenous hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

Conclusion

Both exogenous hyper- and hypothyroidism were associated with increased risk of stroke, highlighting the importance of patient medication safety.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: an ignored clinical syndrome? [^61a8a09b]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological Review

The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis forms the backbone of the endocrine system and is responsible for systemic homeostasis. The main pathophysiological mechanisms of dysfunction are summarized in Fig. 1. The mechanical force of TBI can cause direct damage to the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, or pituitary gland, which is situated at the base of the skull. The anterior pituitary is composed of pars distalis, pars tuberalis, and pars intermedia. Pars distalis forms most of the adenohypophysis involved in hormone secretion. The blood supply to the anterior pituitary is largely from the internal carotid arteries that give rise to superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries. The superior hypophyseal artery supplies the pituitary stalk and penetrates the median eminence of the hypothalamus to form a capillary plexus. The hypothalamic nuclei secrete releasing/inhibitory factors near the median eminence, from where they enter these capillaries that run down the pituitary stalk as portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary. These act on the pituitary to release prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]), and growth hormone (GH). The posterior pituitary comprises axonal projections from the hypothalamus, which stores and releases hormones (oxytocin and vasopressin) and receives its blood supply from the inferior hypophyseal artery. The long hypophyseal vessels that drain the capillary bed of the pituitary stalk traverse a longer path and pass through the diaphragma sellae, making it vulnerable to mechanical injury during head trauma or compressive effect due to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). This can cause ischemic necrosis of the adenohypophysis, resulting in hypopituitarism. These vessels supply the anterolateral portion of the pituitary that contains somatotrophs and gonadotrophs, which explains the pattern of early hormonal loss. Deficiency of GH is most commonly seen, followed by deficiency of ACTH, gonadotropins, and TSH. The short hypophyseal portal vessels drain the capillaries below the diaphragma sellae (near the lower infundibulum), supply the medial and anterior adenohypophysis, and run less chance of disruption and permanent damage. As a result, corticotropes and thyrotropes supplied by short portal vessels are less frequently involved. Low blood pressure, anemia, and hypoxia can cause ischemic changes of the gland. Injury to the stalk also affects hypothalamic neural regulation of the pituitary.

Adult hypothyroidism — scope, screening, and therapy emphasize that the guidelines primarily address ambulatory patients with biochemically confirmed primary hypothyroidism whose thyroid status has been stable for at least several weeks and do not deal with myxedema coma. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations but is not sufficient for assessing hospitalized patients or when central hypothyroidism is either present or suspected, and the standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine which must be tailored to the individual patient.

### Thyroid diseases and cerebrovascular disease [^716c9350]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Acute cerebral ischemia has been described in different diseases of the thyroid gland, and not only as a result of thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke. The purpose of this review is to summarize the studies on the relationship between thyroid diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, discussing the main findings for overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, as well as for subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Summary Of Review

In overt hyperthyroidism, cardioembolic stroke is clearly associated to thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, and in subclinical hyperthyroidism with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels < 0.1 mU/L, the incidence of atrial fibrillation is increased. Although in vitro and in vivo studies indicate a hypercoagulability state in hyperthyroidism, there is insufficient evidence to prove that this state leads to an increased risk of cardiac emboli. However, the hypothesis that overt hyperthyroidism may cause acute cerebral venous thrombosis is intriguing. Possible associations between hyperthyroidism and Moyamoya or Giant cell arteritis have only been described in case reports. There is enough evidence that overt hypothyroidism is associated with several traditional and newer atherosclerotic risk factors, especially hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia. For subclinical hypothyroidism, these associations are less certain. Hypothyroidism has been associated with signs of aortic or coronary atherosclerosis, but no case-control or cohort studies have ever investigated hypothyroidism as a possible risk factor for atherothrombotic stroke.

Conclusions

Hyperthyroidism is associated with atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke. Hypothyroidism is associated with a worse cardiovascular risk factor profile and leads to progression of atherosclerosis. Associations between hyperthyroidism and acute cerebral venous thrombosis, Moyamoya, and Giant cell arteritis have been suggested, but sound evidence is lacking. Additional studies are needed to clarify these issues.

### Low free triiodothyronine predicts poor functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke [^3e6401dd]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of admission serum thyroid hormone concentration with clinical characteristics and functional outcomes in patients after acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

We retrospectively enrolled 398 consecutive patients admitted to our stroke center between July 2010 and April 2012. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) were evaluated upon admission. Neurological severity was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) upon discharge. Poor outcome was defined as a mRS score of 3–5 or death (mRS score 6). Separate analyses were conducted according to outcome and quartile serum FT3 concentration.

Results

In total, 164 patients (41.2%) demonstrated a poor outcome. Age, male gender, blood glucose level, arterial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, smoking, NIHSS score, cardioembolic stroke type, and periventricular hyperintensities, but not FT4 or TSH, were significantly associated with poor functional outcome. Furthermore, poor functional outcome was independently associated with low FT3 (< 2.29pg/mL). In comparisons between FT3 quartiles (Q1 [≤ 2.11pg/mL], Q2 [2.12–2.45pg/mL], Q3 [2.46–2.77pg/mL], Q4 [≥ 2.78pg/mL]), patients with poor outcomes were more frequent in Q1 than in Q4 after multivariate adjustment. Death was more frequent in Q1 than in Q4 after adjustment for risk factors and comorbidities, but this difference was non-significant after additional adjustment for age and NIHSS score.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that a lower FT3 value upon admission may predict a poor functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Further large-scale prospective studies are required to clarify the role of thyroid hormone in the acute phase of ischemic stroke.

### What is the impact of acute endocrine and metabolic alterations on long-term ischemic stroke prognosis: a prospective study [^2f70e22c]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The current study had several limitations. First, considering the dynamic stress changes, assessment over multiple time points can better reflect the alterations status over time than only one-time point which was evaluated here, thus we have applied extra sensitivity analysis considering patients' admission within 1 day2, 3 day3, and 7 days, and found that the potential time window relates to long-term stroke prognosis of stress degrees maybe after 3 days. Second, this is a single-center study despite the study sample capacity was not small, a larger sample size research or external validation is promising to validate our results in the future. Third, we didn't consider patients' baseline thyroid before stroke which is hard to obtain as such acute events can not be plannable, but we have compared the group level of stroke patients and healthy controls that could indicate the acute alterations of the HPT axis in some degrees and SHR is a commonly used which take background blood glucose into consideration, shooter research can prove the relationship but not the causality between the thyroid parameters and stroke prognosis, more studies on the differences between pre-stroke and stress thyroid hormone abnormity can be done to further validate the link between thyroid hormones and stroke.

In summary, high degrees of stress on acute stroke attacks, evidenced by strong endocrine and metabolic changes, may aggravate long-term ischemic stroke prognosis, and timely stress-reduced interventions may help promote post-stroke qualified living that is equally important as survival.

Endocrine complications — thyroid surveillance recommends that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels should be checked at 1 year post-HCT or sooner in case of symptoms and annually thereafter, and notes that patients with exposure to CNS radiation are at risk for central hypothyroidism where TSH alone is unreliable; hypothyroidism can be identified by a low free T4 plus low TSH with a history of hypothalamic-pituitary insult.

### Does pituitary radiotherapy increase the risk of stroke and, if so, what preventative actions should be taken? [^92a14037]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy for pituitary adenomas is a well-established and effective treatment, but it has been linked to a number of complications, including an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease and mortality. Possible underlying mechanisms include the direct effects of radiation on cerebral vasculature and deficiencies in specific pituitary hormones. Higher administered dose of radiotherapy is one of the main predictors of stroke. Although treatment strategies for stroke prevention in patients treated with pituitary radiotherapy have not been studied, using the lowest effective radiation dose and ensuring hormone deficiencies are adequately treated may be beneficial in reducing the risk of stroke.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^3739e1af]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Implications of findings

Our findings may have important implications for research and clinical practice. The finding that long term outcomes remain similar across a wide range of "normal" TSH concentrations supports flexibility in the levothyroxine dosing schemes to preserve TSH within the normal range. Extrapolating, this is also supportive of the not uncommonly overlooked importance of an individual's set point in thyroid homoeostasis, as opposed to the laboratory reference. Related to the above, the local, tissue level activation or inactivation of thyroid hormones by deiodination (D2 and D3 deiodinases, which are critical determinants of the cytoplasmic triiodothyronine pool) may provide the individual with the necessary buffering capacity to control the activation of thyroid receptors at the tissue level according to the individual's needs, provided that this buffering capacity is not overwhelmed by high or low hormone concentrations. From a clinical perspective, this study provides strong support for the current recommendations on the clinical management of hypothyroid patients and validates with hard evidence the latest American Thyroid Association and British Thyroid Association guidelines.

Conclusions

Using repeated measures of TSH concentration over time in a well balanced and highly powered study population, we observed no clinically meaningful difference in the pattern of long term health outcomes, including all cause mortality, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation, all fractures, and fragility fractures, in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism when TSH concentrations lie within normal limits. However, targets for individual patients should be considered in line with their clinical needs.

Thyroid steal syndrome is an extremely rare condition characterized by recurrent transient ischemic attacks. It is usually detected by the presence of an enlarged thyroid gland or thyroid dysfunction on examination. Herein, the authors reported a case of a severe patient with recurrent cerebellar infarction due to thyroid steal syndrome, which was initially considered to be due to intracranial arterial stenosis based on the patient's computed tomography angiogram but was later found to be due to circulation shunt caused by goiter.

### Clinical review: the thyroid in mind: cognitive function and low thyrotropin in older people [^d050a7fd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Table 3.
Possible mechanism for association of cognitive impairment with SH or low serum TSH

An alternative explanation (explanation B) is that the organic brain diseases causing cognitive impairment also reduce TRH secretion from the hypothalamus and other brain areas. This would have a "knock-on" effect leading to lower TSH secretion and hence reduced thyroid hormone turnover (production and excretion) — in effect, a state of mild central hypothyroidism. There is little evidence to either support or refute this contention. It is known that there are projections from many areas of the brain to the paraventricular nucleus containing the TRH-secreting neurons, such as the C1–3 adrenergic neurons of the brainstem, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, and the neurons of the hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus, which exert different effects on the hypophysiotropic TRH neurons. Furthermore, TRH is not only released from the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus but is also localized in neurons of the septal nuclei, preoptic area, raphe nuclei of the medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Thus, TRH has a more generalized role as a central nervous system (CNS) neurotransmitter, and the brain involution of the dementia process may lead to a widespread perturbation of neurotransmitters, including TRH. If we accept this explanation as being plausible, then paradoxically, a study of thyroid hormone supplementation in dementia might be warranted.

A third explanation refers back to our understanding of thyroid hormone metabolism in older age. With this mechanism, one has to consider that low serum TSH (and indeed higher FT4) may be a marker of biological age, reflecting reduced hepatic clearance of thyroid hormones (including reduced type 1 deiodinase activity) and a consequent reduction in thyroid axis turnover. The well-established observation that older people with hypothyroidism require less levothyroxine replacement is the clinical correlate of this phenomenon. In effect, the epidemiological studies reviewed above identify a group of individuals within a cohort who have more advanced biological age, using TSH as the biomarker. These individuals therefore have an excess of the degenerative disorders of advanced age, which includes cognitive impairment and dementia. Compellingly, SH is also associated with excess rates of atrial fibrillation, vascular events, low bone mineral density, fracture, and reduced muscle strength. Thus, dementia can be viewed as another noncausal association of low TSH/SH.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for poor functional outcome after ischemic stroke [^db751878]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke and atrial fibrillation. However, its impact on functional outcome after stroke remains unexplored.

Methods

A total of 165 consecutively recruited patients admitted for ischemic stroke were included in this observational prospective study. Blood samples were taken in the morning within 3 days after symptom onset, and patients were divided into the following 3 groups: subclinical hyperthyroidism (0.1 < thyroid-stimulating hormone ≤ 0.44 μU/mL), subclinical hypothyroidism (2.5 ≤ thyroid-stimulating hormone < 20 μU/mL), and euthyroid state (0.44 < thyroid-stimulating hormone < 2.5 μU/mL). Patients with overt thyroid dysfunction were excluded. Follow-up took place 3 months after stroke. Primary outcome was functional disability (modified Rankin Scale), and secondary outcome was level of dependency (Barthel Index). Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders. Variables previously reported to be affected by thyroid function, such as atrial fibrillation, total cholesterol, or body mass index, were included in an additional model.

Results

Nineteen patients (11.5%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 23 patients (13.9%) had subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a substantially increased risk of functional disability 3 months after stroke compared with subjects with euthyroid state (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–6.82, adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and time of blood sampling). The association remained significant, when including the baseline NIHSS, TIA, serum CRP, atrial fibrillation, body mass index, and total cholesterol as additional variables (odds ratio, 3.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–12.47), and was confirmed by the secondary outcome (Barthel Index: odds ratio, 9.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.08–39.89).

Conclusions

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for poor outcome 3 months after ischemic stroke.

Assessment and management of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in patients who had an acute stroke

General management principles

The critical aspect towards the successful management of sodium and water perturbations requires a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism, accurate clinical assessment of the volume status of the patient (ie, hypovolaemia, euvolaemia or hypervolaemia), and identification of whether the hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia is acute (< 48 hours) or chronic (≥ 48 hours) as management strategies differ. In order to establish the diagnosis and aetiology of hyponatraemia, a careful history and physical examination is required and biochemical investigations such as serum sodium, urine sodium, serum osmolality, urine osmolality, thyroid function tests and 8:00 hour serum cortisol may be needed. Management should then target towards treating the underlying aetiology and correcting the hyperosmolality or hypoosmolality.

What this paper adds

An overview of the neurological manifestations of thyroid dysfunction.
Detailed characterization of the genetic 'brain-thyroid' disorders.

The thyroid gland plays a fundamental role in normal human development and maintenance, and it is therefore not surprising that genetic and acquired disorders of thyroid metabolism often include prominent neurological dysfunction (Table I). The classical example of congenital hypothyroidism (or 'cretinism') clearly demonstrates this association between abnormal thyroid function and neurological deficits. Affected infants are at substantial risk of neurocognitive difficulties if-thyroxine treatment is delayed, whereas prompt institution of treatment usually results in normal intellectual development. Other neurological features seen in congenital and later onset hypothyroidism include anxiety, depression, carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, headache, visual field defects, and coma. At the other end of the spectrum, patients with hyperthyroidism have been reported to have an even wider range of neurological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, psychosis, encephalopathy, marked tremor, Graves ophthalmopathy, muscle weakness, and even cerebrovascular events. Less frequently, deterioration in cognitive function (affecting memory, attention, and planning), headaches, seizures, myasthenia, dysphonia, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and chorea, have been found in association with hyperthyroid states.

Table I
Aetiology, and biochemical and clinical features of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, and benign hereditary chorea

The pathophysiological processes underpinning the neurological symptoms in hypothyroid and hyperthyroid states are likely to be multifactorial, and include (1) autoimmune mechanisms, for example in Hashimoto encephalopathy (thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, or thyroid microsomal thyroid autoantibodies, association with autoimmune vasculitis), Graves disease (thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies), and thyroid dysfunction related to myasthenia gravis; (2) 'channelopathy' as seen in thyrotoxic periodic paralysis; (3) adrenergic hypersensitivity associated with hyperthyroid tremor; and (4) ischaemia in vascular strokes in patients with hyperthyroid and atrial fibrillation. However, the primary processes governing many neurological features (e.g. cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric symptoms) in abnormal thyroid states are not yet fully elucidated, and are likely to be complex as a consequence of both the primary and secondary effects of thyroid dysfunction on metabolic cellular processes and neuronal networks.

Acute endocrine and metabolic alterations and stroke prognosis

As shown in Fig. 1, patients attacked by acute ischemic stroke tended to have significantly lower levels of fT3 (4.46 ± 0.83 versus 4.93 ± 0.72 pmol/L, P = 0.002), fast blood glucose (4.69 ± 0.68 versus 5.67 ± 1.75 mmol/L, P = 0.032) and SHR (8.3 ± 1.2 versus 9.1 ± 2.4 nmol/L, P = 0.025) than healthy controls. Furtherly, stroke patients with severe stroke (baseline NIHSS > 3) tended to have significantly lower levels of total thyroxine (100 ± 22.8 versus 103 ± 18.6 nmol/L, P = 0.032) and fT3 (4 ± 0.92 versus 4.5 ± 0.64 pmol/L, P = 0.028). Additionally, those with poor 1-year stroke prognosis (mRS > 2) tended to have significantly lower levels of fT3 (4.3 ± 1.14 versus 4.56 ± 0.73 pmol/L, P = 0.019) and Hb1Ac (6.22 ± 1.38 versus 6.65 ± 1.69%, P = 0.023), and significantly higher levels of SHR (9.4 ± 2.1 versus 8.8 ± 1.9 nmol/L, P = 0.001).

### Utility of routine thyroid-stimulating hormone determination in new-onset atrial fibrillation in the ED [^dfe72ec3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperthyroidism is a relative uncommon but important cause of atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of routine thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) determination in the emergency department (ED) in patients presenting to the ED with stable, new-onset atrial fibrillation. We derive a set of clinical criteria in which TSH is likely to be normal and therefore thyroid function evaluation deferrable to a different time from ED visit.

Methods

Cross-sectional observational study in a university hospital. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was measured in all patients admitted to the ED observational unit for new-onset atrial fibrillation in a 30 consecutive months' period. Patients' clinical characteristics and treatment received in the ED were recorded. Recursive partitioning analysis technique was used to determine which predictors were associated with a TSH level less than 0.35 μIU/mL.

Results

Of 433 patients enrolled, 47 (10.8%) had a low TSH. Thyroid-stimulating hormone highly correlated with FT3 and FT4 levels (P < .001) confirming its good predictive value as screening tool. Recursive partitioning analysis showed that previous thyroid disease (P < .01), stroke/transient ischemic attack (P < .01), and hypertension (P = 0.10) were associated with low TSH. The final model had sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 31%, corresponding to a negative likelihood ratio of 0.02 (0.01–0.07).

Conclusion

Hyperthyroidism is present in nearly 10% of new-onset atrial fibrillation. Although thyroid function screening is recommended in all patients, a simple model that included previous thyroid disease, stroke, and hypertension might help to identify those patients at high risk (low TSH) in the ED.

### Genome-wide analyses identify a role for SLC17A4 and AADAT in thyroid hormone regulation [^37c9872e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid dysfunction is a common clinical condition, affecting ~10% of the general adult population. Adequate thyroid hormone levels are essential for normal growth and differentiation, regulation of energy metabolism, and physiological function of virtually all human tissues. Thyroxine (T4) is the prohormone produced by the thyroid, which is largely converted into the active hormone 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. Circulating T4 levels are regulated by the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis, in which pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates T4 production. In turn, T4 and T3 negatively regulate TSH synthesis via a negative feedback loop.

To exert their actions, T4 and T3 cross the membranes of target cells via specific transporters. Once intracellular, they are metabolized, including the conversion of T4 to T3, followed by binding of T3 to its nuclear receptor to regulate transcription of target genes. Both T4 and T3 transport and metabolism are therefore key determinants of thyroid hormone action.

In daily clinical practice, thyroid function is assessed by measuring circulating TSH and free T4 (FT4) levels, with increased TSH indicating hypothyroidism and decreased TSH indicating hyperthyroidism. FT4 levels are decreased in overt hypothyroidism, increased in overt hyperthyroidism and in the reference range in subclinical hypo and hyperthyroidism. In the last decade, it has become clear that not only overt but also subclinical hypo and hyperthyroidism are associated with several pathological conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, stroke, depression, as well as cardiovascular and overall mortality –. More recently, studies have shown that even variation in thyroid function within the normal range is associated with many of these complications. Despite the physiological significance of thyroid hormones, as well as the prevalence and clinical importance of thyroid dysfunction, many key players in the regulation of thyroid hormone bioavailability and action, including its transport and metabolism, still need to be elucidated.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^e995408b]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Results

The study population included 162 369 patients with hypothyroidism; we excluded 1930 patients with a baseline TSH measurement only and no subsequent measurement. The remaining 160 439 included patients contributed a total of 1 073 038 person years, with a median follow-up of 6 years (supplementary table A); 23.2% (n = 37 226) of patients were men, and 76.8% (n = 123 213) were women. The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis of hypothyroidism was 58.43 (SD 17.15) years. A total of 863 072 TSH measurements were collected for the analysis.

Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of patients with hypothyroidism for each of the seven outcomes (ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation, all fractures, fragility fractures, and mortality). The number of patients included in the analysis for each of the outcomes varies slightly, as patients with a record of the outcome at baseline were excluded.

### Levothyroxine [^07d48a03]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1–0.5 mU/L for nodules and 0.5–1.0 mU/L for multinodular goiter) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine sodium is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Myxedema Coma - Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, oral thyroid hormone drug products are not recommended to treat this condition. Thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration should be administered.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### Clinical biology of the pituitary adenoma [^0905e9df]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Infections

Immune function is suppressed, increasing susceptibility to sepsis and opportunistic infections reported in up to 50% as a result of immunosuppression and altered immune responses. Cushing's disease may also be a predisposing factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19.

Psychiatric disturbances

Psychiatric and neurocognitive symptoms, including depression and anxiety, mania, and psychosis, are common complications that reduce quality of life, and memory and attention may also be impaired. Depression and cognitive dysfunction may persist after treatment.

Mortality

The standardized mortality ratio is increased from 4- to 16-fold in patients with active/persistent Cushing's disease compared with the general population, mainly from myocardial infarction and stroke. Recent epidemiological results show that death due to cardiovascular disease was increased > 4-fold and mortality rate was 5-fold higher among those with diabetes mellitus and 7-fold higher with persistent hypercortisolism. Risk did not revert to normal with disease remission.

Thyrotrophinoma

TSH-secreting adenomas are very rare, causing secondary hyperthyroidism, which is frequently misdiagnosed. Patients usually present with macroadenomas, and in one-third, co-manifestation of plurihormonal (often GH) secretion is observed. Response to medical therapy with SRLs is often favorable and can be used as a diagnostic test. However, not infrequently, despite surgery and SRL therapy, disease control remains suboptimal. Patients may experience cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation, increasing the risk of stroke. In a retrospective case series, more than half of patients showed morphometrical vertebral fractures associated with age and serum free T4, but not with TSH levels. Patients with adenomas co-secreting TSH and ACTH have an increased a standardized mortality ratio of 1.9 compared with the general population.

### European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) / European association of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation (EACPR) position paper on how to prevent atrial fibrillation endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) [^6a290bef]. Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and endocrine factors — atrial fibrillation (AF) risk and prevention are outlined as follows: Hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus are commonly associated with risk of developing AF, whereas hypothyroidism poses no or reduces risk for arrhythmia. Observational cohort and registry studies reported AF incidence rates of 4.6–13.8% in overt hyperthyroidism, 8.5–12.7% in subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 7.3% in high-normal euthyroidism (based on thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] levels). In subclinical disease, patients are up to 1.68-fold more likely to develop AF during long-term follow-up, and those with suppressed TSH values have 2.54-fold higher risk of incident AF compared with euthyroid populations. AF risk diminishes during antithyroid treatment, with spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm in ~76% of patients and with higher restoration rates in elderly patients with overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism who lack cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. The Rotterdam study reported increased AF risk in individuals with high-normal thyroid function (based on TSH level) and in subjects < 65 years old with higher free thyroxine levels within normal range. In the subclinical form, age and sex affect incident AF risk, being significant in all age categories in women and in young male individuals, except in the older (> 65 years) male population; a meta-analysis also found association with male sex but not with the presence of cardiovascular disease or its risk factors. Subclinical hyperthyroidism was shown to be a predictor of AF in elderly individuals along with advanced age category (> 75 years), male sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and heart failure. Recent studies indicate that thyroid disease is not an independent predictor of AF-related complications such as thromboembolism and stroke. Prevention of AF in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism should include measures such as controlling thyroid function, treatment of associated cardiovascular diseases, and modification of risk factors.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^b066f40a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be considered as a cause of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke having UOsm > 100 mOsm/kg, UNa + > 30 mmol/l and normal extracellular fluid volume. However, its formal diagnosis requires the exclusion of other possible causes of low Na + levels (Figure 1). One such possible cause is adrenal insufficiency. Patients with stroke could be complicated with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary ischaemia or haemorrhage. As in SIADH, hypocortisolism stimulates ADH, and hyponatraemia develops through non-suppressed vasopressin activity. Hyponatraemia owing to hypothyroidism is very rare other than in myxoedema coma, which is also associated with a decrease in cardiac output and glomerular filtration rate.

In SIADH, ADH release occurs independently from effective serum osmolality or circulating volume and might be caused by increased release by the pituitary gland or from ectopic production. Nausea, pain, stress, general anaesthesia and a variety of drugs are non-specific, but remain a potent stimuli for ADH secretion and a frequent cause of SIADH in hospitalized patients with stroke. Commonly used drugs in the community, such as diuretics, proton pump inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other drugs potentially used in the setting of acute stroke, such as antiepileptics (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, sodium valproate) or antipsychotics (i.e. aloperidol) might result in SIADH in patients with stroke. These drugs may result in either increased ADH release or increased susceptibility of the collecting renal duct to the ADH. Infections, such as inspiration pneumonia, are frequent complications of patients with stroke also leading to increased ADH ectopic production and hyponatraemia. Other frequent causes of increased inappropriate ADH secretion include cancers (i.e. small cell lung carcinoma) or central nervous system diseases. Although subarachnoid haemorrhage is the most common central nervous disease associated with SIADH, stroke can also result in increased ADH release. Finally, genetic disorders causing SIADH have been recently identified (i.e. polymorphisms resulting in a loss-of-function of TRPV4, a gain-of-function mutation in the vasopressin 2 receptor).

Recombinant human TSH (thyrotropin alfa) — During follow-up, periodic withdrawal of thyroid hormone therapy has been used to increase serum TSH so that serum Tg measurements with or without iodine‑131 imaging could be performed, but patients dislike withdrawal because it causes symptomatic hypothyroidism. An alternative is intramuscular thyrotropin alfa, which stimulates thyroidal iodine‑131 uptake and Tg release while the patient continues thyroid hormone suppressive therapy and avoids symptomatic hypothyroidism. Administration of thyrotropin alfa is well tolerated; nausea (10.5%) and transient mild headache (7.3%) are the main adverse effects, and it is associated with significantly fewer symptoms and dysphoric mood states than hypothyroidism induced by thyroid hormone withdrawal.

Investigations

She was reviewed at an ear, nose and throat clinic a year prior for vertigo and otalgia. MRI head done on recommendation by the ears, nose and throat team showed possible trigeminal nerve irritation and an incidental finding of a RCC. A pituitary and an internal acoustic meatus MRI scan with contrast done 3 months afterward showed a 6.5×9 mm non-enhancing cyst in the pituitary sella (see figure 1), which appeared to be displacing the normal pituitary tissue superiorly and slightly posteriorly. There was no visible pituitary adenoma on the MRI sections. There was no supra or parasellar extension. The optic chiasm was preserved. The pituitary stalk was not deviated and showed normal enhancement post-contrast. No space-occupying lesion, infarction, mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalous was seen. The cisternal spaces were clear and the grey-white matter interface preserved. No abnormal enhancement following intravenous contrast. Scattered high signal white matter foci were seen and were thought to be most attributable to a low burden of ischaemic small vessel disease. The seventh and eighth cranial nerves had a normal appearance bilaterally with no evidence of an internal acoustic meatus or cerebellopontine angle mass lesion. The internal ear structures appeared intact.

### What is the impact of acute endocrine and metabolic alterations on long-term ischemic stroke prognosis: a prospective study [^abd66cbb]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Post hoc analysis

Medium analysis: acute endocrine and metabolic alterations were significantly related to the baseline NIHSS (r = -0.235, P < 0.001), a well-established factor for ischemic stroke prognosis. The further medium analysis uncovered that the relationships between stress and long-term ischemic stroke prognosis were both dependent and independent from baseline ischemic stroke severity (proportions of medium effect = 40.98%, P < 0.00 1; β direct effect = 0.037, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3); Sensitivity analysis considering stress response in different periods: patients admitted 1 day from the onset, 3 days from the onset, and 7 days from the onset were considered to explore associations of the stress response in different periods with long-term stroke prognosis. Very early endocrine and metabolic alterations may not be related to long-term stroke outcomes (within 1 day: adjusted OR = 4.033, P = 0.086). However, changes in the 3-day and 7-day periods may be meaningful (within 1 day: adjusted OR = 2.981, P < 0.026; within 7 days: adjusted OR = 4.231, P = 0.001) (Supplementary Table 4); Sensitivity analysis: Exploration of stress status and long-term ischemic stroke outcomes with additional consideration of arterial territories. As shown in Supplementary Table 5, after accounting for the territories of infarcted arteries, larger acute endocrine and metabolic variations (fT3 < 4.4 mmol/L and SHR ≥ 8 nmol/L) remained independently associated with poorer prognosis at 3 months (adjusted OR = 3.663, P = 0.001), 6 months (adjusted OR = 4.393, P < 0.001), and one year (adjusted OR = 4.621, P < 0.001).

### Pontine warning syndrome… [^b3c0ec1d]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

A 63-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia was seen with fluctuating right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He had had 2 episodes of complete bilateral horizontal conjugate gaze palsy with unimpaired consciousness lasting for 5 minutes each. His pupils were 4 mm and were equal and reactive to light. Vertical gaze and convergence were preserved. His neurologic status fluctuated between 3 and 15 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Main Outcome Measures Results of computed tomographic angiography, perfusion, and magnetic resonance imaging. Results Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered within a 3-hour window. Fluctuations in motor weakness persisted for 12 hours after receiving thrombolytic therapy. Neuroimaging showed an acute left paramedian pontine infarct with a patent basilar artery. Small-vessel brain disease is a common and potentially devastating disorder.

It constitutes one of the most common causes of isolated pontine strokes, particularly among patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 1 Unfortunately, we know little about stroke mechanisms in patients with fluctuating symptoms and about the role of branch atherosclerotic disease. This is a case report of fluctuating pontine stroke with bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia due to branch atherosclerotic disease. A 63-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia was seen with fluctuating right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He denied previous episodes of transient ischemic attack or stroke. His general physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 167/92 mm Hg, but the findings were otherwise unremarkable. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered at 150 minutes after the onset of symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed an acute left-sided paramedian pontine infarct.

The basilar artery was patent on magnetic resonance angiography. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no cardiac source of embolism. Fluctuations in motor weakness persisted for 12 hours after receiving thrombolytic therapy. By the next 24 hours, his neurologic deficit remained unchanged. The patient was discharged with severe right arm weakness, dysarthria, and bilateral horizontal gaze ophthalmoplegia.

### Hemidystonia precipitated by acute pontine infarct [^9402a9d5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

Hemidystonia is frequently due to an underlying structural lesion in the basal ganglia and thalamus. It has been suggested that a preserved corticospinal tract may be required for hemidystonia to manifest. We provide the first report of a patient who presented with rapid-onset hemidystonia precipitated by an acute pontine infarct demonstrated on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Acute dysregulation of pallidal efferents to the pedunculopontine and/or pontine afferents to the thalamus may precipitate hemidystonia.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^b3b44ec1]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis using repeated measures of TSH concentration over time, we investigated whether maintaining TSH at different concentrations across the "normal" and "abnormal" range in hypothyroid patients was associated with long term adverse outcomes. We found no difference in mortality rates within the recommended normal TSH range of 0.4–4 mIU/L; however, mortality was higher in the lowest TSH category (< 0.1 mIU/L) and for concentrations above 4 mIU/L. Similarly, we observed no increase in risk of ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation, and fractures in patients with hypothyroidism across TSH concentrations within the specified normal range. The risk of heart failure was elevated when TSH was above 10 mIU/L and lower when TSH was below 0.4 mIU/L. Interestingly, we found a higher risk of fragility fractures for TSH above 10 mIU/L, driven predominantly by women and patients aged over 65 years.

We explored whether the findings were robust in sex and age specific analyses. The cardiovascular effects of subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism have been studied in great detail, and evidence suggests that these may be age related, although this has not been universally confirmed. Age seems to have a rather neutral effect when variation of thyroid function within the reference range is studied. We found little evidence to suggest a differential pattern of response on the basis of sex or age within the recommended normal range. Some evidence existed of reduced risk of stroke/transient ischaemic attack in women and patients aged over 65 years when TSH concentrations were within 3–4 mIU/L, but this was offset by a higher risk of atrial fibrillation in those aged over 65 years. At TSH 3–3.5 mIU/L, we also found some evidence of a decrease in mortality in men and a decrease in risk of fracture in patients aged 65 years or under. These findings may be the result of multiple testing, although each result occurs within the 3–4 mIU/L concentration range.

Cardiovascular diseases

Table 2 shows the number of patients who developed each of the outcomes. Incidence rates were higher in men than in women.

Table 2
Sex specific incidence rates of cardiovascular diseases, atrial fibrillation, fractures, and mortality

IHD = ischaemic heart disease; TIA = transient ischaemic attack.

After adjusting for potential confounders, we found a statistically significant increase in risk of ischaemic heart disease and heart failure at high TSH concentrations (> 10 mIU/L) compared with the reference category (2–2.5 mIU/L) (hazard ratio 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.38; P = 0.03) and 1.42 (1.21 to 1.67; P < 0.001), respectively (fig 1 and supplementary tables B and C). This was not the case for stroke/transient ischaemic attack; however, the risk was marginally reduced at TSH concentrations of 3–3.5 mIU/L (hazard ratio 0.86 (0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.04) and 4–10 mIU/L (0.90 (0.80 to 1.00; P = 0.05)) (fig 1 and supplementary table D). At low TSH concentrations (< 0.4 mIU/L), no association with ischaemic heart disease or stroke/transient ischaemic attack was present, but we observed a protective effect for heart failure (hazard ratio 0.79 (0.64 to 0.99; P = 0.04) for TSH < 0.1 mIU/L and 0.76 (0.62 to 0.92; P = 0.006) for 0.1–0.4 mIU/L).

### Effects of atrial fibrillation screening according to thyroid function: post hoc analysis of the randomized LOOP study [^99388df3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a marker for atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke risk.

Objective

This study explored the effects of AF screening according to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

Methods

An AF screening trial (the LOOP study) was analyzed post hoc according to baseline TSH. The primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism (SE). Secondary outcomes included major bleeding, all-cause death, and the combination of stroke, SE, and cardiovascular death.

Results

TSH measurements were available in 6003 of 6004 trial participants, 1500 randomized to implantable loop recorder (ILR) screening for AF and anticoagulation upon detection vs 4503 to usual care; mean age was 74.7 ± 4.1 years and 2836 (47%) were women. AF detection was approximately triple for ILR vs usual care across TSH tertiles (adjusted P interaction = 0.44). In the first tertile, screening was associated with decreased risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% CI 0.30–0.90; P = 0.02) and stroke, SE, or cardiovascular death (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34–0.84; P = 0.006) compared with usual care, while no effect was observed among participants with higher TSH (adjusted P interaction .03 and .01, respectively). There was no effect on other outcomes. Analyses of continuous TSH or excluding those with abnormal TSH or thyroid medication showed similar results.

Conclusion

AF screening and subsequent treatment was associated with decreased stroke risk among participants with low TSH, though the yield of screening was similar across TSH levels. TSH may be useful as a marker to indicate benefit from AF screening vs overdiagnosis and overtreatment. These findings should be considered exploratory and warrant further study.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^94c97b90]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — Postoperative levothyroxine to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is considered optimal for higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, and the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring suppression to individual risk. For known residual carcinoma or high risk of recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mIU/L; for disease-free, low-risk patients, TSH should be maintained at the normal range; and for low-risk patients with imaging negative but concerning Tg, TSH should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mIU/L. Potential toxicities include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis; therefore, an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended when TSH is chronically suppressed, and reports do not suggest altered bone mineral density in patients receiving levothyroxine.

### Sleep disruption following paramedian pontine stroke [^16ff68bd]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pontine structures are critical for the generation of rapid eye movement sleep but there are only a few reports of the effects of focal pontine lesions on sleep patterns in humans. We report the case of an 81-year-old man admitted for the acute onset of disordered speech and motor deficit in the upper right arm who developed hypersomnia within a week. A 24-hour polysomnographic study revealed a very severe disruption of both circadian rhythm and sleep organisation, and a brain MRI documented an ischaemic lesion of the anterior left paramedian portion of the pons. Our observation suggests that even small, paramedian pontine ischaemic lesions can acutely induce a very severe sleep disorder.

### Central hypothyroidism and Sturge-Weber syndrome [^d651736b]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare disorder manifesting with a facial port-wine birthmark and a vascular malformation of the brain. Infants and children present with seizures and stroke-like episodes with focal neurologic deficits. Our previous investigations revealed that growth-hormone deficiency occurs with an increased prevalence in Sturge-Weber syndrome, presumably secondary to involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We have continued to screen for hormonal abnormalities in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, specifically those from our multidisciplinary center for patients with this condition. We describe 2 children out of 83 (2.4%) with Sturge-Weber syndrome and brain involvement who were evaluated at our center and diagnosed with central hypothyroidism, based on clinical signs and laboratory findings. This prevalence is much higher than that of central hypothyroidism in the general population. Although it is well-known that anticonvulsants can lead to abnormalities in thyroid function tests, including central hypothyroidism, patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome carry the additional risk of developing hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, secondary to their central nervous system dysfunction. Therefore, it is important that patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome undergo routine thyroid-function testing, especially in the face of any clinical manifestations.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^472a8176]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and risk for incident ischemic stroke among postmenopausal women [^698ce94f]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is postulated to increase stroke risk via atherogenic changes associated with abnormal thyroid function. However, the direct relationship of SCH with subsequent stroke is poorly studied.

Methods

In this nested case-cohort study, we prospectively evaluated the association between any SCH and severity of SCH in relation to incident ischemic stroke risk among postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. Trained Women's Health Initiative staff, masked to thyroid status, adjudicated stroke cases. We assessed thyroid function using baseline blood specimens. Women with normal free thyroxine levels and thyrotropin (TSH) levels ≥ 4.69mU/L were considered to have SCH. Primary analysis included 639 ischemic stroke cases and 2927 randomly selected subcohort members with an average of seven years of follow-up.

Results

The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) from weighted Cox models were 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77, 1.46) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.47) for women with any SCH and with mild SCH (TSH 4.69 to 6.99mU/L), when compared with women with normal thyroid function. The HR for moderate/severe SCH (TSH ≥ 7.00mU/L) was modestly elevated (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.73, 2.05).

Conclusions

We found no evidence to suggest an association between SCH and ischemic stroke among healthy postmenopausal women.

### Central hypothyroidism: advances in etiology, diagnostic challenges, therapeutic targets, and associated risks [^03d97f1b]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Central hypothyroidism is a rare disorder resulting from impaired thyroid hormone production due to deficiencies in TSH secretion from the pituitary or TRH secretion from the hypothalamus. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of central hypothyroidism, with an emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on genetic and acquired causes, particularly those related to hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and the effects of surgical and radiotherapeutic interventions. Diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies, including levothyroxine therapy and monitoring, are analyzed.

Results

Early diagnosis requires simultaneous measurement of free T4 and TSH to prevent neurological sequelae, especially in congenital cases. Central hypothyroidism is associated with risks such as growth and developmental impairment, as well as metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances. Levothyroxine therapy is crucial for correcting hormonal deficits and improving patient outcomes; however, careful dosing is necessary to avoid potential complications, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Conclusions

Personalized treatment and continuous monitoring are essential to optimize clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life in affected individuals. A thorough understanding of central hypothyroidism's etiology and management is necessary to improve early detection and therapeutic strategies.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^cded62c1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) — lipids and cardiovascular risk: Across included studies, 82% defined SCH as normal T4 with TSH 5–10 mIU/L and 18% as normal T4 with TSH 10 to 20 mIU/L; SCH cohorts generally show lipid abnormalities, with higher total cholesterol and LDL-C reported even when TSH < 10 mIU/L, though some studies find elevations only when TSH > 10 mIU/L. Lipid levels decrease after levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, with an Endocrine Society meta-analysis showing reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG after LT4 while lipids did not change in untreated SCH. Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data indicate increased CV events at TSH > 10 mIU/L; overall stroke risk was not increased for adults with SCH (TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L) but was significantly higher in those younger than 65 years, and across TSH 4.5 to 6.9, 7.0 to 9.9, and 10–19.9 mIU/L, fatal stroke rose with higher TSH without a significant trend. An individual participant meta-analysis (11 studies; 55 287 adults, including 3450 with SCH) found increased CVD risk with TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L but not at lower TSH; CHD mortality was increased for TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L and 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L, reaching statistical significance only in the higher TSH group.

### Thyroid hormone suppression therapy [^ed139a29]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression therapy is designed to lower serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels using doses of thyroid hormone in excess of what would normally be required to maintain a euthyroid state. The basis of this therapy is the knowledge that TSH is a growth factor for thyroid cancer, so that lower serum TSH levels might be associated with decreased disease activity. However, clinical studies have not documented improved outcomes with TSH suppression, except in patients with the most advanced disease. Furthermore, there are a number of negative outcomes related to aggressive thyroid hormone therapy, including osteoporosis, fracture, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a graded approach to TSH suppression is recommended by the American Thyroid Association, based on initial risk and ongoing risk assessment.

Capsular warning syndrome

The capsular warning syndrome is one of the most dramatic presentations in stroke medicine. In this striking phenomenon, in situ disease of a single penetrating artery is thought to cause fluctuating ischaemia and neuronal dysfunction limited to the internal capsule. The early stroke risk is high. Many attacks can occur in a short period of time (eg, 24–48 h) leading to suspicions of seizures or functional disorder in some patients. A similar phenomenon relating to pontine perforating artery ischaemia ("pontine warning syndrome") is also described.

TABLE 5
Distribution of clinical signs comparing patients with and without spontaneous nystagmus.

The full clinical beside HINTS examination was only performed by research personnel or ED physicians in 33% (Table 4) of cases. Overall, the HINTS results supported a central etiology in 29% of patients (30% in posterior circulation stroke and 24% in anterior circulation stroke) and a peripheral pathology in 4% of patients (4% in posterior circulation stroke and 6% in anterior circulation stroke). There was only one patient without SN on whom all three tests were performed and who showed no gaze‐evoked direction‐changing nystagmus, no skew deviation, and no catch‐up saccades on the head impulse test. This patient was classified neither as "central HINTS" nor as "peripheral HINTS".

Risk factors

Arterial hypertension was the most frequent risk factor encountered in this study's population (66%), and dyslipidemia was present in 39% of all stroke patients (Table S1). Most patients had a history of cardiovascular disease (66%). Almost 30% had a known central neurological disease, and up to 20% had an endocrinological disease (e.g. diabetes, hypothyroidism) (Table S2). Table S3 shows the most common therapeutic agents given, with antihypertensive medication predominating.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^e93ad3f6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

### Endocrine alterations in critically ill patients with stroke during the early recovery period [^97b15ce9]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endocrine abnormalities in critically ill patients with stroke during the early recovery period have not been well characterized.

Methods

To investigate this issue, 33 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients (27 men) with hemorrhagic (n = 21) or ischemic (n = 12) stroke having a mean age of 57 ± 12 years were studied. Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission in the hospital was 8 ± 3. The following basal hormones were measured within 72 hours postextubation: cortisol, corticotropin (ACTH), free thyroxine, tri-iodothyronine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Subsequently, a low-dose (1 microg) ACTH stimulation test was performed.

Results

Twenty-six (79%) patients showed endocrine alterations. The most common change was low IGF-1 levels compatible with growth hormone deficiency (45%), followed by hypogonadism (39%), thyroid dysfunction (36%), and cortisol hyporesponsiveness (33%).

Conclusion

Neuroendocrine changes occur with high frequency in critically ill patients with stroke during the early recovery period. It remains to be determined whether these changes have implications for functional and/or clinical outcome.

### Recovery from locked-in syndrome | JAMA neurology… [^bb1b90b1]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

A, Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 day after the onset of symptoms depicting diffusion restriction in the bilateral posterior cerebral artery territories and pons. B, Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan performed 22 months after his stroke that shows a substantial infarct in the ventral pons. Locked-in syndrome may be classified into 3 categories: the classic form, the incomplete form, and the total form with a completely motionless patient including absence of vertical eye movements. 1 Clinical experience has shown that classic locked-in syndrome from pontine infarction may improve, but rarely, to. A 22-year-old healthy man who exercised 3 to 4 hours daily presented with an acute basilar artery occlusion. Pontine and cerebellar infarctions were found despite aggressive treatment with intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. Follow-up vascular imaging confirmed complete recanalization.

He remained awake and attentive, with a gaze preference to the left and minimal horizontal eye movements to the right. He had a complete flaccid quadriparesis. Vertical eye movements and blinking were preserved. He had a trace of jaw and oropharyngeal movement. His stroke was found to be due to relative dehydration in the setting of a heterozygous mutation for factor V Leiden. At 3 months, he was weaned off the ventilator and tracheostomy was removed. There was a severe dysarthria and some cephalic, but no trunk control. At 6 months, he was able to sit with support of his hands. At 10 months, he was able to ambulate with a walker. At 17 months, he was able to climb stairs. His trajectory of recovery was very gradual but eventually led to a substantial recovery. His follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a large punched-out infarct in the ventral pons.

We documented the clinical trajectory of a patient with a large pontine and cerebellar infarct and were able to confirm substantial improvement. Such an improvement may be more likely in incomplete forms of the syndrome.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^4b5003c6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — Principles of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression state that the use of levothyroxine to maintain low TSH levels is considered optimal for papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, although data are lacking to permit precise specification of serum TSH levels. In general, patients with known structural residual carcinoma or at high risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained below 0.1 mU/L. Patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained at the normal range, and for patients at low risk for recurrence with biochemical evidence but no structural evidence of disease (eg, Tg positive, but imaging negative), maintain TSH levels at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Patients who remain disease free for several years should have their TSH levels maintained within the reference range. Given the potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine — including cardiac tachyarrhythmias (especially in the elderly) and bone demineralization (particularly in post-menopausal women) as well as frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis — the risks and benefits of TSH-suppressive therapy must be balanced for each individual patient. Patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed should be counseled to ensure adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

4.4 Limitations

This was a cross‐sectional study, and it is important for future studies to trace the dynamic evolution of intra‐ and inter‐network FCs in PS patients. Besides, this study was that the inter‐network FCs did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons using either FWE or the false discovery rate method; further studies should recruit a larger sample of PS patients to validate our findings, particularly in terms of left‐ or right‐sided stroke patients, respectively. In addition, future work is also needed to evaluate the differences in functional network connectivities between the pontine stroke and strokes elsewhere, especially the other infratentorial brain regions. Lastly, we only collected PS patients with NIHSS defects, which might lead to sampling bias, a larger sample including patients without NIHSS defects should be further studies to be representative of PS patients more broadly.

Case presentation

This is the case of a 52-year-old woman with a recently diagnosed liver mass with multiple bilateral metastatic pulmonary nodules (figure 1A, B). She had a history of cervical and thyroid cancer 10 and 4 years ago, respectively, both currently in remission. The malignancy was initially detected as a new unexpected liver finding on surveillance imaging for her cervical cancer history. MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography and pathology via CT-guided percutaneous core biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. The patient also had a medical history of hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, asthma, morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, neuropathy and arthritis, as well as a 62 pack-years smoking history. The patient underwent systemic palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine for 5 months, and 6 days after her eighth cycle of chemotherapy, she presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, sudden onset of left upper and lower extremities' weakness and slurred speech for 1 day. The patient also described having mild shortness of breath for a few days and diffuse bilateral wheezing was noted during examination. The patient was not in acute respiratory distress; vital signs and oxygen saturation on room air were within normal limits during this admission. The patient had a medical history of asthma and received a combination of beta-adrenergic and anticholinergic bronchodilator (DuoNeb) which improved her symptoms. With regard to the neurological symptoms, the last known normal (LKN) time was determined as 7 hours prior to admission. A non-contrast head CT scan was unremarkable; however, brain MRI findings were consistent with acute multiple non-haemorrhagic strokes. These infarcts involved the right frontal and temporoparietal areas, in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery bilaterally (figure 2A, B). Infarcts also involved the left cerebellum corresponding to the vascular distribution of the posteroinferior cerebellar artery (figure 2C, D). The patient was admitted to the neurology stroke service for stroke workup and poststroke care. On the second day of hospitalisation, she experienced agitation, worsening dysarthria and left-sided weakness. MRI studies showed a new small infarct in the deep white matter of the right hemisphere, specifically in the right parasagittal frontal lobe (figure 3). On hospital day 5, the patient re-experienced worsening dysarthria and increased weakness at the left upper and lower extremities. There was also sensory deficits to light touch and proprioception at the left side. A repeat brain MRI demonstrated a new stroke within the body of the corpus callosum and right cingulate gyrus (figure 4A, B), as well as the superior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere (figure 4C, D). When compared with the patient's prior brain imaging studies, the remaining acute and subacute strokes were essentially stable in appearance. After this clinical event, the patient had a stable hospital stay until discharge to an acute rehabilitation centre.

### Cognitive impairment after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1b9289a6]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) evaluation and differential diagnosis emphasize delirium workup, assessment of reversible contributors, and attention to depression. Workup for delirium should include assessment of electrolytes; tests of liver and renal function; assessment for infection, constipation, and pain; and a review of medications. To exclude potentially reversible causes of impairment, the clinician should obtain laboratory testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone and vitamin B12 and should consider the potential cognitive effects of mood disorders; sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea; and sedating and anticholinergic medications; and hearing and vision impairments. Poststroke depression is common, affecting about one-third of individuals in the first year after stroke, and because depression-related cognitive symptoms may resolve with the treatment of depression, it is important to screen for poststroke depression; the use of a depression screening tool validated in patients with stroke may aid in recognition. Risk factors for poststroke depression include higher physical disability; prestroke history of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment; and lack of social and family support. Poststroke cognitive decline should be differentiated from prestroke decline by questioning the patient and an informant or using validated informant questionnaires (Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly; Eight-Item Informant Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia) to determine whether cognitive impairment predated the stroke. Biomarkers of the AD pathophysiological process such as β-amyloid and tau can be measured in cerebrospinal fluid or blood or by positron emission tomography; however, such testing is currently expensive, invasive, or not widely available for routine use.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^5d18bb5a]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — adrenal insufficiency precautions in central hypothyroidism emphasize that those with adrenal insufficiency, either primary or central, or at risk for it, should be treated with clinically appropriate doses of hydrocortisone until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out; elevated TSH with normal T4 can occur and, when due to adrenal insufficiency, elevated TSH levels fall with glucocorticoid therapy alone.

### A 10-year-old girl with coexistent moyamoya disease and Graves' disease [^05063956]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

There are rare reports of young women with moyamoya disease associated with Graves' disease; we are unaware of any previous reports of this association in prepubescent girls. We report a 10-year-old girl who presented with multiple bilateral strokes. Cerebral angiography demonstrated moderate to severe stenosis of her bilateral distal internal carotid arteries and proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries, which was greater on the right. Thyroid function tests demonstrated suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone and elevated thyroid hormone levels. Serum antiphospholipid antibody screen demonstrated mild elevations of antiocardiolipin IgG. Possible mechanisms predisposing individuals to concurrent moyamoya and Graves' disease are discussed.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism and cardiovascular disease [^ea8916a0]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: In this narrative review, we assess published data on subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) and its association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. Summary: We present data on the risk of SCHyper in relation to CVD outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), major adverse cardiac events (MACE), CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality. Evidence indicates that SCHyper is associated with an elevated risk of AF, heart failure, MACE, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality. SCHyper appears to have little association with stroke risk and has shown conflicting results regarding CHD risk. Regarding the degree of serum TSH suppression, evidence shows a higher risk of CVD in SCHyper individuals with suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mIU/L) compared with those with low TSH (0.1–0.4 mIU/L). Despite evidence that older individuals are inherently at a higher risk for CVD, no studies have yet demonstrated an age-related increase in the relative risk of CVD in SCHyper. Conclusion: The studies indicate that SCHyper is associated with an increased risk of AF, heart failure, MACE, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality. Considering the importance of the degree of serum TSH suppression and age as risk factors for CVD, treatment decisions should be individualized based on their specific risk factors.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^18725e2c]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To explore whether thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is associated with increased all cause mortality and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and fractures.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a database of electronic patient records from UK primary care.

Participants

Adult patients with incident hypothyroidism from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2017.

Exposure

TSH concentration in patients with hypothyroidism.

Main outcome measures

Ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation, any fractures, fragility fractures, and mortality. Longitudinal TSH measurements from diagnosis to outcomes, study end, or loss to follow-up were collected. An extended Cox proportional hazards model with TSH considered as a time varying covariate was fitted for each outcome.

Results

162 369 patients with hypothyroidism and 863 072 TSH measurements were included in the analysis. Compared with the reference TSH category (2–2.5 mIU/L), risk of ischaemic heart disease and heart failure increased at high TSH concentrations (> 10 mIU/L) (hazard ratio 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.38; P = 0.03) and 1.42 (1.21 to 1.67; P < 0.001), respectively). A protective effect for heart failure was seen at low TSH concentrations (hazard ratio 0.79 (0.64 to 0.99; P = 0.04) for TSH < 0.1 mIU/L and 0.76 (0.62 to 0.92; P = 0.006) for 0.1–0.4 mIU/L). Increased mortality was observed in both the lowest and highest TSH categories (hazard ratio 1.18 (1.08 to 1.28; P < 0.001), 1.29 (1.22 to 1.36; P < 0.001), and 2.21 (2.07 to 2.36; P < 0.001) for TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, 4–10 mIU/L, and > 10 mIU/L. An increase in the risk of fragility fractures was observed in patients in the highest TSH category (> 10 mIU/L) (hazard ratio 1.15 (1.01 to 1.31; P = 0.03)).

Conclusions

In patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, no evidence was found to suggest a clinically meaningful difference in the pattern of long term health outcomes (all cause mortality, atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, fractures) when TSH concentrations were within recommended normal limits. Evidence was found for adverse health outcomes when TSH concentration is outside this range, particularly above the upper reference value.

### Silent thyroiditis… [^8e490be5]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

4 levels) should be treated with levothyroxine to a goal TSH level of 1 to 3 mIU per L. A starting dosage of 1. 6 mcg per kg per day can be initiated, with subsequent incremental changes made every 10 to 12 weeks to achieve this goal. Thyroid hormone therapy should resolve hypothyroid symptoms and may result in a reduction in goiter size. This generally occurs within six months after achievement of euthyroidism. Treatment with thyroid hormone in patients with elevated TPO antibody levels and subclinical hypothyroidism is reasonable, especially if symptoms of hypothyroidism are present. Dosages of 25 to 50 mcg per day of levothyroxine can be initiated in these patients and titrated to the same TSH goals as in overt hypothyroidism. If no thyroid hormone is administered, patients should be monitored annually for the development of overt hypothyroidism.

12 Guidelines exist to direct the family physician in the treatment of women with detectable TPO antibodies who are pregnant or who desire fertility. 14, 15. Postpartum hyperthyroidism and Graves disease are characterized by elevated free thyroid hormones and suppressed TSH; however, postpartum thyroiditis has a lower free T. In postpartum thyroiditis, the hypothyroid phase generally presents at four to eight months postpartum and lasts four to six months, although permanent hypothyroidism occurs in 25% of women. 17 The presenting symptoms typically include fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and cold intolerance. Although most women with postpartum thyroiditis will become euthyroid, treatment with levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum TSH level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a TSH level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility.

Treatment with levothyroxine is generally initiated at 50 mcg per day and titrated to achieve a TSH level between 1 and 2. 5 mIU per L. Given the natural course of postpartum thyroiditis, tapering of levothyroxine may be considered after 12 months of therapy. Women with postpartum thyroiditis and subclinical hypothyroidism should be treated with levothyroxine to achieve a TSH level of less than 2. 5 mIU per L if they are pregnant or desire fertility. 15.
