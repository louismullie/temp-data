## Question

Bilat pneumonia on chest xray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret a chest radiograph showing bilateral pneumonia, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the radiographic diagnosis and characterizing the pattern and distribution. Then, I should correlate with clinical context and severity to refine the differential. Next, I will consider etiologies that commonly present bilaterally, including viral, atypical bacterial, aspiration, and immunocompromised-specific pathogens. After that, I need to check for mimics and complications that can look similar on CXR. Then, I should outline immediate management steps, including empiric therapy, oxygenation, and site-of-care decisions. Finally, I will plan follow-up imaging, escalation pathways, and special populations, while continuously verifying assumptions against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the radiographic diagnosis and characterize the abnormality, because I need to ensure we truly have bilateral pneumonia rather than bilateral interstitial edema or another process. Consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and reticular interstitial changes are the main CXR patterns, and bilateral involvement with peripheral and lower-lobe predominance is common in viral pneumonias such as COVID-19, though this pattern is not pathognomonic and must be integrated with clinical data [^112twE4E] [^111n9NuQ].

> Wait, let me verify the distribution and pattern descriptors before I anchor on an etiology. Bilateral, peripheral, and basal-predominant opacities with ground-glass and consolidation are frequently reported in COVID-19 cohorts, but similar distributions can occur with other viral pneumonias and organizing processes, so I should avoid overcalling COVID-19 solely on pattern recognition and instead correlate with exposure risk, timing, and testing [^112twE4E] [^1157AM7s] [^115qb6b4].

> I need to check the clinical context next, because bilateral pneumonia on CXR carries prognostic implications. Hypoxemia, tachypnea, abnormal vitals, and bilateral involvement increase severity and the likelihood of hospitalization, and bilateral CXR involvement has been associated with higher risk of hypoxemia even in otherwise low-risk community-acquired pneumonia, so I should quantify oxygenation and assess systemic inflammatory markers to guide disposition and empiric breadth [^114a3mVp] [^117B5bG7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I will now examine likely causes that classically present with bilateral involvement, starting with viral pneumonia, particularly COVID-19, which frequently shows bilateral GGO with or without consolidation and peripheral/basal predominance, and evolves over time with a peak around days 5–10 and absorption thereafter, though early CXR can be normal and sensitivity improves with symptom duration and age [^112twE4E] [^1111vx5U] [^112fkjGH].

> Let me consider atypical bacterial pathogens next. Mycoplasma and Chlamydia can produce bilateral interstitial or patchy airspace opacities, and Legionella often shows confluent lower-lobe consolidations that can be bilateral, so I should ask about exposure risks, comorbidities, and epidemiology to prioritize testing and empiric coverage if indicated [^116sB8HP] [^112b53dx].

> I should double-check for aspiration as a driver of bilateral lower-lobe disease, especially in patients with impaired consciousness, dysphagia, or recent vomiting. Aspiration pneumonia commonly manifests as bilateral lower-lobe consolidations and can be multifocal, so I need to review risk factors and consider anaerobic coverage if aspiration is suspected [^1157hADe] [^1154kQqE].

> But wait, what if the host is immunocompromised? In that case, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia typically shows diffuse bilateral interstitial ground-glass infiltrates in a butterfly pattern and may be normal early on CXR, so I should have a low threshold for HRCT and targeted therapy if clinical suspicion is high, particularly in HIV or those on immunosuppression [^112PPoP9] [^111Vg7BC] [^116dJzPo].

> I need to ensure I am not missing noninfectious mimics that can resemble bilateral pneumonia. Heart failure with bilateral interstitial edema, hypersensitivity pneumonitis with bilateral GGO and mosaic attenuation, drug-induced pneumonitis with organizing pneumonia patterns, and eosinophilic pneumonia with peripheral upper-zone consolidation can all confound the picture, so medication review, exposure history, and eosinophil counts can be decisive [^112pzT2m] [^112DMY4w] [^116TN97o].

> Next, I should review for complications that change management. Pleural effusion, cavitation, abscess, and pneumothorax are less common in pure viral COVID-19 and should prompt evaluation for bacterial superinfection or alternative diagnoses, and in non-resolving cases, CT can identify occult effusions, empyema, or alternative pathology that CXR may miss [^112twE4E] [^116mGrfY].

> I will now examine immediate management steps. I should confirm oxygenation and initiate supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94%, start empiric antibiotics per CAP guidelines if bacterial pneumonia is suspected, and decide on site of care using validated severity tools, recognizing that bilateral involvement and hypoxemia push toward higher severity and hospitalization, while also considering local resistance patterns and patient-specific risk factors [^115TSttT] [^112hi12x].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of advanced imaging. CT is more sensitive than CXR for early or subtle disease and is indicated when the CXR is normal but suspicion remains high, when there is clinical deterioration or nonresponse, or when complications are suspected, and in immunocompromised hosts with a normal or equivocal CXR, CT is often necessary to detect disease and guide management [^112ZcqoX] [^112qDqRG] [^116dJzPo].

> Let me reconsider the timing and utility of follow-up imaging. Routine repeat CXR is not needed in clinically improving patients, but if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours or deterioration occurs, repeat CXR or CT is warranted to reassess for complications or alternative diagnoses, and I should remember that radiographic resolution lags clinical recovery, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^113ziszD] [^116mGrfY].

> I should confirm special population considerations. In pediatrics, obtain CXR for hypoxemia, significant distress, or failure to improve, and avoid routine lateral films, whereas in immunocompromised patients, maintain a low threshold for CT and broaden the differential to include opportunistic pathogens, and in suspected COVID-19, integrate imaging with PCR testing and clinical evolution rather than using imaging alone for diagnosis [^113DP3Vq] [^114BLMRZ] [^1112GDfv] [^112oXeY1].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal planning. Document baseline severity, anticipate a 4–6 week window for radiographic resolution in uncomplicated cases, and arrange follow-up if symptoms persist or new red flags arise, while educating the patient about warning signs of deterioration and the possibility of slow radiographic improvement even after clinical recovery [^116mGrfY].

Bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray is defined by **bilateral lung infiltrates** with a **multifocal or diffuse pattern** [^1157hADe], most often in the lower lobes, and may show consolidation, ground-glass opacities, or interstitial changes [^112twE4E]. Common causes include **COVID-19** [^112twE4E], influenza [^114g2QXN], bacterial pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella) [^115TSttT], and aspiration [^1157hADe]. Imaging is essential for diagnosis and monitoring, but findings are **not specific**; correlation with clinical and laboratory data is required [^115TSttT]. Management is guided by severity, etiology, and patient factors, with **empiric antibiotics** for suspected bacterial infection and supportive care [^112hi12x]; prognosis is worse with bilateral involvement, older age, comorbidities, and delayed treatment [^114a3mVp].

---

## Radiographic features

Bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray shows the following **characteristic features**:

- **Distribution**: Multifocal or diffuse, often with lower lobe predominance [^112twE4E] [^115mqNcb].

- **Patterns**: Consolidation, ground-glass opacities, interstitial infiltrates, or mixed patterns [^111n9NuQ].

- **Air bronchograms**: May be present within consolidations [^111Kvv91].

- **Pleural effusion**: Less common but may occur, especially in bacterial pneumonia [^1154kQqE].

---

## Common etiologies

Several **pathogens and conditions** can cause bilateral pneumonia:

| **Etiology** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Viral | - COVID-19 [^112twE4E] <br/> - Influenza [^114g2QXN] <br/> - RSV <br/> - Adenovirus [^116eKNYt] |
| Bacterial | - Streptococcus pneumoniae [^1154kQqE] <br/> - Legionella [^112b53dx] <br/> - Mycoplasma pneumoniae <br/> - Klebsiella pneumoniae [^notfound] |
| Aspiration | - Aspiration pneumonia (bilateral lower lobe involvement) [^1157hADe] |
| Immunocompromised hosts | - Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) [^112PPoP9] <br/> - Fungal infections (Aspergillus, Cryptococcus) [^1154kQqE] |

---

## Clinical significance

Bilateral pneumonia indicates **more severe disease** than unilateral pneumonia and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality [^notfound]. It often reflects advanced infection, immunocompromise, or significant underlying lung disease [^1154kQqE].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis of bilateral pneumonia relies on **clinical evaluation**, radiographic imaging, and laboratory testing:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea), physical examination (crackles, bronchial breath sounds), and vital signs (tachypnea, hypoxemia) [^115iaYzu].

- **Chest X-ray**: Initial imaging modality to confirm bilateral infiltrates and assess severity [^114PtydE].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin), blood cultures, sputum cultures, and viral PCR testing (COVID-19, influenza) [^112DXJyG].

- **CT scan**: Considered when chest X-ray is inconclusive or complications are suspected (e.g. abscess, empyema, pulmonary embolism) [^1157hADe].

---

## Management strategies

Management of bilateral pneumonia depends on the **underlying etiology**, severity, and patient factors:

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Based on likely pathogens, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors (e.g. immunocompromise, aspiration risk) [^112hi12x].

- **Antiviral therapy**: For confirmed viral infections (e.g. COVID-19, influenza) [^116sB8HP].

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, fluid management, and respiratory support (non-invasive or invasive ventilation) as needed [^116sB8HP].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent clinical reassessment, repeat chest X-ray or CT if deterioration occurs, and adjustment of therapy based on culture results and clinical response [^116mGrfY].

---

## Prognostic factors

Several factors influence **prognosis** in bilateral pneumonia:

- **Age**: Older patients have higher mortality and slower recovery [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: COPD, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression worsen outcomes [^notfound].

- **Severity of illness**: Extent of lung involvement, hypoxemia, and need for mechanical ventilation predict poorer outcomes [^117Mp4fk].

- **Timeliness of treatment**: Delayed initiation of appropriate therapy increases mortality [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Bilateral pneumonia can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation [^1136tegM].

- **Sepsis**: Systemic inflammatory response with multi-organ dysfunction [^114a3mVp].

- **Pleural effusion or empyema**: Fluid accumulation in the pleural space, potentially requiring drainage [^116mGrfY].

- **Lung abscess**: Localized collection of pus within the lung parenchyma [^1154kQqE].

- **Long-term sequelae**: Pulmonary fibrosis, chronic respiratory symptoms, and reduced lung function [^1136tegM].

---

## Limitations of chest X-ray

While chest X-ray is the initial imaging modality, it has limitations: early or mild disease may be missed, leading to false negatives [^112ZcqoX]; interobserver variability can affect interpretation [^111Kvv91]; and overlapping structures and patient factors (e.g. obesity, poor inspiratory effort) can obscure findings [^113p3gVT]. CT is more sensitive and specific but involves radiation exposure and higher cost [^112ZcqoX].

---

Bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray is characterized by bilateral lung infiltrates with multifocal or diffuse patterns, often involving the lower lobes. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and management requires a comprehensive approach including clinical evaluation, imaging, and targeted therapy.

### Update: interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury-United States, October 2019 [^111BXeQB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Imaging. Radiographic findings consistent with EVALI include pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and opacities on chest computed tomography (CT) scan. A CXR should be obtained on all patients with a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use who have respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly when accompanied by decreased O 2 saturation (< 95%). Chest CT might be useful when the CXR result does not correlate with clinical findings or to evaluate severe or worsening disease, complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, or other illnesses in the differential diagnosis, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. In some cases, chest CT has demonstrated findings such as bilateral ground glass opacities despite a normal or nondiagnostic CXR. Among patients with abnormal CXR findings and a clinical picture consistent with EVALI, a chest CT scan might not be necessary for diagnosis. The decision to obtain a chest CT should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinical circumstances.

Consultation with specialists. Consultation with several specialists might be necessary to optimize patient management. For patients being evaluated for possible EVALI, consideration should be given to consultation with a pulmonologist, who can help guide further evaluation, recommend empiric treatment, and review the indications for bronchoscopy. The decision to perform bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to rule out alternative diagnoses such as pulmonary infection should be made on a case-by-case basis. The value of staining BAL cells or fresh lung biopsy tissue for lipid-laden macrophages (e.g. using oil red O or Sudan Black) in the evaluation of EVALI remains unknown. In addition, there should be a low threshold for consulting with critical care physicians, because, based upon data submitted to CDC, 47% (159/342) of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit and 22% (74/338) required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (Table); critical care physicians should be consulted to determine optimal management of respiratory failure. Consultation with medical toxicology, infectious disease, psychology, psychiatry, addiction medicine, and other specialists should be considered as warranted by patient circumstances.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112C7R9X]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

High-resolution CT pattern — For patients with suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), "we suggest the integration of HRCT findings characteristic of HP with clinical findings to support the diagnosis of HP, but not using the CT findings in isolation to make a definite diagnosis (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence)". Voting results were "definitely agree, 15; probably agree, 0; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 0; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 0; abstained from voting, 0". Characteristic HRCT findings "include profuse centrilobular nodules of ground-glass attenuation, inspiratory mosaic attenuation and air-trapping, and the three-density sign", and assessment of overall probability should consider disease prevalence in the setting, clinical context, exposure history, and information contributed by HRCT.

Lung imaging in COVID-19 — ultrasound, chest x-ray, and computed tomography findings and limitations: Lung ultrasound has emerged as a rapid, reliable, point-of-care imaging modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly in the setting of significant limitations in current radiographic imaging technologies. Ground-glass opacification, linear opacities, and consolidation are the major chest x-ray (CXR) findings in patients with COVID-19; however, these findings are not specific, and a large proportion of patients with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed disease will have a normal CXR, particularly in the early stages of disease. Chest computed tomography (CT) has also played a central role in the early diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19, with initial findings that include bilateral multilobe ground-glass opacification with a peripheral or posterior distribution, but because the CT findings in COVID-19 infection can overlap with other diseases including influenza, organizing pneumonia, and pulmonary edema, it is not recommended as a sole diagnostic technique. Normal ultrasound evaluation of the lungs demonstrates smooth, regular, contiguous pleural lines, the presence of lung sliding, and A-line artifacts that occur at multiples of the distance between the transducer and the pleural line.

### Chest X-ray findings and temporal lung changes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^114dmHF8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common symptom among our patients was cough followed by fever, which is the common presentation among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide. Three percent of our patients suffered from diarrhea which was described by the patients as the worst diarrhea ever experienced. Diarrhea was also an uncommon symptom in previously reported patients.

The most common chest x-ray finding in our patients was GGO in a peripheral distribution with bilateral lung involvement, there was a lower lobe predilection of the opacities, with the right lower lobe more common than the left lower lobe (70% vs. 50%). Our findings are in consensus with previous studies on chest x-ray and chest CT scans. Only two patients had pleural effusion which is not a common finding on chest imaging. Two patients developed reticulations in the second week from the onset of symptoms, this finding was reported on chest CT scan. However, it was reported earlier in the course of the disease on chest x-ray in one large study.

The chest x-ray severity scores changed over time, peaking at day 5–10 of symptom onset with transformation of the GGO into focal areas of consolidations and into nodular consolidations. A phase of improvement of the findings with decrease in the size and number of the GGO/consolidation and lobes involved and regression of consolidations into GGO was observed in 69% of the patients at day 10–15 from onset of symptoms. The peak and the absorption phases in our study were observed to be earlier than those reported previously [peak phase range at days 6–15, absorption phase range at days 14–17].

Chest x-ray severity score was found in a previous report to be a predictive index of risk for hospital admission and intubation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and mobile chest x-rays were found to be beneficial in the follow up of critically ill COVID-19 patients in another study. In our study, the radiographic findings on chest x-ray in COIVD-19 pneumonia patients are consistent with the radiographic findings detected on chest CT scans and on chest x-rays in previous reports. Also, in our study the presence of symptoms correlated significantly with abnormal chest x-ray findings suggesting that chest x-ray may be helpful as an aiding tool in the diagnosis and follow up in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Clinical and radiological changes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from disease onset to acute exacerbation: a multicentre paired cohort study [^117Mp4fk]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To analyse clinical and radiological changes from disease onset to exacerbation in coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) patients.

Methods

We reviewed clinical histories of 276 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and extracted data on patients who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 severe/fatal pneumonia and had an acute exacerbation starting with mild or common pneumonia.

Results

Twenty-four patients were included. Of these, 8% were smokers, 54% had been to Wuhan, and 46% had comorbidities. Before acute exacerbation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (232.9 ± 88.7) was present, and chest CT scans showed the number of involved lobes was 4 (2–5) and total CT score was 6 (2–8). Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p < 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p < 0.01). The number of involved lobes and CT score after an exacerbation significantly increased to 5 (5–5) and 12 (9–14), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively. CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation.

Conclusions

There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation. An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes. Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis.

Key Points

- The common chest CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia after exacerbation were ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, bilateral distribution, and multifocal lesions.
- An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome.
- Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, chest imaging, AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR in case of diagnostic uncertainty, hypoxemia, significant respiratory distress, or no clinical improvement within 48–72 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111Vme9e]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — HRCT integration: For patients with suspected HP, we suggest the integration of HRCT findings characteristic of HP with clinical findings to support the diagnosis of HP, but not using the CT findings in isolation to make a definite diagnosis (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). High-resolution CT findings characteristic of HP include profuse centrilobular nodules of ground-glass attenuation, inspiratory mosaic attenuation and air-trapping, and the three-density sign. Assessment of the overall probability of HP should consider the prevalence of the disease in the particular setting, the clinical context, the exposure history, and the information contributed by the HRCT.

Scenario 2: Moderate-to-severe features of COVID-19 — imaging is advised for patients with any pretest probability when there are no substantial critical resource constraints, and this applies regardless of the results or availability of COVID-19 testing; in COVID-19-positive patients imaging establishes baseline pulmonary status and, if clinical worsening occurs, imaging is again advised to assess for COVID-19 progression or secondary cardiopulmonary abnormalities such as pulmonary embolism, superimposed bacterial pneumonia, or heart failure; for COVID-19-negative or untested patients, imaging may reveal an alternative diagnosis, and because falsely negative testing is more prevalent in high pretest probability circumstances, repeat COVID-19 testing is therefore advised if available.

During the study period, three patients (23%) progressed rapidly over an average period of 4 days with increase in the total chest x-ray severity score on average from 1 to 7. Only one elderly female patient (80 years) passed away at day 18 of onset of symptoms (Fig. 1). Nine patients (69%) showed improvement in the chest x-ray findings with almost complete resolution of the abnormalities (Fig. 2). The chest x-ray findings in one patient remained stable.

### Immune-related (IR)-pneumonitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: multidisciplinary recommendations for diagnosis and management [^111xn6LA]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging of IR-pneumonitis and COVID-19

The most common appearances of IR-pneumonitis and COVID-19 infection on chest X-ray and chest CT imaging are depicted in figure 1. Since interstitial lung changes are poorly appreciated on chest X-ray, diagnostic chest CT is the recommended imaging modality for the evaluation of IR-pneumonitis. The spectrum of imaging findings of IR-pneumonitis on chest CT are described using radiographic patterns according to American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society classifications of interstitial pneumonias and related conditions including (1) acute interstitial pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pattern; (2) cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) pattern; (3) non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern; and (4) hypersensitivity pneumonitis pattern. Among these, the most common pattern is the COP pattern, characterized by multifocal bilateral parenchymal consolidations and ground glass opacities (GGOs) in a peripheral and lower lung distribution on chest CT. In addition, many patients frequently have diffuse bilateral lung involvement and the distribution is often independent from that of tumor involvement of the lung.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^112oXeY1]. Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Table 2 — Summary of recommendations for imaging: Imaging is not routinely indicated as a screening test for COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals, and imaging is not indicated for patients with mild features of COVID-19 unless they are at risk for disease progression (scenario 1). Imaging is indicated for patients with moderate to severe features of COVID-19 regardless of COVID-19 test results (scenarios 2 and 3) and is indicated for patients with COVID-19 and evidence of worsening respiratory status (scenarios 1, 2, and 3). In a resource-constrained environment where access to CT is limited, chest radiography may be preferred for patients with COVID-19 unless features of respiratory worsening warrant the use of CT (scenarios 2 and 3). Additional recommendations specify that daily chest radiographs are NOT indicated in stable intubated patients with COVID-19, CT is indicated in patients with functional impairment and/or hypoxemia after recovery from COVID-19, and COVID-19 testing is indicated in patients incidentally found to have findings suggestive of COVID-19 on a CT scan.

### Chest X-ray features of SARS-CoV-2 in the emergency department: a multicenter experience from Northern Italian hospitals [^115mqNcb]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the imaging features of routine admission chest X-ray in patients referred for novel Coronavirus 2019 infection.

Methods

All patients referred to the emergency departments, RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Two radiologists (8 and 15 years of experience) reviewed all the X-ray images and evaluated the following findings: interstitial opacities, alveolar opacities (AO), AO associated with consolidation, consolidation and/or pleural effusion. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset (cut-off 5 days) and X-ray imaging and according to age (cut-off 60 years old). Computed tomography was performed in case of a discrepancy between clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings, and/or suspicion of complications.

Results

A total of 468 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Lung lesions primarily manifested as interstitial opacities (71.7%) and AO opacities (60.5%), more frequently bilateral (64.5%) and with a peripheral predominance (62.5%). Patients admitted to the emergency radiology department after 5 days from symptoms onset, more frequently had interstitial and AO opacities, in comparison to those admitted within 5 days, and lung lesions were more frequently bilateral and peripheral. Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones. Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations.

Conclusions

The most common X-ray pattern is multifocal and peripheral, associated with interstitial and alveolar opacities. Chest X-ray, compared to CT, can be considered a reliable diagnostic tool, especially in the Emergency setting.

### The association of clinically relevant variables with chest radiograph lung disease burden quantified in real-time by radiologists upon initial presentation in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 [^117B5bG7]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to correlate lung disease burden on presentation chest radiographs (CXR), quantified at the time of study interpretation, with clinical presentation in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Material and Methods

This retrospective cross-sectional study included 5833 consecutive adult patients, aged 18 and older, hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 with a CXR quantified in real-time while hospitalized in 1 of 12 acute care hospitals across a multihospital integrated healthcare network between March 24, 2020, and May 22, 2020. Lung disease burden was quantified in real-time by 118 radiologists on 5833 CXR at the time of exam interpretation with each lung annotated by the degree of lung opacity as clear (0%), mild (1–33%), moderate (34–66%), or severe (67–100%). CXR findings were classified as (1) clear versus disease, (2) unilateral versus bilateral, (3) symmetric versus asymmetric, or (4) not severe versus severe. Lung disease burden was characterized on initial presentation by patient demographics, co-morbidities, vital signs, and lab results with chi-square used for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariable analysis.

Results

Patients with severe lung disease were more likely to have oxygen impairment, an elevated respiratory rate, low albumin, high lactate dehydrogenase, and high ferritin compared to non-severe lung disease. A lack of opacities in COVID-19 was associated with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypernatremia, and hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

COVID-19 lung disease burden quantified in real-time on presentation CXR was characterized by demographics, comorbidities, emergency severity index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, vital signs, and lab results on 5833 patients. This novel approach to real-time quantified chest radiograph lung disease burden by radiologists needs further research to understand how this information can be incorporated to improve clinical care for pulmonary-related diseases. An absence of opacities in COVID-19 may be associated with poor oral intake and a prerenal state as evidenced by the association of clear CXRs with a low eGFR, hypernatremia, and hypoglycemia.

### Can chest X-ray predict pneumonia severity? [^116skK2H]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2004). Low credibility.

Predictors of the severity of pneumonia have not been thoroughly evaluated among children in developed countries. We investigate whether chest radiographic findings could be used as predictors of severity of childhood pneumonia. The study included 167 children, aged more than 12 months, hospitalized in our department during a 4-year period with unilateral lobar or segmental pneumonia. The durations of fever and of hospitalization were considered indicators of severity of the disease. The size of the consolidation and its location in the left hemithorax were independently associated with severity of the disease. Univariate analysis showed that the mean duration of fever and of hospitalization as well as the prevalence of pleural effusion was significantly higher among children with left-sided pneumonia. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that only the presence of pleural effusion was significantly more likely in left-sided pneumonia (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–6.47; P = 0.031). We conclude that the size of consolidation and the side of its location can be used as predictors of severity of pneumonia, with left-sided pneumonia running a more severe course, possibly due to increased risk for the development of pleurisy.

Conclusions

Chest-CT is a sensitive diagnostic technique that can indicate COVID-19 infection in a compatible clinical setting. However, imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia, most frequently characterized by bilateral GGO in a patchy or lower lobes prevalent distribution, are non-specific and can be observed in many different lung diseases, infectious or not, which should always be considered in the differential diagnosis especially when COVID-19 prevalence in the population is low.

### Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia [^114e4Xyf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 44-year-old asthmatic male patient presented to the health centre with a 3-week history of coryzal symptoms, persistent productive sputum and shortness of breath. The chest X-ray (CXR) revealed symmetrical, perihilar airspace shadowed with peribronchial cuffing and bilateral reticular markings. The patient did not improve despite treatment, and hence a high resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the thorax was recommended. The HRCT showed smooth interlobular septal thickening, central perihilar soft tissue thickening and patches of ground glass changes. Both the CXR and HRCT findings, along with the symptoms and eosinophilia counts, were suggestive of idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP) which was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient was successfully treated with steroids. This case highlights the symptoms, diagnosis, management and treatment of IAEP. A rapid diagnosis of this rare disease is essential since it can be completely cured with correct management but can be fatal if left untreated. Once properly treated, this disease does not recur.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^113g7e1v]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is ongoing use of chest radiographs in the management of suspected community-acquired pneumonia in children by clinicians in the developed world that runs contrary to the recommendations of existing guidelines. There is also continued use of chest radiographs by clinicians in the developing world who have a frequent and well-founded concern regarding the identification of tuberculosis as a cause of acute respiratory disease. Guidelines are designed to assist clinicians but should not be considered prescriptive, especially considering the rapidly evolving presentation of pneumonia, ongoing advances in imaging technology, changes in patient management and differing geographic contexts of the practitioner. In addition, radiologists must work to improve radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia, reach consensus on the interpretive terminology that clarifies their confidence regarding the presence of pneumonia and act to replace one imaging technique with another whenever there is proof of improved accuracy or reliability.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1112GDfv]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

Imaging modalities

Radiographic findings in pneumonia generally fall into three categories: 1) focal non-segmental or lobar pneumonia, 2) multifocal bronchopneumonia, and 3) focal or diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In patients who clinically improve, ATS/IDSA guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up chest imaging. However, in cases where clinical presentation is atypical despite radiographic evidence of pneumonia, repeat CXR is advised to rule out alternative diagnoses. Besides, repeat CXR can show progression of disease, but more importantly may reveal fluid collections (rarely abscess, more commonly pleural effusions) which could represent lack of source control (Fig. 2), like empyema requiring drainage. Radiographic resolution can lag days to weeks beyond clinical improvement. In patients under 50 and those with mild-to-moderate pneumonia, radiographic infiltrates typically resolve within four weeks. Conversely, resolution may take up to 10 weeks in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities and COPD, or severe pneumonia. Slow radiographic resolution alone is not an indicator of treatment failure.

Point-of-care LUS can also be beneficial as it is more sensitive than CXR for identifying pleural effusions and can identify fluid characteristics that suggest the presence of an empyema. While LUS avoids the cost and radiation of CT, it requires technical expertise and is less effective for assessing pathology deep to the lung pleura.

For non-resolving pneumonia or clinical deterioration, repeat imaging — especially chest CT scan — is strongly recommended. CT can help confirm or refute the diagnosis of pneumonia and identify alternative or concurrent conditions that may explain patients' delayed response rates, like pulmonary edema, embolism, pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or malignancy. High resolution chest CT reviewed by chest radiologists can be particularly helpful in differentiating infectious from non-infectious pathology. CT also offers better delineation of radiographic patterns (e.g. lobar, interstitial, nodular) and can identify complications such as cavitation, abscess, empyema, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, guiding further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions (Fig. 2).

### Is it possible to predict which patients with mild pneumonias will develop hypoxemia? [^114a3mVp]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Usually, mortality due to mild community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) (Pneumonia severity index (PSI) classes I-III) is low (< 3%), but the appearance of hypoxemia significantly increases mortality. Our aim was to determine the clinical parameters associated with risk factors of developing hypoxemia in subjects with mild CAP (PSI I-III) and the clinical outcomes of the hypoxemic group. We analyzed clinical characteristics and the outcomes of patients with mild CAP and hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 300), in a prospective, multicenter cohort study of 1195 patients. Mild pneumonias (PSI I-III) were found in 645 cases (53.9%), of which 217 (33.6%) presented hypoxemia according to a PaO2/FiO2 < 300. Patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 300 required more ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, and developed septic shock than other PSI I-III patients. The clinical parameters associated with hypoxemia were: COPD, bilateral chest X-ray involvement, and hypoalbuminemia. We conclude that patients with COPD, those with bilateral chest X-ray involvement, or hypoalbuminemia were significantly more likely to have hypoxemia in mild CAP. Hypoxemic patients with low-risk pneumonia have worse clinical outcomes, including more ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation and presence of septic shock than non-hypoxemic low-risk patients.

Pulmonary infections

Bacterial pneumonia

Lung infections are common in clinical practice and bacterial pneumonia is one of the most frequent causes. It is classified as community acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia (NP) based on clinical scenario.

CAP is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative (Enterobacteriae or E. coli) often cause NP, while aspiration pneumonia is due to microorganisms found in oropharynx such as Gram-negative cocci.

Clinical manifestations are fever, chills, cough, and sometimes chest pain; symptoms can be milder or absent in immunocompromised patients.

When pneumonia is suspected, diagnosis is confirmed by imaging evaluation, with chest X-ray (CXR) being the most used tool. CT is more sensitive but usually performed in unclear cases or when complications are suspected.

Imaging findings are variable: in CAP, CT images classically show airspace consolidation and can also evidence GGO, centrilobular nodules and bronchial walls thickening, with or without pleural effusion. Rarer presentations are round and multi-lobar pneumonia. The first, mainly seen in children, is typically characterized by a focal, round-shaped consolidation at imaging. Round pneumonia should be suspected in case of a rapid growing pulmonary nodule/mass, which disappears after antibiotic therapy.

Multi-lobar or bilateral pneumonia are non-focal patterns of CAP, with greater extent, often seen in patient with an underlying lung disease causing parenchymal distortion.

Aspiration pneumonia is secondary to inhalation of oropharyngeal or gastric secretions into the lower respiratory tract. Imaging generally shows bilateral and peri-hilar air-space consolidations, involving lower lobes, especially in the right lung.

NP is a complication of hospitalized patients defined as a pneumonia occurring 48 h after the admission or 48 h after hospital discharge. Imaging findings are bilateral, diffuse, or multiple foci of consolidation involving more than one lobe, frequently associated with pleural effusion.

Complications may occur in any pneumonia but are more frequent in CAP and NP, especially in immunocompromised patients, and are usually detected by CT. Lung cavitation suggests bacterial etiology, with S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria being the most frequent agents in immunocompetent patients, and Aspergillus in immunocompromised ones. Pleural effusions are frequent during uncomplicated CAP and are reactive in nature, resolving after antibiotic therapy, 5–10% of these might complicate and progress to empyema.

### Diagnostic performance of chest radiography in high COVID-19 prevalence setting: experience from a European reference hospital [^116CwA6R]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic performance of chest radiography findings

The description of the diagnostic performance of specific CXR findings, namely, the twelve areas into which the lungs were divided and the three prevalent CXR patterns of lung abnormalities (interstitial reticular pattern, ground-glass opacities and extensive consolidations) is presented in Table 2 in Appendix.

From a multivariate logistic analysis including comorbidities, CXR patterns, and CXR areas, bilateral involvement of medium external lung areas emerged as independent predictor of the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia (p = 0.032).

Chest radiography findings and their distribution in positive patients

Among the COVID-19 confirmed patients, 79% had an abnormal CXR at the initial time of admission. The most common pattern was the interstitial reticular pattern (183 patients; 42%), followed by extensive consolidations (145 patients; 34%) and ground-glass opacities (104 patients; 24%). Men showed a significantly higher rate of extensive consolidations than women (37.5% vs 24.6%; p = 0.008). Extensive consolidations were also more frequently found in patients older than 60 (46% vs 20%; p < 0.0001). A detailed description of frequency and distribution of abnormalities in the 12 lung areas is shown in Fig. 2. CXR findings involved middle-lower lung portions in almost all patients (431; 99.5%), while involvement of upper portions was less common (201 patients; 46.5%). Figures 3 and 4 show examples of typical CXR findings with the typical lung distribution in confirmed COVID-19 patients. In 354 patients (82%), the involvement was bilateral. Among the 78 patients with unilateral distribution of disease, the right lung was more frequently involved than the left lung (68% vs 32%). Comparing patients with a positive CXR with patients with a negative CXR, we found a significant difference in age (p < 0.0001) and sex (p < 0.0001), positive patients being older and more frequently males.

### Chest X-ray findings and temporal lung changes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^113U3E28]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

At days 12–17 from onset of symptoms; involvement of the left lower zone predominated (80%). Bilateral involvement was most common at this stage (80%).

After 18 days from the onset of symptoms; the right upper and right middle zones were the last to recover (66 and 50% respectively). The frequency of involvement of the other lobes decreased with fewer findings seen centrally and complete resolution of the left lung.

The left middle and left upper zones were the least to be involved throughout the course of the illness. Exclusive involvement of the central parts of the lungs was not observed in any of the chest x-rays. The rate of normal chest x-rays decreased from 25% at 0–5 days to none at 12–17 days, then increased to 33% as patients showed recovery. The specific frequencies of the spatial distribution of the lung changes are summarized in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4
The spatial distribution of the lung changes at various time intervals from symptom onset. a Zonal distribution. The right lower zone remained the most frequently involved over time, the left upper and left middle zones were the least to be involved. b Horizontal distribution. The lung changes were more frequently seen in a peripheral distribution. Isolated central involvement of the lung changes was not observed in any of the chest x-rays. c Distribution according to side. Bilateral distribution of the lung changes was more common than unilateral involvement

The highest severity score recorded was eight (of maximum possible score of eight). Peak severity score was reached at day 5–10 from symptom onset, known as the peak phase at which the median chest x-ray severity score was three. Nine out of 13 patients (69%) showed complete or near complete resolution of the chest x-ray findings which was reached at day 10–15 from symptom onset known as the absorption phase (Fig. 5).

### Multifocal pneumonia: fever, cough, and dyspnea | AAFP… [^116sB8HP]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

On examination, the patient's vital signs included a pulse rate of 113 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and temperature of 100. 8°F. The patient required 5 L of oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 96%. Lung auscultation revealed diffuse rales bilaterally. Relevant laboratory results included a white blood cell count of 13, 000 per μL with 48% lymphocytes. A chest radiograph demonstrated moderate multifocal, bilateral, patchy airspace and interstitial opacities. Question Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory, and imaging findings, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis. A. Aspiration pneumonia. B. Congestive heart failure. C. COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. D. Mycoplasma pneumonia.

1 Patients with COVID-19 typically follow a biphasic disease course, with a milder initial presentation that is followed by clinical deterioration about seven to 10 days after the onset of symptoms. 1 Imaging findings include bilateral ground-glass opacities, and subsegmental and lobar areas of consolidation.
2. The patient's nasal swab test was positive for COVID-19 at the urgent care clinic three days before the patient presented to the emergency department. Polymerase chain reaction testing is most useful for the initial diagnosis of COVID-19. Treatment is generally supportive with oxygen, antiviral therapy, and intravenous fluids. Patients who require mechanical ventilation and dialysis have a much poorer prognosis. Bacterial pneumonia typically presents with a focal or lobar consolidation on chest radiography.

Other viral causes of pneumonia can present with similar interstitial infiltrates, which makes polymerase chain reaction testing for common viruses, such as influenza A and B, important when diagnosing COVID-19. 3 The low specificity of diagnostic radiography in aspiration pneumonia can be improved with computed tomography. 3 Mycoplasma pneumonia typically presents with mild symptoms, including fever, cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. Chest radiography may show airspace opacities, reticular opacities, and bronchial thickening. Computed tomography findings are similar to radiography, but in more detail, and can include interstitial thickening and centrilobular nodules.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^114xWhbT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript brings to light an understudied, underrecognized, and underappreciated clinical challenge: the hospitalized patient with severe pneumonia who is not responding to initial treatment. Clinical studies are needed to bring more robust evidence and to hopefully identify different non-response phenotypes.

We propose a common criterion that spans from sCAP to HAP/VAP, identify the most relevant risk factors, and provide a clinical pathway to investigate these patients in a timely manner to facilitate optimizing care.

The decision-making process consists of two key-components: the comprehensive search for an accurate diagnosis and treatment modification as needed to match the revised diagnosis. The former will ensure that clinicians are not missing an important diagnosis responsible for the initial treatment failure, and the later will offer a concrete approach to make the treatment successful.

In summary, there is an urgent need for better data on the epidemiology of pneumonia non-responders and how best to optimize the therapeutic approach in order to secure the best outcomes for all patients.

### Diagnostic impact of bedside chest X-ray features of 2019 novel coronavirus in the routine admission at the emergency department: case series from lombardy region [^112fkjGH]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the imaging features of routine admission chest X-ray in patients suspected for novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Method

We retrospectively evaluated clinical and X-ray features in all patients referred to the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1st and March 13th. A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range < 25% to 75–100%) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (≤ 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (≤ 50 and > 50 years old).

Results

A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8%). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57% (95% CI = 47–67) and 89% (83–94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to ≤ 5 days (76% [62–87] vs 37% [24–52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to ≤ 50 years (59% [48–69] vs 47% [23–72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68% [45–86] and 82% [73–89], respectively).

Conclusions

Overall chest X-ray sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 57%. Sensitivity was higher when symptoms had started more than 5 days before, at the expense of lesser specificity, while slightly higher in older patients in comparison to younger ones.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111MgD3U]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Acute cough with suspected pneumonia — diagnostic indicators and reference standard: Physician judgment alone frequently led to overestimation of the probability of pneumonia. Although individual signs and symptoms alone cannot rule in or rule out pneumonia, combinations of signs and symptoms can improve overall diagnostic accuracy, and the absence of any vital sign abnormalities has a high negative predictive value for ruling out pneumonia. However, even with the highest cutoff points for decision rules, the positive predictive value is rarely > 50%. Studies assessed clinical algorithms against chest radiography as the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis, although chest radiography is described as an imperfect gold standard because a significant proportion of pneumonia cases initially diagnosed based on higher-resolution imaging of the chest are not detected on chest radiographs.

Hypoxemia ranges from mild (room air arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2] ≥ 70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial gradient [A-a gradient] < 35 mmHg) to moderate (A-a gradient ≥ 35 to < 45 mmHg) to severe (A-a gradient ≥ 45 mmHg). Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase levels to > 500 mg/dL is common but also nonspecific, and the chest radiograph typically demonstrates diffuse, bilateral, symmetrical "ground-glass" interstitial infiltrates emanating from the hila in a butterfly pattern.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the radiographic and high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings of adenovirus pneumonia in five patients.

Conclusion

Adenovirus pneumonia in adults appears as bilateral patchy parenchymal opacities on chest radiographs and as bilateral ground-glass opacities with a random distribution with or without consolidation on HRCT images. These findings, however, are not specific for adenovirus pneumonia.

### Interpretation of chest radiography in patients with known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection: what we learnt from comparison with computed tomography [^111n9NuQ]. Emergency Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Differently from computed tomography (CT), well-defined terminology for chest radiography (CXR) findings and standardized reporting in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 are still lacking. We propose a revision of CXR major imaging findings in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia derived from the comparison of CXR and CT, suggesting a precise and standardized terminology for CXR reporting. This description will consider asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients, and patients with SARS-CoV-2-related pulmonary complications. We suggest using terms such as ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and reticular pattern for the most common findings, and characteristic chest radiographic pattern in presence of one or more of the above-mentioned findings with peripheral and mid-to-lower lung zone distribution.

### 'Presenting CXR phenotype of H1N1' flu compared with contemporaneous non-H1N1, community acquired pneumonia, during pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks' [^114g2QXN]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To review, phenotype and assess potential prognostic value of initial chest X-ray findings in patients with H1N1 influenza during seasonal outbreaks of 2009 and 2010, in comparison with non-H1N1, community acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We retrospectively identified 72 patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia during the seasons of 2009 and 2010. H1N1 cases were confirmed by virology PCR. Presenting chest X-rays were jointly read by 2 radiologists, who were 'blinded' to further patient details and divided into 6 zones. Total number of opacified zones, the pattern and distribution of changes and length of hospital stay were recorded.

Results

Patients with H1N1 demonstrated more opacified zones (mean of 2.9 compared with 2.0; p = 0.006), which were bilateral in two-thirds compared with a quarter of those with non-H1N1 CAP (p = 0.001). H1N1 radiographs were more likely to be 'patchy' versus 'confluent' changes of non-H1N1 CAP (p = 0.03) and more often demonstrated peripheral distribution (p = 0.01). H1N1 patients tended to stay in hospital longer (not significant; p = 0.08). A positive correlation existed between number of affected zones and length of inpatient stay, which was statistically significant for the cohorts combined (p = 0.02). The findings were the same for the two evaluated seasons.

Conclusion

H1N1 patients demonstrated more extensive disease, which was more likely bilateral, 'patchy', and peripheral in distribution. With increasing global cases of H1N1, knowledge of the typical findings of the H1N1 presenting chest X-ray may assist with early triage of patients, particularly where rapid viral testing is not available.

Pneumonia

In patients with COPD, the symptoms of pneumonia and ECOPD may be similar (worsened cough, sputum production, dyspnea, and fever). Physical examination may help in the differentiation, with signs of consolidation (localized crackles, crepitus, and dullness on percussion) more frequent in patients with pneumonia. However, because a diagnosis of COPD increases pneumonia risk (by 1.3- to 13.5-fold) and severity, pneumonia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with symptoms of ECOPD.

If the clinical assessment deems the ECOPD to be mild or moderate and there are no signs of lung consolidation, no further diagnostic testing to differentiate the two diseases is indicated. However, if the episode is severe and/or prolonged, and there are abnormal chest exam findings, a proper diagnosis of pneumonia should be undertaken. Mortality after hospitalized pneumonia is higher than after hospitalized ECOPD. Although most patients without severe ECOPD can be safely treated on the basis of chest X-ray results alone, opacities not visible on a chest X-ray may be seen with more sensitive CT scans.

A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our Emergency Department with cough and dyspnea. Laboratory investigations showed increased white blood cell count (10,500 per μL), and C-reactive protein levels (124 mg/dL). Chest X-ray (Figure 1A) showed findings consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia; COVID-19 was detected in a throat swab sample by RT-PCR.

Figure 1.
Plain X-rays. (A) Chest X-ray on admission showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The distribution pattern is mainly peripheral. (B) Chest X-ray on day 14 showed worsening of the radiologic findings with peripheral and central distribution and bilateral evidence of areas of consolidation, particularly in the right lower field. (C) Chest X-ray on day 25 showed improvement of the radiological findings, particularly in the upper and middle fields, on both sides.

From day one, the patient suffered from a type I respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen through a Venturi mask, FiO 2 up to 60%. She was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine; because of the persistent severe conditions (Figure 1B), tocilizumab was added on day 14. Two days later, after improvement in respiratory exchange, the oxygen therapy was suspended. A slow progressive improvement occurred (Figure 1C), and on days 30 and 31, RT-PCR was negative.

On day 32, the patient underwent an unenhanced chest computed tomography (CT), showing diffuse lung architectural distortion, with reticular interstitial pattern, peripheral honeycombing, and bronchial wall thickening.

Images of a previous chest CT performed by the patient a year ago are available, showing no significant abnormalities.

The dramatic pulmonary changes (Figure 2A and B) make us question the possible long-term consequences of COVID-19 pneumonia.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV — clinical manifestations and diagnostic findings commonly include "subacute onset of progressive dyspnea, fever, non-productive cough, and chest discomfort that worsens within days to weeks", with normal resting pulmonary exam in mild cases and exertional "tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse dry (cellophane) rales". "Oral thrush is a common co infection" and "Fever is apparent in most cases". Hypoxemia severity is defined by arterial oxygen and A–a gradient thresholds: mild "room air arterial oxygen [PO2] ≥ 70 mm Hg or alveolar-arterial PO2 gradient [A-a] DO2 < 35 mm Hg", moderate "[A-a] DO2 ≥ 35 to < 45 mm Hg", and severe "[A-a] DO2 ≥ 45 mm Hg". Exercise desaturation is "often abnormal but is non-specific", and "Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase levels to > 500 mg/dL is common but also non-specific". Chest radiographs typically show "diffuse, bilateral, symmetrical 'ground-glass' interstitial infiltrates emanating from the hila in a butterfly pattern", though early disease may have a normal film; atypical patterns "such as nodules, blebs and cysts, asymmetric disease, upper lobe localization, intrathoracic adenopathy, and pneumothorax, also occur", while "Cavitation and pleural effusion are uncommon" and suggest alternate pathology. Concurrent conditions are frequent, as "approximately 13% to 18% of patients with documented PCP have another concurrent cause of pulmonary dysfunction", and "Thin-section computed tomography (CT) is a useful adjunctive study".

CT showing ill-defined ground glass nodules in both lungs (yellow arrows). b A 49-year-old male patient with acute dyspnea for 4 days. CT showing extensive ill-defined consolidations with positive air-bronchograms in both lower lobes: COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR. c A 60-year-old male patient with consolidations in the lung periphery sparing the subpleural space. The findings are compatible with organizing pneumonia indicating ongoing repair of the known COVID-19 pneumonia

Although imaging findings of pulmonary involvement are relatively characteristic of COVID-19, they are not specific for this disease. Underlying conditions might influence the imaging presentation, requiring careful consideration of any previous patient history. Other entities such as influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus may mimic radiological aspects of COVID-19 pneumonia. The pattern of distribution of finding in the lungs as well as the composition of parenchymal opacities may assist in the discrimination between viral etiologies. For instance, influenza pneumonia is reported to present with dense opacifications, whereas COVID-19 is characterized by more prevalent ground glass density.

Over the course of the COVID-19 illness, the relative proportion of ground glass opacities decreases, whereas the proportion of consolidations and reticular abnormalities tends to increase. The extent of consolidations peaks between day 9 and 13 after the initial onset of symptoms. Importantly, the gradual resolution of abnormalities can take several weeks. In some patients, however, the diffuse alveolar damage in COVID-19 may lead to an adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and life-threatening multi-organ dysfunction. CT findings in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 show extensive bilateral ground glass opacities with or without admixed consolidations. An increasing number of imaging and autopsy studies also report lung fibrosis as a long-term consequence of COVID-19 with traction-bronchiectasis and fibrotic bands. Importantly, pleural effusion, cavities, lymphadenopathy, mucous plugging, and tree-in-bud are uncommon findings in COVID-19, and their presence should thus raise the suspicion of a bacterial superinfection or other complications. Initial reports also address the issue of late effects in recovered patients following COVID-19. Figure 4 shows lung-imaging sequelae of severe COVID-19.

A 58-year-old male ex-smoker was admitted to hospital because of nodular infiltrates on chest x rays. He was complaining of fatigue, dyspnoea with exertion, low grade fever and weight loss. Physical examination was unremarkable. Bronchoscopy was inconclusive but revealed endobronchial lesions of chronic active inflammation. The diagnosis of cryptogenic organising pneumonitis bronchiolitis obliterans-organising pneumonia (COP-BOOP) was established by open lung biopsy. Proliferative bronchiolitis with regions of organising pneumonia is the characteristic feature of COP. The radiological picture of bilateral pulmonary nodules is an infrequent manifestation of COP. Lung biopsy, open or with video assistance thoracic surgery, is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

COVID-19 infection is associated with microvascular thrombosis, and an increased frequency of pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarctions, visualized on CT as peripheral opacities.

CT may also help differentiate other lung diseases, acute heart failure, and, when performed with contrast medium, pulmonary thromboembolism.

CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia may widely vary also depending on the phase and on the severity of the disease, and in 10.6% of symptomatic patients chest-CT can be normal.

Radiologic patterns of drug-related pneumonitis at chest CT — Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) presents with patchy areas of ground-glass opacity (GGO) that may progress to irregular reticular opacities with architectural distortion and traction bronchiectasis, with or without consolidation, and are bilateral and symmetric with predominant lower-lung involvement. Organizing pneumonia (OP) shows multifocal patchy alveolar opacities with peribronchovascular and/or peripheral distribution and may demonstrate a reversed halo sign. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is characterized by poorly defined small centrilobular nodules, bilateral GGO, and large or lobular areas of decreased attenuation and vascularity. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) shows extensive bilateral GGO and dependent airspace consolidation in the exudative phase, with traction bronchiectasis and decreased lung volumes in organizing and fibrotic phases. Simple pulmonary eosinophilia (PEO) presents with consolidation or GGO that can be unilateral or bilateral and is transient and migratory, and spontaneous resolution within 4 wk is common.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA

An ideal reference diagnosis for pneumonia should be based upon the detection of pathogenic agents in lung parenchyma, along with suggestive clinical findings. However, this cannot be carried out in routine clinical practice for evident practical reasons. Hence, pneumonia is usually suspected in the presence of respiratory and infectious signs and symptoms, and confirmed by the demonstration of a new lung infiltrate on a radiologic examination. Unfortunately, signs and symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific, leading to a poor predictive value of clinical data for the diagnosis of chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT)-proven pneumonia.

The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is even more difficult in elderly patients, because symptoms are less specific, and decompensated comorbidities (e.g. heart failure and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) can further blur the clinical picture. The prevalence of most symptoms, including fever and shivers, is reduced with increasing age. Elderly patients tend to report symptoms less accurately because of memory disorders or delirium. Finally, the incidence of alternative diagnoses to pneumonia (e.g. pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, nonrespiratory sepsis and so on), and the prevalence of chronic respiratory conditions (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease) is also increased in elderly patients (Figs. 1–4).

Bilateral pleural effusions (arrows, b) were considered to be related to congestive heart failure. The lowermost CT slices covering the upper abdomen showed a liver cavity containing debris and air (arrow, c), held responsible for pain referred to the lung bases. CT, computed tomography.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^1154poU5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale.

Chest imaging can be essential in the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19. Published reports to date have focused mainly on standard chest x-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT). Abnormalities are very often present on CXR images of COVID-19 patients; consolidations and ground-glass opacities have been reported in 47% and 33%, respectively. Not all patients with COVID-19 have abnormalities on chest CT images. Patchy ground-glass opacities, typically in a bilateral and peripheral locations, and consolidations have been most commonly described. – In light of the high sensitivity of an abnormal scan, CT has even been suggested as a primary diagnostic tool for COVID-19.

Challenges with access to CT and, at times, even simple CXR may preclude the usefulness of these imaging techniques in LMICs. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is increasingly recognized as a chest imaging tool with a strong potential to guide management of critically ill patients and may represent a useful tool in patients with COVID-19.

Search results.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched until May 2020. The search used combinations of MeSH terms and free-text words, including "COVID–19", "coronavirus", "SARS–CoV–2", "'radiography", "chest radiography", "CT", "chest CT", "CT", "chest CT", "ultrasound", "LUS", and "lung ultrasonography". Several studies were found but none reporting data from LMICs.

Evidence.

For the diagnosis of pneumonia from causes other than COVID-19, LUS has been found to be superior to standard CXR, and it approaches chest CT in terms of diagnostic accuracy. – Lung ultrasound had a better diagnostic yield than CXR in the early diagnosis of H1N1 2009 viral pneumonia. Experience with LUS in patients with COVID-19 is rapidly growing, with the consistent finding that nearly all COVID-19 patients have an abnormal LUS. Four major findings are frequently described in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1), although the sensitivity and specificity of the following findings remain uncertain.
1 focal, multifocal, or confluent B-lines (in 97% of cases);
2 pleural thickening (in 50% of cases);
3 subpleural and pleural consolidations (in 40% of cases); and
4 rarely, pleural effusions (in 16% of cases). –

### Two in one: overlapping CT findings of COVID-19 and underlying lung diseases [^117XmmBk]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with pneumonia and has various pulmonary manifestations on computed tomography (CT). Although COVID-19 pneumonia is usually seen as bilateral predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation, it can present with atypical radiological findings and resemble the imaging findings of other lung diseases. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is much more challenging for both clinicians and radiologists in the presence of pre-existing lung disease. The imaging features of COVID-19 and underlying lung disease can overlap and obscure the findings of each other. Knowledge of the radiological findings of both diseases and possible complications, correct diagnosis, and multidisciplinary consensus play key roles in the appropriate management of diseases. In this pictorial review, the chest CT findings are presented of patients with underlying lung diseases and overlapping COVID-19 pneumonia and the various reasons for radiological lung abnormalities in these patients are discussed.

### Chest X-ray findings and temporal lung changes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^113Wpp3w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

After 18 days, the lung abnormalities regressed (50% GGO and 17% consolidation), with increase in the frequency of normal chest x-rays (33%) indicating a healing phase. Figure 3 shows the distribution of lung abnormalities at different time intervals from onset of symptoms.

Fig. 3
Temporal change of chest x-ray findings. Stacked-bar graph showed the distribution of the lung abnormalities on chest x-ray at various time points from symptom onset. GGO was the most frequent abnormality on initial x-rays, consolidation increased in frequency till the second week then regressed into GGO which again was more frequent on subsequent chest x-rays. Mixed pattern of GGO and nodular consolidation and reticulations were noted in the second week. Normal chest x-rays increased in frequency with time as patients showed clinical improvement. GGO = ground glass opacity

The spatial distribution of the radiographic lung changes increased throughout the course of the disease. Earlier in the disease (days 0–5) bilateral involvement was seen in 30%, exclusive unilateral involvement was observed in 5/20 (25%) on the right, and 4/20 on the left (20%). The lower zones were more frequently involved (55% right, 40% left). The lung abnormalities were seen predominantly in the periphery of the lungs.

At days 11–6 from onset of symptoms, the percentage of involvement of the lower zones increased and remained the most common (65% right lower zone, 52% left lower zone). The lung abnormalities extended from the periphery to the central giving a diffuse pattern in 25%. Exclusive involvement of the right lung was noted in the majority of the x-rays (40%). Bilateral involvement was noted in 35% of the x-rays.

Chest radiography (CXR) is most likely to be the utilized modality for diagnosing COVID-19 and following up on any lung-associated abnormalities. This review provides a meta-analysis of the current literature on CXR imaging findings to determine the most common appearances of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients in order to equip medical researchers and healthcare professionals in their efforts to combat this pandemic. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The inclusion criteria consisted of: (1) published in English literature; (2) original research study; (3) sample size of at least 5 patients; (4) reporting clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients as well as CXR imaging features; and (5) noting the number of patients with each corresponding imaging feature. A total of 1948 patients were included in this study. To perform the meta-analysis, a random-effects model calculated the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of abnormal CXR imaging findings. Seventy-four percent (74%) (95% CI: 51–92%) of patients with COVID-19 had an abnormal CXR at the initial time of diagnosis or sometime during the disease course. While there was no single feature on CXR that was diagnostic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia, a characteristic set of findings were obvious. The most common abnormalities were consolidation (28%, 95% CI: 8–54%) and ground-glass opacities (29%, 95% CI: 10–53%). The distribution was most frequently bilateral (43%, 95% CI: 27–60%), peripheral (51%, 95% CI: 36–66%), and basal zone (56%, 95% CI: 37–74%) predominant. Contrary to parenchymal abnormalities, pneumothorax (1%, 95% CI: 0–3%) and pleural effusions (6%, 95% CI: 1–16%) were rare.

Appearance of the disease on the chest CT

The SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family of Coronaviridae and causes systemic and/or respiratory tract infections, rarely acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multi-organ failure. Its cellular entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor which is expressed partly on the alveolar cells of the lung epithelium.

The CT manifestation of this viral pneumonia is non-specific but it has characteristic features based on which experienced radiologists can diagnose the disease. Findings are similar to other viral pneumonias but the localization of the signs is rather typical (see Fig. 1). The most frequent and earliest pattern is ground-glass opacity (GGO) that at first may be unifocal, but usually multifocal, bilateral, and peripheral distribution with a posterior predominance especially in inferior lobes. In the area of GGO, common findings are the widening of vessels and traction bronchiectasis.

Ultrasound, chest X-ray, and computed tomography (CT) have been used with excellent results in diagnosis, first assessment, and follow-up of COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients. Ultrasound and chest X-ray have the advantages of the wide availability and acquisition at the patient's bed; CT showed high sensitivity in COVID-19 diagnosis. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation are the main CT and X-ray features; the distribution of lung abnormalities is typically bilateral and peripheral. Less typical findings, including pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathies, the bubble air sign, and cavitation, can also be visible on chest CT. Radiologists should be aware of the advantages and limitations of the available imaging techniques and of the different pulmonary aspects of COVID-19 infection.

### Radiology residents' on-call interpretation of chest radiographs for pneumonia [^111Kvv91]. Academic Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

This study is designed to assess the performance of radiology residents in interpreting emergency department chest radiographs for pneumonia and to characterize chest radiographic findings in patients for which interpretation was amended by an attending radiologist.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all amended reports for chest radiographs performed on emergency department patients July 2002-June 2003. Reports preliminarily interpreted by residents and amended by a board-certified staff radiologist for the presence or absence of pneumonia were identified. A panel of three experienced radiologists, blinded to reports, jointly reviewed each chest radiograph. If the panel diagnosed pneumonia, the chest radiograph was evaluated for the projection that best showed the pneumonia, its size and location, and the presence or absence of the following features: increased opacity, air bronchograms, loss of vascular markings, silhouette sign, and linear opacities. The resident's post-graduate year (PGY) training level was noted.

Results

One percent (134/12,600 reports) of chest radiographic reports were amended for the presence or absence of pneumonia. One hundred chest radiographs were available and comprised the series. There were 56 females and 44 males with a mean age of 45 years (range, 1–99 years). The staff radiologist diagnosed pneumonia in 79% (79/100 radiographs). The panel agreed with the staff in 77% (kappa = 0.76) and the resident in 23% (kappa = 0.43). The panel diagnosed pneumonia in 60% (60/100 radiographs) with the following chest radiographic findings: 100% (60/60), increased opacity; 37% (22/60), air bronchograms; 72% (43/60), loss of vascular markings; 40% (24/60), silhouette sign; and 20% (12/60), linear opacities. The pneumonia was right sided in 52% (31/60), left sided in 37% (22/60), and bilateral in 11% (7/60). Right-sided pneumonias were equally distributed among the three lobes, and left-sided pneumonias had a lower-lobe predominance of 77% (17/22). Seventy-five percent (45/60) of pneumonias were segmental or smaller, and 82% (49/60) of chest radiographs showing pneumonia had both posteroanterior and lateral projections. The pneumonia was conspicuous on only one projection in 43% (21/49); the posteroanterior view in 22% (11/49), and the lateral view in 20% (10/49). Eighty-one percent (81/100) of interpreting residents were PGY-3.

Conclusion

Interpretation of chest radiographs for pneumonia by PGY-3 residents has a low error rate. Missed pneumonias often were segmental or smaller and conspicuous on only one projection.

### Chest X-ray findings and temporal lung changes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^11759dm9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Almost half of the patients with COVID-19 had abnormal chest x-ray findings, GGO in a peripheral distribution with lower lobe predilection being the most common findings on chest x-ray. The radiographic findings peaked at day 5–10 of symptom onset reaching the highest severity score. Presence of symptoms correlated significantly with abnormal chest x-ray findings. Chest x-ray may be helpful as an aiding tool in the diagnosis and follow up in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Radiological imaging in pneumonia: recent innovations [^1157hADe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia is one of the major infectious diseases responsible for significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Radiological imaging plays a prominent role in the evaluation and treatment of patients with pneumonia. This paper reviews recent innovations in the radiologic diagnosis and management of suspected pulmonary infections.

Recent Findings

Chest radiography is the most commonly used imaging tool in pneumonias because of availability and an excellent cost-benefit ratio. Computed tomography is mandatory in unresolved cases or when complications of pneumonia are suspected. A specific radiologic pattern can suggest a diagnosis in many cases. Bacterial pneumonias are classified into four main groups: community-acquired, aspiration, healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The radiographic patterns of community-acquired pneumonia may be variable and are often related to the causative agent. Aspiration pneumonia involves the lower lobes with bilateral multicentric opacities. The radiographic patterns of healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired pneumonia are variable, most commonly showing diffuse multifocal involvement and pleural effusion.

Summary

Combination of pattern recognition with knowledge of the clinical setting is the best approach to the radiologic interpretation of pneumonia. Radiological imaging will narrow the differential diagnosis of direct additional diagnostic measures and serve as an ideal tool for follow-up examinations.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^1143v4kq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosis — high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern integrated with histopathology: For those "clinically suspected of having IPF", matrix mapping shows that with HRCT pattern UIP, histopathology UIP, probable UIP, or indeterminate for UIP map to "IPF", whereas histopathology alternative diagnosis maps to "Non-IPF dx"; with HRCT pattern probable UIP, histopathology UIP or probable UIP map to "IPF", indeterminate for UIP maps to "IPF (Likely)", and alternative diagnosis maps to "Non-IPF dx"; with HRCT pattern indeterminate for UIP, histopathology UIP maps to "IPF", probable UIP to "IPF (Likely)", indeterminate for UIP to "Indeterminate for IPF", and alternative diagnosis to "Non-IPF dx"; with HRCT pattern alternative diagnosis, histopathology UIP maps to "IPF (Likely) /non-IPF dx" and all other histopathology categories map to "Non-IPF dx". "Clinically suspected of having IPF" is defined as "unexplained symptomatic or asymptomatic patterns of bilateral pulmonary fibrosis on a chest radiograph or chest computed tomography, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and age greater than 60 years", noting that "[> 40 yr and < 60 yr]… can rarely present… as the typical patient older than 60 years". "IPF is the likely diagnosis when any of the following features are present", including traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis in "four or more lobes… or… two or more lobes… in a man over age 50 years or in a woman over age 60 years", "Extensive (> 30%) reticulation on HRCT and an age > 70 years", and when "Multidisciplinary discussion reaches a confident diagnosis of IPF". For the "Indeterminate for IPF" category, "Without an adequate biopsy is unlikely to be IPF", and with "an adequate biopsy may be reclassified… after multidisciplinary discussion and/or additional consultation". Abbreviations are defined as "HRCT = high-resolution computed tomography; IPF = idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; UIP = usual interstitial pneumonia".

### The role of chest imaging in the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^1111vx5U]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia

Defining disease stage and predicting and monitoring disease progression are major roles of chest imaging. A typical pattern of disease progression of COVID-19 starts as subpleural non-segmented GGOs or small rounded GGOs in the middle layer of the lung parenchyma that distribute unilaterally or bilaterally, culminating in a crazy-paving pattern and subsequent consolidation. According to Pan et al. chest CT patterns can be divided into the following 4 stages: (1) early stage (day 0–4), when the main findings are GGOs occasionally accompanied by crazy-paving patterns that distribute unilaterally or bilaterally (chest CT findings may be negative at this stage), (2) progressive stage (day 5–8), when regions progressively congregate and extend bilaterally, with increased frequency and proportion of crazy-paving and consolidation, (3) peak stage (day 9–13), when regions slowly expand with an increasing proportion of consolidation and peaks out often accompanied with an organizing pneumonia pattern, i.e. volume reduction, perilobular distribution, and/or residual parenchymal band, and (4) absorption stage (days ≥ 14), when consolidations are gradually absorbed with GGOs being the most frequent findings. The disease severity peaks at 6–11 days on chest CT and 10–12 days on chest X-ray after symptom onset.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### The management of surgical patients in the emergency setting during COVID-19 pandemic: the WSES position paper [^116Mk1y1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Even if an abdominal CT scan is always performed in acute abdomen with clinical and biological signs of gravity, adding a chest CT could require more occupational time of the radiological room, a different acquisition protocol of images for the radiologist and an environmental risk of dissemination of the virus due to the inspiration and expiration requested to the patient during examination.

Furthermore, according to available evidence, CT scan used as a screening tool has some shortcomings, such as the overlap of imaging findings with other respiratory diseases and at very early stage of infection, the absence of any abnormalities. Therefore, CT is not helpful as a screening tool, except when combined with other epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and RT-PCR test information to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the pneumonia, even if CT scan results are available in a shorter waiting time than swab tests.

Other radiological imaging techniques, such as chest X-ray (CXR) and lung US, may be advocated in the screening of surgical patients, both to decrease the number of chest TC and in case of contraindication or unavailability of CT, to confirm the COVID-19 pneumonia.

Common CXR findings are bilateral interstitial pattern/ground-glass opacities, with isolated focal infiltrate making the diagnosis less likely.

In clinical practice, the CXR may be normal early in the disease course, so a normal x-ray does not rule out the diagnosis, exactly like a chest CT scan.

With the purpose to describe the time course and severity of the CXR findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate radiological findings with RT-PCR testing for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid, a retrospective study was carried out in a cohort of 64 COVID-19 patients and the CXR demonstrated lower sensitivity of 69% [95% CI: 56–80%], compared with 91% [95% CI: 81–96%] (p = 0.009) for initial RT-qPCR. In this study, CXR abnormalities preceded positive RT-PCR in only 6/64 (9%) patients; moreover, common CXR findings mirror those described for CT that are bilateral, peripheral, consolidation and/or ground-glass opacities. The severity of CXR findings peaked at 10–12 days from the date of symptom onset.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111B1b12]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Chest radiography for acute cough in adults — A Cochrane review of chest radiographs for acute lower respiratory tract infections included two RCTs with a combined 2,024 patients (1,502 adults, 522 children), and the conclusion was that chest radiography did not improve clinical outcomes (duration of illness); for adults with acute cough illness, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routinely obtaining a chest radiograph in addition to clinical judgment to make management decisions, and because the overall proportion with significant radiographic findings is very small, the benefit, if any, is likely very small. Clinical algorithms to identify the subset of patients with a higher risk of underlying pneumonia are needed to help guide the decision to order chest radiographs in this population.

### Multimodality imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia: from diagnosis to follow-up. A comprehensive review [^112RuUjT]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to its pandemic diffusion, SARS- CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection represents a global threat. Despite a multiorgan involvement has been described, pneumonia is the most common manifestation of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) and it is associated with a high morbidity and a considerable mortality. Especially in the areas with high disease burden, chest imaging plays a crucial role to speed up the diagnostic process and to aid the patient management. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to understand the diagnostic capabilities and limitations of chest X-ray (CXR) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in defining the common imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia and correlating them with the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. The evolution of lung abnormalities over time, the uncommon findings, the possible complications, and the main differential diagnosis occurring in the pandemic phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection are also discussed.

### Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a paediatric case [^1115bzkn]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is a rare disorder in children, characterised by respiratory and systemic symptoms, with a generally good prognosis. A 11-year-old asthmatic girl was admitted to our clinic with a 3-month history of progressive cough, dyspnoea, weight loss and asthenia. Peripheral blood eosinophilia, multiple bilateral pulmonary infiltrates to the x-ray, multiple nodules with a surrounding ground-glass halo and peripheral predominance to the chest CT suggested the diagnosis of eosinophilic lung disease (ELD). Further investigations ruled out other ELD and supported diagnosis of CEP. The response to oral corticosteroids was dramatic, no relapses were reported in 2-year follow-up while the patient was under inhaled corticosteroids for pre-existing asthma.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^112ZcqoX]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Use of imaging in COVID-19 — chest radiography and CT of the thorax — is guided by clinical actionability balanced against risks and resource constraints. "The value of an imaging test relates to the generation of results that are clinically actionable either for establishing a diagnosis or for guiding management, triage, or therapy", yet this value "is diminished by costs that include the risk of radiation exposure to the patient, risk of COVID-19 transmission to uninfected health care workers and other patients, consumption of PPE, and need for cleaning and downtime of radiology rooms in resource-constrained environments". The statement "focuses exclusively on the use of chest radiography and CT of the thorax", noting that "Although US has been suggested as a potential triage and diagnostic tool for COVID-19… there is limited experience at this time… as well as infection control issues". Chest radiography "is insensitive in mild or early COVID-19 infection", but in hospitalized patients "can be useful for assessing disease progression and alternative diagnoses (eg, lobar pneumonia suggestive of bacterial superinfection, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion)", and portability "may favor chest radiography… effectively eliminating the risk of COVID-19 transmission… particularly in environments lacking PPE". In contrast, "CT is more sensitive for early parenchymal lung disease, disease progression, and alternative diagnoses including acute heart failure from COVID-19 myocardial injury and, when performed with intravenous contrast material, pulmonary thromboembolism".

### Case report: walking pneumonia in novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): mild symptoms with marked abnormalities on chest imaging [^115XL5Wf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In China, computed tomography (CT) has been an important imaging modality for assisting the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fang et al.compared the detection rate of initial chest CT and RT-PCR in 51 eventually confirmed COVID-19 cases and reported a higher detection rate for initial CT (98%) than first RT-PCR (71%) (P < 0.001). On admission, the predominant CT findings included ground-glass opacification (GGO), consolidation, bilateral involvement, and peripheral and diffuse distributions. The CT in the present case was performed after symptom resolution, and our findings were compatible with the late peak to early absorption stage described in a case series of COVID-19 CT findings in 21 confirmed adult Chinese patients. The overuse of CT may cause some drawbacks including higher radiation exposure and the need for transportation, which increases the risk of disease spreading. Furthermore, the utility of CT as the standard chest imaging study might be inapplicable for resource-limited settings. Because the predominant CT pattern observed in COVID-19 pneumonia on admission is GGO, a CXR is not sensitive to detect this and may demonstrate normal findings in the early stage of infection. These limitations of both CT and CXR lead to the possibility of using LUS at the bedside as a screening and monitoring tool. It is noninvasive and can be performed at the bedside for those in isolation or in intensive care, thus limiting the risk of spreading the disease compared with transferring patients to CT. Lung ultrasonography is also more readily available in low- to middle-income countries but does need to be performed by trained medical personnel with special precaution. Further research is needed to address the utility of LUS in a diagnostic pathway for patient selection for CT and to explore the application of artificial intelligence in screening chest radiographs in suspected cases.

In conclusion, we report a symptomatically mild COVID-19 case presenting as "walking pneumonia" in which the early diagnosis and management was achieved in the presymptomatic stage by the use of chest imaging studies.

### Radiology of bacterial pneumonia [^1117KD4C]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Radiology plays a prominent role in the evaluation of pneumonia. Chest radiography is the most commonly used imaging tool in pneumonias due to its availability and excellent cost benefit ratio. CT should be used in unresolved cases or when complications of pneumonia are suspected. The main applications of radiology in pneumonia are oriented to detection, characterisation and follow-up, especially regarding complications. The classical classification of pneumonias into lobar and bronchial pneumonia has been abandoned for a more clinical classification. Thus, bacterial pneumonias are typified into three main groups: Community acquired pneumonia (CAD), Aspiration pneumonia and Nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The usual pattern of CAD is that of the previously called lobar pneumonia; an air-space consolidation limited to one lobe or segment. Nevertheless, the radiographic patterns of CAD may be variable and are often related to the causative agent. Aspiration pneumonia generally involves the lower lobes with bilateral multicentric opacities. Nosocomial Pneumonia (NP) occurs in hospitalised patients. The importance of NP is related to its high mortality and, thus, the need to obtain a prompt diagnosis. The role of imaging in NP is limited but decisive. The most valuable information is when the chest radiographs are negative and rule out pneumonia. The radiographic patterns of NP are very variable, most commonly showing diffuse multifocal involvement and pleural effusion. Imaging plays also an important role in the detection and evaluation of complications of bacterial pneumonias. In many of these cases, especially in hospitalised patients, chest CT must be obtained in order to better depict these associate findings.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome: radiographic and CT findings [^113zsKpQ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We review the radiographic and CT findings in the lungs of 12 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in an effort to describe the most common radiologic findings for this disease.

Conclusion

The most common radiographic findings of SARS patients at presentation are unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral or bilateral areas of consolidation. In hospitalized SARS patients, the abnormalities tend to progress to bilateral air-space consolidation. CT may reveal parenchymal disease in patients whose radiographs show normal results.

### Validation of the Pneumocystis pneumonia score in haematology patients with acute respiratory failure [^117MJTtG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, there are several questions regarding the variables used in the final model. Firstly, those patients over the age of 50 years were associated with lower scores meaning a lower risk of PCP. The authors described these points to be in line with older patients receiving less frequently high-dose chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. These conditions put patients at high risk for PCP. However, the majority of haematologic malignancies are diagnosed in elderly patients and the decision to treat might not only be determined by age, but also by combining performance and frailty. In addition, previous reports showed an association between age > 60 years and pulmonary Pneumocystis colonisation, especially in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Secondly, chest X-ray findings of PCP are non-specific and sometimes normal. In some cases, PCP presents bilateral, symmetric opacities in an interstitial or alveolar pattern on a chest X-ray. This is associated with an increased frequency of spontaneous pneumothorax. Therefore, high resolution computed tomography (known to be the most reliable imaging technique for the detection and differential diagnosis of PCP), is recommended in immunocompromised patients, complementing either a negative or a vague chest X-ray.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Legionnaire's pneumonia: is there really an interstitial disease? [^112b53dx]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Legionella pneumonia is usually classified as "atypical pneumonia", which suggests a predominance of interstitial patterns in chest X-rays. Based on a selection of recent clinical cases and a brief review of the literature, the aim of the study is to clarify, how far the actual radiological findings would be consistent with these expectations.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective analysis of 18 epidemic personal cases and a review of the literature data were performed to describe the chest X-ray findings of Legionella pneumophila (LP) community acquired pneumonia. X-ray review was performed simultaneously and in consensus by two radiologists (J.P.T. E.C.) and a physician (C.G.).

Results

From our series, 17 patients had an abnormal chest X-ray on admission. Among these pathological X-ray cases, infiltrates were more often confluent (n = 16), or patchy (n = 7), rather than interstitial (n = 1). Fifteen patients had infiltrates involving the lower lung fields. Bilateral distribution of abnormalities and pleural effusion were each observed in three cases. Radiological findings deteriorated between the second and seventh days following admission, particularly in the form of patchy infiltrates with pleural effusion. The review of the literature is consistent with these findings, by reporting prevalent confluent or patchy infiltrates.

Conclusions

These findings are consistent with the physiopathological particularity of this affection and incite us to avoid the classification "atypical pneumonia" in radiologic terminology. This term is more appropriate for clinical and microbiological use.

### Diagnostic utility of the soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with bilateral lung infiltrates [^117VFFtC]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study are that sTREM-1 concentration can be used effectively in the diagnosis of bacterial or fungal pneumonia in patients with bilateral infiltration, and that a modified CPIS of more than 6 is not a valid diagnostic indicator of pneumonia using multivariate analysis.

In cases where patients displayed localized consolidation on a chest radiogram, diagnosing pneumonia is less difficult than identifying the cause of bilateral infiltration. The appropriate diagnosis of bilateral lung infiltrates in critically ill patients is crucial but difficult. In many cases, bilateral lung infiltrates are associated with noninfectious inflammatory diseases. Although previous reports show that a CPIS of more than 6 indicates a high likelihood of pneumonia, its diagnostic accuracy in bilateral lung infiltrates is controversial. A CPIS value greater than 6 was also a useful screening tool (82% sensitivity) in the present study, but its specificity for differential diagnosis of bilateral bacterial pneumonia was low (39%). In contrast to our findings, Gibot and colleagues reported that CPIS could be effectively applied to differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia (including community-acquired pneumonia). Our study included 68.4% of patients with a CPIS of more than 6, compared with 49% of patients in Gigot's study. It therefore seems that a CPIS of more than 6 is not an efficient factor in the diagnosis of pneumonia with bilateral lung infiltrates.

### Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a very rare, life-threatening complication [^117J3odq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, the presence of acute respiratory failure is generally associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome; however, it is essential to consider other differential diagnoses that require different, and urgent, therapeutic approaches. Herein we describe a COVID-19 case complicated with bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax. A previously healthy 45-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain and progressive shortness of breath 17 days after diagnosis with uncomplicated COVID-19 infection. He was tachypneic and presented severe hypoxemia (75% percutaneous oxygen saturation). Breath sounds were diminished bilaterally on auscultation. A chest X-ray revealed the presence of a large bilateral pneumothorax. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the large bilateral pneumothorax, with findings consistent with severe COVID-19 infection. Chest tubes were inserted, with immediate clinical improvement. Follow-up chest CT scan revealed resolution of bilateral pneumothorax, reduction of parenchymal consolidation, and formation of large bilateral pneumatoceles. The patient remained under observation and was then discharged home. Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax is a very rare, potentially life-threatening complication in patients with COVID-19. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this complication early to prevent potentially fatal consequences.
