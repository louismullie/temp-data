## Question

What are the treatment options for CLTI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining CLTI and establishing urgency and goals of therapy. Then, I should verify the foundational role of best medical therapy and risk factor modification. Next, I will examine revascularization strategy selection using the PLAN framework and reconcile endovascular-first versus surgery-first evidence. After that, I need to consider special populations and anatomic scenarios, followed by management of no-option patients. Finally, I should review non-revascularization therapies, wound care and infection control, and the importance of multidisciplinary care and outcome measurement, while continuously checking for internal consistency and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and why timing matters. CLTI is defined by PAD with rest pain, gangrene, or nonhealing ulceration beyond two weeks, and it excludes venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies; urgent referral to a vascular specialist is recommended because delays increase amputation risk, and contemporary guidelines emphasize revascularization for limb salvage as soon as feasible, ideally within days of presentation when tissue threat is high [^115JM1u5] [^112eWBhw] [^112msmke].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about procedures before medical optimization. Best medical therapy is mandatory for all patients and includes high-intensity statin therapy with add-on lipid-lowering if needed, antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel as a reasonable first choice and consideration of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin in selected patients, strict blood pressure and glycemic control, smoking cessation, diet and exercise counseling, and preventive foot care; these measures reduce cardiovascular events and may modestly improve limb outcomes, forming the backbone of care regardless of revascularization candidacy [^117RAevt] [^112xsbM9] [^116c6Pyi] [^115vaBHp] [^115ggr47] [^117M1oK3].

> I need to check the PLAN framework next because it drives revascularization decisions. Evidence-based revascularization hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk (average versus high risk by estimated perioperative mortality and 2-year survival), Limb severity (WIfI staging of wound, ischemia, and infection), and ANatomic complexity (GLASS staging of target artery path and limb-based patency), with the availability of autogenous vein further influencing the choice between endovascular and open bypass strategies [^112AjNoC] [^117M1oK3] [^114iEsny].

> Let me consider Patient risk stratification carefully. Average surgical risk is typically defined as anticipated perioperative mortality less than 5 percent with estimated 2-year survival greater than 50 percent, whereas high surgical risk is anticipated perioperative mortality at least 5 percent or estimated 2-year survival 50 percent or less; frailty independently worsens outcomes and often steers clinicians toward less invasive strategies, so I should confirm frailty assessments when selecting modality and counseling patients [^1133n24j] [^117VYkZF] [^116kCso8] [^116bZRSo].

> Next, I should review Limb severity using WIfI. WIfI integrates wound extent, degree of ischemia, and foot infection severity; patients with high-grade ischemia and tissue loss have substantially higher 1-year major amputation rates than those with rest pain alone, which justifies more aggressive and timely revascularization and underscores the need to control infection before definitive revascularization planning [^114iEsny] [^111U39sL] [^111Ce6LF].

> I will now examine ANatomic complexity with GLASS. GLASS stages infrainguinal disease by target artery path and limb-based patency, guiding whether endovascular therapy is likely to succeed; for example, GLASS stage IA aortoiliac disease often favors endovascular-first, whereas extensive multilevel disease with poor runoff may favor vein bypass in appropriate candidates, and I should double-check that inflow lesions are addressed before outflow when they are flow-limiting [^116a5P51] [^1177EtRS] [^117CTCis].

> But wait, what about the ongoing debate between endovascular-first and surgery-first strategies. Contemporary randomized data and meta-analyses suggest no significant differences in amputation-free survival or overall survival between endovascular-first and surgery-first approaches overall, though patency and durability often favor autologous vein bypass, particularly for below-knee targets; therefore, modality selection should be individualized by patient risk, limb severity, anatomy, and vein availability rather than a blanket endovascular-first policy [^116tUzvE] [^1111bnZC] [^111xmdJv] [^1149KERG].

> Let me verify the role of endovascular therapy in specific anatomic tiers. For aortoiliac inflow disease, endovascular revascularization is generally first-line, including treatment of common femoral artery disease in selected high-risk patients or hostile groins; for femoropopliteal disease, balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloons, and stenting are appropriate, with drug-eluting stents showing improved patency over bare-metal stents in some contexts; for infrapopliteal disease, plain balloon angioplasty remains common, with drug-eluting technologies promising but requiring careful selection and long-term follow-up given evolving safety signals [^1177EtRS] [^1175CLxb] [^1111bnZC] [^1123kcCW].

> I should confirm surgical bypass principles. Autologous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass, with great saphenous vein demonstrating superior primary and secondary patency compared with prosthetic grafts, especially to below-knee targets; prosthetic conduits should be reserved for situations where endovascular therapy is not feasible and suitable autogenous vein is unavailable, and patient selection should weigh perioperative risk and life expectancy [^115RZSq9] [^114rAMBp] [^111r1XBM] [^1138JFRk].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. In multilevel disease with low-grade ischemia or limited tissue loss, correcting inflow alone may suffice initially, reserving outflow reconstruction if the limb fails to improve; in high limb risk presentations, simultaneous inflow and outflow revascularization may be warranted; in ESRD, endovascular strategies are increasingly favored due to surgical risk, with early minor amputation considered to expedite healing when appropriate [^113Pjtxb] [^111SWoex] [^1142wNkt].

> Next, I should review no-option CLTI. A standardized classification identifies desert foot anatomy, lack of conduit, extensive tissue loss, prohibitive comorbidity, or nonfunctional limbs; for these patients, deep venous arterialization has emerging evidence for limb salvage, and cell or gene therapies remain investigational and should be restricted to clinical trials; I need to ensure patients are counseled about the experimental nature and potential benefits and risks of these approaches [^116F2Mcu] [^113f7UBy] [^111QGtAn].

> Let me consider non-revascularization therapies and be careful not to overstate their benefit. Intermittent pneumatic compression may be offered to carefully selected patients with rest pain or minor tissue loss when revascularization is not possible; spinal cord stimulation and hyperbaric oxygen have limited or unproven benefit and should be individualized; importantly, conservative care alone is associated with high 1-year mortality and major amputation rates, so shared decision-making must transparently communicate these risks [^115W6YQe] [^117M1oK3] [^115SuMm4].

> I need to ensure meticulous wound care and infection control are integrated. Deep space infection or wet gangrene requires urgent surgical drainage, debridement, and antibiotics, with limb restaging afterward; wound infection can still cause failure after successful revascularization, so coordinated podiatric and wound services are essential to optimize healing trajectories [^111Ce6LF] [^116k5C2X].

> Next, I should review system-level care. Multidisciplinary centers of excellence with defined protocols, outcomes tracking, and continuous quality improvement improve amputation prevention; all patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to vascular specialists unless primary amputation is medically urgent, and palliative strategies should be considered for those with limited life expectancy, poor functional status, or unsalvageable limbs after shared decision-making [^111QDc1K] [^116NMoMr] [^116wwBCu] [^1134GFPs].

> I should double-check how we measure success. Amputation-free survival is the most widely endorsed primary endpoint for CLTI trials, but it does not distinguish amputation level and may miss clinically important differences; time-integrated measures and composite endpoints such as major adverse limb events plus death better capture disease burden, and patient-reported outcomes require more CLTI-specific tools to detect meaningful changes in pain, function, and quality of life [^116B7t84] [^114qHovD] [^1115xCJQ] [^111Hq7rT].

> Let me reconsider the overall treatment algorithm to ensure coherence. All patients receive best medical therapy and risk factor modification; urgent vascular referral triggers WIfI staging and GLASS anatomic assessment; average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and complex anatomy may benefit from vein bypass, whereas high-risk patients or those with less complex disease may favor endovascular therapy; no-option patients are considered for investigational or emerging therapies within trials; throughout, infection control, wound care, and multidisciplinary coordination guide timing and choice of interventions to maximize limb salvage and survival [^117M1oK3] [^112AjNoC].

CLTI management centers on **urgent revascularization** [^112eWBhw] to restore inline flow, relieve rest pain, and heal tissue loss, with the choice between endovascular and surgical approaches individualized by anatomy, conduit, and comorbidity [^1149KERG] [^116bwLnN]. Best medical therapy is **mandatory** [^117RAevt] for all patients, including antiplatelet therapy, high-intensity statins, and risk-factor control [^112xsbM9]. For no-option patients, consider deep venous arterialization [^113f7UBy] or investigational cell/gene therapies in trials [^111QGtAn] [^114kq9kH]. Conservative care is reserved for non-reconstructible disease or high risk, with shared decision-making and palliative options as needed [^115SuMm4] [^1134GFPs]. Multidisciplinary care and structured surveillance improve outcomes and reduce amputation [^112AjNoC] [^117M1oK3].

---

## Revascularization strategies

Revascularization is the **cornerstone of CLTI care** [^112g8KwX], with the goal of restoring inline flow to the foot to enable healing and relieve pain [^116a5P51] [^112msmke]. The choice between endovascular and surgical revascularization depends on patient-specific factors, including anatomical complexity, comorbidities, and availability of autologous vein conduit [^1149KERG].

---

### Endovascular revascularization

- **Indications**: Endovascular therapy is recommended as first-line treatment in patients with increased surgical risk, inadequate autologous vein, or favorable anatomical lesions [^112c3PuT] [^112AjNoC].

- **Techniques**: Balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloons, stenting, and atherectomy are commonly used endovascular techniques [^notfound].

- **Outcomes**: Endovascular interventions offer lower perioperative morbidity and mortality, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, but may require repeat interventions due to restenosis or reocclusion [^116Jgch1].

---

### Surgical revascularization

- **Indications**: Surgical bypass is preferred in patients with good autologous vein, low surgical risk, and complex multilevel disease [^112AjNoC].

- **Conduit**: Autologous vein (preferably great saphenous vein) is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass, with prosthetic grafts reserved for cases without suitable vein [^114rAMBp] [^1138JFRk].

- **Outcomes**: Vein bypass grafts demonstrate superior long-term patency and limb salvage rates compared to prosthetic grafts, particularly in below-knee targets [^1111bnZC].

---

### Hybrid revascularization

Hybrid procedures combine endovascular and surgical techniques and are **considered** for complex multilevel disease, particularly when addressing both inflow and outflow lesions in a single session [^112msmke].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is **essential** for all CLTI patients to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and to improve overall outcomes [^117RAevt].

---

### Antiplatelet therapy

Antiplatelet therapy is **recommended** for all patients with CLTI [^116c6Pyi]; clopidogrel is preferred as the single antiplatelet agent [^115vaBHp]. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) may be considered for 1–6 months following endovascular interventions in patients at low bleeding risk [^112sPzZx].

---

### Lipid-lowering therapy

High-intensity statin therapy is **recommended** for all CLTI patients to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^112xsbM9]. If LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL despite statin therapy, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^112xsbM9].

---

### Antihypertensive and glycemic control

Blood pressure should be **tightly controlled** to reduce cardiovascular risk, and diabetes should be aggressively managed to improve wound healing and reduce infection risk [^112AjNoC].

---

### Smoking cessation

Smoking cessation is **strongly recommended**, as smoking significantly increases the risk of limb loss and cardiovascular events [^117M1oK3].

---

## Management of no-option CLTI

A subset of CLTI patients have "no-option" disease, characterized by extensive distal arterial occlusion, unsuitable anatomy, or prohibitive comorbidities [^116F2Mcu]. For these patients, **alternative therapies** include:

- **Deep venous arterialization**: A promising minimally invasive technique that bypasses occluded arteries by arterializing the venous system, improving perfusion and limb salvage rates [^113f7UBy].

- **Cell and gene therapy**: Investigational therapies targeting angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, currently limited to clinical trials [^111QGtAn] [^114kq9kH].

- **Conservative management**: Focused on wound care, pain control, and infection management, with shared decision-making regarding palliative care options [^115SuMm4] [^1134GFPs].

---

## Conservative management and palliative care

Conservative management is **appropriate** for patients with non-reconstructible disease, high surgical risk, or limited life expectancy. It emphasizes wound care, infection control, pain management, and cardiovascular risk reduction. Palliative care should be considered for patients with advanced disease, poor functional status, or limited life expectancy, focusing on symptom control and quality of life [^116wwBCu].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and follow-up

Multidisciplinary care involving vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, podiatrists, wound care specialists, and rehabilitation services is **essential** for optimal outcomes [^111QDc1K]. Structured surveillance programs are recommended to monitor for recurrence, restenosis, or new lesions, enabling timely interventions and reducing the risk of amputation [^117M1oK3].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Several emerging therapies are under investigation, including **novel endovascular devices**, bioresorbable stents, and advanced wound care technologies [^111BkGfS]. Regenerative medicine approaches, such as stem cell therapy and gene therapy, hold promise but require further research and validation [^117M1oK3]. Improved risk stratification tools and patient-reported outcome measures are being developed to guide treatment selection and evaluate outcomes [^112oKLp8] [^111Hq7rT].

---

CLTI management requires a **comprehensive, individualized approach** that balances revascularization, medical therapy, and supportive care. Endovascular and surgical revascularization remain the cornerstone of therapy, with the choice of modality guided by patient-specific factors. Medical management is essential for all patients, and emerging therapies offer hope for no-option patients. Multidisciplinary care and structured surveillance are critical to achieving optimal outcomes.

Chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) poses a significant treatment challenge for vascular surgeons, interventionalists, podiatrists, and associated medical specialists. The evidence for what constitutes appropriate care is rapidly evolving and new treatment options are in constant development. This review examines the current guidelines for CLTI care, as well as reported outcomes for multiple care strategies in this patient population, including revascularization and medical optimization. We performed a literature review of the PubMed database, reviewing articles that reported outcomes for CLTI care between 2000 and 2023, and described these outcomes as they relate to the current state of CLTI treatment. Significant data are still forthcoming regarding CLTI care, but widespread adoption of appropriate CLTI care is essential for the treatment of this vulnerable population.

As the number of patients afflicted by chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) continues to grow, new solutions are necessary to provide effective, durable treatment options that will lead to improved outcomes. The diagnosis of CLTI remains mostly clinical, and endovascular revascularization remains mostly balloon-based. Multiple innovative techniques and technologies are in development or in early usage that may provide new solutions. This review categorizes areas of advancement, highlights recent developments in the management of CLTI and looks forward to novel devices that are currently under investigation.

### Objective outcome measures for trials in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia across 2 decades: analysis and recommendations [^113RUEFt]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is prevalent and associated with morbidity and mortality. The published research concerning CLTI therapeutics is evolving. The goals of this review are to: 1) summarize the endpoints that are being used in trials assessing interventions for patients with CLTI; and 2) review gaps and discrepancies in current outcome definitions. A search was conducted of the PubMed database and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify studies published between January 2000 and March 2020 that evaluated treatment options for patients with CLTI. Meta-analyses, case series, case reports, abstracts, and expert opinion were excluded. Forty-nine studies (n = 11,667) were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most trials reported clinical outcomes (mortality, 69.4%; limb events, 87.8%; target lesion revascularization, 83.7%). Mean follow-up duration was 23.7 months. In investigational device exemption trials, total follow-up and follow-up to primary outcomes were discordant (12 months vs 6 months; P = 0.0018). Hemodynamic testing was reported in 71.4%, usually ankle-brachial index. Patency was assessed in 89.8% of trials; ultrasound was used in 65.3% and invasive angiography in 85.7%, at baseline and/or during follow-up. Wound assessment was performed in 49.0% of studies, qualitative in 28.6% and quantitative in 20.4%. Finally, quality of life assessment was performed in 55% of studies. Definitions for many outcomes varied across studies. Consensus regarding which outcomes to study, uniform definitions, and optimal methods to measure some of these outcomes are yet to be established. A comprehensive effort by all stakeholders is needed to move the field of CLTI forward.

### Modalities to deliver cell therapy for treatment of chronic limb threatening ischemia [^114kq9kH]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance: Chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) is a severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and especially limb loss. In patients with no options for revascularization, stem cell therapy is a promising treatment option. Recent Advances: Cell therapy directly delivered to the affected ischemic limb has been shown to be a safe, effective, and feasible therapeutic alternative for patients with severe PAD. Multiple methods for cell delivery, including local, regional, and combination approaches, have been examined in both pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. This review focuses on delivery modalities used in clinical trials that deliver cell therapy to patients with severe PAD. Critical Issues: Patients with CLTI are at high risk for complications of the disease, such as amputations, leading to a poor quality of life. Many of these patients do not have viable options for revascularization using traditional interventional or surgical methods. Clinical trials have shown therapeutic benefit for cell therapy in these patients, but methods of cell treatment are not standardized, including the method of cell delivery to the ischemic limb. Future Directions: The ideal delivery approach for stem cell therapy in PAD patients remains unclear. Further studies are needed to determine the best modality of cell delivery to maximize clinical benefits.

Guideline Summary

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is associated with mortality, amputation, and impaired quality of life. These Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are focused on definition, evaluation, and management of CLTI with the goals of improving evidence-based care and highlighting critical research needs. The term CLTI is preferred over critical limb ischemia, as the latter implies threshold values of impaired perfusion rather than a continuum. CLTI is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration > 2 weeks duration. Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric oxygen) has not been established. Regenerative medicine approaches (eg, cell, gene therapies) for CLTI should be restricted to rigorously conducted randomizsed clinical trials. The GVG promotes standardization of study designs and end points for clinical trials in CLTI. The importance of multidisciplinary teams and centers of excellence for amputation prevention is stressed as a key health system initiative.

### A review and proposed classification system for the no-option patient with chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^116F2Mcu]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A growing, but poorly defined subset of patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) have "no option" for revascularization. One notable subgroup includes patients with severe ischemia and advanced pedal artery occlusive disease, termed "desert foot", who are at high risk for major amputation due to a lack of conventional revascularization options. Although new therapies are being developed for no-option patients with desert foot anatomy, this subgroup and the broader group of no-option patients are not well defined, limiting the ability to evaluate outcomes. Based on a systematic review, a classification of the no-option CLTI patient was constructed for use in clinical practice and studies. Several no-option conditions were identified, including type I-severe and pedal occlusive disease (desert foot anatomy) for which there is no accepted method of repair; type II-lack of suitable venous conduit for bypass in the setting of an acceptable target for bypass; type III-extensive tissue loss with exposure of vital structures that renders salvage impossible; type IV-advanced medical comorbidities for which available revascularization options would pose a prohibitive risk; and type V-presence of a nonfunctional limb. While type I and type II patients may have no option for revascularization, type III and type V patients have wounds, infection, comorbidities, or functional status that may leave them with few options for revascularization. As treatment strategies continue to evolve and novel methods of revascularization are developed, the ability to identify no-option patients in a standardized fashion will aid in treatment selection and assessment of outcomes.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^111NxcYs]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) trial populations should reflect differences in therapeutic goals by presentation (ischemic rest pain versus minor or major tissue loss) and not mix or extrapolate findings between CLTI and intermittent claudication (IC); it is stated that combining IC and CLTI in the same study is rarely if ever appropriate and that extrapolation between them is inappropriate. Trials should describe enrolled patients by limb threat and anatomic burden of disease, note that amputation rates are higher with tissue loss than rest pain, and recognize that some patients with advanced disease will progress to amputation or death regardless of intervention.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — conceptual framework, nomenclature, and staging — This clinical practice guideline (CPC) intentionally seeks to create a new conceptual framework for the treatment of CLTI. It encompasses nomenclature, disease staging, and a platform for evidence-based revascularization (EBR) that will allow future evaluation and quality improvement in the field. Consistent and meaningful nomenclature is of fundamental importance for assessing the state of evidence and guiding future research efforts, and the GVG promotes the use of the term CLTI, defined by the target population, to denote the universe of patients with advanced lower limb ischemia, wounds, neuropathy, and infection who are commonly referred to vascular specialists for evaluation and management. Prior terms such as "critical" and "severe" limb ischemia connote specific hemodynamic thresholds and fail to recognize the full spectrum and inter-relatedness of components beyond ischemia that contribute to major limb amputation and long-term disability. Improved disease staging is mandatory for designing clinical trials, conducting comparative effectiveness research, identifying critical gaps in knowledge, and developing effective algorithms for treatment, and the GVG incorporates the SVS Lower Extremity Threatened Limb Classification System as a preferred staging system for CLTI.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of revascularization outcomes of infrainguinal chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^1111bnZC]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal strategy for revascularization in infrainguinal chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) remains debatable. Comparative trials are scarce, and daily decisions are often made using anecdotal or low-quality evidence.

Methods

We searched multiple databases through May 7, 2017, for prospective studies with at least 1-year follow-up that evaluated patient-relevant outcomes of infrainguinal revascularization procedures in adults with CLTI. Independent pairs of reviewers selected articles and extracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool outcomes across studies.

Results

We included 44 studies that enrolled 8602 patients. Periprocedural outcomes (mortality, amputation, major adverse cardiac events) were similar across treatment modalities. Overall, patients with infrapopliteal disease had higher patency rates of great saphenous vein graft at 1 and 2 years (primary: 87%, 78%; secondary: 94%, 87%, respectively) compared with all other interventions. Prosthetic bypass outcomes were notably inferior to vein bypass in terms of amputation and patency outcomes, especially for below knee targets at 2 years and beyond. Drug-eluting stents demonstrated improved patency over bare-metal stents in infrapopliteal arteries (primary patency: 73% vs 50% at 1 year), and was at least comparable to balloon angioplasty (66% primary patency). Survival, major amputation, and amputation-free survival at 2 years were broadly similar between endovascular interventions and vein bypass, with prosthetic bypass having higher rates of limb loss. Overall, the included studies were at moderate to high risk of bias and the quality of evidence was low.

Conclusions

There are major limitations in the current state of evidence guiding treatment decisions in CLTI, particularly for severe anatomic patterns of disease treated via endovascular means. Periprocedural (30-day) mortality, amputation, and major adverse cardiac events are broadly similar across modalities. Patency rates are highest for saphenous vein bypass, whereas both patency and limb salvage are markedly inferior for prosthetic grafting to below the knee targets. Among endovascular interventions, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-eluting stents appear comparable for focal infrapopliteal disease, although no studies included long segment tibial lesions. Heterogeneity in patient risk, severity of limb threat, and anatomy treated renders direct comparison of outcomes from the current literature challenging. Future studies should incorporate both limb severity and anatomic staging to best guide clinical decision making in CLTI.

### Outcomes of conservative treatment in patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SuMm4]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease. International guidelines recommend arterial revascularisation in patients with CLTI. However, these patients are often fragile elderly people with significant comorbidities, whose vascular anatomy is not always suitable for open or endovascular revascularisation. Recent studies have suggested acceptable outcomes of conservative treatment. A systematic review of the available literature was conducted to obtain best estimates of outcomes of conservative treatment in patients with CLTI.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central.

Review Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched from inception until September 2019. All studies reporting on outcomes of conservative treatment for CLTI were considered. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were done by two investigators independently. Risk of bias was evaluated with a modified version of the Cochrane tool for observational studies. Outcomes of interest were all cause mortality, major amputation, and amputation free survival (AFS) after at least 12 months of follow up. A random effects model was used for meta-analyses.

Results

Twenty-seven publications were included, consisting of 12 observational studies and 15 placebo arms from randomised clinical trials, totalling 1 642 patients. Most studies included patients with non-reconstructable CLTI. Overall study quality was moderate. The pooled 12 month all cause mortality rate in 14 studies comprising 1 003 patients was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] 13–25, I² = 73%). The pooled major amputation rate from 14 studies comprising 755 patients was 27% (95% CI 20–36, I² = 65%) after one year, and pooled AFS rate after 12 months in 11 studies with 970 patients was 60% (95% CI 52–67, I² = 75%).

Conclusion

Conservative treatment for patients with CLTI may be considered and does not always result in loss of limb or patient demise. The results of this review can be used to inform patients with CLTI about conservative treatment as part of a shared decision making process.

### Association of frailty with treatment selection and long-term outcomes among patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^116kCso8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic limb‐threatening ischemia (CLTI) represents the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease and has devastating consequences if left untreated, with a 22% cardiovascular mortality rate and a 22% major amputation rate at 1 year. Determining the optimal treatment strategy for each individual patient in the setting of these aggregate poor outcomes remains unclear. Although prompt revascularization is recommended in multiple major societal guidelines, it is often uncertain whether an endovascular or surgical approach is superior for a particular patient, as each strategy carries its unique advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, there may be competing risks of morbidity and mortality that negate the benefit of revascularization altogether and may favor palliation. As such, it is critical that factors associated with prognosis are identified and used to guide clinical decision‐making to improve CLTI outcomes.

Prior attempts at creating clinical risk stratification tools have focused on traditional comorbidities and their cumulative burden. However, these characteristics may not fully represent a patient's risk or candidacy for a specific invasive strategy. Recently, frailty has emerged as an important prognostic factor that can guide treatment selection and help identify patients with cardiovascular disease at greater risk of poor outcomes. Multiple methods have been adopted to measure frailty, including in‐person and health record‐based assessments. Despite the demonstrated utility of identifying patients with cardiovascular disease who are frail, the extension of these methods to larger CLTI populations is limited.

Therefore, this study involving patients hospitalized with CLTI aimed to examine the association of a health record‐based frailty measure with: (1) treatment choice and (2) outcomes. Such results can not only help inform shared decision‐making with patients on CLTI treatment options but can also help guide future studies examining the optimal treatment strategy for patients with CLTI.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — scope of palliative therapy: Palliative therapy should rarely include revascularization except in special circumstances, such as treatment of hemodynamically significant inflow disease, if needed to improve the likelihood of a successful amputation at the most distal possible level; and relief of intractable pain or to improve wound healing after shared decision-making with the patient, family, and vascular treatment team.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) trial end points are grouped into objective clinical (AFS, MALEs), subjective clinical (patient-reported outcome measures [PROMs] including generic and disease-specific HRQL instruments), hemodynamic (ankle and toe pressures and indices), and anatomic (patency: target lesion, vessel, and limb revascularization). To assess overall revascularization quality, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) should use a menu of outcomes derived from all four categories and include full health economic analysis; for example, in the United Kingdom the National Health Service will not usually fund interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in excess of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, which represents the UK willingness-to-pay threshold.

Study designs and trial end points in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) state: Use a research framework such as the IDEAL for gathering new data and evidence on the surgical and endovascular management of CLTI. Encourage funders, journal reviewers, and editors to prioritize prospective, multicenter, controlled, and preferably randomized studies over retrospective case series, studies using historical controls, or other less rigorous research methodologies. When RCTs are not feasible, use the OPG benchmarks from the SVS's Critical Limb Ischemia Working Group to evaluate the efficacy of novel endovascular CLTI techniques and devices. To facilitate sufficient enrollment, limit RCT exclusion criteria to those who are deemed essential to trial integrity. Design RCTs, prospective cohort studies, and registries that are specific to CLTI. Use an integrated, limb-based threatened limb classification system (eg, WIfI) and a whole limb anatomic classification scheme (eg, GLASS) to describe the characteristics and outcomes of CLTI patients who are enrolled. Describe outcomes in CLTI trials using a combination of objective and clinically relevant events, subjective PROMs and HRQL assessments, and anatomic and hemodynamic end points. Require regulatory trials aimed at obtaining premarket approval for devices for use in CLTI to study CLTI patients and to present data on objective and clinically relevant end points, PROMs and HRQL assessments, and anatomic and hemodynamic end points. Follow up patients in trials for a time sufficient (this will usually be > 2 years) to allow appropriate comparison of the impact of the different interventions on the natural history of CLTI, and measure and declare completeness of follow-up coverage to quantify risk of attrition bias. Include a time-integrated measure of clinical disease severity (such as freedom from CLTI) in the CLTI trial design to describe the total impact of comparator CLTI interventions. Publish all CLTI trial protocols together with the full statistical analysis plans in peer-reviewed journals to allow independent, public, and transparent scrutiny and to prevent nonreporting of negative trials. Conduct postmarketing surveillance data collection using well-designed, large observational studies and registries.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^117XQkKB]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Introduction — rationale and goals: Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) represents the end stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), a problem of growing prevalence and increased health care costs around the globe. CLTI is a highly morbid disease, incurring significant mortality, limb loss, pain, and diminished health-related quality of life (HRQL) among those afflicted. Multiple health care specialists are involved in the management of CLTI, yet lack of public awareness and the frequent failure to make an early diagnosis continue to be major obstacles to effective treatment. Variability in practice patterns is high, contributing to a broad disparity in the use of treatments and clinical outcomes. For example, a study from the United States suggested that many patients do not even receive angiography in the year before major limb amputation.

### The double burden: deciphering chronic limb-threatening ischemia in end-stage renal disease [^1142wNkt]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) poses significant challenges in clinical management due to its unique pathology and poor treatment outcomes. This review calls for a tailored classification and risk assessment for these patients to guide better revascularization choices with early minor amputation as a first-line strategy in advanced stages.

Methods

This review consolidates key findings from recent literature on CLTI in ESRD, focusing on disease mechanisms, treatment options, and patient outcomes. It evaluates the literature to clarify the decision-making process for managing CLTI in ESRD.

Results

CLTI in ESRD patients often results in worse clinical outcomes, such as nonhealing wounds, increased limb loss, and higher mortality rates. While the literature reveals ongoing debates regarding the optimal revascularization method, recent retrospective studies and meta-analyses suggest potential benefits of endovascular treatment (EVT) over open bypass surgery (OB) in reducing mortality and wound complications, with comparable amputation-free survival rates.

Conclusions

The selection of revascularization methods in ESRD patients with CLTI is complex, necessitating individualized strategies. The importance of early detection and timely intervention is critical to decelerate disease progression and improve revascularization outcomes. There is a shift in these treatment strategies toward less invasive endovascular procedures, acknowledging the limitations these patients face with open revascularization surgeries. Considering early minor amputations after revascularization could prevent worse consequences, reflecting a shift in the approach to managing CLTI in ESRD patients.

Why the current tools are too generic for use in CLTI.

As outlined elsewhere in this article, the gaps in existing PROMs for patients with CLTI are related to specificity and the spectrum of symptoms encountered by patients facing this disease. The need for discrimination in these PROMs is vital, because any of the new treatments that will be tested in CLTI require a careful assessment of any treatment effect. Such treatments include the full range of medical, biologic, regenerative, revascularization, and nonrevascularization interventions currently available or under development for CLTI. Capturing these treatment effects will be difficult, if not impossible, if the assessment tools are too general in nature and do not fully explore the domains of PROMs. Detecting a signal of a treatment effect will require more precise assessment of domains, and assessment of other domains not measured by these tools. By designing more precise and descriptive PROMs with more relevant domains calibrated to the treatment effects likely to be seen in these patients, we will both better understand individual treatment effects, as well as better evaluate existing and new therapies in clinical trials. A sample of currently enrolling trials studying patients with CLTI and incorporating PROMs is shown in Table II.

How stakeholders can work to advance PROMs in CLTI.

The VascularCures Foundation has a dedicated interest in partnering with researchers, patients, and investigators who are committed to a better understanding of treatment outcomes in PAD. By convening a multidisciplinary group of clinician-scientists, researchers, patients, regulatory experts, and industry partners to perform comprehensive review, we hope to develop a broad foundation which will provide solid footing for the emergence of a widely applicable, validated set of PROMs in CLTI.

PROMs for patients with CLTI will need to inform decisions affecting individuals, groups, and, most important, patients with CLTI. These discussions will be beneficial to inform patient decision-making when individuals consider treatment options. Further, PROMs will be needed when treatments are compared across different groups in clinical trials. – Finally, the overall impact of systematic treatment of the comorbidities which often occurs concomitantly with CLTI, such as diabetes and smoking, may have small impact at the individual level. However, when examining small changes in QoL using accurate tools, differences may be detectable in large populations if the measures are precise and reproducible. Finally, ensuring that stakeholders contribute broadly from different populations will help to ensure that these new measures translate outcomes across race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and socioeconomic status.

### A systematic review of patient-reported outcome measures patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^112gKnFi]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is estimated to affect more than 200 million individuals around the globe, with an incidence increasing owing to aging, diabetes, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The most severe manifestation of PAD is chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI; also referred to as "critical limb ischemia" or CLI), where severe vascular insufficiency leads to disabling pain, wounds, and gangrene of the lower limb. CLTI incurs significant mortality, morbidity, and negative effects on physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients with CLTI often have other significant comorbidities and are at increased risk for both mortality and major amputation (each estimated at 22% at 1 year). The management of these patients is multimodal, often requiring medical therapy, analgesics, wound care, revascularization, and associated surgical procedures such as minor and major amputation. Frequently multiple providers are involved in the care of patients with CLTI. Decision-making for individual patients with CLTI is a complex balance of estimated risks and benefits, inadequately informed by high-quality evidence. Recent and ongoing clinical trials are attempting to address this evidence gap, while contemporary practice guidelines promote greater standardization in evaluation and treatment. –

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^112AjNoC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Global vascular guidelines — revascularization planning and best medical therapy for CLTI specify that evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three integrated axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN), and average risk and high risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2 year all-cause mortality. The guidelines propose a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS) that defines a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimates limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention; the optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery, and recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention; all patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy, including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care, and following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised.

### Clinical effectiveness and resource utilization of surgery versus endovascular therapy for chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^116Jgch1]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical effectiveness of surgical versus endovascular therapy for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) continues to be debated, and the resources required for each therapy are unclear.

Methods

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing surgery with endovascular therapy for CLTI, which reported clinical effectiveness and resource utilization. Short-term and long-term clinical outcomes were examined.

Results

The search yielded 4,231 titles, of which 17 publications met our inclusion criteria. Five publications were all from 1 RCT, and 12 publications were observational studies. In the RCT, the surgical approach had greater resource use in the first year (total hospital days across all admissions for surgery versus angioplasty: 46.14 ± 53.87 vs. 36.35 ± 51.39; P < 0.001; also true for days in high-dependency and intensive therapy units), but differences were not statistically significant in subsequent years. All-cause mortality presented a nonsignificant difference favoring angioplasty in the first 2 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.75–2.15), but after 2 years, it favored surgical treatment (aHR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.17–0.71). The observational studies reported short-term effectiveness and resource utilization favoring endovascular therapy, but most differences were not statistically significant. Long-term outcomes were more mixed; in particular, mortality outcomes generally favored surgery, although concluding that cause and effect is not possible as endovascularly treated patients tended to be older and may have had a shorter life expectancy regardless of therapy.

Conclusions

The clinical effectiveness and resource utilization of surgery compared with endovascular therapy for CLTI is not known with certainty and will not be known until ongoing trials report results. It is likely that findings will vary by the time horizon, where initial outcomes and utilization tend to favor endovascular interventions, but long-term outcomes favor surgical revascularization.

### An endovascular-versus a surgery-first revascularization strategy for chronic limb-threatening ischemia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116tUzvE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Timely revascularization is essential for limb salvage and to reduce mortality in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). In patients who are candidates for endovascular therapy and surgical bypass, the optimal revascularization strategy remains uncertain. Recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have presented conflicting results. We conducted a trial-level meta-analysis to compare the outcomes between endovascular-first and surgery-first strategies for revascularization. PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify RCTs comparing the outcomes of endovascular-first versus surgery-first strategies for revascularization in patients with CLTI. Data were pooled for major outcomes and their aggregate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random-effects model. Kaplan-Meier curves for amputation-free survival and overall survival time were plotted using the pooled aggregated data from published curves, with their corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals reported for up to 5 years of follow-up. A total of 3 RCTs with 2,627 patients (1,312 endovascular-first and 1,315 surgery-first) were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 1,864 patients (70.9%) were men and 347 (13.2%) were older than 80 years. Comparing the endovascular-first and surgery-first approaches, there was no significant difference in the overall (HR 0.92 [0.83 to 1.01], p = 0.09) or amputation-free survival (HR 0.98 [0.92 to 1.03], p = 0.42), reintervention (RR 1.24 [0.74 to 2.07], p = 0.41), major amputation, (RR 1.16 [0.87 to 1.54], p = 0.31), or therapeutic crossover (RR 0.92 [0.37 to 2.26], p = 0.85). In conclusion, data from available RCTs suggest that there is no difference in clinical outcomes between endovascular-first and surgery-first revascularization strategies for CLTI. A planned patient-level meta-analysis may provide further insight.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^115qpQgA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Study designs and IDEAL framework in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) note that the evidence base underpinning the surgical and endovascular management of CLTI is weak compared with coronary and pharmacologic fields, and methodologies used by the pharmaceutical industry to generate level I evidence cannot be easily transferred to revascularization for CLTI. 11.1 Use a research framework such as the IDEAL for gathering new data and evidence on the surgical and endovascular management of CLTI, and the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, and Long-term study (IDEAL) framework provides a system for evaluating new surgical and interventional therapies that can be adapted for use in CLTI. Depending on the stage of surgical innovation the IDEAL framework describes different methodologies, but once the assessment stage has been reached, RCTs remain by far the most reliable means of comparing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies and should be the method of choice whenever it is practically and financially feasible; alternative approaches such as large administrative databases and prospective registries may offer relative low cost, simplicity, and improved external validity yet carry risks including treatment bias, confounding, nonrandom treatment assignment, sampling errors, and imprecise causality, some of which can be mitigated by multivariate analysis, while registries still help identify practice trends and capture experiences of particular subsets.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^1146D9TA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic limb-threatening ischemia:

- Definition: CLTI, also known as critical limb ischemia, is a severe form of PAD characterized by ischemia and tissue necrosis due to inadequate blood flow to the extremities.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of CLTI primarily involves inadequate blood supply to the limb tissues due to atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or embolism, leading to tissue hypoxia and ischemia.
- Epidemiology: The annual incidence of CLTI is estimated at 36.2 per 100,000 population, with rates as high as 330 per 100,000 population in the elderly.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for CLTI include advanced age, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, renal failure, HF, history of stroke, prior open revascularization, and multiple reinterventions after lower extremity revascularization for claudication.
- Disease course: CLTI is characterized by non-healing ulcers, gangrene, and severe limb pain, often at rest.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of CLTI is often poor, with high mortality rates and a significant risk of major amputation. The risk of major amputation (above the ankle) or death, or both, ranges between 20% and 40% at 1 year in untreated cases.

### Percutaneous approach to deep vein arterialization for the "no-option" chronic limb-threatening ischemia patient [^113f7UBy]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia is an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease characterized by rest pain or tissue loss. Treatment of patients classified as "no-option" CLTI remains particularly challenging, as historically their primary treatment has been limited to major amputation. Venous arterialization has emerged as a promising alternative in this difficult-to-treat population. Advances in optimized technology and endovascular techniques, particularly deep venous arterialization, have had encouraging outcomes for long-term limb salvage. Successful limb preservation relies on proper patient selection, a compliant patient, and a robust multidisciplinary clinical team to support the complex processes of deep venous arterialization maturation and wound healing. This review will discuss the historical background of venous arterialization, patient selection criteria, and surgical techniques for percutaneous deep venous arterialization, and postoperative management after the index procedure, including wound care, surveillance, and reintervention strategies for successful limb salvage.

Objective performance goals (OPGs) — standardized outcome measures for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — were developed by the SVS Critical Limb Ischemia Working Group and derived from CLTI patients undergoing open bypass in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The OPGs include "major adverse limb events (MALE) and postoperative death as a measure of early safety and AFS to define longer term clinical effectiveness", and additional safety and efficacy OPGs and risk-stratified guidelines for defined subgroups were identified. The initiative's main aim was "to establish benchmark values against which novel endovascular therapies could be initially evaluated without undertaking full RCTs", but "without good-quality RCTs, OPGs cannot be refreshed and, over time, will increasingly come to rely on historical controls", so "RCTs are still required to determine both the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness once safety and efficacy OPGs have been met".

Global vascular guidelines — time-to-event analysis for CLTI trials highlight limits of time-to-first-event end points and the role of time-integrated measures. There is a compelling need to develop end points that move beyond a simple time-to-first-event analysis. End points such as AFS can reliably capture limb amputation and death, and MALE and other end points focused on reintervention can capture the early clinical impact of treatment failure, but collectively these may present an incomplete assessment of the total impact of treatment strategies over time. The primary goal of a time-integrated measure for CLTI disease severity should be to more accurately assess long-term relief from commonly occurring multiple events, and without such an approach even an otherwise well designed CLTI trial may be incomplete and potentially misleading.

Lipid-lowering therapy in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) emphasizes statins with add-on options and randomized controlled trial (RCT) data: For high-risk patients, "high-intensity/ maximally tolerated statin dosing is recommended; and if on-treatment LDL-C levels remain ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), the addition of ezetimibe is considered reasonable". In PAD patients already on statins, the FOURIER RCT with evolocumab (a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitor) reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) as the composite endpoint was significantly reduced "(hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; p = 0.0040)" and "There was also a reduction in the risk of MALEs, including acute limb ischemia and major amputation". The on-page recommendation for CLTI states: "Use moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CLTI", graded 1 (Strong) with level of evidence A (High).

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^112sPzZx]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) endovascular intervention — dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) use and outcomes: Despite an absence of level 1 evidence, DAPT is frequently employed for 1 to 6 months after peripheral interventions. In the MIRROR double-blind RCT after IP intervention comparing aspirin and placebo vs aspirin and clopidogrel for 6 months, of the 80 patients randomized, 42% had CLTI; decreased target lesion revascularization occurred in the DAPT arm with no significant difference in patency rate. A meta-analysis suggested that DAPT might be associated with a reduced risk of major amputations after revascularization, with increased bleeding risk vs monotherapy, and a propensity-adjusted analysis from the Vascular Quality Initiative associated DAPT use with improved survival after revascularization for CLTI. The efficacy of DAPT may depend on procedure-related, anatomic, and patient factors; subgroups who may derive more benefit include those with complex disease patterns, prior failed interventions, and those at lower risk of bleeding complications (eg, younger patients); adequately powered RCTs are needed to define risks, benefits, and optimal dosing and duration. It has been estimated that between 4% and 30% of individuals treated with conventional doses of clopidogrel do not attain the full antiplatelet response.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^116a5P51]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

GLASS rationale for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — An accurate assessment of limb threat and stratification of the anatomic pattern of disease are the foundations of EBR, and the authors propose a new, clinically oriented framework for classifying the pattern of arterial disease in CLTI, noting that GLASS is a fundamental departure from current approaches used in PAD and more analogous to the SYNTAX system for CAD. Current PAD anatomic classification schemes either describe the location and severity of individual arterial lesions or quantify the overall burden and morphology of disease, and although lesion- or segment-based grading systems are useful for comparing endovascular device performance in well-defined clinical situations, they are not, however, useful for defining EBR strategies in CLTI, especially given the complex, multilevel, and increasingly distal disease patterns typically seen in current clinical practice. Successful revascularization in CLTI, particularly in patients with tissue loss, nearly always requires restoration of pulsatile in-line flow to the foot, and because individual lesion-based schemes correlate poorly with effective revascularization in CLTI, vascular specialists must integrate approaches for arterial segments into a management strategy for the whole limb.

Global vascular guidelines — sample and effect size considerations for CLTI randomized controlled trials (RCTs) warn about optimistic effect estimates and ethical design. CLTI patients in the "nonactive treatment" placebo group often have better-than-expected outcomes compared with similar patients treated outside research, making it harder to show differences in effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. As a result, researchers must avoid basing power calculations on an unrealistically large effect size; it is widely agreed it is poor science and unethical to embark on a trial with no realistic prospect of answering the question, and an overpowered trial is also undesirable because it misuses resources and may disadvantage patients by continuing treatment of little or no value or even potentially harmful.

Paclitaxel-eluting devices (PTX) for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in the femoral and/or popliteal arteries identified an increased mortality at two years and beyond for patients treated with PTX devices versus controls, and these trials largely enrolled intermittent claudication patients with a small minority (11%) within the spectrum of CLTI. In the interim the US Food and Drug Administration has urged caution in the use of PTX devices for treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The GVG Steering Committee believes that the risks and benefits of treatments for CLTI, including drug-eluting devices, need to be examined with appropriately controlled, prospective studies that are specific to the CLTI population, and states that the execution of randomized controlled trials involving PTX-eluting devices in CLTI, with appropriate safety monitoring and community oversight, are important to the vascular community. Such trials should incorporate appropriate informed consent discussions with subjects, including the potential increased risk of mortality, and should mandate long-term follow-up for at least 2 years. Outside of such trials, given the indeterminate risk and efficacy of these devices in patients with CLTI, and the availability of alternative modalities, we believe appropriate caution should be exercised.

### Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^1175DqJY]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted patients with conditions that are associated with significant morbidity, but might not be immediately life-threatening. Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) were affected by delays in care, potentially increasing major limb amputations. This study sought to review strategies employed, and limb salvage outcomes reported, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a literature review of the electronic database PubMed from December 2019 to December 2020. Articles subjected to analysis must have had a specific CLTI group before the pandemic to compare to the pandemic group. Case reports, case series, and non-CLTI comparisons were excluded. The literature search yielded 55 articles for review, of which 6 articles met criteria for analysis. The main classifications used for disease stratification included Rutherford, Fontaine, and SVS WIfI (Wound, Ischemia, Foot Infection). Overall, a decrease in vascular clinical volume was reported, ranging from 29% to 54%. A higher major limb amputation rate (2.6% to 32.2%) during the pandemic surge was reported in 5 of 6 publications. Four of 6 studies also reported minor amputations; 3 of these demonstrated an increase in minor amputations (7% to 17.7%). The CLTI population is vulnerable and it appears that both minor and major amputation rates increased in this population during the pandemic. The limited data available in CLTI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and use of different stratifications schemes in areas impacted to variable extents prevent recommendations for the best treatment strategy. Further data are required to improve strategies for treating this population to minimize negative outcomes.

### The current state of critical limb ischemia: a systematic review [^112g8KwX]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chronic critical limb ischemia, marked by intractable lower extremity ischemic rest pain and tissue loss, is a highly morbid condition that leads to the loss of ambulation and decreased quality of life. It is associated with a high risk of limb loss and mortality and presents a significant economic burden to society.

Objective

To review the current state of epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of critical limb ischemia.

Evidence Review

An extensive literature search of the subject matter was conducted on material published in English between 1980 and 2016; both landmark and recently published articles were evaluated. Articles were reviewed if they included the terms critical limb ischemia, ischemic rest pain, gangrene, or extremity ulcers.

Findings

Critical limb ischemia represents the end stage of peripheral arterial disease. Because peripheral arterial disease is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, critical limb ischemia is heavily associated with smoking and diabetes. Revascularization is the cornerstone of therapy to prevent limb amputation, and both open vascular surgery and endovascular therapy play a key role in the treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia. However, few scientific data are available to identify the optimal revascularization strategy, which has led to a significant amount of variability and equipoise in the treatment of this condition. Medical therapy plays a significant role in optimizing coexistent cardiovascular risk factors and a limited role in improving limb outcomes in nonrevascularizable disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

Understanding critical limb ischemia and its treatment strategies is important for providing the best care for affected patients. Currently, ongoing randomized clinical trials in North America and the United Kingdom aim to provide data to support the best management of these patients.

Systematic reviews in CLTI — Study counts and interim guidance: A systematic review comparing open and endovascular treatments for CLTI found only nine studies meeting standard criteria, three of which were RCTs, and only BASIL met all study quality benchmarks. Researchers concluded that low-quality evidence suggested similar mortality and amputation outcomes but better expected patency for bypass surgery, with broadly similar conclusions across other comparative reviews. OPGs for endovascular interventions in CLTI based on open surgical data have been suggested to provide minimum standards of safety and efficacy until direct comparative data become available.

### Association of frailty with treatment selection and long-term outcomes among patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^116bZRSo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with long‐term follow‐up, we evaluated the impact of a claims‐based measurement of frailty on treatment selection and outcomes among patients hospitalized with CLTI. We found the following notable results. Patients hospitalized for CLTI were, on average, more frail than the community‐dwelling Medicare beneficiary population. Frailty was a useful tool to discriminate whether a patient underwent a revascularization strategy versus a non‐invasive treatment approach, irrespective of most traditional comorbidities. The presence of frailty also impacted who underwent an endovascular revascularization strategy versus surgical. Furthermore, regardless of treatment strategy, frailty was independently associated with worse outcomes, even after adjusting for an array of demographics and comorbidities. This association was primarily driven by an increased risk of death and not necessarily by differences in amputation. These results suggest that frailty can be used to prognosticate future outcomes and guide shared decision‐making with patients about the various treatment options available.

We found evidence that treatment selection for patients hospitalized with CLTI is influenced by frailty, a multidimensional syndrome characterized by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Previous studies have shown that patients with CLTI who receive conservative or endovascular therapy are likely to have more comorbidities than those who receive surgical therapy. Guidelines currently recommend endovascular over surgical treatment for CLTI in patients with substantial comorbidities, which may place them at higher risk of postoperative complications from surgical revascularization. Our finding that frail patients are more likely to receive endovascular intervention, despite controlling for comorbidities, reflects how clinicians may already consider frailty in the selection of appropriate treatment options for patients with CLTI. However, a frailty assessment may be one method to improve communication about what characteristics of the patient may make them a better or worse candidate for a particular revascularization strategy, thereby improving patient counseling and comprehension.

CLTI anatomic outcome considerations indicate limitations of patency-based metrics: "Anatomic outcomes such as patency have been widely used in regulatory trials designed to obtain premarketing authorizations despite the well-recognized problematic relationship between these outcomes and clinical success", and "clinically driven target lesion and target vessel revascularization are inappropriate in the context of CLTI". Patency is "further limited by the lack of consensus with regard to definitions after endovascular interventions", and "The role of patency and other anatomic end points within CLTI trial methodology needs to be better defined".

As the number of patients affected by peripheral arterial disease continues to increase, new technical approaches and devices have been developed to provide effective and durable treatment options that will lead to improved outcomes. While the mainstay of endovascular intervention remains mostly balloon-based, several innovative techniques and technologies are in development that may provide new solutions. This review highlights recent endovascular advancements in the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia and additional adjunctive devices that are needed to improve lesion patency, reduce the need for reintervention, and lead to better patient-centered functional outcomes.

### The need for improved risk stratification in chronic critical limb ischemia [^1146R9nZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Vascular surgeons are well acquainted with chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI), the most severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease, with patients presenting with ischemic rest pain or ulcerations, or both. Epidemiologic data predict a burgeoning epidemic of CLI within the United States, commensurate with the increasing incidence and prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors, especially age and diabetes. Untreated, the risk of major amputation (above the ankle) or death, or both, ranges between 20% and 40% at 1 year. Current open and endovascular therapies have imperfect results, diverse treatment options, and recommendations that are often conflicting and confuse physicians, industry, and patients alike. The best treatment options are ideally evaluated by prospective, randomized controlled trials. However, these have proven impractical in CLI because the rapid evolution of devices and techniques has outstripped the ability to measure outcomes and compare treatment options. Alternatively, risk-stratifying models have been proposed to allow physicians, patients, and industry to objectively evaluate new therapeutics and devices as they evolve. These models are developed from prospective cohorts to identify and quantify variables that can subsequently predict outcome in individual patients. The risk stratification models can also compare CLI outcomes between physicians and institutions, supporting quality assessments, and compensation decisions within Accountable Care Organizations under the Affordable Health Care Act (ACA). Widespread adoption of risk-stratification schemes has yet to occur, despite the critical need for such a tool in CLI, because present models lack optimal predictive ability and generalizability. The passage of the ACA amplifies the importance of developing an improved risk-stratification tool to ensure equitable quality assessments and compensation. This review presents current risk-stratification models for CLI with a summary of the respective strengths and limitations of each. Future research is needed to simplify and improve the accuracy and generalizability of risk stratification in CLI.

- Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up care may be needed. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Different types of targeted therapy are used to treat CLL:

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy: This treatment blocks the enzyme, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to develop into more white blood cells than the body needs. Ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, and duvelisib are TKIs used to treat symptomatic or progressive, recurrent, or refractory CLL.
- Immunotherapy with or without rituximab.
- A clinical trial of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. All of these treatments may be used for patients being treated for the first time and those who have been treated before. Because these treatments have not been compared in studies, it is not possible to know if one treatment is better than another. The choice of treatment is made based on test results, the patient's age and general health, and the desire to minimize short-term and long-term side effects.
- Targeted therapy with any of the following drugs:

- A tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
- Venetoclax with or without obinutuzumab or rituximab.
- Ofatumumab with or without chemotherapy.
- Duvelisib.
- Chemotherapy with or without rituximab.
- Immunotherapy with or without rituximab.
- Bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
- Radiation therapy as palliative treatment to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.
- A clinical trial of CAR T-cell therapy.

### Validating GLASS score in predicting acute limb events in CLTI… [^112JbVqX]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Following the diagnosis, the best management course is recommended by a multidisciplinary team, considering each patient's disease pattern and overall health. Treatment options include performing a key-hole procedure, called an endovascular procedure within the artery, where the vascular surgeon will be using a balloon to widen the artery, and/or a wire-reinforced stent which remains inside the artery serving as a scaffolding to keep it open. The primary aim of the PROMOTE GLASS study is to investigate if the Global Anatomical Staging System score, which is a summation of points given according to the disease pattern as seen on assessment images can accurately tell if the treatment using catheters and stents inside blood vessels will work well for people with ischemia in their legs.

The Global Vascular Guideline is an expert consensus, representing every major vascular society, aiming to promote a standardized evidence-based approach to assessing and treating patients with Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia. In terms of revascularization, the GVG recommendations revolve around three independent variables: patient risk, limb severity, and anatomic complexity. Each section is fundamental to providing successful treatment to the patient, much controversy remains on which patterns of anatomical disease should be treated with endovascular or open surgery. To that end, the GLobal Anatomic Staging System was developed and adopted by the GVG committee as an angiographic scoring system to quantify the extent of infra-inguinal disease and predict the likely success of treatment with endovascular techniques.

The purpose of this longitudinal prospective study is to examine the validity and reliability of the GLASS score in predicting ITS, LBP, MALE, MLLA, and OS in patients with CLTI, eventually helping to identify those patients who are likely to benefit from EVT. This could help clinicians make more informed decisions about treatment options, potentially reducing the need for more invasive procedures and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the GLASS score could be used as a tool for patient selection in future clinical trials evaluating endovascular interventions for CLTI.
- Palliative revascularization
- Patient with expected problems of maintaining a 1-year follow-up
- Patients with previously implanted devices within the affected segment.

### Behavioral treatment for tics that works | Tourette syndrome… [^113DjtLe]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics is a type of behavioral therapy that can help people with tics and tic disorders manage their tics better.
- CBIT can be effective for many people with tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome. Background For many years, medication was the only real treatment option for children and adults with TS. Medication can help control tics, but it doesn't always work. Medication can also cause side effects that make people feel bad and can lead to other health problems. Researchers working with the Tourette Association of America began developing and testing a promising treatment option that does not use medication, called comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics, or CBIT. An effective treatment option When CBIT was first developed, health professionals were concerned that it could cause more misunderstandings about tics.

Just because tics can be managed by changing behavior doesn't mean that tics are done by choice. Experts now suggest using CBIT as the first approach to treatment because its effectiveness is similar to medications but with fewer side effects. During the past decade, there has been increasing evidence that CBIT can be effective for many people with Tourette. Linda Rowland, mother of Lucas, 15, who has Tourette syndrome, shared her experience: Keep in mind.
- CDC partners with TAA to provide CBIT training for health professionals and educational programs about CBIT for people who have TS and their families. In the past decade, the partnership has supported 120 CBIT programs with about 3, 700 attendees. TAA has also supported 33 training institutes for CBIT, with close to 300 practitioners becoming licensed to provide CBIT to their patients.

- With limited options for direct access to training and treatment in the current environment, there is more need than ever to find ways to use telehealth approaches. TAA has worked with experts to identify ways to provide teletraining to professionals who want to learn about CBIT. They also assist professionals who have been trained on CBIT so that they can learn to provide the therapy to their clients via telehealth. In the long term, telehealth can help families who live in rural areas, who have difficulty finding time to visit with a provider, or who have trouble finding a trained provider by giving them options for accessing treatment.
