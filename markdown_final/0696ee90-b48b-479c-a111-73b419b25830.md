## Question

Which signs and symptoms are the most reliable for diagnosing heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which signs and symptoms are most reliable for diagnosing heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework, especially likelihood ratios and pre-test probability. Then, I should review high-credibility emergency department data to anchor reliability. Next, I will compare this with primary care data and flag bias. After that, I should synthesize consistent clinical themes and note limitations, particularly HFpEF. Finally, I will rank the most reliable findings and clarify how combinations and confirmatory testing with natriuretic peptides and echocardiography fit into practice.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Reliability of individual findings is best expressed via likelihood ratios, and their impact depends greatly on the clinical setting and the pre-test probability, so ED-derived LRs often generalize better than pre-selected primary care cohorts where spectrum and selection biases can inflate estimates [^114Wjz9q] [^115UV5nx].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility ED synthesis. The JAMA Rational Clinical Examination review in dyspneic ED patients shows that a third heart sound (S3) is the most reliable individual clinical sign with a positive LR around 11, while a past history of heart failure carries a positive LR near 5.8; paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea offers modest incremental value with a positive LR about 2.6, and for comparison, pulmonary venous congestion on chest radiograph has an LR around 12 and atrial fibrillation on ECG about 3.8 [^114Wjz9q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from primary care data. The Portuguese primary care study preselected patients using a Boston questionnaire threshold or diuretic use, which inflates LRs for symptoms such as orthopnea and PND and for therapeutic history like diuretic or digoxin exposure, making those impressive numbers (for example, orthopnea LR near 39, PND near 36, prior pulmonary edema above 50) not generalizable to unselected patients and vulnerable to circular reasoning and incorporation bias [^114KKJug].

> I will now examine consistent clinical themes across sources. Reproducibly useful signs include an S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral edema, with a displaced apical impulse often reflecting remodeling rather than diagnostic specificity; among symptoms, exertional dyspnea is common but nonspecific, whereas orthopnea and PND are more specific pointers toward congestion than dyspnea alone, and rapid weight gain and fatigue modify the picture but lack standalone specificity [^114Wjz9q] [^115Y881R] [^115UV5nx].

> Wait, let me verify broader limitations and context. Guidelines emphasize that no single sign or symptom is sufficiently sensitive or specific to diagnose heart failure, recommending a composite clinical assessment supported by natriuretic peptides to rule in or out, and echocardiography to establish cardiac structure and function; diagnostic performance also varies by phenotype, with HFpEF particularly challenging and often missed in community settings, and exercise hemodynamics can unmask HFpEF when resting measures and biomarkers are nondiagnostic [^115UV5nx] [^111VTuRa] [^112skMbR] [^114CbNvR] [^11568J43].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchy, being careful to keep setting in mind. First, the S3 gallop is the most reliable bedside sign in ED data, strongly increasing the probability when present; a prior history of heart failure is the strongest historical factor and meaningfully shifts post-test probability. Second, orthopnea and PND are more specific than exertional dyspnea, with modest LRs in unbiased ED data but larger, likely inflated LRs in preselected primary care cohorts, while elevated jugular venous pressure is consistently predictive of congestion though precise LRs vary by study. Third, exertional dyspnea is sensitive but nonspecific, and peripheral edema, pulmonary crackles, and rapid weight gain are supportive context that sharpen suspicion when combined but rarely decide the diagnosis alone [^114Wjz9q] [^114KKJug] [^115UV5nx].

> I should confirm how combinations of findings perform. The concurrent presence of right- and left-sided congestion signs, such as jugular venous distension plus lung crackles, identifies a high proportion of systolic heart failure in ambulatory cohorts and independently portends worse prognosis, which underscores why clustering of signs is more informative than any single sign in isolation [^111pswEr]. Signs of congestion include jugular venous distension, pulmonary rales (pulmonary pulmonary), and peripheral peripheral edema [^111pswEr].

> But wait, I need to integrate confirmatory testing pragmatically. Natriuretic peptides are recommended to support diagnosis or exclusion in dyspneic patients, with strong rule-out value in acute care meta-analyses, while chest radiography that demonstrates pulmonary venous congestion substantially increases the likelihood of heart failure, and echocardiography remains required to confirm structural and functional abnormalities; a careful history and physical still frame the evaluation and guide subsequent testing, and ECG findings such as atrial fibrillation further raise suspicion in context [^111VTuRa] [^1172JV3n] [^113sYqT2] [^112skMbR] [^1111n5NZ] [^114Wjz9q].

> In summary, I need to ensure my ranking remains reference-grounded and setting-aware. The most reliable bedside sign is the S3 gallop, the strongest historical factor is a prior diagnosis of heart failure, and the most specific symptoms are orthopnea and PND though their LRs vary widely by selection and setting; jugular venous distension, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral edema strengthen the case when they cluster, whereas exertional dyspnea and fatigue are sensitive but nonspecific, and none of these can replace natriuretic peptide testing and echocardiography for a definitive diagnosis; HFpEF particularly demands caution because classic signs can be subtle or absent at rest, sometimes requiring exercise hemodynamics to unmask disease when clinical suspicion remains high [^114Wjz9q] [^114KKJug] [^111VTuRa] [^112skMbR] [^114CbNvR] [^115UV5nx].

The most accurate signs and symptoms of heart failure are those with the **highest diagnostic likelihood ratios** and guideline support. The most accurate symptoms are **paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)** [^114Wjz9q] and **orthopnea** [^114KKJug], which strongly increase the probability of heart failure. The most accurate signs are **elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)**, **third heart sound (S3)** [^114Wjz9q], and **pulmonary rales** [^115Y881R], which are highly specific for heart failure. These findings are most reliable when combined with objective evidence such as elevated natriuretic peptides [^111VTuRa] and echocardiography [^112skMbR], as recommended by current guidelines [^1111n5NZ].

## Most accurate symptoms

| **Name** | **Definition** | **Diagnostic accuracy** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) | Sudden awakening from sleep due to shortness of breath, relieved by sitting or standing | Positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 2.6, indicating a moderate increase in the probability of heart failure [^114Wjz9q] | Highly specific for heart failure, particularly left-sided failure [^114KKJug] |
| Orthopnea | Shortness of breath when lying flat, relieved by sitting or standing | Positive LR of 2.2, indicating a moderate increase in the probability of heart failure [^114Wjz9q] | Strongly associated with heart failure, particularly left-sided failure [^114KKJug] |
| Exertional dyspnea and fatigue | Shortness of breath and fatigue during physical activity | Common but less specific than PND and orthopnea [^11568J43] | Frequently reported by patients with heart failure, but less specific than PND and orthopnea [^115Y881R] |

## Most accurate signs

| **Name** | **Definition** | **Diagnostic accuracy** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) | Visible distension of the jugular vein, indicating elevated central venous pressure | Highly specific for heart failure, particularly right-sided failure [^115Y881R] | Strongly associated with heart failure and indicates elevated filling pressures [^111pswEr] |
| Third heart sound (S3) | An extra heart sound heard during auscultation, indicating increased ventricular filling pressures | Positive LR of 11, indicating a strong association with heart failure [^114Wjz9q] | Highly specific for heart failure, particularly in acute settings |
| Pulmonary rales (crackles) | Crackling sounds heard during lung auscultation, indicating pulmonary congestion | Highly specific for heart failure, particularly left-sided failure [^116p3fuF] | Indicates pulmonary congestion and fluid overload [^112N9D9e] |
| Peripheral edema | Swelling of the lower extremities due to fluid retention | Commonly observed but less specific than elevated JVP and S3 [^115Y881R] | Indicates fluid overload and is commonly associated with right-sided heart failure [^1113ghMt] |

## Diagnostic accuracy of combined signs and symptoms

Combining multiple signs and symptoms significantly improves **diagnostic accuracy** [^1111n5NZ]. The presence of several signs of congestion (e.g. elevated JVP, pulmonary rales, peripheral edema) strongly supports a heart failure diagnosis [^111pswEr], whereas their absence makes it less likely [^11166BTv].

---

## Role of objective diagnostic tests

- **Natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP)**: Highly sensitive biomarkers [^111VTuRa] that support the diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure [^1172JV3n].
- **Echocardiography**: Essential for assessing cardiac structure and function, including ejection fraction and valvular abnormalities [^112skMbR] [^115Y881R].
- **Chest radiography**: Useful for detecting pulmonary congestion [^114Wjz9q] and cardiomegaly [^113sYqT2].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Non-specificity**: Many symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, fatigue) are non-specific [^11568J43] and can occur in other conditions [^112BKgdK].
- **Variability**: Clinical presentation varies widely among patients [^112BKgdK], making diagnosis challenging [^115t6bf6].
- **Subjectivity**: Patient-reported symptoms are subjective [^112BKgdK] and may be influenced by individual perception and comorbidities [^111XYnUq].

---

The **most accurate signs and symptoms** of heart failure include paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, and pulmonary rales. These findings are highly specific and strongly associated with heart failure, particularly when combined with objective diagnostic tests such as natriuretic peptides and echocardiography.

### The diagnosis of heart failure in primary care: value of symptoms and signs [^114KKJug]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

The value of symptoms and signs in the diagnosis of CHF has rarely been tested in large numbers of patients in the community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of symptoms, signs, and past medical history in the diagnosis of CHF in primary care.

- **Methods**: Data on a sample of Portuguese men and women attending 365 primary care centres for any condition other than the treatment of acute infection, metabolic conditions, or pregnancy were collected. All subjects who scored three or more points in the sum of categories one and two of the Boston questionnaire (history and physical examination) and those being treated for heart failure with loop or thiazide diuretics were considered to have possible heart failure and referred for further assessment including a resting echocardiogram. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio (LR) for the diagnosis of heart failure were calculated.

- **Results**: A total of 5434 subjects were identified, of whom 1058 fulfilled the criteria for further assessment. Among these, 551 subjects had cardiac dysfunction at rest, with 35.5% in NYHA class I and 4.9% in class IV. Prior use of digoxin (LR 24.9) and/or diuretics (LR 10.6), a history of coronary artery disease (LR 7.1), or of pulmonary oedema (LR 54.2) was associated with a greater likelihood of having heart failure. Among symptoms, a history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (LR 35.5), orthopnea (LR 39.1), and breathlessness when walking on the flat (LR 25.8) were associated with a diagnosis of heart failure.

### Does this dyspneic patient in the emergency department have congestive heart failure [^114Wjz9q]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

Dyspnea is a common complaint in the emergency department where physicians must accurately make a rapid diagnosis. This study aims to assess the usefulness of history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies — such as chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) — that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department.

Data was sourced from MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks. A total of 22 studies were retained concerning various findings for diagnosing heart failure in adult patients presenting with dyspnea to the emergency department.

Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality. The synthesis indicated that several features increased the probability of heart failure. Key features included:

- **Past history of heart failure**: Positive LR = 5.8 (95% CI, 4.1–8.0).
- **Symptom of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**: Positive LR = 2.6 (95% CI, 1.5–4.5).
- **Sign of the third heart sound (S3) gallop**: Positive LR = 11 (95% CI, 4.9–25.0).
- **Chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion**: Positive LR = 12.0 (95% CI, 6.8–21.0).
- **Electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation**: Positive LR = 3.8 (95% CI, 1.7–8.8).

The absence of a past history of heart failure significantly decreased the probability of heart failure.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for heart failure, specifically in relation to transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend considering obtaining repeat measurements of ejection fraction, the degree of structural remodeling, and valvular function. These assessments should inform therapeutic interventions in patients with heart failure who have experienced a significant clinical change, have received guideline-directed medical therapy, and are being considered for invasive procedures or device therapy.

### Loop diuretic therapy with or without heart failure: Impact on prognosis [^1131UPzJ]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is characterized by water and salt retention, leading to congestion of the systemic and pulmonary circulation and eventually to symptoms such as exertional breathlessness and signs such as peripheral oedema. Guidelines on HF strongly recommend loop diuretics for managing symptoms and signs of congestion, but loop diuretics can also be used for resistant hypertension or managing congestion due to end-stage kidney disease. For patients with HF, the development of congestion and the need for loop diuretics to manage it are associated with an adverse prognosis. However, many patients are prescribed loop diuretics but are not investigated to exclude cardiac dysfunction; if they relieve symptoms and signs, they may mask a diagnosis of HF.

To find out how many patients are prescribed loop diuretics, how often this is associated with a diagnosis of HF, and whether prescribing loop diuretics is associated with an adverse prognosis, electronic health records were obtained for patients in the Greater Glasgow & Clyde region who either had a diagnosis of coronary or peripheral arterial disease or HF or were prescribed loop diuretics or medicines commonly prescribed for hypertension or ventricular dysfunction.

### Does the physical examination still have a role in patients with suspected heart failure [^111pswEr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of signs of congestion in patients suspected of having chronic heart failure (CHF) is unknown. Our objectives were to define their prevalence and specificity in diagnosing CHF and to determine their prognostic value in patients in a community heart failure clinic.

- **Methods and results**: Analysis of referrals to a community clinic for patients with CHF symptoms. Systolic CHF (S-HF) was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45%, heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HeFNEF) as LVEF > 45%, and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide > 50 pmol L(-1); other subjects were defined as not having CHF. Signs of congestion were as follows: no signs; right heart congestion (RHC: oedema, jugular venous distension); left heart congestion (LHC: lung crackles); or both (R + LHC). Of 1881 patients referred, 707 did not have CHF, 853 had S-HF, and 321 had HeFNEF. The median inter-quartile range (IQR) age was 72 years (64–78), 40% were women, and LVEF was 47% (35–59). Overall, 417 patients had RHC, of whom 49% had S-HF and 21% HeFNEF. Eighty-five patients had LHC, of whom 43% had S-HF and 20% had HeFNEF. One hundred and seventy-two patients had R + LHC, of whom 71% had S-HF and 16% had HeFNEF. During a median (IQR) follow-up of 64 (44–76) months, 40% of the entire patient cohort died. The combination of R + LHC signs was an independent marker of an adverse prognosis (χ(2)-log-rank test = 186.1, P < 0.0001).

Clinical signs of congestion are independent predictors of prognosis in ambulatory patients with suspected CHF.

### Diflunisal [^114cv4Ls]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure, including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema, and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS).

Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms. If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical attention.

Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction, for example, difficulty breathing or swelling of the face or throat. If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).

Inform pregnant women to avoid the use of diflunisal tablets and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with diflunisal tablets is required for a pregnant woman between approximately 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios if treatment continues for more than 48 hours (see WARNINGS, Fetal Toxicity, and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile checked periodically.

### Exercise hemodynamics enhance diagnosis of early heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114CbNvR]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

When advanced, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is readily apparent. However, the diagnosis of earlier disease may be challenging because exertional dyspnea is not specific for heart failure, and biomarkers and hemodynamic indicators of volume overload may be absent at rest.

- **Methods and results**: Patients with exertional dyspnea and an ejection fraction > 50% were referred for hemodynamic catheterization. Those with no significant coronary disease, normal brain natriuretic peptide assay, and normal resting hemodynamics (mean pulmonary artery pressure < 25 mm Hg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP] < 15 mm Hg) (n = 55) underwent an exercise study. The exercise PCWP was used to classify patients as having HFpEF (PCWP ≥ 25 mm Hg) (n = 32) or noncardiac dyspnea (PCWP < 25 mm Hg) (n = 23). At rest, patients with HFpEF had higher resting pulmonary artery pressure and PCWP, although all values fell within normal limits. Exercise-induced elevation in PCWP in HFpEF was confirmed by greater increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and was associated with blunted increases in heart rate, systemic vasodilation, and cardiac output. Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension was present in 88% of patients with HFpEF and was related principally to elevated PCWP, as pulmonary vascular resistances dropped similarly in both groups. Exercise PCWP and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were highly correlated. An exercise pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥ 45 mm Hg identified HFpEF with 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity.

### Acute heart failure syndromes [^112pRCpt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heart failure resulting in hospitalization represents a significant and growing healthcare burden. Heterogeneity characterizes this group in terms of mode of presentation, pathophysiology, and prognosis. The vast majority of patients symptomatically improve during hospitalization; however, their early post-discharge rehospitalization and mortality rates continue to be high. Worsening signs and symptoms, neurohormonal, and renal abnormalities occurring soon after discharge may contribute to these high post-discharge event rates.

Currently available assessment modalities combined with recent advances in cardiovascular therapies provide present-day opportunities to improve post-discharge outcomes. Further investigation into pathophysiologic targets and novel approaches to clinical trial design are needed. Improving post-discharge outcomes is the single most important goal in the management of acute heart failure syndromes.

### Missed diagnosis of new-onset systolic heart failure at first presentation in children with no known heart disease [^111CWwWu]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the frequency of missed heart failure diagnosis at first presentation among children with no known heart disease admitted with new-onset heart failure.

- **Study design**: Using a retrospective design, we reviewed electronic medical records of all patients aged < 21 years with no known heart disease, hospitalized with new-onset heart failure during 2003–2015 at a tertiary-quaternary care institution. We assessed records for missed diagnosis of heart failure (primary outcome), associated process breakdowns, and clinical outcomes using a structured data collection instrument.

- **Results**: Of 191 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 49% (94/191) were missed on first presentation. The most common incorrect diagnostic labels given to "missed" patients were bacterial infection (29%; 27/94), followed by viral illness (22%; 21/94) and gastroenteritis/hepatitis (21%; 20/94). On multivariable analysis, presentation to the primary care provider (PCP), longer duration of symptoms (median 7 days), more than two symptoms of heart failure, and nausea/emesis were associated with missed diagnosis. On examining process breakdowns, 49% had errors in history-taking and 50% had no documentation of differential diagnoses. There was no difference in hospital mortality, length of stay, or mechanical circulatory support in missed vs. not-missed cohorts. Unnecessary noninvasive and invasive tests were performed in 18% and 4% of patients, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Nearly one-half of children with no known heart disease hospitalized with systolic heart failure were missed at first presentation.

### Prevalence, incidence and survival of heart failure: a systematic review [^111bnZRM]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

Our review was designed to address specific challenges in the reporting of heart failure burden for the general population. Epidemiological studies of heart failure vary in study design and clinical definition, complicating efforts to produce comparable estimates of disease burden. For example, definitions of heart failure are heterogeneous and include clinical criteria established before non-invasive imaging was widely available, such as the Framingham and the European Society of Cardiology criteria. Some population-based studies also identify heart failure by International Classification of Disease (ICD) or Read codes, which have been shown to vary in some populations from classic clinical criteria level, and reveal differences between estimates of heart failure prevalence or incidence when applying different clinical scores.

Beginning in 2015, the GBD study has performed an annual systematic review of the literature from 1990 onward to identify all primary data sources with population-representative estimates of the prevalence, incidence, or survival rates of heart failure. For this analysis, we searched PubMed using structured search criteria from 1990 to 2020. Additionally, we included papers sent to us via the network of over 3500 GBD study collaborators or identified in the citations of high-impact studies identified by expert reviewers.

To ensure comparability between data sources, the GBD study defines a gold-standard case definition for each of its 370 reported causes. The case definition for heart failure was that of a clinical diagnosis of heart.

### Congestion in acute heart failure syndromes: An essential target of evaluation and treatment [^112N9D9e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) typically present with signs and symptoms of systemic and pulmonary congestion at admission. However, elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures, known as hemodynamic congestion, may be present days or weeks before systemic and pulmonary congestion develop, resulting in hospital admission. This "hemodynamic congestion", with or without clinical congestion, may have deleterious effects, including subendocardial ischemia, alterations in LV geometry resulting in secondary mitral insufficiency, and impaired cardiac venous drainage from coronary veins, leading to diastolic dysfunction. It is possible that these hemodynamic abnormalities, in addition to neurohormonal activation, may contribute to LV remodeling and heart failure progression. Approximately 50% of patients admitted for AHFS are discharged with persistent symptoms and/or minimal or no weight loss, despite the fact that the main reason for admission was clinical congestion. Accordingly, the assessment and management of pulmonary and systemic congestion in these patients require reevaluation.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: But we can induce remission [^112KE5Ro]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In part, the lack of progress in acute heart failure (AHF) research over the past decades can be attributed to its subjective definition. Most authors define it as a sudden worsening of symptoms and signs of congestion associated with some cardiac abnormality requiring emergency treatment. Some add to the definition the need for admission, whereas others add requirements for intravenous therapy. However, compared with other acute cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, or pulmonary embolism — where electrocardiographic data, imaging data, and biomarkers can confirm or refute the diagnosis with high certainty — no such imaging or blood test exists for the diagnosis of AHF.

Although elevated natriuretic peptides are important in diagnosing AHF and a lack of increase can rule out AHF with high certainty, increased natriuretic peptides can also be caused by other disease states, most notably chronic stable heart failure (HF). Hence, natriuretic peptides by themselves are not specific for AHF. Chest X-ray signs of congestion, on the other hand, are highly specific but lack sensitivity. Therefore, despite years of research, no single biomarker or imaging technique has been found to be both specific and sensitive to the diagnosis of AHF. Its diagnosis remains subjective and is based mostly on symptoms, clinical assessments, and ruling out other reasons for acute congestion, such as acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, or infection.

### Quality of life in heart failure. The heart of the matter. A scientific statement of the Heart Failure Association and the European Association of Preventive Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology [^116QS15K]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). High credibility.

For most patients with chronic, progressive illnesses, maintaining good quality of life (QoL) with preserved functional capacity is just as crucial as prolonging survival. Patients with heart failure (HF) experience much worse QoL and effort intolerance than both the general population and people with other chronic conditions, since they present a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest discomfort, fatigue, fluid congestion, trouble with sleeping, and depression. These symptoms reduce patients' capacity for daily social and physical activity.

Usual endpoints of large‐scale trials in chronic HF have mostly been defined to evaluate treatments regarding hospitalizations and mortality, but more recently, patients' priorities and needs expressed with QoL are gaining more awareness and are being more extensively evaluated. This scientific statement aims at discussing the importance of QoL in HF, summarizing the most largely adopted questionnaires in HF care, and providing an overview on their application in trials and the potential for their transition to clinical practice. Finally, by discussing the reasons limiting their application in daily clinical routine and the strategies that may promote their implementation, this statement aims at fostering the systematic integration of the patient's standpoint in HF care.

Regarding specific circumstances for heart failure, more specifically with respect to patients with cancer therapy-related heart failure, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend considering the serial measurement of cardiac troponin for further risk stratification in patients being considered for potentially cardiotoxic therapies.

### Epidemiology of heart failure [^112ZuxLg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a contemporary overview of the epidemiology of heart failure for the practicing physician, covering prevalence and incidence, etiology, and prognosis.

The heterogeneity of the heart failure syndrome is reflected in the existing variety of definitions and categorizations, leading to large variance in reported estimates of occurrence, hospitalizations, and mortality rates of heart failure. This paper is not intended to be a comprehensive presentation of all epidemiological reports, but rather a clinical summary of the evolving heart failure epidemic and a guide in understanding the differences across studies.

### Approach to acute heart failure in the emergency department [^114q5Arz]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) patients rarely present complaining of 'acute heart failure'. Instead, they initially present to the emergency department (ED) with a myriad of chief complaints, symptoms, and physical exam findings. Such heterogeneity prompts an initially broad differential diagnosis; securing the correct diagnosis can be challenging. Although AHF may be the ultimate diagnosis, the precipitant of decompensation must also be sought and addressed.

For those AHF patients who present in respiratory or circulatory failure requiring immediate stabilization, treatment begins even while the diagnosis is uncertain.

- **Diagnostic workup**: The initial diagnostic workup consists of a thorough history and exam (with a particular focus on the cause of decompensation), an EKG, chest X-ray, laboratory testing, and point-of-care ultrasonography performed by a qualified clinician or technologist.

- **Guiding initial treatment**: We recommend initial treatment be guided by presenting phenotype. Hypertensive patients, particularly those in severe distress and with markedly elevated blood pressure, should be treated aggressively with vasodilators, most commonly nitroglycerin. Normotensive patients generally require significant diuresis with intravenous loop diuretics. A small minority of patients present with hypotension or circulatory collapse. These patients are the most difficult to manage and require careful assessment of intra- and extra-vascular volume status.

After stabilization, diagnosis, and management, most ED patients with AHF in the United States (US) are admitted. While this is understandable, it may be unnecessary. Ongoing research…

### Relationships between clinical assessments and patients' perceptions of the effects of heart failure on their quality of life [^111XYnUq]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Hypothetically, most of the effects of heart failure on quality of life might be attributed to symptoms produced by the pathology. Relationships between measures of these concepts need to be quantified to test this conceptual model.

- **Methods and results**: Measurements of heart failure pathology, symptoms, and quality of life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) questionnaire at the 4-month visit in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial were analyzed. Correlation and regression analyses corrected for estimated reliability of measurements were used to quantify relationships. The percentage of variance in dependent variables that was related to explanatory variables was summarized by the coefficient of determination (100 x R²) from regression models. Dyspnea at rest, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, and New York Heart Association class were significantly related to MLHF scores.

Combined, these symptoms explained 41% of the variation in MLHF scores. Controlling for symptoms, age explained an additional 4.5% of the variation in MLHF scores, whereas race, gender, and available comorbidities each explained less than 1%. Pathologic measures including ejection fraction, B-type natriuretic peptide, jugular venous distension, rales, peripheral edema, systolic blood pressure, creatinine, and hemoglobin were not strongly related to symptom assessments (combined R² = 17%) or MLHF scores (combined R² = 7%).

- **Conclusion**: Symptoms of heart failure explain a substantial proportion of the variation in the effects of heart failure.

### Heart failure diagnosis in the general community - who, how and when? A clinical consensus statement of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^115t6bf6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Low credibility.

A significant proportion of patients experience delays in the diagnosis of heart failure due to the non-specific signs and symptoms of the syndrome. Diagnostic tools such as the measurement of natriuretic peptide concentrations are fundamentally important when screening for heart failure, yet are frequently under-utilized. This clinical consensus statement provides a diagnostic framework for general practitioners and non-cardiology community-based physicians to recognize, investigate, and risk-stratify patients presenting in the community with possible heart failure.

### Prevalence, incidence and survival of heart failure: A systematic review [^115QSzcx]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

Our prospective systematic review identified 125 studies reporting the prevalence, incidence, or mortality of heart failure, synthesizing the landscape of epidemiological research on this condition. Data reported in these studies will inform the GBD 2020 study, help elucidate the global epidemiology of heart failure, and guide resources, research, and interventions.

These studies describe a prevalence and incidence of heart failure that varies widely across locations. Much of the observed variation may reflect true changes in the age-specific burden of heart failure within specific populations. Our results suggest that differences in study design and case ascertainment strategy may also contribute to the observed heterogeneity. Heart failure remains a condition frequently identified when patients develop acute symptoms and, at times, are clinically unstable.

Especially relevant are differences in diagnostic criteria, whose sensitivity and specificities reflect clinical judgement across diverse and complex settings such as emergency departments and primary care offices. While some studies apply research-grade enrollment protocols in these settings or even extend surveillance to households, many remain simple counts of acute decompensation of heart failure. As technologies for the non-invasive evaluation of heart failure improve, there is a need to shift studies of heart failure epidemiology from case identification based on physical examination and cardiac auscultation to a standardized application of rapid, inexpensive, and robust laboratory and echocardiographic criteria.

### Clinical presentation, hospital length of stay, and readmission rate in patients with heart failure with preserved and decreased left ventricular systolic function [^1149uxA9]. Clinical Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admissions for adults in the United States. To our knowledge, there are limited data comparing the clinical presentation, hospital length of stay, and readmission in patients with preserved and decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic function.

- **Hypothesis**: The goal of the study was to determine whether there are differences in clinical presentation, hospital length of stay, and readmission in patients with preserved (≥ 50%) and reduced (< 50%) LV systolic function.

- **Study results**: Patients with EF < 50% were more likely to be men (54% vs. 37%, p = 0.03). They were also more likely to be African Americans (79% vs. 60%, p = 0.007), had a higher prevalence of previous stroke (17% vs. 5%, p = 0.03), were more likely to carry no medical insurance at the time of admission (14% vs. 2%, p = 0.01), and were discharged on digoxin (60% vs. 30%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, rest dyspnea, or orthopnea.

### First symptoms and health care pathways in hospitalized patients with acute heart failure: ICPS2 survey. A report from the heart failure working group (GICC) of the French society of cardiology [^111bp7WK]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Appendix S1 provides detailed information about patient referral to the hospital, according to the type of symptom and time of appearance. The emergency medical assistance service (SAMU) was the most common type of referral, accounting for 41.6%. Only 19.5% of the patients were referred by their cardiologist. SAMU-referred patients were older and more likely to suffer from acute coronary symptoms and chest pain, as well as dyspnea. Patients referred by a general physician (GP) or a cardiologist were more likely to suffer from lower limb edema. Other symptoms, particularly recent weight gain, were less frequently reported by patients. Most patients referred by their GP or cardiologist had symptoms for over 15 days, including 76.8% of those referred by a cardiologist. Very few patients had consulted a cardiologist within 48 hours prior to hospitalization.

- **Hospital admission by type of referral**: Patients were admitted to the hospital by different pathways, according to the type of referral and patient characteristics. The non-intensive care unit (ICU) was the most common way of recruitment, including 76.2% of admissions from the ER department (48.0%), traditional cardiology units (19.6%), and consulting as out-patients (8.6%). Only 23.8% were recruited from the ICU. Most SAMU-referred patients were admitted to the ER or ICU. Patients referred by their GP or attending the hospital on their own most often attended the ER. The majority of cardiologist-referred patients (59.1%) were directly admitted to a non-intensive care unit and bypassed the ER.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to acute decompensated heart failure [^115r4ugS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Heart failure afflicts a large number of patients and is the leading cause of hospitalizations in the United States. The diagnosis and management of decompensated heart failure present a clinical challenge, requiring complex decision-making. History and physical examination findings are important in diagnosing heart failure. Diagnostically, B-type natriuretic peptide levels appear very useful to separate cardiac from noncardiac causes of dyspnea and provide information about heart failure severity and prognosis. Immediate management goals include improvement of symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. Diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents are useful in the acute setting. This article provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and managing acute decompensated heart failure.

### Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^113om4Lc]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

Heart failure is not a diagnosis but a syndrome with a variety of potential causes. Symptoms generally relate to reduced cardiac output, and signs typically to elevated filling pressures, as outlined in Table 1. Unfortunately, the non-specific nature of symptoms means that identification of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is often made at a later stage when the patient is admitted to the hospital acutely. This often represents the end of a long process of chronic pressure or volume overload of the left ventricle, with subacute decompensation on a background of chronic myocardial disease.

Acute, de novo heart failure — triggered by acute ischaemia, myocarditis, toxin, or arrhythmia — is an alternative presentation, and a careful history often identifies the clinical problem. Where heart failure is suspected, serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or its N-terminal component (NT-proBNP) should be measured and is highly sensitive but poorly specific for heart failure. It is used as a gatekeeper for echocardiography, and individuals with a normal BNP can be investigated for other causes of symptoms. BNP is released from the myocardium in response to stretching forces related to elevated filling pressures, and it promotes natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilatation, and suppresses the sympathetic nervous axis, restoring normal loading conditions. However, levels are chronically elevated in cases of heart failure, and higher concentrations are associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended a rapid access pathway based on BNP measurements.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^115MaDXF]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of heart failure (HF) primarily relies on signs and symptoms that are neither sensitive nor specific, impeding timely diagnosis and delaying effective therapies or interventions, despite the availability of several evidence-based treatments for HF. Through monumental collaborative efforts from representatives of HF societies worldwide, the universal definition of HF was published in 2021 to provide the necessary standardized framework required for clinical management, clinical trials, and research. This review elaborates on the key concepts of the new universal definition of HF, highlighting the key merits and potential avenues that can be further nuanced in future iterations. We also discuss the key implications of the universal definition document from the perspectives of various stakeholders within the healthcare framework, including patients, care providers, systems/payers, and policymakers.

### Diagnosis and assessment of the heart failure patient: the cornerstone of effective management [^114WcJbP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a syndrome describing a pathophysiological state with diverse etiologies. Providing an adequate mechanistic definition is difficult. The guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology define the diagnosis of heart failure based on three criteria: patients should have symptoms compatible with heart failure at rest or during exercise; there should be objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest; and in doubtful cases, there should be a favourable response following therapy for heart failure.

The term diagnosis derives from the Greek words "dia" and "nosi", meaning "through knowledge", and it implies that a conclusion is drawn describing the patient's status based on the available information. This information is commonly based on symptoms, patient history, findings from physical examination, results from laboratory tests, and the results from various non-invasive and invasive special examinations.

Diagnostic precision is crucial in deciding treatment strategy, and this task presents a continuous academic and clinical challenge. Ultimately, the clinical diagnosis of heart failure is based on all the information available to the physicians. No single investigation is specific for this clinical syndrome, and management strategies attempt to modify the underlying mechanisms to alleviate symptoms and improve survival.

### Decompensated heart failure: Symptoms, patterns of onset, and contributing factors [^1113ghMt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the time course, contributing factors, and patient responses to decompensated heart failure.

- **Methods**: We studied consecutive patients admitted to a public general hospital with a diagnosis of heart failure. Using a timeline follow-back technique, a nurse interviewer administered a questionnaire shortly after admission. This explored the patient's knowledge of their heart failure diagnosis, the symptoms and time course of decompensation, and their responses to worsening symptoms.

- **Results**: Of 87 patients, 83 (95%) consented to be interviewed, with only 49 (59%) aware of their heart failure diagnosis. Symptoms associated with decompensation included dyspnea in 81 patients (98%), edema in 64 patients (77%), and weight gain in 34 patients (41%). The onset of symptom worsening was noted, on average (± SD), 12.4 ± 1.4 days before admission for edema, 11.3 ± 1.6 days for weight gain, and 8.4 ± 0.9 days for dyspnea. Forty-two patients (57%) reported missing or skipping medication due to various factors, particularly missed outpatient appointments.

- **Conclusion**: Using a timeline follow-back interview, we identified a period of days to weeks between the onset of worsening symptoms and hospital admission for heart failure decompensation. This pattern suggests a time window between symptom exacerbation and admission during which earlier access and intervention might prevent hospitalization. Medication lapses remain an important preventable cause of decompensation leading to admission.

### Epidemiology of heart failure [^113wmAQE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis based on echocardiographic screening studies in the general population — thus also counting previously unrecognized cases — showed that the prevalence of 'all type' heart failure in developed countries is around 11.8% in those aged 65 years and over. This would account for a calculated prevalence in the general population of 4.2%, which is around twice as high as some of the reported prevalence based on registries containing only established cases. Given that by convention a sample of people from the general population must be included in the denominator, the prevalence rate of 4.2% is a more realistic estimate.

The difference between the 4.2% and 2% prevalence rates illustrates that even a prognostically severe syndrome like heart failure may remain undetected in over half of the cases. Especially, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is easily missed: up to 76% of the unrecognized cases of heart failure are patients with a preserved ejection fraction. Reasons for not recognizing heart failure are multiple and include misclassification as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, deconditioning, aging, or obesity due to a similarity in symptoms, and the unavailability of echocardiography in primary care.

The absolute number of patients living with heart failure has been increasing as a result of the aging population, global population growth, and improved survival after diagnosis. Part of this increase is 'artificial' and caused by recognizing HFpEF as an important heart failure subtype.

### Artificial intelligence in diagnosis of heart failure [^112Yop6X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a complex and varied condition that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Although significant strides have been made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of HF, several challenges persist, particularly in the accurate diagnosis of HF. These challenges include issues related to its classification, the identification of specific phenotypes, and the assessment of disease severity. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to transform HF care by enhancing clinical decision-making processes, enabling the early detection of patients at risk for subclinical or worsening HF. By integrating and analyzing vast amounts of data with intricate multidimensional interactions, AI algorithms can provide critical insights that help physicians make more timely and informed decisions.

- **Challenges in diagnosis of HF**: The complexity of HF makes its diagnosis particularly challenging, with factors such as classification, phenotype identification, and disease severity assessment requiring improvement.

- **Basic AI concepts and common AI algorithms**: Understanding the foundational principles and typical algorithms of AI is essential for its application in HF diagnosis.

- **Latest AI research in HF diagnosis**: Recent advances in AI research are exploring its application in improving the diagnosis of HF, offering new possibilities for enhancing patient care.

### Diastolic heart failure: Challenges of diagnosis and treatment [^117NepWm]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Diastolic heart failure, a major cause of morbidity and mortality, is defined as symptoms of heart failure in a patient with preserved left ventricular function. It is characterized by a stiff left ventricle with decreased compliance and impaired relaxation, which leads to increased end-diastolic pressure. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of heart failure with systolic dysfunction. The diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is best made with Doppler echocardiography.

Based on current knowledge, pharmacologic treatment of diastolic heart failure should focus on normalizing blood pressure, promoting regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, avoiding tachycardia, treating symptoms of congestion, and maintaining normal atrial contraction when possible. Diuretic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for preventing pulmonary congestion, while beta blockers appear to be useful in preventing tachycardia and thereby prolonging left ventricular diastolic filling time. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers may be beneficial in patients with diastolic dysfunction, especially those with hypertension.

Evidence from adequately powered randomized controlled trials, however, is not available yet. The outcomes of ongoing clinical trials may provide much-needed information to move from intuitive treatment to therapy based on evidence that matters: decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of heart failure [^115Y881R]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of volume overload, which may include peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. Heart failure has high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in older persons. Many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, can cause or lead to decompensation of chronic heart failure. Up to 40 to 50 percent of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular function, and the overall mortality is similar to that of systolic heart failure.

The initial evaluation includes a history and physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory assessment to identify causes or precipitating factors. A displaced cardiac apex, a third heart sound, and chest radiography findings of venous congestion or interstitial edema are useful in identifying heart failure. Systolic heart failure is unlikely when the Framingham criteria are not met or when B-type natriuretic peptide level is normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic or diastolic heart failure through assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Evaluation for ischemic heart disease is warranted in patients with heart failure, especially if angina is present, given that coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure.

### Heart failure in type 2 diabetes: current perspectives on screening, diagnosis and management [^11568J43]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Low credibility.

Several clinical symptoms and signs, which are listed in Table 2, are similar for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and need to be assessed at every visit. Both symptoms and signs can be used for monitoring treatment response and its stability over time. However, there are difficulties in accurately diagnosing heart failure solely based on symptoms and signs, as these are often non-specific, especially during the early stages of the disease. They may also be masked by other conditions, particularly in elderly individuals with multiple comorbid conditions.

Moreover, while some signs specifically indicate heart failure, they can be hard to detect in clinical practice and are poorly reproducible. Generally, diagnosing HFpEF is more challenging than HFrEF due to the absence of a dilated left ventricle (LV) in HFpEF patients, who instead have increased LV wall thickness and/or an increased left atrial size as a sign of enhanced filling pressure.

### The worst symptom as defined by patients during heart failure hospitalization: Implications for response to therapy [^116MZoYb]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Patients perceive different symptoms of heart failure decompensation, but it is not known whether the nature of the worst symptom relates to hemodynamic profile, response to therapy, or improvement in clinical trials.

- **Methods and results**: Patients in the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness trial were hospitalized with advanced heart failure, ejection fraction ≤ 30%, and at least one sign and one symptom of elevated filling pressures. Visual analog scales (VAS) for symptoms were completed by 371 patients, who selected their worst symptom as difficulty breathing, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, or body swelling. They also scored breathing and global condition at baseline and discharge. The dominant symptom identified was difficulty breathing by 193 (52%) patients, fatigue by 118 (32%), and abdominal discomfort and swelling each by 30 (8%) patients, combined as right-sided congestion for analysis. Clinical and hemodynamic assessments were not different between groups, except that right-sided congestion was associated with more hepatomegaly, ascites, third heart sounds, and jugular venous distention. This group also had greater reduction in jugular venous distention and a trend toward higher blood urea nitrogen after therapy. By discharge, average improvements in the worst symptom and global score were 28 points and 24 points, respectively. For those with ≥ 10 points improvement in the worst symptom, 84% also improved global assessment by ≥ 10 points. Initial fatigue was associated with less improvement (P = 0.002) during and after hospitalization.

### Epidemiology of heart failure [^1172Y6LE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The prognosis of heart failure has improved significantly since clinical trials conducted 30 years ago demonstrated that the grim outcomes for heart failure patients could be markedly altered. However, prognosis remains poor, and the quality of life is severely diminished. In age- and risk factor-adjusted models, incident heart failure is associated with a fivefold increased risk of death. Despite this, translating the natural history of heart failure as a disease into precise prognosis for the individual remains difficult. Physicians are understandably reluctant to provide explicit quantitative information on prognosis to patients. Many prognostic markers of death and hospitalization have been identified; however, the clinical value of prognostic models is limited, and individual risk stratification remains challenging.

- **Mortality of heart failure**: Estimates of heart failure mortality vary considerably depending on study design, baseline risk of the population, heart failure criteria, LVEF cut-off values, and the potential introduction of bias through the exclusion of patients with missing LVEF values. The high mortality rates in observational studies contrast with those in clinical trials, which generally include 'stable' outpatients who are younger and with fewer comorbidities, thus yielding a lower mortality rate.

A recent meta-analysis including over 1.5 million patients with all types of heart failure estimated the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates to be 87%, 73%, 57%, and 35%, respectively. Mortality was observed to be lowest in studies…

### Prognostic importance of presenting symptoms in patients undergoing exercise testing for evaluation of known or suspected coronary disease [^115jNwhE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Chest symptoms, along with standard cardiovascular risk factors, are commonly factored into pre-test risk stratification of patients who are referred for stress testing. We sought to determine the independent prognostic value of chest symptoms.

- **Methods**: We studied the outcomes of 10,870 patients referred for symptom-limited exercise testing who had no history of myocardial revascularization, heart failure, or arrhythmias. Chest symptoms were prospectively characterized according to prespecified definitions. Propensity analysis was used to account for differences in baseline and exercise characteristics.

- **Results**: Typical angina was present in 635 patients (6%), atypical angina in 3408 (33%), nonanginal chest pain in 1805 (17%), and dyspnea in 841 (8%). The remaining 4181 patients (38%) were asymptomatic. During a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, there were 381 deaths. After propensity matching patients who had typical angina with asymptomatic patients, symptoms were not predictive of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6 to 1.3; P = 0.4). Among patients who had chest pain, typical angina was associated with a highly significant risk of mortality compared with nonanginal chest pain (HR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.4 to 5.1; P = 0.002), but not compared with atypical angina (HR = 1.3; 95% CI: 0.9 to 2.1; P = 0.21).

- **Conclusion**: After accounting for baseline and exercise characteristics, the presence of symptoms was not independently associated with increased mortality among patients undergoing testing for known or suspected coronary disease.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to acute decompensated heart failure [^1164djbD]. Circulation Research (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of symptoms and signs of congestion and poor organ perfusion due to heart failure (HF) requiring urgent, usually intravenous, therapy has been variously called acute heart failure (AHF), acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), AHF syndrome, and hospitalized HF, as well as other terms. For the purposes of this review, ADHF will be used, recognizing that most patients have a subacute evolution of their symptoms and signs resulting from cardiac and vascular dysfunction due to a variety of etiologies and triggers resulting in decompensated hemodynamics. There are a number of classifications for HF, including by ejection fraction (EF; HF with reduced [HFrEF] or preserved EF [HFpEF]) and predominant left versus right ventricular dysfunction.

The subacute or acute dysfunction in ADHF overwhelms compensatory mechanisms, resulting in signs and symptoms of left or right (and often both) ventricular increased filling pressures leading to symptoms including dyspnea, exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, peripheral edema, abdominal bloating, early satiety, and fatigue. Pulmonary vascular congestion from left ventricular failure increases right ventricular pressures and results in a cascading effect on multiorgan function. While the most common cause of right HF is left HF, isolated right HF is becoming increasingly recognized and can also result in increased peripheral signs of congestion and end-organ dysfunction. Since many of these patients with right HF have severe pulmonary disease as the cause of their HF, they can present with significant dyspnea independent of pulmonary congestion.

### Investigating pain in heart failure patients: Rationale and design of the Pain Assessment, Incidence & Nature in Heart Failure (PAIN-HF) study [^111TVsRY]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is increasing in prevalence. Treatments for heart failure permit a growing number of persons to live with the illness for many years. The burden of symptoms in persons with advanced heart failure is high. Fatigue, limited exertion, dyspnea, and depression are commonly associated with heart failure, but pain is common as well.

- **Methods and results**: Although it is known that underlying comorbidities modify the response to and experience of pain, the interaction between pain and the clinical syndrome of heart failure has not been studied at the time of writing. The Pain Assessment, Incidence & Nature in Heart Failure (PAIN-HF) study will evaluate pain in patients with advanced heart failure. Specifically, PAIN-HF will examine the anatomical location of pain, prevalence of pain, its association with aspects of patients' heart failure and comorbid conditions, and its relation to interventions and medications to treat pain.

- **Conclusions**: This study to identify the nature, incidence, and character of pain is an important step in relieving distress and discomfort in persons with heart failure.

Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms. If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical attention.

Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction, including difficulty breathing and swelling of the face or throat. If these symptoms occur, patients should seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS). In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided because it can cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

- **Laboratory tests**: Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash), or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.

- **Drug interactions**: Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac tromethamine induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes.

### Non-symptom-related factors contributing to delay in seeking medical care by patients with heart failure: A narrative review [^115RbhFb]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Delay in seeking timely medical care by patients with acute coronary syndrome and stroke has been well established in the literature, but less is known about delay in care-seeking behavior by patients with heart failure (HF). The purpose of this narrative review was to synthesize the literature regarding non-symptom-related factors that contribute to delay in seeking medical care for HF symptoms.

- **Methods and results**: A literature search of Scopus, Medline, and PubMed was conducted for published articles from database inception to July 2009. Available evidence has shown that non-symptom-related factors, such as HF severity, HF history, age, and ethnocultural background, were related to delay in certain studies; however, null results have also been reported. Other non-symptom-related factors, such as male gender, initial contact with a primary care physician, arriving in the emergency department by means other than ambulance, and patient responses such as self-care, low anxiety, and hopelessness, may play a role in longer delay.

- **Conclusions**: Although this review identified several non-symptom-related factors that may be implicated in care-seeking delay, health care professionals should be vigilant in identifying all high-risk individuals and educating them about warning signs of HF. Moreover, access to outpatient chronic disease management programs that may have the potential to reduce care-seeking delay behavior should be explored.

### Epidemiology of heart failure [^111EX8cm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Because heart failure can be viewed as the chronic stage of any disease leading to cardiac functional impairment, assigning a specific cause to heart failure in an individual is challenging. Multiple causes often co-exist, and most comorbid conditions do not occur independently of heart failure. Instead, they share a set of risk factors, play a role in syndrome pathogenesis, or function as a perpetuating factor.

The majority of patients with heart failure exhibit multi-morbidity. The number of patients with three or more chronic comorbidities increased from 68% in 2002 to 87% in 2014. Comorbidity is associated with increased severity of heart failure symptoms and corresponds to a poor quality of life and a worse prognosis.

### Heart failure in primary care: Qualitative study of current management and perceived obstacles to evidence-based diagnosis and management by general practitioners [^115GUYtp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure is a common clinical condition with high morbidity and mortality. Despite the evidence that appropriate treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can improve morbidity, primary care studies show that patients with heart failure are incorrectly diagnosed and inadequately treated.

- **Aim**: To explore general practitioners' accounts of their management of patients with heart failure and identify the perceived obstacles to diagnosis and management.

- **Methods**: We conducted this qualitative study using semi-structured interviews in 18 general practices. The practices were stratified based on size, location, and the level of practice development. The interviews were based on a schedule of open questions from the literature concerning the diagnosis and management of patients with heart failure. Transcriptions of the audiotaped interviews were independently analyzed by two researchers using open coding and a constant comparative approach. Categories were reduced to major themes.

- **Results**: General practitioners suspect heart failure when patients present with breathlessness or ankle oedema. Many reported diagnosing heart failure after respiratory examination and a positive finding of basal crepitations. Many general practitioners arrange a chest X-ray to establish the diagnosis, while some arrange an electrocardiogram. A few general practitioners mentioned diagnosing heart failure with a trial of diuretics. Obstacles to diagnosis were mentioned by most general practitioners.

### Oseni [^114s1CJT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of various conditions related to Oseni use:

- **Congestive heart failure**: Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Instruct patients who experience an unusually rapid increase in weight, edema, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of heart failure while on Oseni to immediately report these symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Pancreatitis**: Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during the use of Oseni. Educate patients that persistent, severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, may or may not be accompanied by vomiting and is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue Oseni and contact their healthcare provider if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Inform patients that allergic reactions have been reported during the use of Oseni. Instruct patients that if symptoms of allergic reactions occur, including skin rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing, they should discontinue Oseni and seek medical advice promptly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Hepatic effects**: Instruct patients to promptly stop taking Oseni and seek immediate medical advice if they experience signs or symptoms of liver injury, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or dark urine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Edema**: Inform patients that Oseni use can lead to new-onset or worsening of edema. Instruct patients to immediately report any related symptoms.

### 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1111n5NZ]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for heart failure, more specifically with respect to clinical evaluation, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend eliciting a thorough history and performing a physical examination in patients presenting with heart failure to:

- **Direct diagnostic strategies**: Uncover specific causes likely to warrant disease-specific management.

- **Identify contributing factors**: Recognize cardiac and noncardiac disorders, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and social determinants of health likely to cause or accelerate the development or progression of heart failure.

### The diagnostic accuracy of the natriuretic peptides in heart failure: Systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis in the acute care setting [^1172JV3n]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of heart failure is often challenging; the symptoms and signs may be non-specific and could occur in other non-cardiac diseases. The mortality from acute heart failure remains high, at approximately 25% over one year, and this may be reduced by prompt diagnosis and treatment. The early use of a natriuretic peptide test to rule out acute heart failure, at the diagnostic thresholds evaluated in this meta-analysis, can reliably exclude heart failure and allow more rapid investigation of other potential causes for a patient's symptoms. A negative test result may reduce or obviate the need to proceed to echocardiography or other cardiac imaging, allowing more efficient use of resources.

In cases where clinical assessment is difficult, the ability to rapidly raise the suspicion of acute heart failure when the result for natriuretic peptide is above the cut-off will allow targeted, rapid investigation to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Earlier confirmation of the diagnosis of heart failure may facilitate more rapid initiation of specific treatment, potentially shortening hospital stay and reducing mortality.

When B-type natriuretic peptide was compared with NT-proBNP, there was no statistically significant difference in their diagnostic ability at the rule-out thresholds examined. When converted to absolute patient numbers, the use of B-type natriuretic peptide rather than NT-proBNP in an acute care setting potentially increased the false negative test results by between 8 and 31 more people per 1000 people (assuming a prevalence ranging from…).

### Dyspnoea versus fatigue: additional prognostic information from symptoms in chronic heart failure [^114DJ6NC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2008). Low credibility.

In non-heart failure populations, dyspnoea reported by the patient as the reason for stopping an exercise test is associated with a worse prognosis than fatigue. Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have exercise limitation due to breathlessness or fatigue, but it is unclear whether one symptom confers an adverse prognosis over the other.

- **Methods**: Consecutive CHF patients underwent exercise testing with metabolic gas exchange. Upon stopping exercise, the dominant symptom reported by the patients was recorded. Survival analyses were performed to establish predictors of mortality and relationships between symptoms and objective measures of exercise capacity.

- **Results**: Data were analysed on 271 patients (219 men), with a mean age of 67 (10) years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 32 (8)%, and a median follow-up of 59 months (interquartile range 38). There were no differences in exercise variables, sex, NYHA class, body mass index, and medical therapy between fatigued and dyspnoeic patients. At the censor date, 92 (34%) patients had died. Deceased patients had a lower peak oxygen consumption (17.2 (4.6) versus 20.3 (5.6); p = 0.0028). Although NYHA class was related to death at 36 months (chi2 value = 7.3, p = 0.026), reason for stopping was not (chi2 value = 0.57, p = 0.45).

- **Conclusion**: Unlike in non-heart failure populations, dyspnoea as the reason for stopping an exercise test in CHF subjects is not associated with increased mortality. CHF patients should be assessed for treatments such as cardiac resynchronisation therapy by the degree of exercise intolerance, not the nature of the symptoms.

### Congestive heart failure: Diagnosis, pathophysiology, therapy, and implications for respiratory care [^116p3fuF]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical disorder that results in pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced cardiac output. CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history and physical examination and characteristic chest radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography have substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis.

Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.

### Effects of tolvaptan on physician-assessed symptoms and signs in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure syndromes: analysis from the efficacy of vasopressin antagonism in heart failure outcome study with tolvaptan (EVEREST) trials [^1127gxxH]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A rapid and sustained relief of heart failure (HF) symptoms and signs is an important goal of management in patients hospitalized for acute HF syndromes (AHFS). At the time of writing, no novel therapy in AHFS had been shown to improve signs and symptoms throughout hospitalization. This study explores the clinical effects of tolvaptan, a vasopressin-2-receptor antagonist, in addition to standard medical therapies on physician-assessed signs and symptoms in hospitalized AHFS patients.

- **Methods**: The EVEREST trial randomized 4,133 patients admitted with worsening HF and reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%) within 48 hours after hospital admission. On each inpatient day, investigators assessed dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, jugular venous distension (JVD), rales, and pedal edema by predefined ordinal scales. Responder analyses were performed for each sign and symptom, with significant clinical response defined as a change in one point on the measurement scale.

- **Results**: Post hoc analysis demonstrated a greater likelihood of clinical improvement in physician-assessed dyspnea, edema, orthopnea, and JVD among tolvaptan-treated subjects (P < .05) as early as inpatient day 1. This difference was observed throughout hospitalization only for JVD and orthopnea through day 3.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of tolvaptan to standard therapy for AHFS improves physician-assessed signs and symptoms during hospitalization without serious adverse short- or long-term effects.

### Artificial intelligence in diagnosis of heart failure [^115se3e6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a complex and varied condition that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Although there have been significant strides in understanding the underlying mechanisms of HF, several challenges persist, particularly in the accurate diagnosis of HF. These challenges include issues related to its classification, the identification of specific phenotypes, and the assessment of disease severity.

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to transform HF care by enhancing clinical decision-making processes and enabling the early detection of patients at risk for subclinical or worsening HF. By integrating and analyzing vast amounts of data with intricate multidimensional interactions, AI algorithms can provide critical insights that help physicians make more timely and informed decisions.

In this review, we explore the challenges in diagnosis of HF, basic AI concepts, common AI algorithms, and the latest AI research in HF diagnosis.

### Acute coronary syndromes and acute heart failure: A diagnostic dilemma and high-risk combination. A statement from the Acute Heart Failure Committee of the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology [^117LKkra]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome is a precipitant of acute heart failure in a substantial proportion of cases, and the presence of both conditions is associated with a higher risk of short-term mortality compared to acute coronary syndrome alone. The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in the setting of acute heart failure can be challenging. Patients may present with atypical or absent chest pain, electrocardiograms can be confounded by pre-existing abnormalities, and cardiac biomarkers are frequently elevated in patients with chronic or acute heart failure, independently of acute coronary syndrome.

It is important to distinguish transient or limited myocardial injury from primary myocardial infarction due to vascular events in patients presenting with acute heart failure. This paper outlines various clinical scenarios to help differentiate between these conditions and aims to provide clinicians with tools to aid in the recognition of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of acute heart failure. Interpretation of electrocardiogram and biomarker findings, and imaging techniques that may be helpful in the diagnostic work-up are described.

Guidelines recommend an immediate invasive strategy for patients with acute heart failure and acute coronary syndrome, regardless of electrocardiographic or biomarker findings. Pharmacological management of patients with acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure should follow guidelines for each of these syndromes, with priority given to time-sensitive therapies for both.

### A review of dyspnea in acute heart failure syndromes [^116exsoz]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In acute heart failure syndrome (AHFS), dyspnea is one of the most common yet least understood presenting symptoms for hospitalization. As a result, relief of dyspnea is increasingly becoming a focus in the development of therapies for AHFS treatment and currently stands as an acceptable primary endpoint for regulatory approval by governmental agencies. This review raises the question of how best to measure such a subjective symptom. We will describe the basis for dyspnea, provide a detailed description of the strengths and weaknesses of the best tools used to measure it, and outline future directions for the development of dyspnea measurement in AHFS.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^112BKgdK]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of heart failure (HF) primarily relies on signs and symptoms that are neither sensitive nor specific, which impedes timely diagnosis and delays effective therapies or interventions, despite the availability of several evidence-based treatments for HF. Through monumental collaborative efforts from representatives of HF societies worldwide, the universal definition of HF was published in 2021, providing the necessary standardized framework required for clinical management, clinical trials, and research. This review elaborates the key concepts of the new universal definition of HF, highlighting the key merits and potential avenues, which can be nuanced further in future iterations. We also discuss the key implications of the universal definition document from the perspectives of various stakeholders within the healthcare framework, including patients, care providers, system/payers, and policymakers.
