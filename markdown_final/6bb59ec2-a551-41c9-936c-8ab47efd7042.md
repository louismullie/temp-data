## Question

What is the impact of MAP on kidney function in patients with hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how mean arterial pressure (MAP) impacts kidney function in patients with hypertension, including the implications for target values and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the renal physiology of autoregulation and how MAP relates to renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Then, I should verify how chronic hypertension shifts autoregulatory thresholds and what that means for perfusion. Next, I will examine the evidence for MAP-based targets in CKD, including MDRD and AASK, and reconcile these with modern guideline targets. After that, I need to review the hemodynamic consequences of intensive BP lowering, including the initial eGFR dip and its prognostic meaning. I will then consider acute care scenarios where MAP targets matter, especially sepsis and perioperative states. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, individualized approach to MAP/BP targets, monitoring, and safety, and double-check for any caveats or exceptions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the physiological foundation: renal blood flow and GFR are normally maintained over a MAP range of roughly 60–100 mmHg via afferent arteriolar myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms, so within that window, changes in MAP do not linearly change GFR. Outside that window, perfusion becomes pressure-dependent and GFR falls with lower MAP, which is clinically relevant in hypotension and in patients with shifted autoregulation [^114Hxg5Z] [^115r99md].

> Hold on, I should verify how chronic hypertension modifies this physiology: sustained hypertension remodels renal vasculature and shifts the autoregulatory curve rightward, meaning hypertensive kidneys may require higher MAP to maintain the same RBF/GFR. This rightward shift explains why, in shock states, patients with chronic hypertension sometimes need MAP targets above the generic 65 mmHg to avoid AKI, though this must be balanced against risks like atrial fibrillation with higher vasopressor exposure [^116PpMwC] [^116kQGYg] [^114F4y7F].

> Next, I should review the classic CKD trials that operationalized MAP targets: MDRD tested a low MAP target (< 92 mmHg) versus usual (< 107 mmHg) and, in long-term follow-up, showed slower progression to kidney failure with the lower MAP goal. AASK used the same MAP thresholds and found no overall renal benefit, but a signal of benefit in the subgroup with proteinuria, reinforcing that proteinuric CKD may be the phenotype where lower MAP/BP most clearly translates to renoprotection [^115FvR8H] [^116ztrgM] [^111USxYQ].

> Wait, let me verify how these MAP-based trials map to contemporary guideline targets: current ESH/ESC guidance recommends treating to office SBP < 140/90 mmHg in all CKD, and toward 130–139 mmHg if tolerated, with stronger support for < 130/80 mmHg in patients with albuminuria, acknowledging that SPRINT's < 120 mmHg strategy improved cardiovascular outcomes but did not demonstrate clear kidney benefit in the CKD subgroup and raised concerns about hemodynamic AKI, so < 120 mmHg is not broadly endorsed for CKD outside selected contexts [^117Corcw] [^1112BQLb] [^111bpcqd].

> I will now examine the hemodynamic price of intensive BP lowering: post hoc analyses of SPRINT and ACCORD show that for each ~10 mmHg fall in MAP beyond 10 mmHg, eGFR declines by about 3.4%, with an initial eGFR drop up to roughly 20–46% depending on the magnitude of MAP reduction. Importantly, this early decline stabilizes and does not predict faster long-term eGFR loss, so an initial eGFR fall within these bounds is generally acceptable if the patient is clinically stable and electrolytes are monitored [^111FurYp] [^114BPmxu] [^116LFD1n].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is acute illness rather than chronic CKD management? I need to check MAP targets in shock and perioperative care: in septic shock, a generic MAP target of 65–70 mmHg suffices for most, but patients with chronic hypertension have fewer AKI events and less RRT when MAP is targeted to 80–85 mmHg, likely reflecting their right-shifted autoregulation. Similarly, perioperative literature suggests higher MAP targets (about 80–95 mmHg) in hypertensive patients may reduce AKI, though data are heterogeneous and require individualized titration to perfusion rather than a fixed number [^116M1KhU] [^116kQGYg] [^116PpMwC].

> Let me consider the proteinuria dimension more carefully, because I should confirm whether lower MAP/BP is renoprotective only when albuminuria is present: subgroup analyses in AASK and long-term MDRD data indicate benefit of lower MAP/BP in proteinuric CKD, whereas nonproteinuric CKD does not show the same signal. Guidelines accordingly emphasize < 130/80 mmHg in the presence of albuminuria, aligning the MAP/BP target with the pathophysiology of glomerular capillary hypertension and injury [^116ztrgM] [^115FvR8H] [^117Corcw].

> I should double-check the practical monitoring implications: when intensifying therapy toward lower MAP/BP, I need to ensure standardized BP measurement (preferably home or ambulatory), check electrolytes and creatinine/eGFR within 1–2 weeks after major dose changes, and accept up to a 20% eGFR decline if asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. If the eGFR decline exceeds about 20% or continues beyond 3–4 weeks, I should reassess volume status, diuretic use, and renovascular disease, and consider stepping back on therapy [^1141MaYJ] [^114BPmxu] [^116LFD1n].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single MAP threshold fitting all hypertensive patients. I need to ensure the plan is individualized: for chronic nonproteinuric CKD, aiming for SBP 130–139 mmHg (roughly MAP 93–103 mmHg) is reasonable. For proteinuric CKD, targeting SBP < 130 mmHg (MAP < 93 mmHg) is favored. For frail older adults, I should avoid SBP < 130 mmHg and watch for orthostatic symptoms. In acute shock or perioperative states with chronic hypertension, titrating vasopressors toward MAP 75–85 mmHg may better preserve renal perfusion while balancing arrhythmia risk [^117Corcw] [^114EJM8P] [^116M1KhU].

> Let me reconsider the overarching message to ensure internal consistency: MAP is the perfusion pressure for the kidney, and within the autoregulatory range, renal function is relatively MAP-independent. Chronic hypertension shifts autoregulation rightward, so the safe lower bound of MAP may be higher in long-standing hypertension. Clinically, modest MAP reductions in CKD are acceptable if monitored, but the clearest renal benefit of lower MAP/BP is in proteinuric disease, whereas in acute illness with hypertensive vasculopathy, higher MAP targets may be necessary to prevent AKI, all of which argues for dynamic, phenotype-specific MAP/BP management rather than a fixed target [^114Hxg5Z] [^116ztrgM] [^116PpMwC] [^117Corcw].

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the primary determinant of renal perfusion, and in hypertensive patients, **MAP < 92–98 mmHg** slows CKD progression, especially with proteinuria [^116mf7RH] [^115FvR8H]. Intensive BP lowering to MAP ~92 mmHg reduces cardiovascular events [^notfound] but can cause an initial eGFR decline of 10–20% [^1141MaYJ], which is usually reversible; however, **MAP < 65 mmHg** risks acute kidney injury, particularly in chronic hypertension where autoregulation is shifted rightward [^116PpMwC] [^116M1KhU]. Individualize targets: aim for MAP 92–98 mmHg in proteinuric CKD, and avoid MAP < 65 mmHg in acute or critical illness; monitor eGFR and electrolytes closely during intensification [^117Corcw] [^116LFD1n].

## Physiological relationship between MAP and kidney function

- **Renal autoregulation**: The kidney maintains stable RBF and GFR across MAP ~60–100 mmHg via afferent/efferent tone and RAAS [^114Hxg5Z]; outside this range, RBF and GFR become pressure-dependent [^116kQGYg].

- **Hypertension and autoregulation**: Chronic hypertension shifts autoregulation rightward, requiring higher MAP to preserve perfusion and increasing AKI risk when MAP falls [^116PpMwC] [^116kQGYg].

- **Critical threshold**: MAP < 65 mmHg is associated with increased AKI risk, especially in chronic hypertension [^116M1KhU].

---

## Clinical evidence on MAP targets and kidney outcomes

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

- **MDRD study**: MAP target < 92 mmHg slowed CKD progression vs 100–107 mmHg, particularly with proteinuria [^115FvR8H].

- **AASK trial**: MAP target < 92 mmHg reduced proteinuria but did not significantly slow GFR decline overall; subgroup with proteinuria benefited [^116ztrgM] [^111USxYQ].

- **Meta-analyses**: Lower BP targets reduce cardiovascular events [^113NMA8q] but show limited renal benefit; proteinuria modifies risk [^111rv7Dk] [^116ztrgM].

---

### Acute kidney injury (AKI)

In septic shock, **higher MAP targets (80–85 mmHg)** reduce AKI and RRT in chronic hypertensive patients, though mortality is unchanged [^116PpMwC] [^116kQGYg]. In critical illness, **MAP < 65 mmHg** increases AKI risk, particularly with right-shifted autoregulation [^116kQGYg].

---

## Risks and benefits of intensive blood pressure control

Intensive BP lowering to MAP ~92 mmHg **reduces cardiovascular events** [^notfound] and may slow CKD progression in proteinuria, but it can cause an initial eGFR decline of 10–20% [^1141MaYJ], which is usually reversible. Excessive lowering below the autoregulatory range increases **AKI risk**, particularly in chronic hypertension [^116PpMwC] [^116kQGYg].

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended map target (mmhg)** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| General hypertensive patients | < 100 (SBP < 130/80) | High |
| Proteinuric CKD | 92–98 (SBP < 130/80) | High |
| Acute illness (sepsis, ICU) | ≥ 65 (individualize to 80–85 in chronic hypertension) | High |
| Elderly or frail patients | 100–110 (SBP < 150/90) | Moderate |

---

Individualization is essential — tailor targets to **age, comorbidities, proteinuria, and tolerance** [^117Corcw] [^1126tHYP].

---

## Clinical implications and practical considerations

- **Monitoring**: Track eGFR, creatinine, and electrolytes during intensification; expect a reversible 10–20% eGFR dip [^1141MaYJ] [^116LFD1n].

- **Medication selection**: Use RAAS blockade in proteinuric CKD; add CCBs or thiazides as needed [^117Corcw] [^1141MaYJ].

- **Acute care**: Avoid MAP < 65 mmHg; consider 80–85 mmHg in chronic hypertension with shock [^116PpMwC] [^116M1KhU].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

- **Optimal MAP**: Aim for 92–98 mmHg in proteinuric CKD; lower MAP reduces cardiovascular events but may cause reversible eGFR decline [^116mf7RH] [^113NMA8q] [^116LFD1n].

- **Avoid hypotension**: Keep MAP ≥ 65 mmHg in acute illness, especially in chronic hypertension [^116PpMwC] [^116M1KhU].

- **Individualize**: Adapt targets to age, comorbidities, proteinuria, and tolerance; monitor renal function closely during intensification [^117Corcw] [^1126tHYP].

MAP is a key driver of renal perfusion; **MAP 92–98 mmHg** balances renal protection and cardiovascular benefit, while **MAP < 65 mmHg** should be avoided in acute settings.

### Blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease: still no consensus [^1141zur6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite a strong consensus that treatment of hypertension is fundamental to strategies seeking to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce the associated risk of cardiovascular events (CVE), controversy persists regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) targets. This article reviews the evidence for different targets, discusses associated controversies and suggests approaches to improve BP control.

Recent Findings

Landmark clinical trials established the principle that lower BP targets are associated with slower progression of CKD in people with a greater magnitude of proteinuria and previous guidelines recommended a target BP of < 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. However, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial provided new evidence that a systolic BP target of < 120mmHg was associated with a reduced risk of CVE, though there was no impact on CKD progression and there was concern about an increase in renal adverse events. Nevertheless, 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended systolic BP < 120 mmHg, though other updated guidelines did not follow this trend. All guidelines emphasise the importance of standardised BP measurement and a personalised approach.

Summary

An individualised and shared decision-making approach to BP target setting and management is recommended, guided by standardised BP measurement.

### Differential effects of arterial stiffness and fluid overload on blood pressure according to renal function in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease [^111yDPk6]. Hypertension Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of hypertension is multifactorial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We explored the relative contribution of arterial stiffness and fluid overload to blood pressure (BP) in these patients. We evaluated 1531 patients from a prospective observational cohort study of high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. BP, arterial stiffness, and volume status expressed as the extracellular water/total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) were measured by 24-h BP monitoring, pulse-wave velocity (PWV), and bioelectrical impedance analysis, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that both PWV and ECW/TBW of the patients with CKD were significantly associated with 24-h systolic BP (SBP). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for predicting 24-h SBP ≥ 130mm Hg significantly increased after PWV was added to conventional factors regardless of CKD status. However, the AUCs did not increase in the ECW/TBW-based models. When a cut-off 24-h SBP level of 140mm Hg was used, the predictability of ECW/TBW for elevated BP significantly improved in patients with CKD (0.718 vs. 0.683, P = 0.034) but not in those without. Notably, a significant impact of arterial stiffness on high BP was consistently observed regardless of CKD status. This association was further confirmed by the net reclassification and integrated discriminant improvements, root mean squared error with adjusted R 2, and interaction effects. As kidney function declines, fluid overload is significantly associated with high BP. The impact of fluid overload on BP is only observed in more severe hypertension in patients with CKD.

### One-size MAP does not fit all [^116PpMwC]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

One-size mean arterial pressure does not fit all

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign advocates maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg in sepsis patients undergoing resuscitation. Leone and colleagues, in an article published in this journal, suggest considering higher MAP targets in the resuscitation of patients with a history of arterial hypertension so they do not progress to acute kidney injury. Asfar and colleagues, in a multicenter, open-label trial, showed no significant difference in mortality outcomes in septic shock patients undergoing resuscitation with an MAP target of either 80 to 85 mm Hg (high-target group) or 65 to 70 mm Hg (low-target group). However, the study did show that chronic hypertensive patients in the higher-target group had lower incidences of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy. This likely stems from the need for higher MAPs in chronic hypertensive patients in order to maintain organ blood flow because of a shift of the organ's autoregulatory range to the right. Thus, targeting a higher MAP for chronic hypertensive patients may help avoid the development of acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement therapy. Renal replacement therapy carries with it inherent morbidity as well as additional cost. These costs include the need for dialysate fluid and extra personnel and the use of anticoagulation and the extracorporeal circuit. However, chronic hypertensive patients in the high-target group had a greater incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (5.2% in the low-target group versus 9% in the high-target group). Patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation during sepsis have been shown to have increased incidences of in-hospital stroke and in-hospital mortality as well as subsequent recurrence of atrial fibrillation and increased long-term risks for heart failure, ischemic stroke, and death. This may offset any benefit of a higher MAP. The ideal target MAP may have to be individualized for specific patient populations. More studies are needed to determine whether baseline blood pressure plays a role in the ultimate determination of the ideal MAP target for patients with sepsis.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1112BQLb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ESH Guidelines suggest that the results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) have little relevance to the question discussed herein. SPRINT randomized 9361 hypertensive patients of increased CV burden to intensive (target SBP < 120 mmHg) or standard (target SBP < 140 mmHg) treatment. Of these patients, about 28% had CKD with eGFR between 20 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m², but very few had albuminuria A2 or A3, as individuals with proteinuria > 1 g/day or > 1 g/g were excluded. Importantly, DM, i.e. the most common cause of ESKD, and prior stroke were also exclusion criteria. In the overall trial, although the primary composite outcome of CV events as well as CV and total mortality were significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group compared with the standard-treatment group, kidney outcomes did not differ between the two groups. A sub-analysis of the SPRINT CKD subpopulation showed no difference between groups in the primary outcome or in the pre-specified kidney outcome, but a lower total mortality rate in participants in the intensive BP arm. The above results must be interpreted with caution, since the SPRINT trial was not designed or powered to study kidney outcomes, and, as such resulted in an extremely small number of kidney events (15 vs 16 in the two groups).

Following the above, the 2023 ESH Guidelines indicate that a recommendation to target office SBP < 120 mmHg in persons with CKD cannot be made. The reasoning for this is that the only relevant findings are delivered by this hypothesis-generating sub-analysis of the SPRINT trial, which included only a narrow range of the CKD population (non-diabetic, non-proteinuric CKD with eGFR 20–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and had both the primary outcome and the main kidney outcome (with only few events) be not significantly different between treatment groups. Furthermore, although SPRINT according to protocol used a trial-specific automated BP measurement technique, during its execution no consistent universal methodology was followed with regards to personnel attendance (no attendance, attendance during rest periods, readings' period or both), a fact that directly influenced the observed differences in outcomes. It is also known that unattended SBP (assessed in about 42% of SPRINT participants) and conventional office SBP measurement can vary substantially in the individual (between 5 and 15 mmHg).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^111uzNKG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — scope relative to the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline is outlined as follows: In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released new hypertension guidelines based on a systematic review; many recommendations are relevant to nephrology, but dialysis blood pressure (BP) targets and management are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses on recommendations pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or with non–dialysis-dependent CKD and includes a brief discussion of a consensus statement for adults receiving maintenance dialysis from the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association and the European Society of Hypertension working groups. Overall, the commentary supports the vast majority of ACC/AHA recommendations and highlights areas in which best diagnostic and treatment options remain controversial.

### Elevated pulse pressure is associated with low renal function in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension [^114E3i5Q]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

In the past decade, pulse pressure has emerged as a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. During aging, elevation of pulse pressure is a consequence of stiffening of the arterial wall. The relationship between pulse pressure and the renal aging process was studied in a cohort of 212 patients with never-treated isolated systolic hypertension. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were measured using constant infusion of technetium 99m (99mTc)-DTPA and 131I-ortho-iodohippurate, respectively, and timed urine collections. The relationship between pulse pressure and renal function was studied using a linear regression model in the total population and in 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and 60 years and older age categories. In the whole population, there was an inverse relationship between pulse pressure and glomerular filtration rate; however, this relation did not persist after adjustment for age. In fact, the inverse relationship between pulse pressure and glomerular filtration rate was only present in patients 60 years of age or older. This relationship in elderly patients remained after adjustment for age, gender, MAP, and cardiovascular risk factors (P = 0.006). It is suggested that pulse pressure, a marker of arterial stiffening, may have a detrimental influence on the age-related decline in glomerular filtration rate, after 60 years of age in patients with never-treated isolated systolic hypertension.

### Hypertension in chronic kidney disease after the systolic blood pressure intervention trial: targets, treatment and current uncertainties [^112cd3yj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the number one cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, and its treatment represents one of the most important interventions in patients at high risk for CV events. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high CV risk, yet as a group they have been excluded from most major blood pressure (BP)-lowering trials examining CV and mortality end points. The paucity of randomized clinical trial evidence for BP lowering in CKD patients is compounded by the fact that the association between BP levels and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD suggests the presence of a J-curve, which makes extrapolations from general population studies especially difficult. The recent completion of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which enrolled a large number of patients with mild to moderate CKD, has raised hope for much-needed clarity about the ideal systolic BP target in this patient population. This review discusses the epidemiology of hypertension in CKD and the pathophysiologic underpinnings of the distinct associations between BP levels and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD, and it examines the applicability of the SPRINT results to the general CKD population.

### Management of hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^112drtUz]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with impaired kidney function. The kidney exerts a marked degree of control over blood pressure through various mechanisms, such as by regulating sodium balance and hormone secretion through the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. The kidney is susceptible to injury, and if already damaged can be at risk of further loss of function as a consequence of elevated blood pressure. Once elevated blood pressure is identified, a combination of sensible lifestyle measures, such as sodium restriction and weight loss, with pharmacological intervention to reduce blood pressure will usually achieve blood pressure goals. In this Review, we outline the importance of blood pressure control for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the mechanisms that affect blood pressure control, and the basis for non-drug and drug therapies. We further discuss the rationale for < 140 mmHg systolic and < 90 mmHg diastolic targets for blood pressure in patients with CKD, with consideration for tighter targets in the setting of proteinuria.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1144hvQX]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — targets in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) notes that for diabetes, targeting the SBP to < 140 mmHg and towards 130 mmHg is beneficial on major outcomes; moreover, targeting SBP to < 130 mmHg, for those who will tolerate it, may further reduce the risk of stroke but not other major outcomes, and SBP should not be < 120 mmHg; for patients with CKD, the evidence suggests that the target BP range should be 130–139 mmHg.

### Low mean perfusion pressure is a risk factor for progression of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients – A retrospective analysis [^115r99md]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications of critical illness affecting 50–60% of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It is associated with serious short- and long term complications, including increased mortality and contributes to significant healthcare costs. Worldwide, opportunities are sought to prevent AKI and to reduce the risk of progression.

Haemodynamic regulation of renal blood flow and renal venous pressure are key determinants of renal function. In healthy individuals without systemic hypertension, intrarenal blood flow is auto-regulated at renal perfusion pressures between 60 and 100 mmHg. During critical illness, these processes may be compromised. A raised central venous pressure (CVP) and the resultant increased backward pressure also negatively impacts on renal function, mainly due to renal congestion and increased intra-renal pressure resulting in a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Most evidence stems from studies in patients with cardiovascular disease where an association between renal venous congestion and the development of AKI has been repeatedly shown.

To date, there are no established techniques to evaluate and monitor intrarenal blood flow and renal perfusion pressures directly. There are also no reliable means to predict intrarenal haemodynamics from systemic arterial pressures. It has been suggested that mean perfusion pressure (MPP) may serve as a surrogate. MPP is calculated as the difference between systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CVP, ie MPP = MAP – CVP Previous studies have shown that a lower MPP was associated with an increased risk of developing AKI. It remains unknown whether MPP also affects the risk of progression in patients with established AKI.

### Renal denervation for resistant hypertension [^112uZSNp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Resistant hypertension is highly prevalent among the general hypertensive population and the clinical management of this condition remains problematic. Different approaches, including a more intensified antihypertensive therapy, lifestyle modifications or both, have largely failed to improve patients' outcomes and to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk. As renal sympathetic hyperactivity is a major driver of resistant hypertension, in the last decade renal sympathetic ablation (renal denervation) has been proposed as a possible therapeutic alternative to treat this condition.

Objectives

We sought to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of renal denervation in individuals with resistant hypertension on clinical end points, including fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, hospital admissions, quality of life, blood pressure control, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiovascular and metabolic profile and kidney function, as well as the potential adverse events related to the procedure.

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to 3 November 2020: Cochrane Hypertension's Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (via CENTRAL) and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared renal denervation to standard therapy or sham procedure to treat resistant hypertension, without language restriction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study risk of bias. We summarised treatment effects on available clinical outcomes and adverse events using random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects using Chi² and I² statistics. We calculated summary treatment estimates as a mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, and a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Certainty of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We found 15 eligible studies (1416 participants). In four studies, renal denervation was compared to sham procedure; in the remaining studies, renal denervation was tested against standard or intensified antihypertensive therapy. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment and blinding. When compared to control, there was low-certainty evidence that renal denervation had little or no effect on the risk of myocardial infarction (4 studies, 742 participants; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.84), ischaemic stroke (5 studies, 892 participants; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.95), unstable angina (3 studies, 270 participants; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.89) or hospitalisation (3 studies, 743 participants; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.11). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, renal denervation may reduce 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) systolic BP (9 studies, 1045 participants; MD -5.29 mmHg, 95% CI -10.46 to -0.13), ABPM diastolic BP (8 studies, 1004 participants; MD -3.75 mmHg, 95% CI -7.10 to -0.39) and office diastolic BP (8 studies, 1049 participants; MD -4.61 mmHg, 95% CI -8.23 to -0.99). Conversely, this procedure had little or no effect on office systolic BP (10 studies, 1090 participants; MD -5.92 mmHg, 95% CI -12.94 to 1.10). Moderate-certainty evidence suggested that renal denervation may not reduce serum creatinine (5 studies, 721 participants, MD 0.03 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.13) and may not increase the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance (6 studies, 822 participants; MD -2.56 mL/min, 95% CI -7.53 to 2.42). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In patients with resistant hypertension, there is low-certainty evidence that renal denervation does not improve major cardiovascular outomes and renal function. Conversely, moderate-certainty evidence exists that it may improve 24h ABPM and diastolic office-measured BP. Future trials measuring patient-centred instead of surrogate outcomes, with longer follow-up periods, larger sample size and more standardised procedural methods are necessary to clarify the utility of this procedure in this population.

Resistant and uncontrolled hypertension are common presentations to the nephrology clinic. Many of these patients benefit from evaluation for secondary hypertension in order to optimize antihypertensive therapy and reduce the risks of target organ damage from uncontrolled hypertension. The purpose of this review is to present several cases of difficult-to-control and/or secondary hypertension and to identify optimal approaches to evaluating and managing hypertension in these high-risk patients.

### Intensive systolic blood pressure reduction and kidney and cardiovascular outcomes: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111dPFvc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The global burden of hypertension, which affects 1.28 billion adults worldwide, poses a substantial public health challenge. Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and chronic kidney injury. The dysfunction caused by chronic kidney injury is irreversible. Therefore, the investigation of the association between blood pressure (BP) control and kidney function is crucial.

Intensive BP control has been demonstrated to additionally reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension compared with traditional BP targets. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) highlighted a reduction in cardiovascular outcomes on achieving a systolic BP (SBP) level below 120 mm Hg. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommended intensive BP lowering to an SBP level below 130 mm Hg and noted the need for implementation studies to demonstrate the benefits and safety of intensive BP control in resource-constrained practice settings.

However, when implementing intensive BP control, the risk of kidney injury should be taken into consideration. A substantial reduction of SBP levels may impair the kidney function. A meta-analysis study revealed that SBP lower than 120 mm Hg results in loss of kidney protection and a SBP less than 110 mm Hg increases kidney injury. A subgroup analysis of the SPRINT study showed that a SBP less than 120 mm Hg increased 2.6% of kidney outcomes compared with a SBP less than 140 mm Hg in individuals without chronic kidney disease (CKD), yet this finding was outweighed by the potential benefits for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Similarly, a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials, including SPRINT and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), showed that intensive BP control also increased the risk of kidney outcomes in populations with and without type 2 diabetes. In the Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) trial, intensive BP control in the elderly population did not increase the risk of kidney outcomes but reduced the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, the effect of intensive BP control on kidney outcomes seems to be controversial because all these previous studies were conducted in special populations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for studies involving more representative populations to provide robust evidence on whether intensive BP control increases the risk of kidney outcomes in patients without CKD.

### Hypertension and chronic kidney disease progression: why the suboptimal outcomes? [^114pJ8xA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Current therapeutic interventions to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease have yielded disappointing outcomes despite adequate renin-angiotensin system blockade. The parameters to gauge the adequacy of blood pressure control need to be reassessed because clinic blood pressure constitutes a poor gauge of such control. The biologically relevant parameter for hypertensive target organ damage is total blood pressure burden, and reliance on isolated clinic blood pressure measurements per se does not accurately reflect the total blood pressure burden. This is particularly relevant to the population with chronic kidney disease in whom masked daytime or nocturnal hypertension and blood pressure lability are both widely prevalent and more difficult to control. Consequently, it is possible that the limited success currently being achieved in preventing or attenuating chronic kidney disease progression may be attributable in part to suboptimal 24-hour blood pressure control. Recent data and analyses also indicate that blood pressure variability, instability, episodic and nocturnal blood pressure elevations, and maximum systolic blood pressure may constitute additional strong predictors of the risk of target organ damage independently of mean systolic blood pressure. Accordingly, we suggest that future research should include the development of safe and effective strategies to achieve around-the-clock blood pressure control in addition to targeting mechanisms that reduce intrarenal blood pressure transmission or interrupt subsequent downstream pathways. Meanwhile, more aggressive use of patient education and home blood pressure monitoring with selection of longer-acting antihypertensive agents or nocturnal dosing should be considered to improve the current suboptimal results.

### Determining the relationship between blood pressure, kidney function, and chronic kidney disease: insights from genetic epidemiology [^112c7bwa]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Novelty and Relevance

Conventional observational analyses find higher blood pressure (BP) is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progressionand risk of developing end-stage kidney disease (known as kidney failure). The associations are apparent even among those with only moderate elevations in systolic BP to high-normal levels (ie, > 130 mmHg). However, no clear overall benefit on kidney outcomes emerged from meta-analyses of intensive versus standard BP lowering trials which tested an average BP difference of about 7 mmHg (down to on average about 130 mmHg), raising doubts about whether moderate elevations in BP (in the absence of accelerated-phase hypertension) are an important cause of CKD.

See editorial, pp

One potential explanation for the apparent discrepancy between findings from conventional cohorts versus randomized trials is reverse causality. Early kidney disease may be undetected and increase BP, resulting in spuriously strong BP-CKD observational associations. A second potential explanation is that intensive BP lowering trials may not have been large or long enough to confirm modest benefits of the achieved BP differences on CKD progression risk. Thirdly, it has been suggested that moderate elevations of BP may only cause CKD in individuals with certain comorbid diseases. For example, in healthy individuals, physiological autoregulation of renal blood flow at the glomerular afferent arteriole is considered to protect the kidneys from moderate fluctuations in BP by maintaining a steady filtration pressure, whereas dysregulated renal blood flow homeostasis which predisposes to the development of glomerular hyperfiltration — has been described in people with preexisting diabetes, vascular disease, and obesity. Post hoc subgroup analyses of intensive BP lowering trials are consistent with such a concept, having hypothesized that benefits of intensive BP lowering may be evident in people with preexisting proteinuria (a marker of dysregulated glomerular function), but not in those without.

### Effect of blood pressure control on long-term risk of end-stage renal disease and death among subgroups of patients with chronic Kidney disease [^115Rw2Xx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2017 American Heart Association guidelines recently lowered the blood pressure (BP) level that defines hypertension from 140/90 to 130/80 mm Hg for all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 1 These guidelines were strongly influenced by the results of the recent SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which demonstrated lower cardiovascular morbidity and all‐cause mortality among patients with and without CKD at elevated cardiovascular risk who were randomized to a lower systolic BP target of < 120 mm Hg. 1, 2, 3 However, the results of SPRINT have sparked considerable debate over optimal BP targets for individuals with different risk factors. 4, 5, 6

Despite the cardiovascular and mortality benefit seen with intensive BP lowering, SPRINT did not demonstrate a benefit of strict BP control on renal outcomes before the trial was stopped early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board. But there were only a small number of kidney events in SPRINT. 7 The results of SPRINT are consistent with those of other trials in nondiabetic CKD, which also failed to demonstrate in their primary analyses a benefit to intensive BP lowering over a relatively short time period on renal or mortality outcomes. 8, 9, 10, 11 Post hoc analyses of SPRINT have suggested potential harm with an intensive BP‐lowering approach among patients with CKD, including a higher risk for acute kidney injury, although most patients with CKD did recover from these acute kidney injury episodes, and acute kidney injury was not a primary outcome in SPRINT. 2, 12

The rationale and design of the AASK cohort study have been previously published. In brief, The AASK cohort study is a prospective multicenter observational study that is an extension of the AASK trial which tested the effects of a low mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal and the use of antihypertensives on renal function in African Americans with Hypertensive Kidney Disease. In the AASK Cohort study, trial participants who did not reach end-stage renal disease were followed up for five years after trial conclusion with the main outcome of interest being a composite renal outcome defined as a doubling of serum creatinine from baseline, ESRD or Death. A cardiovascular outcome was predefined as a combination of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, or strokes. Outcomes were ascertained from participants at each contact. Hospitalization records were reviewed by a cardiovascular event committee to adjudicate cardiovascular outcomes. Participants had their blood pressure managed by the AASK investigators with a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 130 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure goal of less than 80 mmHg. Investigators were encouraged to follow a standardized algorithm in their pharmacologic management. 24-h ABPM with measurements every 30 min during both day and night were collected at the post-trial baseline and then every other year to total three ABPM measurements over the span of the five years of the study.

### Importance of blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease [^1148aevT]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Arterial hypertension together with proteinuria is one of the most important factors associated with the progression of both diabetic and nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. In this review, the role of hypertension and proteinuria in renal disease progression, the BP target that should be achieved to slow the progression of renal damage, and the influence of baseline and current proteinuria on the renoprotective effects of antihypertensive therapy are discussed thoroughly. The interaction between the renoprotective effects of specific antihypertensive agents — mostly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers — and the level of achieved BP also are evaluated. The body of evidence provided by several studies emphasizes the importance of both lowering BP and inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system as specific goals for renal and cardiovascular protection in chronic kidney disease.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal as well as to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

### Patient-specific factors predicting renal denervation response in patients with hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fS9gx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal Function

In this review, renal function was graded by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and an eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 was considered renal insufficiency. Data from 3 original studies were available for meta‐analysis. Moderate‐certainty evidence suggested that patients with hypertension without renal insufficiency had a more significant reduction in office SBP after RDN (WMD, −5.63 [95% CI, −9.73 to −1.52]), whereas very low‐certainty evidence suggested that 24‐hour diastolic BP decreased more significantly after RDN in patients with hypertension with renal insufficiency (WMD, 2.24 [95% CI, 0.15 to 4.32]). There was no significant difference in 24‐hour SBP in patients with hypertension with or without renal insufficiency (WMD, 2.00 [95% CI, −0.89 to 4.89]) (Figure 8).

Figure 8
Meta‐analysis of renal insufficiency (without vs with) for office SBP (A), 24‐h SBP (B), and 24‐h DBP reduction (C) after RDN.

DBP indicates diastolic blood pressure; MD, mean difference; RDN, renal denervation; and SBP, systolic blood pressure.

Six other studies were mainly for qualitative analysis due to the lack of valid data. Two of them reported that patients with hypertension with renal insufficiency or a lower eGFR seemed to be less sensitive to RDN. Three of them reported that there is no statistically significant difference between those with and without renal insufficiency. The rest 2 studies reported that patients with decreased kidney function are likely to show a BP‐lowering effect(Table S3).

Cardiovascular Disease

Two studies were included for qualitative analysis due to the lack of valid data. One study with high risk of bias reported that the presence of cardiovascular disease (composite of transient ischemic attacks, strokes, and coronary artery disease) was related to a greater BP‐lowering effect of RDN, and the other with moderate risk of bias reported that BP reductions were similar in patients with varying baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk scores(Table S3).

### Balloon angioplasty versus medical therapy for hypertensive patients with renal artery obstruction [^117129ro]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Balloon angioplasty is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy on blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of renovascular complications, and side effects in hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

Search Strategy

The reviewers performed a search of MEDLINE from 1966 to December 2002, EMBASE from 1980 to 2002, Science Citation Index from 1990 to 2002, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and personal files to identify randomised controlled trials comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis. In addition, reference lists of papers resulting from this search were hand-searched, and authors of published trials were contacted to enquire if they were aware of any eligible unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50 per cent reduction in luminal diameter and minimal follow-up of six months).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators independently extracted data on trial design, characteristics of trial participants, types of interventions, and outcome measures. The quality of the available data precluded a formal meta-analysis to assess the effect on blood pressure, renal function, and number and defined daily doses of antihypertensive drugs. Peto's odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes such as the presence or absence of patent vessels and renovascular complications.

Main Results

Three randomised controlled trials involving 210 patients met the inclusion criteria. In unselected patients there was a consistent, but statistically non significant trend towards lower blood pressure in the balloon angioplasty group. Patients treated with balloon angioplasty required less antihypertensive drugs in two of three trials, and were more likely to have patent renal arteries after 12 months (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.8 to 9.8). There were no differences in renal function. There were significantly fewer cardiovascular and renovascular complications in patients treated with angioplasty (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70, test for heterogeneity p > 0.1).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Available data are insufficient to conclude that balloon angioplasty is superior to medical therapy in lowering blood pressure of patients with renal artery stenosis in whom blood pressure can be controlled with medical therapy. In patients with hypertension refractory to medical therapy, there is some weak evidence that balloon angioplasty lowers blood pressure more effectively than medical therapy. Balloon angioplasty appears to be safe and leads to fewer cardiovascular and renovascular complications. There is a need for randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of balloon angioplasty and medical therapy on the preservation of renal function in the long term.

### Evaluation and treatment of renal artery stenosis: impact on blood pressure and renal function [^112ai1vW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The conventional non-invasive tests to diagnose renal artery stenosis in a general hypertensive population are not accurate enough for screening purposes. Magnetic resonance angiography might become the new gold standard, with the advantages of the absence of contrast toxicity, good accuracy, and information on flow characteristics. With regard to the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis, intervention is advised only when blood pressure cannot be controlled by at least three antihypertensive drugs. Patency after stenting is superior to angioplasty, although its clinical benefit has not been proved. As for renal function, evidence - although from uncontrolled studies - for the preservation of renal function by intervention is accumulating, especially in those patients with bilateral stenosis or stenosis in a single functioning kidney.

### Blood pressure lowering for prevention of cardiovascular disease and death: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bbjJZ]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

The benefits of blood pressure lowering treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline blood pressure, presence of comorbidities, or drug class is less clear. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these differences.

Method

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE for large-scale blood pressure lowering trials, published between Jan 1, 1966, and July 7, 2015, and we searched the medical literature to identify trials up to Nov 9, 2015. All randomised controlled trials of blood pressure lowering treatment were eligible for inclusion if they included a minimum of 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than hypertension were eligible. We extracted summary-level data about study characteristics and the outcomes of major cardiovascular disease events, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. We used inverse variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool the estimates.

Results

We identified 123 studies with 613,815 participants for the tabular meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses showed relative risk reductions proportional to the magnitude of the blood pressure reductions achieved. Every 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular disease events (relative risk [RR] 0·80, 95% CI 0·77–0·83), coronary heart disease (0·83, 0·78–0·88), stroke (0·73, 0·68–0·77), and heart failure (0·72, 0·67–0·78), which, in the populations studied, led to a significant 13% reduction in all-cause mortality (0·87, 0·84–0·91). However, the effect on renal failure was not significant (0·95, 0·84–1·07). Similar proportional risk reductions (per 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) were noted in trials with higher mean baseline systolic blood pressure and trials with lower mean baseline systolic blood pressure (all ptrend > 0·05). There was no clear evidence that proportional risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease differed by baseline disease history, except for diabetes and chronic kidney disease, for which smaller, but significant, risk reductions were detected. β blockers were inferior to other drugs for the prevention of major cardiovascular disease events, stroke, and renal failure. Calcium channel blockers were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke. For the prevention of heart failure, calcium channel blockers were inferior and diuretics were superior to other drug classes. Risk of bias was judged to be low for 113 trials and unclear for 10 trials. Heterogeneity for outcomes was low to moderate; the I(2) statistic for heterogeneity for major cardiovascular disease events was 41%, for coronary heart disease 25%, for stroke 26%, for heart failure 37%, for renal failure 28%, and for all-cause mortality 35%.

Interpretation

Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering blood pressure to systolic blood pressures less than 130 mm Hg and providing blood pressure lowering treatment to individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

### Effects of exercise on kidney function among non-diabetic patients with hypertension and renal disease: randomized controlled trial [^116BhqzM]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease is an important public health threat. Such patients present high morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, with low quality of life and survival, and also high expenditure resulting from the treatment. Arterial hypertension is both a cause and a complication of kidney disease; also, arterial hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease among patients with kidney diseases. There is some evidence that exercise interventions may be beneficial to chronic kidney disease patients, but previous studies included only end-stage patients, i.e. those undergoing dialysis. This study aims to evaluate the effect of exercise on kidney function, quality of life and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease among non-diabetic chronic hypertensive kidney disease patients who are not undergoing dialysis.

Methods

The participants will be located through screening hypertensive patients attended within the public healthcare network in Pelotas, a city in south of Brazil. Eligible individuals will be those with glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 59 ml/min x 1.73 m 2. The randomization will be done in fixed-size blocks of six individuals such that 75 participants will be allocated to each group. At baseline, information on demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, anthropometric, blood pressure and quality-of-life variables will be collected, and laboratory tests will be performed. The intervention will consist of three weekly physical exercise sessions lasting 60–75 minutes each, with a total duration of 16 weeks. The outcomes will be the kidney function progression rate, quality of life, blood pressure, lipid profile, hemoglobin level, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein level, and ankle-arm index. The patients in both groups (intervention and control) will be reassessed and compared partway through the study (8 th week), at the end of the intervention (16 th week) and in the 8 th week after the end of the intervention.

Discussion

There is still a scarcity of data relating to the effect of physical exercise among the most numerous group of individuals with kidney disease, i.e. patients undergoing conservative treatment. In particular, there is a lack of randomized controlled studies. This study will help fill this gap.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1141MaYJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — chronic kidney disease (CKD) targets, diuretics, and monitoring — Current evidence suggests that in patients with CKD, BP should be lowered to < 140/90 mmHg and towards 130/80 mmHg, and loop diuretics should replace thiazide diuretics when the estimated GFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². In non-diabetic CKD, one meta-analysis showed the slowest progression of CKD with a treated SBP of 110–119 mmHg in patients with albuminuria ≥ 1 g/day, whereas in those with proteinuria < 1 g/day the lowest risk was with an SBP of < 140 mmHg. In a large retrospective cohort of 398 419 treated hypertensive patients, the nadir SBP and DBP for the lowest risk were 137 and 71 mmHg, with a clear increase in mortality risk at SBP < 120 mmHg. Because BP lowering reduces renal perfusion pressure, it is expected and not unusual for eGFR to be reduced by 10–20% after initiation; careful monitoring of blood electrolytes and eGFR is essential, the decline usually occurs within the first few weeks of treatment and stabilizes thereafter, and if the decline in GFR continues or is more severe, the treatment should be stopped and renovascular disease investigated.

### Current strategies for management of hypertensive renal disease… [^111BpJe6]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

The most important action to slow progressive renal failure is to control hypertension by whatever means necessary. Controlling hypertension with any antihypertensive agent slows the progression of renal insufficiency. All classes of antihypertensive drugs are effective in controlling blood pressure in patients with renal insufficiency. Hypertension in such patients may be resistant to control, and multiple antihypertensive drugs may be needed. 8, 24 Hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency should receive an ACEI, unless contraindicated, since these drugs have been shown to be renoprotective beyond their antihypertensive effects. Because of the possible beneficial renal effects of some calcium-channel–blocking agents, these agents should be useful as a third class of drug.

32 Possible mechanisms by which CCBs may be renoprotective are the reduction of systemic blood pressure, prevention or reduction of renal hypertrophy, modulation of mesangial traffic of macromolecules, reduction in metabolic activity of remnant kidneys, amelioration of uremic nephrocalcinosis, attenuation of mitogenic renal growth factors, possible prevention of pressure-induced calcium entry, and reduction of free radical formation.
33. A persistent increase of the serum creatinine level greater than 88 µmol/L above a baseline serum creatinine value indicates worsening of renal function. The ACEIs can reduce renal function in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis to a solitary kidney. They can cause hyperkalemia in older patients and some patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.

52, 53 If goal blood pressure is not reached with an ACEI and a diuretic, another class of antihypertensive agents should be added. There has been some comparison of ACEIs and ARBs in several experimental models of renal disease. In general, ARBs were as effective as ACEIs in slowing progressive renal failure in the remnant hypertensive kidney, diabetic rat, puromycin aminonucleoside glomerular disease, obstructive uropathy, and the genetic model of glomerular sclerosis, the MWF/Ztm rat. 20, 37, 58–60 On the other hand, ARBs were somewhat less effective than an ACEI in preventing kidney damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to nephrectomy, obese Zucker rats, and the Heyman model of membranous glomerulonephritis. 61–63.

### The relationship between mean arterial pressure and decreased glomerular filtration rate in rural areas of northeast China [^114tzUjP]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a global public health problem, and patients with CKD have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Mild renal insufficiency has been considered to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the correlation in people, in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors has been confirmed. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is considered to be the perfusion pressure for the organs of the body. Low MAP can cause low renal blood flow (RBF) and damage the kidney. However, this doesn't mean that RBF increases as the MAP increases.

Recent interest has been aroused in the relationship of renal damage with arterial stiffness evaluated by the augmentation index (AIx) and blood pressure including central blood pressure (cBP) and peripheral blood pressure (pBP). Several studies have investigated the association of AIx, cBP and pBP with glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but they have obtained inconsistent results. How MAP affects kidney function and gender differences in this mechanism remains unclear.

In the general population, is unknown how MAP influences the GFR? This study examined the relation between MAP and decreased GFR in participants aged ≥ 35 years from the Liaoning province of China. Further, we studied the relationship to see if there was a difference between the sexes.

### Relationship between blood pressure and incident chronic kidney disease in hypertensive patients [^114at3iV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hypertension is an important cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Identifying risk factors for progression to CKD in patients with normal kidney function and hypertension may help target therapies to slow or prevent decline of kidney function. Our objective was to identify risk factors for development of incident CKD and decline in estimated GFR (eGFR) in hypertensive patients.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between incident CKD (defined as eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and potential risk factors for CKD from a registry of hypertensive patients.

Results

Of 43,305 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 12.1% (5236 patients) developed incident CKD. Diabetes was the strongest predictor of incident CKD (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.84 to 2.09) and was associated with the greatest rate of decline in eGFR (-2.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year). Time-varying systolic BP was associated with incident CKD with risk increasing above 120 mmHg; each 10-mmHg increase in baseline and time-varying systolic BP was associated with a 6% increase in the risk of developing CKD (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.08 for both). Time-weighted systolic BP was associated with a more rapid decline in eGFR of an additional 0.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year decline for every 10-mmHg increase in systolic BP.

Conclusions

We found that time-varying systolic BP was associated with incident CKD, with an increase in risk above a systolic BP of 120 mmHg among individuals with hypertension.

### Optimizing mean arterial pressure in septic shock: a critical reappraisal of the literature [^112njLeK]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that a mean arterial pressure (MAP) value greater than 65 mm Hg should be the initial blood pressure target in septic shock, but what evidence is there to support this statement? We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar by using the key words 'arterial pressure', 'septic shock', and 'norepinephrine' and retrieved human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2014. We identified seven comparative studies: two randomized clinical trials and five observational studies. The results of the literature review suggest that a MAP target of 65 mm Hg is usually sufficient in patients with septic shock. However, a MAP of around 75 to 85 mm Hg may reduce the development of acute kidney injury in patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Because of the high prevalence of chronic arterial hypertension in patients who develop septic shock, this finding is of considerable importance. Future studies should assess interactions between time, fluid volumes administered, and doses of vasopressors.

### Blood pressure targets and kidney and cardiovascular disease: same data but discordant guidelines [^115hKWdq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension is highly prevalent in the United States and a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Hypertension is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and likely contributes to the association between CKD and cardiovascular disease. The ideal systolic BP to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with CKD is controversial.

Recent Findings

Several societies have released guidelines on the treatment of hypertension in the past year, each differing in important aspects, including BP targets. The release of new guidelines was largely spurred by the results of Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which suggested mortality benefit with more intensive BP targets. Recent post-hoc analyses of a subgroup of ACCORD-BP participants suggest a benefit with tighter BP control. However, another post-hoc analysis of ACCORD-BP participants showed worse kidney outcomes with tighter BP control.

Summary

Lower target BP appears associated with lower mortality in CKD, although longer term benefits with regard to kidney function remain unclear. Within this framework, treatment of hypertension should be tailored to each individual patient, accounting for cardiovascular disease risk, medication tolerance, and individual patient goals.

### Hypertension in CKD: core curriculum 2019 [^1114dFYq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely interlinked pathophysiologic states, such that sustained hypertension can lead to worsening kidney function and progressive decline in kidney function can conversely lead to worsening blood pressure (BP) control. The pathophysiology of hypertension in CKD is complex and is a sequela of multiple factors, including reduced nephron mass, increased sodium retention and extracellular volume expansion, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, activation of hormones including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and endothelial dysfunction. Currently, the treatment target for patients with CKD is a clinic systolic BP < 130mm Hg. The main approaches to the management of hypertension in CKD include dietary salt restriction, initiation of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretic therapy. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and accelerate progression to end-stage kidney disease. Although intensive BP control has not been shown in clinical trials to slow the progression of CKD, intensive BP control reduces the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in the CKD population.

### Effect of blood pressure control on long-term risk of end-stage renal disease and death among subgroups of patients with chronic Kidney disease [^1132BuxH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the duration of most clinical trials of intensive BP control have been short (mean duration, ≈3 years), 8, 9, 10, 11 trials that are stopped early may have exaggerated effect sizes, 13, 14 and lower BP targets may be difficult to achieve in all patients with CKD, there is a need for longer‐term studies of the effect of intensive BP control on CKD and mortality outcomes, which may occur over many years. In particular, there is a paucity of trial‐based evidence to support appropriate BP targets among patients with advanced CKD (stage 4 or beyond) and among young patients with CKD (eg, 18–40 years of age) because of their underrepresentation in most clinical trials. There have also been few studies that have examined whether the effect of intensive BP lowering is more pronounced among patients who have other concurrent metabolic or cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, a known risk factor for both CKD progression and death. 15, 16, 17, 18 Furthermore, current guidelines suggest that selection of BP targets be based on the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, but the available risk estimators have not been validated and may not be applicable to patients < 40 years of age. 1, 19

### The relationship between mean arterial pressure and decreased glomerular filtration rate in rural areas of northeast China [^114QdQ3J]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, MAP was associated with decreased eGFR in men, while in women MAP was not associated with decreased eGFR. These findings provide some evidence that a different adaptive response to renal regulation may exist in males and females, and paves the way for further studies aiming to identify the sex hormones involved in this mechanism.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114EJM8P]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in older patients (age ≥ 65 years) — older is defined as ≥ 65 years and the very old as ≥ 80 years — has high prevalence (~60% over the age of 60 years and ~75% over the age of 75 years). Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates benefit and tolerability, as "antihypertensive treatment substantially reduces CV morbidity and CV- and all-cause mortality" and "treatment has been found to be generally well tolerated", and "age alone should never be a barrier to treatment". It is recommended that older patients are treated according to the guideline algorithm, and "in very old patients, it may be appropriate to initiate treatment with monotherapy". For targets, "BP should be lowered to a systolic value of 130–139 mmHg and a diastolic value of < 80 mmHg if tolerated", and "treated SBP values of < 130 mmHg should be avoided". Monitoring needs are emphasized: "in all older patients, and especially very old or frail patients, possible occurrence of postural BP should be closely monitored and symptoms of possible hypotensive episodes checked by ABPM", and "renal function should be frequently assessed to detect possible increases in serum creatinine and reductions in eGFR". Drug selection cautions are that "centrally acting drugs and alpha-blockers should be avoided because of their association with injurious falls". Adverse effects require vigilance because "adverse effects can be more frequent than reported in RCTs", and trial evidence is limited as "RCTs have not included very frail patients, dependent patients, and patients with postural hypotension".

### Renal function and target organ damage in hypertension [^113WnGvb]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently observed in patients with arterial hypertension. The same factors that promote the appearance and progression of atherosclerosis can also promote the development of CKD. Two parameters are usually measured to estimate alterations in renal function, the presence of albuminuria, and the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Microalbuminuria and a decreased estimated GFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) are both accompanied by a significant increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk. Chronic kidney disease can develop all over the cardiorenal continuum and its presence in hypertensive patients with already developed CV disease contributes to a further increase in the development of events and death. Renal protection will in turn obtain CV protection and the treatment to be used is similar to that employed to prevent or to treat established CV disease.

### Nighttime MUCH, left ventricular hypertrophy, and kidney function among patients with CKD… [^112UnTYP]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, nighttime MUCH was common and associated with LVH and poor kidney outcomes among patients with hypertension and nondialysis CKD. These findings suggest that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was inadequately used in patients with CKD and hypertension, calling for more widespread use, even in patients with controlled office hypertension. Chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem, affecting 10. 8% of the Chinese population. 1 Hypertension is a common complication in patients with CKD, with a prevalence of 65% in patients with normal or nearly normal kidney function and up to 95% in patients with end stage kidney disease. 2 Given that hypertension is a strong risk factor for incident cardiovascular diseases, progression of kidney diseases, and mortality in the CKD population, 3, 4 strict blood pressure intervention and monitoring are needed to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular risk.

As shown in the Table, a total of 125, 244, and 280 had controlled hypertension, MUCH, and sustained hypertension, respectively. The 26 patients with white coat hypertension were excluded from further analyses because of limited sample size. Compared with patients with controlled hypertension, patients with MUCH and sustained hypertension were older, more likely to have diabetes, had lower hemoglobin levels and eGFR, had higher levels of proteinuria and office and ambulatory BP values, and used more antihypertensive drugs. In the univariate analyses, compared with controlled hypertension, MUCH and sustained hypertension were significantly associated with increased risk of the composite kidney outcome and ESKD. MUCH was associated with kidney dysfunction, the extent of proteinuria, and higher LVMI in earlier cohorts.

13, 18, 31, 34, 35 In the current study, both stage 1 and 2 MUCH were associated with LVH and an increased risk of kidney function deterioration. Furthermore, when using lower BP thresholds recommended by the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines, MUCH remained significant in the association with kidney function deterioration.

### Blood pressure deficits in acute kidney injury: not all about the mean arterial pressure? [^115U8p9t]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although there are many causes of AKI, it is known that patients undergoing high-risk surgery are known to be at significant risk. Although much effort has centred on the minimum arterial pressure needed to maintain renal perfusion, this tends to be based on relatively crude measures such as the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is widely used as an index for the optimal blood pressure. The rationale behind maintaining MAP is to provide adequate organ perfusion, although this is difficult to assess other than by applying crude end-points. Recent studies have examined the progression of AKI as defined by the KDIGO criteria in terms of time-weighted average values for premorbid and within-ICU haemodynamic pressure-related parameters. Although principally performed on patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery and who were on vasopressor support, some interesting results were obtained suggesting that crude MAP may not be an adequate target in AKI. In patients with AKI progression, greater observed deficits in mean perfusion pressure, diastolic arterial perfusion, and diastolic perfusion pressures were observed. This study may highlight potential modifiable risk factors for the prevention of progression of AKI, and hopefully translate into improved outcomes.

### Blood pressure deficits in acute kidney injury: not all about the mean arterial pressure? [^114Hxg5Z]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

When considering alterations to the systemic blood pressure and effects on the renal circulation, however, several features must be borne in mind. Firstly, the renal circulation can be viewed as two circulations in series: that to the glomerular capillaries through the afferent arteriolar system, and that to the tubular network via the efferent arterioles. Secondly, in order to maintain adequate pressure within the glomerular and distal capillaries, these systems are under intimate local control. This balance between the afferent and efferent systems, termed auto-regulation, is a fundamental component of renal function.

Autoregulation stabilizes renal blood flow (RBF) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during variations in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) over a defined range, implying that renal vascular resistance (RVR) changes in proportion to the RPP. The major pre-glomerular resistance vessels whose tone mediates most of this pressure-induced auto-regulation includes the afferent and cortical radial arteries. The efferent arterioles only play a minor role in RBF auto-regulation, principally under conditions of low RPP. Auto-regulation occurs through two major mechanisms: the myogenic response and the macula densa tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response, which are outlined in Fig. 1. The myogenic response reflects afferent arteriolar tone in response to changes in intraluminal pressure, whereas TGF is a more delayed response activated by tubular electrolyte delivery and re-absorption and, as such, associates the GFR with NaCl delivery. Consequently, TGF integrates both tubular and vascular function, and together these mechanisms adjust the tone of the pre-glomerular vessels in the face of a changing RPP. Local mediators also govern these responses; these include angiotensin II, arachidonate metabolites, and NO. Thus, auto-regulation is intrinsic to the kidney and largely independent of extrinsic nerves or circulating hormones. Such auto-regulation is not unique, and in many organs blood flow is regulated to satisfy the metabolic demands. However, what is different in the kidney is that the renal metabolic work is a function of RBF and is specifically dependent on the GFR and the amount of sodium that is to be actively re-absorbed. Therefore, the higher the blood flow the higher the metabolic demands. Given that under normal conditions renal sympathetic tone is low, a relatively high resting blood flow rate is observed within a relatively low resistance system. Interestingly, these flow waveforms observed are similar to that seen in the brain: both a relatively high diastolic pressure and mean flow velocity.

### Renal autoregulation and blood pressure management in circulatory shock [^114F4y7F]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A number of clinical studies have reported an association between low arterial blood pressure and increased mortality in patients with different types of shock. These patients typically receive vasopressor therapy to maintain adequate organ perfusion. Generally, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) target of around 65 mmHg is recommended in the initial management of shock, but the optimal level is hard to define. For example, a lower target may be advisable in patients with hemorrhagic shock without severe brain injury to minimize additional blood loss. Conversely, some patients may benefit from a higher blood pressure than others. Indeed, a small study in 25 patients with cardiogenic shock suggested a beneficial effect on microcirculation and tissue metabolism of increasing MAP from 65 to 85 mmHg. Whether a higher blood pressure beneficially affects renal blood flow (RBF) or kidney function is unknown. In septic shock, variable responses of RBF and kidney function to blood pressure levels greater than 65 mmHg have been reported in several small interventional studies. The randomized controlled SEPSISPAM trial evaluated the effect of increasing the target MAP to 80–85 mmHg, compared to a target of 70–75 mmHg, in 776 septic shock patients and found no difference in mortality between the two groups. However, patients in the pre-defined subgroup with arterial hypertension benefited from the higher MAP, as evidenced by lower plasma creatinine concentrations and reduced use of renal replacement therapy. These findings may be attributed to the existence of impaired renal autoregulation in these patients.

### Blood pressure lowering and major cardiovascular events in people with and without chronic kidney disease: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112XVEYE]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Blood pressure weighted meta-analyses of subgroups according to kidney function.

For the meta-analysis weighted blood pressure reduction in the placebo controlled trials, we calculated pooled estimates per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure over time as

exp(5×[∑∆SBPᵢ×Wᵢ×logHRᵢ/∑∆SBPᵢ²×Wᵢ])

where ∆SBPi is the mean difference in systolic blood pressure over time between randomised treatment groups and logHRi and Wi are natural log transformed hazard ratios of randomised treatment on each outcome and its inverse variance in trial i. For the head to head comparisons, where much smaller differences in blood pressure were observed, we calculated similar blood pressure weighted estimates per 1 mm Hg difference between the randomised groups.

Continuous effects of eGFR

We tested for interactions between eGFR fitted as a continuous variable and the effects of treatment on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes to maximise statistical power to detect possible differences in the effects of the various regimens according to baseline eGFR. Interactions between blood pressure lowering treatment and eGFR taken as a continuous variable were investigated with Cox proportional hazard regression models or logistic regression models including study treatment, continuous eGFR values, and their interaction term. The regression coefficient for the latter term estimates the log ratio of hazard ratios for comparing treatments, which shows the effect of a unit increase in eGFR on the treatment effect. Twenty three trials contributing individual participant data were included in these analyses. The log ratios of hazard ratio were pooled with a random effects model. The pooled summary was exponentiated to arrive at the overall estimated ratio of hazard ratio for a 10 mL/min/1.73 m² decrement in eGFR for each outcome.

### Arterial stiffness: a novel risk factor for kidney injury progression? [^113PSUgg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Arterial stiffness is typical feature of vascular remodeling in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Increased arterial stiffness raises flow and pressure pulsatility and is considered the principle pathogenic mechanism of isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and congestive heart failure. Apart from the impact of arterial stiffness on left ventricular afterload, downstream transmission of pressure pulsatility to the level of microcirculation is suggested to promote injury of other susceptible organs. This may be of particular importance for kidney injury progression, since passive renal perfusion along with low resistance and input impedance in renal microvessels make kidneys particularly vulnerable to the damaging effect of systemic pulsatile pressure. Recent studies have provided evidence that arterial stiffness culminates in elevated pulsatility and resistance in renal microvasculature, promoting structural damage of small intra-renal arterioles. Further, prospective observational studies have shown that reduced aortic compliance is closely associated with the annual rate of renal function decline and represents independent predictor of kidney injury progression to end-stage renal disease among patients with CKD. This article provides insights into the cross-talk between macrocirculation and renal microcirculation and summarizes the currently available clinical evidence linking increased arterial stiffness with kidney disease progression.

Initial Decline in eGFR Versus Decline in BP

Figure 2 depicts the relation between the initial BP decrease and initial decline in renal function expressed as percentage of baseline eGFR. Up to a 10 mm Hg decrease in MAP, eGFR remained virtually unchanged, but larger decreases resulted in a linear decrease in eGFR of 3.4% (95% CI, 2.9–3.9) per 10 mm Hg decrease in MAP. The normal initial eGFR decline, based on the lower eGFR threshold of the 95% of the participants, ranged from 26% with 0 mm Hg decrease in MAP to a 46% lower eGFR with 40 mm Hg decrease in MAP. The relation between MAP and eGFR did not materially change after correction for age, sex, BMI, baseline SBP, treatment allocation, diabetes mellitus, and increased albuminuria (data not shown). Patients with diabetes mellitus had a higher initial eGFR decrease of 3.6% (95% CI, 3.0–4.2) independent of the reduction of MAP. Likewise, albuminuria was associated with a higher initial decrease in eGFR of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.1–2.4).

### Blood pressure management in clinically complex scenarios: new horizons for a tailored approach [^115Lbeib]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Arterial hypertension is a major preventable cardiovascular risk factor, which is estimated to be responsible of around 25% of heart attacks and 40% of cardiovascular deaths in Europe. As the prevalence of arterial hypertension is continuously growing in the general population, it is estimated that by 2025 up to 60% of the adult western population will suffer from high blood pressure (BP), making arterial hypertension a timely topic for scientific research. The management of BP in specific conditions such as heart failure, kidney diseases or paediatric patients could be challenging. In the last years, new drugs have been introduced, changing the landscape of heart failure treatment, while possibly having a significant impact on BP regulation and kidney function. Similarly, while resistant hypertension may represent a true issue for clinicians and patients, novel therapeutic approaches are now available. In this regard, while for instance renal artery denervation has been introduced as an innovative therapy for patients with resistant hypertension, it has possibly shown consistent benefits also in patients with heart failure at large, whereby it could significantly reduce sympathetic nervous activation. This review focuses on new perspectives for the management of BP in these specific populations in order to provide practical hints for a tailored approach for clinically complex and/or resistant patients.

### Effects of intensive systolic blood pressure control on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in persons without kidney disease: a secondary analysis of a randomized trial [^1115sDcc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The public health significance of the reported higher incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering is unclear.

Objective

To examine the effects of intensive SBP lowering on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes and contrast its apparent beneficial and adverse effects.

Design

Subgroup analyses of SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01206062).

Setting

Adults with high blood pressure and elevated cardiovascular risk.

Participants

6662 participants with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

Intervention

Random assignment to an intensive or standard SBP goal (120 or 140 mm Hg, respectively).

Measurements

Differences in mean eGFR during follow-up (estimated with a linear mixed-effects model), prespecified incident CKD (defined as a > 30% decrease in eGFR to a value < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and a composite of all-cause death or cardiovascular event, with surveillance every 3 months.

Results

The difference in adjusted mean eGFR between the intensive and standard groups was -3.32 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI, -3.90 to -2.74 mL/min/1.73 m2) at 6 months, was -4.50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CI, -5.16 to -3.85 mL/min/1.73 m2) at 18 months, and remained relatively stable thereafter. An incident CKD event occurred in 3.7% of participants in the intensive group and 1.0% in the standard group at 3-year follow-up, with a hazard ratio of 3.54 (CI, 2.50 to 5.02). The corresponding percentages for the composite of death or cardiovascular event were 4.9% and 7.1% at 3-year follow-up, with a hazard ratio of 0.71 (CI, 0.59 to 0.86).

Limitation

Long-term data were lacking.

Conclusion

Intensive SBP lowering increased risk for incident CKD events, but this was outweighed by cardiovascular and all-cause mortality benefits.

Vasopressors

Recommendations

We recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65–70 mmHg (Grade 1B) rather than a higher MAP target (80–85 mmHg) in patients with septic shock. However, for patients with chronic hypertension we recommend aiming for a higher target (80–85 mmHg) for renal protection in septic shock (Grade 1C).
We recommend lowering systolic pressure to 140–190 mmHg rather than to 110–139 mmHg in patients with acute cerebral haemorrhage with severe admission hypertension (Grade 1C).
If vasopressors are needed for treatment of hypotension, we recommend norepinephrine (along with correction of hypovolaemia) as the first-choice vasopressor to protect kidney function (Grade 1B) and suggest vasopressin in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery (Grade 2C).
We suggest individualizing target pressure when premorbid blood pressure is available (BPS).

Rationale for MAP target

Preservation or improvement of renal perfusion can theoretically be achieved through increasing cardiac output by fluid resuscitation or inotropic drugs, through renal vasodilators or systemic vasopressors. Optimal target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was studied in a large open-label multicentre RCT randomising 777 patients with septic shock to resuscitation with a MAP target of either 80–85 mmHg or 65–70 mmHg. In most of the patients the achieved MAP was above the set target. The study found no difference in mortality, incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.7% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.42) or need for RRT (33.5% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.5), but more atrial fibrillation in the high target group. However, in patients with known chronic hypertension a higher MAP resulted in a lower incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.9% vs. 52%, p = 0.02) and less RRT (31.7% vs 42.2%, p = 0.046); mortality was unchanged.

The safety of lowering systolic pressure was studied in a larger RCT in patients with acute cerebral haemorrhage with severe hypertension on admission. Patients were randomised to a systolic blood pressure target of 110–139 or 140–179 mmHg. The primary endpoint (death or disability) was not different between groups. However, the rate of serious renal adverse events was higher in the lower target group (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.002) (ESM_2 Table S5).

### SPRINT – A kidney-centric narrative review: recent advances in hypertension [^111bpcqd]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a potent cardiovascular risk factor with deleterious end-organ effects and is especially prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease. The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) enrolled patients at an elevated cardiac risk including patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease and found that an intensive systolic blood pressure goal of < 120 mm Hg significantly reduced the rates of adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality and nonsignificantly reduced the rates of probable dementia; these results were consistent whether one had chronic kidney disease or not. However, results of intensive blood pressure therapy on chronic kidney disease progression were inconclusive, and there was an increased risk of incident chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury, but the declines in kidney function appear to be hemodynamically driven and reversible. Overall, an intensive blood pressure target is effective in reducing cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality and may reduce the risk of probable dementia in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease. More studies are needed to determine its long-term effects on kidney function.

### Renal metabolism and hypertension [^115qMkpF]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension continues to be a leading risk factor for disease burden worldwide, despite the availability of several preventive and therapeutic approaches. Hypertension substantially increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive decline. Most hypertensive patients need to take antihypertensive medications continuously, as a cure is not available. Millions of patients remain hypertensive despite taking three or more antihypertensive medications. Numerous genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors may contribute to the development of hypertension. Understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying blood pressure regulation and utilizing this mechanistic understanding to sub-group hypertensive patients for precision prevention and treatment are important challenges in medical and biomedical research.

Cardiac output and total peripheral vascular resistance determine systemic blood pressure. Several organs and tissues, including kidneys, resistance arterioles, central nervous system, and immune system, contribute to the regulation of blood pressure by regulating cardiac output or vascular resistance. The kidneys may regulate bodily fluid volume and vascular resistance by directly altering renal tubular transport of fluid and sodium or indirectly, by altering renal hemodynamics or endocrine factors. Nearly all of the identified causal genes for Mendelian forms of human blood pressure abnormalities involve kidney function, and most of the commonly used animal models of hypertension present kidney abnormalities.

In addition to its essential fueling and housekeeping functions, intermediary metabolism is increasingly recognized for its regulatory role in which metabolic pathways and intermediate products influence gene expression, signal transduction, and other regulatory pathways in the cell. Alterations in intermediary metabolism have been associated with the development of various conditions, including cancer and heart disease. In the kidneys, intermediary metabolism and related cellular functions such as mitochondrial function play an essential role in the development of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

Most of the energy produced in the kidneys is used to support renal tubular transport, which is essential for the long-term regulation of blood pressure. Changes in renal energy and substrate metabolism may influence tubular transport by altering adenosine triphosphate (ATP) availability and levels of other metabolic intermediates with regulatory function. Therefore, renal energy and substrate metabolism might be important for regulating blood pressure and the development of hypertension. Moreover, energy and substrate metabolism might provide new interventional targets for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.

In this review, we provide a brief overview of renal metabolism and its association with tubular transport, summarize studies in humans and animal models that have examined renal energy and substrate metabolism in blood pressure regulation and hypertension, and outline challenges and opportunities in this exciting research area.

DEFINITION OF HYPERTENSION AND CLASSIFICATION OF BP

In the 2023 ESH Guidelines, hypertension is defined based on repeated office systolic blood pressure (SBP) values ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg. The document acknowledges that this definition is arbitrary and has mainly the pragmatic purpose of simplifying the diagnosis and decision on hypertension management, as there is a continuous relationship between BP and the risk of death from stroke or ischemic heart disease starting from an office SBP > 115 mmHg and a DBP > 75 mmHg. In this context, the above office threshold BP values correspond to the level of BP at which the benefits of intervention (lifestyle interventions or drug treatment) exceed those of inaction, as shown by outcome-based randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The classification of office BP and definition of hypertension grades remain the same from previous guidelines and are presented in Table 1. The evidence grading system used in the 2023 ESH Guidelines is depicted in Supplementary data, Fig. S1.

Table 1:
Classification of office BP and definition of hypertension grades in adults and adolescents ≥ 16 years old (from, with permission).

In addition to grades of hypertension, which are based on BP values, the Guidelines also distinguish stages of hypertension as summarized below [Class of Recommendation (CoR) I, Level of evidence (LoE) C]. The presence of CKD plays a crucial role in this staging.

- **Stage 1**: uncomplicated hypertension [i.e. without hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), established CV disease (CVD) and CKD G3 or higher].
- **Stage 2**: presence of HMOD or CKD G3 or diabetes.
- **Stage 3**: established CVD, or CKD G4 or G5.

### Impact of intensive blood pressure control on kidney outcomes [^113Ei7PL]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension has long been recognized as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events. However, the role of intensive blood pressure (BP) control in preventing kidney disease progression continues to be debated. This review will provide a brief update on the evidence in support of or against the intensive control of BP on kidney outcomes in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), focusing particularly on trial-grade evidence.

Recent Findings

Recently, three large trials conducted in China compared the effects of intensive BP control in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. All three trials demonstrated that intensive BP control confers cardiovascular benefits, but mixed results were noted in terms of the risk of adverse kidney outcomes. In individual-level meta-analyses of six trials of different BP control strategies in patients with CKD, intensive BP control appeared to reduce the risk of kidney replacement therapy in those with CKD stage 4–5, but not in patients with CKD stage 3.

Summary

Most guidelines continue to recommend a systolic BP target of 120–130mmHg for patients with CKD given the cardiovascular benefits observed in trials of intensive BP control, though there are some signals of potential risks to the kidney with this BP treatment strategy.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Optimal blood pressure control and antihypertensive regimens in hypertensive renal disease: the potential of exploring the mechanisms of response variability [^116mf7RH]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

In renal patients rigorous blood pressure control is crucial to prevent renal and cardiovascular target organ damage. For renoprotection target blood pressure depends on the severity of proteinuria before treatment. For proteinuria of 1–3g/day a mean arterial pressure of 98 mmHg provides additional benefit, whereas the target should be as low as 92 mmHg if proteinuria exceeds 3g/day. The antiproteinuric effect of antihypertensive intervention predicts renoprotection; it is therefore recommended that therapy should be titrated not only on blood pressure, but also on reduction of proteinuria. All currently available classes of antihypertensives can be used to reduce blood pressure in renal patients. Interventions based on blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have additional antiproteinuric, and thus renoprotective, potential. Large individual differences in therapeutic benefit are common, even for interventions of proven efficacy at group level. Studies applying different classes of drugs in the same patient (rotation schedules) demonstrate that individual factors are main determinants of therapy response. Exploration of the mechanisms underlying these patient factors is important to improve treatment outcome. Analysis of genetic determinants of therapy response has great potential in this respect. However, therapy response is a complex phenotype. Thus, careful study of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions will be needed in order to turn this type of knowledge into benefit for the patient.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113sgNfp]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — glucose-lowering drugs and blood pressure notes that incretin-based and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) therapies have cardiovascular and renal effects beyond glucose control. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists slightly reduce blood pressure (BP), and also body weight with glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists; two glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists (liraglutide and semaglutide) reduced CV and total mortality, but not heart failure, in patients with type 2 diabetes. Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 are the only glucose-lowering drug class to reduce BP beyond the projected impact of weight reduction on BP, and empagliflozin and canagliflozin have demonstrated a reduction in heart failure and total and CV mortality, and a protective effect on renal function.

### Managing kidney disease with blood-pressure control [^112W1F7M]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

The progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that the rate of CKD progression can be lowered by pharmacological interventions. Nephroprotective strategies currently focus on the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers provide efficient control not only of blood pressure, but also of proteinuria, an effect associated with improved long-term nephroprotection compared with other antihypertensive drug classes. In addition, evidence for an additional nephroprotective advantage of tight blood-pressure control towards the low-normal range in young patients and patients with proteinuria is emerging. In this Review, we describe the role of hypertension in CKD and discuss the therapeutic principle of the prevention of CKD progression with antihypertensive agents.

### The kidney in arterial hypertension [^117Asmyq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

The kidney facilitates the development of arterial hypertension and suffers its consequences. Once renal damage is clinically manifested, a clear increase in cardiovascular risk appears. The coincidence of renal and cardiovascular damage strengthens the need for therapies attempting the simultaneous protection of both the kidney and the cardiovascular system.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112uqw8b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) presented and published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA). Following the evolution of evidence in recent years, several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appeared in these Guidelines. These include recommendations for target office blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg in most and against target office BP < 120/70 mmHg in all patients with CKD; recommendations for use of spironolactone or chlorthalidone for patients with resistant hypertension with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) higher or lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively; use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for patients with CKD and estimated eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2; use of finerenone for patients with CKD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, albuminuria, eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium < 5.0 mmol/L; and revascularization in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and secondary hypertension or high-risk phenotypes if stenosis ≥ 70% is present. The present report is a synopsis of sections of the ESH Guidelines that are relevant to the daily clinical practice of nephrologists, prepared by experts from ESH and ERA. The sections summarized are those referring to the role of CKD in hypertension staging and cardiovascular risk stratification, the evaluation of hypertension-mediated kidney damage and the overall management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^111USxYQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Additional Insights: CKD

BP targets in CKD patients were also increased from < 130/80 to < 140/90 mm Hg between the JNC 7 and JNC 8 guidelines. While the JNC 8 panel did not incorporate proteinuria as an outcome of interest, the ASH/ISH, the ESH/ESC, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group all make a distinction between CKD patients based on proteinuria status, with a lower BP goal of < 130/80 to 90 mm Hg for those with proteinuria detectable on urinanalysis. 12, 14, 22

The International Society on Hypertension in Blacks also recommends a target of < 130/80 mm Hg for black adults with CKD. The evidence for these recommendations is based on 3 trials — the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, and the Blood‐pressure Control for Renoprotection in Patients with Non‐diabetic Chronic Renal Disease (REIN‐2) study. None of these trials showed a difference in kidney or CVD outcomes between those with lower versus higher BP goals. 40, 41, 42

AASK (N = 1094) evaluated mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals, targeting 102 to 107 mm Hg in the usual‐BP group versus ≤ 92 mm Hg in the lower‐BP group. While the lower‐BP group achieved an average BP of 128/78 mm Hg, compared with 141/85 mm Hg in the other group, there was no significant change in the rate of glomerular filtration rate decline, end‐stage renal disease, or death. There was, however, a decrease in proteinuria in the strict treatment group at 6 months (17% decrease versus 7% increase), and this effect persisted throughout the length of the study. 41 MDRD (N = 1585) used the same MAP targets, and in participants with at least 1 g/d of proteinuria, the lower BP target group had a slower rate of glomerular filtration rate decline. 42

### Balloon angioplasty, with and without stenting, versus medical therapy for hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis [^116xEx6D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Balloon angioplasty with stenting is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis but the effectiveness of this procedure in treating hypertension, improving renal function and preventing adverse cardiovascular and renal events remains uncertain. This is an update, to include the results of recent, important large trials, of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. The following outcomes were compared: blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of cardiovascular and renal adverse events, presence or absence of restenosis of the renal artery, side effects of medical therapy, numbers and defined daily doses of antihypertensive drugs.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 4). Bibliographies were also reviewed and trial authors were contacted for more information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter) and with a minimum follow-up of six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently on trial design, participants, interventions and outcome measures. A formal meta-analysis was completed to assess the effect on blood pressure, renal function and cardiovascular and renal adverse events. Peto's odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous variables were calculated.

Main Results

Eight RCTs involving 2222 participants with renal artery stenosis were included in the review. The overall quality of evidence included in this review was moderate. Limited pooling of results was possible due to the variable presentation of some of the trial outcomes. Meta-analysis of the four studies reporting change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) found a small improvement in diastolic BP in the angioplasty group (MD -2.00 mmHg; 95% CI -3.72 to -0.27) whilst the meta-analysis of the five studies reporting change in systolic BP did not find any evidence of significant improvement (MD -1.07 mmHg; 95% CI -3.45 to 1.30). There was no significant effect on renal function as measured by serum creatinine (MD -7.99 µmol/L; 95% CI -22.6 to 6.62). Meta-analysis of the three studies that reported the mean number of antihypertensive drugs found a small decrease in antihypertensive drug requirements for the angioplasty group (MD -0.18; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03). Repeat angiography was only performed on a small number of participants in a single trial and it was therefore not possible to comment on restenosis of the renal artery following balloon angioplasty. Based on the results of the seven studies that reported cardiovascular and renal clinical outcomes there were no differences in cardiovascular (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11) or renal adverse events (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.38) between the angioplasty and medical treatment groups. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (haematoma at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection (2.5%) as well as peri-procedural deaths (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The available data are insufficient to conclude that revascularisation in the form of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, is superior to medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. However, balloon angioplasty results in a small improvement in diastolic blood pressure and a small reduction in antihypertensive drug requirements. Balloon angioplasty appears safe and results in similar numbers of cardiovascular and renal adverse events to medical therapy.

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^113RrpeN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30%-60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve BP targets and subsequently remain at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly important to nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with CKD. Data are limited on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension, because patients with CKD have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials. First, we propose a consistent definition of resistant hypertension as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at dosages optimized to provide maximum benefit in the absence of intolerable side effects. Second, we recommend that each patient undergo a standardized, stepwise evaluation to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications to identify and reduce barriers and discontinue use of substances that may exacerbate hypertension. Patients in whom there is high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension. Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed with special considerations of the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD, including the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the current place of emerging therapies, such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation. We endorse use of such a systematic approach to improve recognition and care for this vulnerable patient group that is at high risk for future kidney and cardiovascular events.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^116H42yQ]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .)

In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours.

In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy.

At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours, after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing.

The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure.

In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.

In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure(see PRECAUTIONS).

Hydrochlorothiazide

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.

After oral use diuresis begins within two hours, peaks in about four hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^112gDYYh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduction of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains an important intervention for slowing kidney disease progression. Over the past decade, the most appropriate BP target for initiation and titration of BP-lowering medications has been an area of intense research and debate within the clinical community. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in conjunction with several other professional societies released new hypertension guidelines based on data from a systematic review of clinical trials and observational data. While many of the recommendations in the ACC/AHA hypertension guideline are relevant to nephrology practice, BP targets and management strategies for patients receiving dialysis are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses largely on recommendations from the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines that are pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease or with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. This KDOQI commentary also includes a brief discussion of the consensus statement regarding hypertension diagnosis and management for adults receiving maintenance dialysis published by the European Renal and Cardiovascular Medicine Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Hypertension and the Kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension. Overall, we support the vast majority of the ACC/AHA recommendations and highlight select areas in which best diagnosis and treatment options remain controversial.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular and renal outcomes: updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NMA8q]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recent hypertension guidelines have reversed previous recommendations for lower blood pressure targets in high-risk patients, such as those with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or diabetes. This change represents uncertainty about whether more intensive blood pressure-lowering strategies are associated with greater reductions in risk of major cardiovascular and renal events. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intensive blood pressure-lowering strategies.

Methods

For this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for trials published between Jan 1, 1950, and Nov 3, 2015. We included randomised controlled trials with at least 6 months' follow-up that randomly assigned participants to more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment, with different blood pressure targets or different blood pressure changes from baseline. We did not use any age or language restrictions. We did a meta-analysis of blood pressure reductions on relative risk (RR) of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death, separately and combined), and non-vascular and all-cause mortality, end-stage kidney disease, and adverse events, as well as albuminuria and progression of retinopathy in trials done in patients with diabetes.

Findings

We identified 19 trials including 44,989 participants, in whom 2496 major cardiovascular events were recorded during a mean 3·8 years of follow-up (range 1·0–8·4 years). Our meta-analysis showed that after randomisation, patients in the more intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment group had mean blood pressure levels of 133/76 mm Hg, compared with 140/81 mm Hg in the less intensive treatment group. Intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment achieved RR reductions for major cardiovascular events (14% [95% CI 4–22]), myocardial infarction (13% [0–24]), stroke (22% [10–32]), albuminuria (10% [3–16]), and retinopathy progression (19% [0–34]). However, more intensive treatment had no clear effects on heart failure (15% [95% CI -11 to 34]), cardiovascular death (9% [-11 to 26]), total mortality (9% [-3 to 19]), or end-stage kidney disease (10% [-6 to 23]). The reduction in major cardiovascular events was consistent across patient groups, and additional blood pressure lowering had a clear benefit even in patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 140 mm Hg. The absolute benefits were greatest in trials in which all enrolled patients had vascular disease, renal disease, or diabetes. Serious adverse events associated with blood pressure lowering were only reported by six trials and had an event rate of 1·2% per year in intensive blood pressure-lowering group participants, compared with 0·9% in the less intensive treatment group (RR 1·35 [95% CI 0·93–1·97]). Severe hypotension was more frequent in the more intensive treatment regimen (RR 2·68 [1·21–5·89], p = 0·015), but the absolute excess was small (0·3% vs 0·1% per person-year for the duration of follow-up).

Interpretation

Intensive blood pressure lowering provided greater vascular protection than standard regimens. In high-risk patients, there are additional benefits from more intensive blood pressure lowering, including for those with systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg. The net absolute benefits of intensive blood pressure lowering in high-risk individuals are large.

### Elevated blood pressure and risk of end-stage renal disease in subjects without baseline kidney disease… [^113JTnvF]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Many cases of end-stage renal disease are ascribed to hypertension. 1–5 However, because kidney disease itself can raise blood pressure, the importance of hypertension as a risk factor for ESRD continues to be questioned. 6–15 In emphasizing the possibility that primary renal disease may explain both elevated blood pressure and progression to ESRD, some have pointed out that there are "no reported cases of benign essential hypertensive patients with normal serum creatinine levels and no proteinuria who subsequently went on to develop renal failure. "11, 16. Compared with subjects with a blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg, the adjusted relative risk of developing ESRD increased

1. 6-fold for subjects with blood pressures of 120 to 129/80 to 84 mm Hg, 2. 0-fold for subjects with blood pressures of 130 to
139.

We demonstrated in this large cohort a graded association between blood pressure and risk of ESRD among subjects without baseline clinical evidence of kidney disease. This study extends our understanding of the relationship between blood pressure and renal failure in several important ways. Some investigators12, 16 argue that ESRD seen in patients with hypertension is due to underlying primary renal disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Previous cohort studies18–20, 28 of the relationship between blood pressure and ESRD did not uniformly screen out kidney disease at baseline so were unable to address this potential critical confounder. Hence, proof that elevated blood pressure is a causal risk factor of ESRD by observing the effect of interrupting this risk factor cannot be easily accomplished using a randomized trial approach. Intriguingly, in randomized trials, antihypertensive therapy did not appear to reduce the incidence of less severe cases of renal dysfunction.

14, 15 Second, because of the large differences between the absolute risk of ESRD and absolute risk of cardiovascular disease, in a competing mortality paradigm, modest absolute reductions in cardiovascular mortality through implementation of available cardiovascular therapies may contribute to significant relative increases in ESRD incidence because patients survive longer and therefore develop kidney failure. This study provides the strongest epidemiologic evidence to date that nonmalignant hypertension is indeed an independent risk factor for ESRD. Risk is increased even with relatively modest elevations in blood pressure. Notably, the observed relationship does not appear to be due to confounding by clinically evident baseline kidney disease. Improved control of blood pressure and better understanding of other contributors to the worsening epidemic of ESRD are needed to reduce the worldwide burden of kidney disease.

### Very low SBP targets and the boom-and-bust cycle of benefit and adverse kidney events [^115aAAWt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Fourth, could tighter blood pressure targets be achieved without adverse kidney events? Effects of Intensive Systolic Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment in Reducing RIsk of Vascular evenTs (ESPRIT) was the largest trial (11 255 participants) on intensive versus standard antihypertensive treatment. It aimed at similar SBP targets as the SPRINT trial and also enrolled participants with high cardiovascular risk (although 38.7% had diabetes mellitus). The mean age and baseline blood pressure of the participants and the length of the trial and achieved SBP (119.1 ± 11.1 and 134.8 ± 10.5 mmHg at 1 year) were not dissimilar to SPRINT but only 6% had CKD G3a. Like SPRINT, the intensive treatment arm had fewer occurrences of the primary composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78–0.99) but an increased risk of kidney adverse events. A sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 40% from baseline was observed in 3% of the participants in the intensive versus 1.8% in the standard treatment arm (HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.33–2.17).

Overall, a blood pressure target range of 110 to < 130 mmHg may be more feasible and potentially safer from the kidney point of view while maintaining the cardiovascular and survival benefits. However, differences in healthcare systems, culture and ethnicity, and other differences between the study populations preclude direct comparisons between these trials. Given the differences across countries in healthcare systems, life expectancy and the epidemiology of cardiovascular–kidney–metabolic diseases, a pan-European pragmatic clinical trial may best address the question of the optimal target SBP in the European context.

Finally, the short- and long-term results of SPRINT suggest some divergence in the 'dose-response' relationship of SBP targets and the consequent CVD or renal outcomes. Whereas a lower SBP target was associated with lower risk of stroke or CVD death, the opposite appeared to be true for renal outcomes such as worsening kidney function or incident kidney failure.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Renal metabolism and hypertension [^112P9UP2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Hypertension is a leading risk factor for disease burden worldwide. The kidneys, which have a high specific metabolic rate, play an essential role in the long-term regulation of arterial blood pressure. In this review, we discuss the emerging role of renal metabolism in the development of hypertension. Renal energy and substrate metabolism is characterized by several important and, in some cases, unique features. Recent advances suggest that alterations of renal metabolism may result from genetic abnormalities or serve initially as a physiological response to environmental stressors to support tubular transport, which may ultimately affect regulatory pathways and lead to unfavorable cellular and pathophysiological consequences that contribute to the development of hypertension.

### Initial estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and long-term renal function during intensive antihypertensive therapy: a post hoc analysis of the SPRINT and ACCORD-BP randomized controlled trials [^114BPmxu]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Lowering blood pressure (BP) can lead to an initial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). However, there is debate how much eGFR decline is acceptable. We performed a post hoc analysis of ACCORD-BP (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure) and SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which randomized patients to intensive or standard systolic BP-targets. We determined the relation between initial decline in mean arterial pressure and eGFR. Subsequently, we stratified patients to BP-target and initial eGFR decrease and assessed the relation with annual eGFR decline after 1 year. A total of 13 266 patients with 41 126 eGFR measurements were analyzed. Up to 10 mm Hg of BP-lowering, eGFR did not change. Hereafter, there was a linear decrease of 3.4% eGFR (95% CI, 2.9%-3.9%) per 10 mm Hg mean arterial pressure decrease. The observed eGFR decline based on 95% of the subjects varied from 26% after 0 mm Hg to 46% with a 40 mm Hg mean arterial pressure decrease. There was no difference in eGFR slope (P = 0.37) according to initial eGFR decline and BP-target, with a decrease of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.09–1.39), 1.20 (95% CI, 0.97–1.43), and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.77–1.50) in the 5%, 5% to 20%, and > 20% stratum during intensive and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.81–1.09), 1.23 (95% CI, 0.97–1.49), and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.65–1.69) mL/minute per 1.73 m² per year during standard treatment. In patients at high cardiovascular risk with and without diabetes mellitus, we found no association between initial eGFR and annual eGFR decline during BP-lowering treatment. Our results support that an eGFR decrease up to 20% after BP lowering can be accepted and suggest that the limit can be extended up to 46% depending on the achieved BP reduction.

### Higher blood pressure versus normotension targets to prevent acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^116kQGYg]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

MAP is the fundamental driver of organ perfusion. Autoregulation is the capacity of healthy essential organs such as the heart, brain, and kidney to maintain a consistent blood flow rate within a range of perfusion pressure. In disrupted hemodynamics, such as circulatory shock and perioperative patients, organ blood flow depends on perfusion pressure. Targeting a physiological MAP is necessary to safeguard key organs by ensuring peripheral perfusion BP and microcirculatory blood flow. As a target for hemodynamic optimization, MAP is commonly set at 65 mmHg in septic shock guidelines and perioperative settings. However, since the kidney has the highest autoregulation threshold compared to other organs, it remains unclear if a higher MAP is required for better AKI prevention. Animal research demonstrated a 50 to 90 mmHg renal autoregulation threshold, but no human data was available. The absence of renoprotective impact of greater MAP relative to normotension may be related to the kidney's ability to autoregulate above the autoregulation threshold. Our findings supported the currently suggested normotension level (MAP about 65 mmHg) over higher MAP targets for AKI prevention in frequent AKI-related scenarios.

After adjusting for patient group, we found no significant effect of hypertension, mean age, or RoB on the link between MAP and AKI in meta-regression models. Nevertheless, subgroup analysis of shock patients with hypertension revealed a renoprotective signal of higher MAP (> 70 mmHg) on reducing the RRT receipt rate. Chronic hypertension is known to shift the renal autoregulation zone to the right, higher MAP is therefore required to maintain adequate perfusion pressure. Dewitte et al. studied 26 hypertensive patients with sepsis-associated AKI and discovered that targeting 80–85 mmHg MAP was linked with significantly higher creatinine clearance than lower MAP (65–70 mmHg). Evidence of effect modification of hypertension is scarce in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery patients. Wu et al.'s RCT, which included exclusively hypertensive patients undergoing major surgery, demonstrated renoprotective effect of MAP at 80–95 mmHg versus MAP of 65–79 mmHg. Guidelines in resuscitating shock patients, consensus on post-operative non-cardiac AKI and perioperative patients also recommended higher MAP target in hypertension patients. Due to the observational nature of subgroup analysis and meta-regression, whether higher MAP targets could actually prevent AKI in hypertensive patients with hemodynamic instability may be an essential question for future trials.

### Hypertension as cardiovascular risk factor in chronic kidney disease [^112SgaPL]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the leading modifiable cause of premature death and hence one of the global targets of World Health Organization for prevention. Hypertension also affects the great majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both hypertension and CKD are intrinsically related, as hypertension is a strong determinant of worse renal and cardiovascular outcomes and renal function decline aggravates hypertension. This bidirectional relationship is well documented by the high prevalence of hypertension across CKD stages and the dual benefits of effective antihypertensive treatments on renal and cardiovascular risk reduction. Achieving an optimal blood pressure (BP) target is mandatory and requires several pharmacological and lifestyle measures. However, it also requires a correct diagnosis based on reliable BP measurements (eg, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, home BP), especially for populations like patients with CKD where reduced or reverse dipping patterns or masked and resistant hypertension are frequent and associated with a poor cardiovascular and renal prognosis. Even after achieving BP targets, which remain debated in CKD, the residual cardiovascular risk remains high. Current antihypertensive options have been enriched with novel agents that enable to lower the existing renal and cardiovascular risks, such as SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors and novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Although their beneficial effects may be driven mostly from actions beyond BP control, recent evidence underline potential improvements on abnormal 24-hour BP phenotypes such as nondipping. Other promising novelties are still to come for the management of hypertension in CKD. In the present review, we shall discuss the existing evidence of hypertension as a cardiovascular risk factor in CKD, the importance of identifying hypertension phenotypes among patients with CKD, and the traditional and novel aspects of the management of hypertensives with CKD.

### Arterial stiffness, pulse pressure, and the kidney [^115pVLtD]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Classical studies indicate that the contribution of kidneys to hypertension is almost exclusively related to the association between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and vascular resistance. Recent reports including estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) have shown that pulse pressure (PP) and pulse wave velocity, 2 major indices of arterial stiffness, now emerge as significant predictors of cardiovascular risk and age-associated decline in GFR. Such findings are mainly observed in patients with hypertension and renal failure and in atherosclerotic subjects undergoing coronary angiography. In such patients, amplification of PP between ascending and terminal aorta at the renal site is constantly increased over 10mm Hg (P < 0.001), whereas MAP level remains continuously unmodified. This PP amplification is significantly associated with presence of proteinuria. Furthermore, increases in plasma creatinine and aortic stiffness are independently and positively correlated (P < 0.001) both in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. All these relationships associating PP, arterial stiffness, and renal function are mainly observed in patients 60 years of age or older. Furthermore, in renal transplant patients and their donors, subjects have been recruited for evaluations of arterial stiffness and posttransplant decline in GFR. Determinants of GFR decline were evaluated 1 and 9 years after transplantation. The first year GFR decline was related to smoking and acute rejection, whereas the later was significantly and exclusively associated with donor age and aortic stiffness. Thus, in hypertensive humans, the observed association between PP and GFR suggests that the 2 parameters are substantially mediated by arterial stiffness, not exclusively by vascular resistance.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, BP targets, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate immediate antihypertensive drug treatment in most patients with CKD independently of the CKD stage if SBP is ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP is ≥ 90 mmHg.

### The effect of a lower target blood pressure on the progression of kidney disease: long-term follow-up of the modification of diet in renal disease study [^115FvR8H]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease. The optimal blood pressure to slow progression is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of a low target blood pressure on kidney failure and all-cause mortality.

Design

Long-term follow-up of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study, a randomized, controlled trial conducted from 1989 to 1993.

Setting

15 outpatient nephrology practices.

Participants

840 persons with predominantly nondiabetic kidney disease and a glomerular filtration rate of 13 to 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2.

Intervention

A low target blood pressure (mean arterial pressure < 92 mm Hg) or a usual target blood pressure (mean arterial pressure < 107 mm Hg).

Measurements

After the randomized trial was completed, kidney failure (defined as initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation) and a composite outcome of kidney failure or all-cause mortality were ascertained through 31 December 2000.

Results

Kidney failure occurred in 554 participants (66%), and the composite outcome occurred in 624 participants (74%). After Cox proportional hazards modeling and intention-to-treat analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.68 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82; P < 0.001) for kidney failure and 0.77 (CI, 0.65 to 0.91; P = 0.0024) for the composite outcome in the low target blood pressure group compared with the usual target blood pressure group. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that the benefit of a low target blood pressure differed according to the cause of kidney disease, baseline glomerular filtration rate, or degree of proteinuria.

Limitations

The exact mechanism underlying the benefit of a low target blood pressure is unknown.

Conclusions

Assignment to a low target blood pressure slowed the progression of nondiabetic kidney disease in patients with a moderately to severely decreased glomerular filtration rate.

### Strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat kidney disease related to systemic arterial hypertension: a narrative review from the Mexican group of experts on arterial hypertension [^112SD7X3]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Section 4: strategies to achieve BP Targets in patients living with CKD

In patients living with CKD, systemic arterial hypertension prevalence increases with KD progression, reaching 90% prevalence in patients classified with CKD stage 5. The key mechanisms related to systemic arterial hypertension in patients living with CKD include volume overload, sympathetic hyperactivity, salt retention, endothelial dysfunction, and alterations in BP-regulating hormone systems. Moreover, in kidney transplant recipients, systemic arterial hypertension etiology is multifactorial, depending on the recipient and donor characteristics and transplant-specific causes (e.g. immunosuppressive medications, allograft dysfunction, and surgical complications like transplant artery stenosis). High BP is an independent risk factor for CVD morbidity-mortality and adverse KD outcomes, making BP control a crucial goal for adequate clinical management. However, optimal BP goals in hypertensive CKD patients, specifically kidney transplant recipients, remain controversial.

Question 4.1: what are the risks/benefits of key-strategies in patients living with CKD who survive stage 3 KDIGO?

Target BP in patients with CKD without dialysis

The ideal BP targets in patients with CKD without dialysis vary widely across systemic arterial hypertension guidelines. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommends a BP target of < 130/80 mmHg for stage 5 CKD patients. This goes in line with threshold recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH), which also suggest a BP target < 130–139 mmHg for the same population. Conversely, the updated National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend a BP target of < 140/90 mmHg for patients with ACR < 70 mmol/mol and systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mmHg and BP < 130/80 mmHg (considering lower SBP of 120 mmHg) for those with CKD and ACR > 70 mmol/mol.

Blood pressure treatment intensity — effects on kidney outcomes and adverse events — is summarized as follows: "Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews support more intensive BP treatment to reduce cardiovascular events but do not demonstrate a reduction in the rate of progression of kidney disease". Intensive treatment "may result in a modest reduction in glomerular filtration rate… and may be reversible", and "Electrolyte abnormalities are also more likely during intensive BP treatment".

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116vyvd4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Taking these largely indirect findings together and considering that, at least after development of proteinuria, progression of kidney injury tends to follow the same course in different situations, the 2023 ESH Guidelines suggest that: (i) the BP target for proteinuric nondiabetic CKD applies to patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease as well and (ii) for both patient categories, a target SBP of < 130 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg, if well tolerated, can be associated with protection against CKD progression in individuals with an albuminuria > 30 mg/g. A similar target may be associated with a reduction in mortality in most patients with CKD. Particularly in patients with advanced CKD (G4 and G5), careful monitoring of eGFR is recommended as a further functional, but reversible, decline of GFR may occur on a lower BP. Finally, most of the patients with CKD have CV comorbidities that require respective target BP values to be taken into account, and thus these CV comorbidities and not CKD protection may primarily guide the target BP in an individual patient.

However, the 2023 ESH Guidelines acknowledge that these recommendations have a number of limitations: (i) none of the trials comparing different BP targets included patients with diabetes and CKD, thus current evidence cannot be readily extrapolated to this subpopulation; (ii) MDRD and AASK trials randomized participants to different mean BP levels, which cannot be readily extrapolated to SBP and DBP values; (iii) MDRD and AASK trials recruited patient populations of a relatively young age (mean age 51.7 and 54.6 years, respectively), and thus, their findings cannot be readily extrapolated to older patients with CKD; and (iv) even for the long-term observational analyses, the benefits associated with lower BP targets were mainly apparent in individuals with proteinuria.

Overall, as shown in Fig. 2, the guidelines recommend that in all patients with CKD the primary goal is to lower office SBP to < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg (CoR I, LoE A) and that in most CKD patients (young patients, patients with a urine ACR ≥ 300 mg/g, high CV risk patients) office BP may be lowered to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated (CoR II, LoE B). Actively targeting an office SBP target of < 120 mmHg and DBP < 70 mmHg cannot be recommended because of the absence of relevant evidence and the potential to induce harm (CoR III, LoE C).

### Intensive blood-pressure control in hypertensive chronic kidney disease [^116ztrgM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

In observational studies, the relationship between blood pressure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is direct and progressive. The burden of hypertension-related chronic kidney disease and ESRD is especially high among black patients. Yet few trials have tested whether intensive blood-pressure control retards the progression of chronic kidney disease among black patients.

Methods

We randomly assigned 1094 black patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease to receive either intensive or standard blood-pressure control. After completing the trial phase, patients were invited to enroll in a cohort phase in which the blood-pressure target was less than 130/80 mm Hg. The primary clinical outcome in the cohort phase was the progression of chronic kidney disease, which was defined as a doubling of the serum creatinine level, a diagnosis of ESRD, or death. Follow-up ranged from 8.8 to 12.2 years.

Results

During the trial phase, the mean blood pressure was 130/78 mm Hg in the intensive-control group and 141/86 mm Hg in the standard-control group. During the cohort phase, corresponding mean blood pressures were 131/78 mm Hg and 134/78 mm Hg. In both phases, there was no significant between-group difference in the risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio in the intensive-control group, 0.91; P = 0.27). However, the effects differed according to the baseline level of proteinuria (P = 0.02 for interaction), with a potential benefit in patients with a protein-to-creatinine ratio of more than 0.22 (hazard ratio, 0.73; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

In overall analyses, intensive blood-pressure control had no effect on kidney disease progression. However, there may be differential effects of intensive blood-pressure control in patients with and those without baseline proteinuria.

### A high mean arterial pressure target is associated with improved microcirculation in septic shock patients with previous hypertension: a prospective open label study [^114ka8A9]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock is a major cause of death in critically ill patients and is characterized by hypotension and hypoperfusion. Although mortality has been reported to be decreased due to the progress in therapy for septic shock, microcirculation abnormalities can still be present and contribute to hypoperfusion. Microvascular dysfunction is associated with organ dysfunction and mortality; moreover, early improvement in the microcirculation during resuscitation is associated with reduced organ failure. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the microcirculation are warranted to mitigate hypoperfusion and organ failure.

Maintaining sufficient perfusion pressure might be an important way to improve the microcirculatory perfusion. As one of the key determinants of perfusion pressure, adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) might reduce hypoperfusion and organ failure. Correa and colleagues have evaluated the effects of different MAP targets in septic pigs, and show that targeting a MAP between 50 and 60 mmHg in septic shock is associated with increased incidence of acute kidney injury when compared with a target MAP of between 75 and 85 mmHg. Moreover, Badin and colleagues have reported that acute kidney injury is decreased with a MAP of at least 72 mmHg. However, which MAP levels should be targeted to improve microcirculation remains controversial.

The optimal MAP target in septic shock patients, especially in patients with previous hypertension, is still unknown. The guidelines for treating septic shock have recommended that MAP should be maintained at a level of at least 65 mmHg, and emphasized a higher blood pressure for patients with previous hypertension. A recent published randomized controlled study has shown no difference in mortality in septic shock patients undergoing resuscitation with a high MAP target or a low MAP target. However, among chronic hypertensive patients, those in the high-target group require less renal replacement therapy, indicating that septic shock patients with chronic hypertension might need higher MAP to maintain microcirculation.

Our goal was to assess the effect on the microcirculation of MAP titration to normal levels in septic shock patients with previous hypertension. We hypothesized that the increase in MAP from 65 mmHg to the normal levels of patients is associated with improved sublingual microcirculation.

### Balloon angioplasty or medical therapy for hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112hWb82]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The optimal treatment for hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the effects of balloon angioplasty and medical therapy in these patients.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and reference lists. Authors of published trials were contacted.

Results

We identified three trials involving a total of 210 patients with moderate-to-severe (≥ 50%) unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension who were followed for at least 3 months after intervention. Balloon angioplasty was significantly more effective in reducing blood pressure than was medical therapy; the weighted mean difference between the two treatments was -7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]: -12 to -1 mm Hg) for systolic blood pressure and -3 mm Hg (95% CI: -6 to -1 mm Hg) for diastolic blood pressure. There was no consistent difference in changes in renal function. Patients treated with balloon angioplasty were more likely to have patent renal arteries after 12 months (52% vs. 19%; odds ratio [OR] = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.8 to 9.8), used fewer antihypertensive medications, and appeared to have fewer major cardiovascular and renovascular complications (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.23; P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Balloon angioplasty has a modest but significant effect on blood pressure and should be considered for patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension. There is no evidence supporting its use in improving or preserving renal function, although none of the trials were designed to address this issue.

### Elucidating the complex interplay between chronic kidney disease and hypertension [^116rkm6x]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension share a complex relationship, each exacerbating the progression of the other. CKD contributes to hypertension by decreasing renal function, leading to fluid retention and increased plasma volume, whereas hypertension exacerbates CKD by increasing glomerular pressure and causing renal damage. This review examines the intertwined nature of CKD and hypertension, exploring the factors driving hypertension in CKD and how hypertension accelerates CKD progression. It discusses the role of the renin-angiotensin system and inflammatory cytokines in this relationship, as well as the potential of blood pressure management to slow renal decline. While studies suggest that meticulous blood pressure control can help attenuate CKD progression, optimal management strategies remain unclear and require further investigation. This review also evaluates the evidence surrounding strict antihypertensive therapy in patients with CKD, considering both diabetic and non-diabetic cases. It recommends blood pressure targets based on CKD stage and presence of diabetes, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment approaches. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are highlighted as a key pharmacological intervention due to their renal protective effects, particularly in patients with CKD with proteinuria. However, evidence regarding their efficacy in patients with CKD but without proteinuria is inconclusive. This review underscores the need for comprehensive approaches to effectively address the intertwined nature of CKD and hypertension and calls for further research to optimize clinical management strategies in this complex interplay.

### Gender, blood pressure, and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in adults with hypertension from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial [^115CfSp7]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To determine if the effects of intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure (goal of less than 120mmHg) versus standard lowering (goal of less than 140mmHg) upon cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes differed by gender.

Methods

Nine thousand three hundred and sixty-one men and women aged 50 years or older with systolic blood pressure of 130mmHg or greater, taking 0–4 antihypertensive medications, and with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but free of diabetes, were randomly assigned to either a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120mmHg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140mmHg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome encompassed incident myocardial infarction, heart failure, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, or cardiovascular-related death. All-cause mortality, renal outcomes, and serious adverse events were also assessed.

Results

Compared with the standard treatment group, the primary composite outcome in the intensive treatment group was reduced by 16% [hazard ratio 0.84 (0.61–1.13)] in women, and by 27% in men [hazard ratio 0.73 (0.59–0.89), P value for interaction between treatment and gender is 0.45]. Similarly, the effect of the intensive treatment on individual components of the primary composite outcome, renal outcomes, and overall serious adverse events was not significantly different according to gender.

Conclusion

In adults with hypertension but not with diabetes, treatment to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120mmHg, compared with a goal of less than 140mmHg, resulted in no heterogeneity of effect between men and women on cardiovascular or renal outcomes, or on rates of serious adverse events.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^115kLDnV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Phrmacodynamics

Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .)

In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours.

In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy.

At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing.

The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure.

In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.

In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see PRECAUTIONS).

Hydrochlorothiazide

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.

After oral use diuresis begins within two hours, peaks in about four hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.

### Intensive systolic blood pressure reduction and kidney and cardiovascular outcomes: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114JidcJ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the reduction of systolic blood pressure associated with kidney injury and cardiovascular diseases?

Findings

This secondary analysis of 7562 China Rural Hypertension Control Project participants with estimated glomerular filtration rates between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 found no significant difference in kidney outcomes between the intervention and usual care groups. However, the intervention group had a significantly lower rate of composite cardiovascular diseases compared with the usual care group.

Meaning

These findings suggest that intensive blood pressure control reduced the incidence of composite cardiovascular disease without increasing the risk of kidney injury in patients without chronic kidney disease.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Is It time to abandon the kidney-centered view on the origin of primary hypertension? [^1136xsDA]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Stiff Large Arteries

Almost by definition, large arteries are at the base of hypertension, given that BP measurement is performed at this level. From a hemodynamic point of view, BP can be considered as pressure fluctuations (pulse pressure) around a certain BP level (mean arterial pressure), with mean arterial pressure determined by cardiac output and peripheral resistance (ie, the sum of small arteries and microcirculation), and pulse pressure determined by stroke volume (cardiac function) and large artery stiffness (LAS), subsequently changing wave reflections. LAS is assessed as pulse wave velocity, typically along the carotid-femoral or brachial-ankle pathway.

While increased LAS has been viewed traditionally as a consequence of elevated BP over a longer time period, recent evidence clarified that increased LAS is also a precursor of hypertension, creating a vicious cycle. Specifically, various longitudinal studies, – starting at ages from 17.7 to 62.4 years, consistently showed that pulse wave velocity measured at baseline is a significant predictor of BP 2.2 to 7 years later, whereas the opposite — that is, BP at baseline predicting arterial stiffness at the follow-up investigation — is not always the case. Along the same lines, isolated systolic hypertension, traditionally considered the main hypertension phenotype in elderly individuals due to increased LAS, can be present in young people, with increased LAS as a major contributor as well.

Rather than viewing large artery function in isolation, it is increasingly evident that large and small arteries, along with the microcirculation, are intricately interconnected, forming a detrimental feedback loop in hypertension. Increased LAS increases pulse pressure, wave reflections, and the transmission of pulsatile energy into small arteries and the microcirculation. These phenomena disproportionately affect high-flow, low-impedance organs, such as the brain and kidneys, leading to subclinical damage, functional impairment, and eventually clinical complications. – Impaired renal function and uremia drive metabolic, inflammatory, and endocrine changes, including those related to chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disease. These changes promote the progression of LAS, perpetuating the vicious cycle. Furthermore, the heart is particularly vulnerable to increased LAS due to associated changes in pulsatile afterload, the timing of wave reflections, and diastolic perfusion. These alterations can lead to clinical consequences such as heart failure and ischemia. This interplay highlights the systemic impact of LAS and the complex interdependence between BP-mediated vascular, cardiac, and renal health.

### Effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on renal and systemic inflammation and blood pressure: a 12-month prospective study [^113VBvEw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bariatric surgery improves arterial hypertension and renal function; however, the underlying mechanisms and effect of different surgical procedures are unknown. In the present prospective study, we compared the 12-month follow-up results after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on weight loss, hypertension, renal function, and inflammatory status.

Methods

A total of 34 morbidly obese patients were investigated before, one and 12 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 10), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (n = 13), and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n = 11) for hypertension, kidney function, urinary and serum cytokine levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and chemokine ligand-18.

Results

At 12 months after surgery, the patients in all 3 treatment arms showed a significant decrease in the mean body mass index, mean arterial pressure, and urinary and serum inflammatory markers (all P < .001). The reduction in urinary and serum cytokine levels correlated directly with body weight loss (P < .05). Patients with impaired renal function at baseline (corresponding to serum cystatin C > .8 mg/L) had a marked improvement in renal function 12 months after surgery (P < .05).

Conclusion

Surgically induced weight loss is associated with a marked decrease in renal and systemic inflammation and arterial hypertension and improvement in renal function in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. These effects appear to be independent of surgical procedure. The improvement in renal inflammation could be 1 of the mechanisms contributing to the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on arterial blood pressure, proteinuria, and renal function.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in people with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events. Thereby, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

Objectives

Primary: to compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Secondary: to assess the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (130/80 mmHg or lower) to standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or lower). Participants were adults with CKD and elevated blood pressure documented in a standard way on at least two occasions, or already receiving treatment for elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our critical outcomes were: total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Important outcomes were: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects, and number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level or at least a 50% reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the end of the study. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the critical outcomes. This review received no funding.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that contributed data for meta-analysis, involving 7348 participants overall (range 840 to 4733 people per study). The mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range 1.0 to 8.0 years). Three studies were publicly funded, two were privately funded, and one had both public and private funding. All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies blinded participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure target. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all studies. Critical outcomes. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets likely result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.06; 6 studies, 7348 participants), total serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 7348 participants), and total cardiovascular events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; 5 studies, 6508 participants), all with moderate-certainty evidence. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 6 studies, 7348 participants) and progression to end-stage renal disease (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 4 studies, 4788 participants), both with low-certainty evidence. Important outcomes. We found little to no differences in: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects; and the number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level, or at least a 50% reduction in GFR at the end of the study. Exploratory outcomes. Compared to the standard blood pressure target groups, participants in the lower target groups achieved lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure values after one year, and required a higher number of antihypertensive drugs at the end of the studies. A higher proportion of participants in the standard blood pressure target groups achieved the targets they were assigned than did participants in the intensive target groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to a standard blood pressure target, lower blood pressure targets probably result in little to no difference in total mortality, total serious adverse events, and total cardiovascular events, and may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or in the progression to end-stage renal disease in people with hypertension and CKD. However, the evidence underpinning these conclusions has several limitations. All studies were open design, blood pressure measurement was performed at a medical office, and there was scant information about adverse events. Future research should include high-quality adverse event data, report results for people with different levels of proteinuria, and consider out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Several studies are ongoing, and may provide new evidence for this topic in the near future.

### Association of blood pressure with decline in renal function and time until the start of renal replacement therapy in pre-dialysis patients: a cohort study [^111oTykt]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

What could be an explanation for the found association of hypertension with an accelerated decline in renal function and an earlier start of RRT? Endothelial dysfunction is a pathological consequence of hypertension leading to vessel damage, causing atherosclerosis, and subsequently arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness in turn can lead to an increased afterload, left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced coronary perfusion, congestive heart failure, and altered or reduced blood supply to tissues including the kidney. In pre-dialysis patients, arterial stiffness can lead to glomerular hypertension and thereby increased glomerular permeability and excessive filtration of proteins. Protein ultrafiltrates are toxic to the proximal tubules, resulting in tubular damage and scarring. Glomerular hypertension and increased ultrafiltration of proteins contribute to the progression of chronic renal damage and thereby renal function. It is also possible that blood pressure increases as the result of an accelerated decline in renal function, resulting in a vicious circle between blood pressure increase and decline in renal function. In our cohort, arterial stiffness seems a plausible explanation because with increasing pulse pressure, which is a marker for arterial stiffness, decline in renal function accelerated and time until the start of RRT decreased (data not shown).

### Strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat kidney disease related to systemic arterial hypertension: a narrative review from the Mexican group of experts on arterial hypertension [^114UYxW5]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2021 KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for BP management in CKD recommends treating patients not receiving RRT using an SBP threshold of < 120 mmHg. This strategy is primarily based on the SPRINT study subgroup analysis of CKD patients, which demonstrated a 25% risk reduction in major adverse CVD events using this threshold. However, for patients with eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73m 2, no reduction in CVD risk was observed with these SBP targets, although reductions in all-cause mortality and mild cognitive impairment were observed. Nevertheless, it has been further questioned whether an SBP target < 120 mmHg is the ideal threshold as it has been associated with increased risks of adverse outcomes, including hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure. A sub-analysis of the ACCORD trial compared intensive SBP control (SBP < 120 mmHg) with standard control (SBP < 140 mmHg) in patients living with diabetes and found no overall benefit of intensive BP control, except for a reduced risk of non-fatal stroke. Recently, three systematic reviews and meta-analyses examined the benefits of intensive BP control in patients living with CKD. The first meta-analysis performed by Tsai et al. found no additional benefit of intensive BP control compared to standard control on KD outcomes. Conversely, a second meta-analysis showed that intensive BP reduction was associated with significantly lower mortality risk compared to less intensive BP control. The last meta-analysis found no differences in death, cardiovascular death, or heart failure when comparing various SBP targets. However, lower BP targets were associated with higher adverse effects at follow-up. Based on this evidence, we suggest that patients living with CKD without dialysis should have SBP targets of < 130 mmHg, as this threshold could lead to an optimal balance between efficacy and safety.

Comorbidities

Hypertension

For patients with CKD and hypertension, clinical practice guidelines recommend intensive BP control goal of < 130/80 mm Hg in most patients and < 120/80 mm Hg for high-risk individuals. For the general population, intensive hypertension control has been shown to have cardiovascular and mortality benefits in large, randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analysis. Application to CKD patients was initially conflicting, as many trials did not include significant kidney disease. Subgroup analysis of the SPRINT trial suggested that there may be increased CKD incidence with intensive BP control. Meta-analysis data suggests that intensive BP control may prevent progression of kidney disease in those with proteinuric CKD. Cardiovascular and mortality benefits seen in SPRINT and meta-analysis data rather than kidney-specific protection are the primary benefits for CKD patients with intensive BP targets.

Measuring blood pressure is a routine procedure in outpatient and inpatient practice that is often performed inaccurately. In an office setting, blood pressure should be measured with an appropriate fitting cuff on a patient's bare upper arm rested at the level of the heart after at least five minutes of rest. Other accepted forms of measurement include 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), which provide more accurate representation of the patient's blood pressure outside of an office environment. Particularly when targeting systolic blood pressure in the range of 110 to 130 mm Hg, assessing blood pressure outside of the clinic to provide additional datapoints in between visits using a validated and calibrated HBPM or when available in select cases ABPM is important for monitoring and safety.

Diabetes Mellitus

For patients with diabetes and CKD, tight glycemic control alone has been shown to prevent the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Hemoglobin-A1c targets of < 7% are generally accepted as goal for reducing microvascular complications. This benefit must be outweighed by the potential for increased adverse events associated with intensive control.

Pharmacotherapy

GFR adjustments

As many as 50% of all FDA approved medications are renally excreted, and alterations in excretion may lead to systemic toxicities. For patients with CKD, medication regimens should be evaluated and dosed appropriately according to the patient's eGFR. The level of kidney function should guide prescription practice including avoidance or dose adjustment of medications.

### Kidney outcomes following sacubitril / valsartan for thrombotic microangiopathy… [^11596JZr]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eFigure 1. Standardized Mean Difference of Baseline Covariate Adjustment in the Propensity-Score Matched Analysis eFigure
2. Representative Light Electron Microscopic and Immunofluorescence Findings of Malignant Hypertension–Associated TMA eFigure 3. Cumulative Risk of Primary Outcome of Kidney Function Recovery in Patients Receiving Sacubitril/Valsartan or ACEI/ARBs in the Overall Comparison and Propensity Score–Matched Comparison Based on Sensitivity Analysis. Malignant hypertension remains a life-threatening crisis of severe accelerated hypertension that can rapidly progress to end-stage kidney disease. 1 Thrombotic microangiopathy, a pathological lesion triggered by endothelial injury and/or dysfunction, is one of the most classic and severe complications of mHTN.

The diagnosis of mHTN was based on the detection of a marked elevation of systolic BP levels of 180 mm Hg or greater and/or diastolic BP levels 120 mm Hg or greater, accompanied by grade III or IV hypertensive retinopathy according to the Keith. Timmermans et al17 found that complement activation was present in 6 of 9 patients with TMA attributed to severe hypertension. Our immunofluorescence results were consistent with kidney histology staining for complement components in previous studies. 17, 22, 23 Endothelial dysfunction is a major contributor to the development of mHTN-associated TMA. Severe and rapidly progressive hypertension damages the endothelial lining of small blood vessels, 24 leading to the stimulated release of vasoconstrictive substances and RAAS activation.

25 In response to the cascade of events, increased renin production yields higher levels of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor that stimulates endothelin-1 production and promotes inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. 26 This rapid activation process creates a self-perpetuating cycle that exacerbates kidney and vascular lesions in other organs. Our study focused on the kidney outcomes of sacubitril/valsartan therapy in mHTN-associated TMA, a unique subgroup of patients with severe hypertension and renal histopathology showing endothelial dysfunction and microvascular thrombosis. Furthermore, our study focused on kidney recovery, due to initially poor kidney function on admission in these patients, which may differ in terms of the outcomes of worsening kidney function or a decrease in eGFR from the previously mentioned studies.

Initiation of blood pressure-lowering treatment by hypertension grade — it is recommended that in patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension, BP-lowering drug treatment should be initiated alongside lifestyle interventions; in patients with grade 1 hypertension at high risk or with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), drug treatment should also be initiated simultaneously with lifestyle interventions; in lower-risk grade 1 hypertension, drug treatment should be initiated after 3–6 months if BP is not controlled by lifestyle interventions alone; figure-based thresholds/actions include grade 1 hypertension BP 140–159/90–99 mmHg with immediate drug treatment in high or very high risk patients with CVD, renal disease or HMOD and drug treatment in low moderate risk patients without CVD, renal disease or HMOD after 3–6 months of lifestyle intervention if BP not controlled, grade 2 hypertension BP 160–179/100–109 mmHg with immediate drug treatment in all patients and aim for BP control within 3 months, and grade 3 hypertension BP ≥ 180/110 mmHg with immediate drug treatment in all patients and aim for BP control within 3 months.

### Blood pressure and decline in kidney function: findings from the systolic hypertension in the elderly program (SHEP) [^112RgkSj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

The association between BP and decline in kidney function in older persons and the BP component most responsible for kidney disease are unknown. This study investigated the relationship between baseline BP and an incident decline in kidney function among 2181 men and women enrolled in the placebo arm of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). A decline in kidney function was defined as an increase in serum creatinine equal to or greater than 0.4 mg/dl over 5 yr of follow-up. The incidence and relative risk of a decline in kidney function increased at higher levels of BP for all BP components, independent of age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, diabetes, and history of cardiovascular disease. Systolic BP imparted the highest risk of decline in kidney function. The adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) associated with the highest compared with the lowest quartile of BP was 2.44 (1.67 to 3.56) for systolic; 1.29 (0.87 to 1.91) for diastolic; 1.80 (1.21 to 2.66) for pulse; and 2.03 (1.39 to 2.94) for mean arterial pressure. The risk associated with systolic BP remained strong in models containing other BP components, while diastolic, pulse, and mean arterial pressure had no significant association with a decline in kidney function in models containing systolic BP. Therefore, systolic BP is a strong, independent predictor of a decline in kidney function among older persons with isolated systolic hypertension.

### Blood pressure lowering and major cardiovascular events in people with and without chronic kidney disease: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111rv7Dk]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease

There was no clear benefit for more intensive compared with less intensive blood pressure lowering regimens in people with chronic kidney disease, although there was only limited power for these analyses and little capacity to detect whether the effects of treatment varied according to kidney function; lower blood pressure targets have, nonetheless, been suggested to improve renal outcomes in people with proteinuric chronic kidney disease, providing some support for the earlier recommendation that blood pressure be lowered more intensively in these high risk patients. The effects of more intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular outcomes in people with kidney disease remains to be demonstrated by future trials, such as the ongoing Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT, NCT01206062).

### Arterial stiffness as a risk factor for clinical hypertension [^111NYs4D]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

In patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension, cardiac output remains within normal ranges and intravascular volume is normal or low, assuming the presence of a sufficient Windkessel effect and usual resistance and compliance calculations. However, mean circulatory pressure is elevated in these patients. In addition, vascular resistance is augmented, and most importantly, the viscoelasticity of the cardiovascular system is substantially impaired. Such considerations are essential to understanding the mechanisms behind carotid-femoral arterial stiffness, a major risk factor in individuals with hypertension. Arterial stiffness, measured from pulse wave velocity, is substantially increased in hypertension even independently of blood pressure levels. Structural vascular changes and endothelial dysfunction are consistently associated with vessel impairments in animal models of hypertension. Increased arterial stiffness has a major effect on pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure), wave reflections, kidney function, and above all, cardiovascular risk. This increased cardiovascular risk is particularly deleterious in patients with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at risk of both renal and cardiovascular events. In this Review, we discuss the importance of arterial stiffness in the diagnosis and management of hypertension and the need for new approaches for the treatment of hypertension in patients with or without diabetes and/or renal impairment.
