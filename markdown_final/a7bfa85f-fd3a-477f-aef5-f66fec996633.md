## Question

How would you describe functional limitations caused by scoliosis and degenerative disc disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to describe the functional limitations caused by scoliosis and degenerative disc disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathology and biomechanical cascade underlying scoliosis and degenerative disc disease. Then, I should categorize the major functional domains affected and link them to the pathophysiology. Next, I will analyze condition-specific patterns across degenerative disc disease, degenerative scoliosis, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. After that, I should validate these limitations with patient-reported outcome measures and their psychometrics. Then, I need to consider age-stratified differences in drivers of disability and treatment decisions. Next, I will quantify treatment effects, including trade-offs and adverse events. Finally, I will synthesize the overall functional limitation profile and key quantifiers to conclude pragmatically.

> Let me first confirm the core pathology and its biomechanical cascade so I do not anchor incorrectly on symptoms alone; scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity with coronal curvature, sagittal malalignment, and axial rotation, while degenerative disc disease involves progressive disk desiccation, height loss, and segmental instability that alter load distribution and motion coupling, creating a degenerative loop of instability and deformity over time.

> I will now examine spinal mobility impairments because function often starts with motion loss; higher lumbar Pfirrmann grades correlate with reduced lumbar flexion-extension and rotation, with compensatory increases in thoracic sagittal motion, particularly in older adults and those with chronic low back pain, which suggests a proximal compensation that may itself have consequences over time [^114aVYTd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pain sources; progressive axial back pain, radiculopathy, and neurogenic claudication are frequent in degenerative scoliosis, but the exact coupling between curve side and pain side is uncertain and prior speculation about convex vs concave pain generators lacks robust evidence, so I should present mechanisms like foraminal stenosis and facet arthropathy as plausible contributors while acknowledging uncertainty [^112uaAxS] [^112Ac8wZ].

> Wait, I should verify neurological deficits and not conflate baseline disease burden with postoperative risk; adults with spinal deformity can present with radiculopathy and even myelopathy, yet after complex deformity surgery, over 20% had new lower extremity motor score declines at discharge and about 10% persisted at two years, which underscores both the baseline neural vulnerability and the iatrogenic risk that can affect function and recovery trajectories [^117SRABE] [^114dmLP8].

> Next, I should review balance, proprioception, and stability because they mediate safe mobility; adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis demonstrate reduced hip range of motion, impaired hip joint position sense, decreased lumbopelvic stability on single-leg squat, and balance deficits on Y-balance testing, indicating kinetic chain disruption and neuromuscular control alterations even when overt disability seems modest [^1155zoPY].

> I need to check how these impairments translate into activities of daily living and instrumental activities; in older adults, lower physical activity predicts slower progression of functional limitations, which in turn delays ADL/IADL disability, and globally nearly half of older adults exhibit IADL limitations, suggesting a large reservoir of potentially modifiable function that spinal conditions can accelerate toward dependency [^notfound].

> Let me consider health-related quality of life burden to contextualize severity; symptomatic adult spinal deformity patients have SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores about one standard deviation below U.S. norms, with worse scores in lumbar scoliosis and increasing sagittal malalignment, and although SRS-22r domains vary in responsiveness, self-image and function often change more than pain, which should temper expectations when counseling [^113SBJCE] [^117M1ptp].

> I will now examine condition-specific patterns, being careful to differentiate overlapping phenotypes; degenerative disc disease predominantly restricts segmental motion with pain-provoked avoidance and age-exacerbated stiffness, sometimes with compensatory thoracic hypermobility, whereas degenerative scoliosis layers asymmetric loading, foraminal stenosis, and progressive sagittal imbalance that strongly correlates with disability, and unilateral symptoms do not consistently couple to curve direction, while adolescent idiopathic scoliosis shows notable hip-spine balance and proprioceptive deficits with relatively lower baseline disability despite measurable impairments [^114aVYTd] [^112uaAxS] [^112yPpEe] [^113SBJCE] [^1155zoPY].

> Next, I should review PROMs and their interpretability so I can quantify change meaningfully; the Oswestry Disability Index is recommended for lumbar degenerative conditions including fusion outcomes, with established MCIDs, while the SRS-22r has validated domain structure and good responsiveness in adult deformity, and the Lumbar Stiffness Disability Index captures stiffness-specific functional limits, which is crucial when fusion trades pain relief for reduced motion [^11385PBQ] [^116zK6gZ] [^113UM6cy] [^1166gsdK].

> Hold on, I should verify MCID thresholds in the specific populations studied because applying the wrong anchor can mislead; in de novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis after long-segment fusion, anchor-based MCIDs were approximately 18.9 for ODI and 0.5 to 0.8 across SRS-22r domains, and methodologic work shows that minimum detectable differences vary with age and baseline disability, reinforcing the need to contextualize observed changes against measurement noise [^112ufTDj] [^1126ADS8].

> Now, I need to consider age-stratified differences in drivers of treatment and disability, but wait, let me first confirm the directionality so I do not misstate it; initially I thought younger patients were more pain-disability driven and older patients more deformity-driven, but the referenced multicenter analysis actually concluded the opposite, namely that pain and disability tend to determine treatment modality for older adults, while deformity magnitude more strongly guides treatment in younger adults, with worsening sagittal imbalance across age strata contributing to disability in both groups [^111Y5hG6].

> I should double-check nonoperative interventions because they set the baseline for shared decision-making; guidelines for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis do not support or refute standalone physical therapy due to insufficient evidence, whereas core-based exercise in scoliosis shows small improvements in Cobb angle and SRS-22 scores without serious adverse events, though the evidence quality is low and effect sizes are modest, so expectations must remain measured [^113x8cM9] [^116T4nPR] [^111Q26np].

> Let me review surgical impact and trade-offs, and I need to ensure I separate short-term benefits from longer-term durability; at two years, operative treatment for adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis yields greater improvements in ODI and SRS-22 compared with nonoperative care, and at five years these advantages persist, yet serious adverse events are common and dampen gains, and fusion-related stiffness can limit certain ADLs even as pain improves, especially with multilevel constructs [^114V6omZ] [^112StdvG] [^1169w8Rp] [^1166gsdK].

> But wait, what about the long arc of disability and comorbidity burden around the spine; adults with symptomatic lumbar scoliosis experience substantial non-spinal orthopedic events over four years, with advancing age and tobacco history increasing risk, which can independently pressure functional trajectories and complicate attribution of disability to the spine alone [^111Pqzwc].

> I should synthesize the overall functional limitation profile to ensure internal consistency; degeneration at the tissue level perturbs load sharing and motion, precipitating pain and neural compression that reshape movement patterns and compensation, ultimately restricting ADLs and lowering HRQOL, with DDD primarily mediating pain-stiffness limitations, degenerative scoliosis amplifying disability via asymmetry and sagittal imbalance, and AIS expressing neuromuscular control and hip-spine coupling deficits with relatively lower symptom-driven disability at baseline, all quantified by PROMs that typically show 0.5 to 1 SD deficits and improve by roughly 10 to 15 ODI points after surgery while accepting stiffness and adverse event trade-offs [^112Ac8wZ] [^112uaAxS] [^113SBJCE] [^112ufTDj] [^112StdvG] [^1166gsdK].

> Finally, I should confirm key quantifiers to anchor clinical decisions; approximately 46% of individuals with disc degeneration report chronic low back pain, adult spinal deformity patients average SF-36 physical scores near 41 versus 50 in the general population, ODI thresholds of 20 or greater are commonly used to define meaningful disability in adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis trials, and each decade of age increases the hazard of non-spinal orthopedic events by roughly 44%, all of which can refine prognosis and counseling [^114aVYTd] [^113SBJCE] [^114V6omZ] [^111Pqzwc].

Scoliosis and degenerative disc disease cause **functional limitations** through pain [^112Ac8wZ], reduced spinal mobility [^114aVYTd], and postural imbalance [^112uaAxS], leading to difficulty with bending, lifting, prolonged standing, and walking. These conditions impair **activities of daily living**, including dressing, bathing, and household tasks [^1155zoPY] [^113SBJCE], and can cause neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, and balance problems [^112uaAxS]. Functional impairment is typically measured with the Oswestry Disability Index, SRS-22, and SF-36 [^11385PBQ], and is strongly correlated with pain severity, spinal alignment, and neurological involvement [^113SBJCE].

---

## Pain and neurological symptoms

Pain is often **chronic** in scoliosis and degenerative disc disease and worsens with activity and prolonged standing or sitting [^112Ac8wZ]. Radicular pain from nerve root compression is also common [^112uaAxS]. Neurological symptoms from nerve root compression include **weakness, numbness, tingling, and balance problems**, further limiting function.

---

## Reduced spinal mobility and flexibility

Spinal stiffness from degenerative disc disease reduces **mobility**, especially in the lumbar region, making bending, twisting, and lifting difficult [^114aVYTd]. Postural imbalance from the abnormal curvature in scoliosis leads to **compensatory mechanisms** that further limit mobility [^112yPpEe].

---

## Impact on activities of daily living (ADLs)

Basic ADLs — such as **dressing, bathing, and personal hygiene** — often become difficult because of pain, stiffness, and limited mobility [^113SBJCE]. Instrumental ADLs — including **household tasks, shopping, and meal preparation** — are commonly impaired, reducing independence and quality of life.

---

## Functional impairment in occupational and recreational activities

Occupational limitations include **reduced work capacity** due to pain, limited mobility, and neurological symptoms, especially in physically demanding jobs. Recreational limitations involve **restricted participation in sports and leisure activities** because of pain and limited mobility [^112Ac8wZ].

---

## Psychological and social impact

Psychological distress from chronic pain and functional limitations can cause **anxiety, depression, and reduced self-esteem** [^113SBJCE]. Social isolation may result from **withdrawal** and **reduced participation** in social activities.

---

## Measurement of functional impairment

Functional impairment is typically assessed using validated **patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)** [^114W56g7]:

| **Outcome measure** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) | Measures disability related to back pain and spinal disorders [^11385PBQ] |
| Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) | Assesses pain, function, self-image, and mental health in scoliosis patients [^113UM6cy] |
| Short Form-36 (SF-36) | General health-related quality of life measure [^11385PBQ] |

---

## Factors influencing severity of functional limitation

Several factors influence the **severity of functional limitations** in scoliosis and degenerative disc disease:

- **Degree of spinal curvature**: Greater curvature correlates with more severe functional impairment [^113SBJCE].

- **Extent of disc degeneration**: More severe degeneration leads to greater pain and mobility limitations [^114aVYTd].

- **Presence of neurological symptoms**: Neurological involvement significantly increases functional impairment [^117SRABE].

- **Patient age and comorbidities**: Older age and additional health conditions exacerbate functional limitations [^116MkSse].

---

## Treatment and management strategies

Management strategies include **non-surgical management** — physical therapy, pain management, and bracing — to reduce pain and improve function [^116e34qm], and **surgical management** — including spinal fusion and decompression surgery — which may improve function and quality of life in severe cases [^112StdvG] [^116qkTPC].

---

Scoliosis and degenerative disc disease cause **significant functional limitations** through pain, reduced mobility, and neurological symptoms, affecting daily activities, work, and social participation. The severity of impairment depends on spinal curvature, disc degeneration, neurological involvement, and patient factors, and is assessed with validated PROMs [^111zToMs].

### Assessing the association between degenerative disc disease and spinal mobility [^114aVYTd]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is commonly associated with chronic low back pain (cLBP) and disability, yet its impact on spinal mobility remains underexplored. This study investigates the association between lumbar disc degeneration and spinal mobility to assess its functional consequences.

In this cross-sectional study, participants were recruited from the general population. Individuals with specific LBP were excluded. Intervertebral disc degeneration was graded using the Pfirrmann classification, and an overall lumbar Pfirrmann grade (PG) was calculated. Uni- and multivariable linear regression models were performed to analyze the relationship between disc degeneration and spinal mobility, accounting for age, sex, BMI, physical activity, and pain intensity, with additional subgroup analysis by sex, cLBP status, and age.

A total of 909 participants (44.1% female) were included in the study; 421 (46.3%) were affected by cLBP. After accounting for confounders, a higher lumbar PG was significantly associated with reduced sagittal lumbar and rotational mobility (p < 0.001) and increased thoracic sagittal mobility (p = 0.005) in males. Subgroup analyses indicated that associations with mobility impairments were more pronounced in individuals with cLBP and older patients.

This study provides evidence linking lumbar disc degeneration to reductions in spinal mobility, particularly in individuals with chronic low back pain. The pronounced mobility loss in cLBP patients suggests that chronic pain may disrupt compensatory mechanisms.

### Spinal decompensation in degenerative lumbar scoliosis [^112uaAxS]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms of degenerative scoliosis most frequently include progressive back pain, radiculopathy, and neurogenic claudication. Aging progressively affects all structures of the spinal units, eventually leading to degenerative instabilities such as spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, and scoliosis. Given these multiple degenerative pathologies, identifying the exact pain source is very difficult. The relationships between scoliotic patterns and patient symptoms are unclear, although speculations on such relationships are frequently made.

Some authors suggest that pain at the convexity is caused by muscle fatigue of the paraspinal muscles, while others claim that it can also be caused by facet joints. Pain at the concavity of the scoliotic curve is thought to be caused by the destruction of facet joints and degenerative changes in disc spaces. Radicular pain at the concavity can arise from narrowed foramina or ruptured discs causing radiculopathy. Additionally, dynamic overstretch of a nerve root could also cause radicular pain at the convex side of the scoliosis. None of these speculations are evidence-based.

The first objective of this study is to assess whether a dominant direction of compensation exists in degenerative scoliosis. The second objective is to investigate whether asymmetric symptoms are related to the curve direction, i.e. whether pain and radicular symptoms in degenerative lumbar scoliosis are predominantly present on one side relative to the curve direction.

### Impact of new motor deficit on HRQOL after adult spinal deformity surgery: Subanalysis from ScoliRisk 1 prospective study [^117SRABE]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

With an aging population and increased awareness, adult spinal deformity (ASD) is a growing diagnosis. ASD arises from multiple etiologies, but most commonly from arthritic spondylosis and iatrogenic causes, leading to asymmetric degeneration of discs, facet joints, and other spinal elements. The sum of these abnormal changes may result in structural coronal and sagittal spinal deformities and often result in nerve root and spinal cord compression. Patients may present with radiculopathy, myelopathy, inability to ambulate, and/or debilitating axial back pain. It has been well-proven that global spinal misalignment is strongly correlated with disability and pain outcomes — greater imbalance is correlated with greater functional disability. Fortunately, the surgical correction and reestablishment of age-appropriate global spinal alignment and spinopelvic parameters can significantly improve patient function, pain, and appearance on multiple outcome scales.

Surgery is warranted for ASD when conservative management fails. Surgical correction of ASD can be technically challenging. Cases of fixed, non-mobile deformities require high-grade osteotomies, such as Grade 3 to 5 (pedicle subtraction osteotomy [PSO] to vertebral body resection [VCR]). While osteotomies are powerful techniques for correction, mechanical realignment of the spine can be associated with significant complications at a relatively high rate compared with degenerative cases. The reported complication rates range from 8% to 59% depending on various factors, such as ASD severity and osteotomy grade.

### Hip-related functional limitations in individuals with idiopathic scoliosis: a controlled trial [^1155zoPY]. European Spine Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Since scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity, it causes some movement limitations in the spine and related joints; however, functional limitations associated with scoliosis-related hip joint involvement are the subject of research.

- **Aims**: This study aims to investigate the physical characteristics and functional limitations associated with idiopathic scoliosis (IS), focusing on the hip joint.

- **Methods**: Demographic characteristics, scoliosis-specific assessments, and hip joint active range of motion (RoM), lumbar mobility (Modified Schober test), lumbopelvic stability (single leg squat test-SLS), hip joint position sense, lower extremity balance (Y-balance test), and lower extremity functionality (lower extremity functional scale-LEFS) were evaluated.

- **Results**: The study included 120 individuals, with 86 in the scoliosis group (mean age: 15.7 ± 3.4 years) and 34 in the control group (mean age: 16.1 ± 4.8 years). The scoliosis group exhibited limited RoM of the hip joint in flexion, extension, right abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and left external rotation compared to controls (p < 0.001). Lumbar mobility was decreased (p < 0.001). In the joint position sense test, the mean difference for right flexion was and for left flexion. There were bilateral decreased SLS test performances (p < 0.001) and Y-balance test performance (p < 0.05) in individuals with IS. LEFS scores were statistically different but not clinically different between groups (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Individuals with IS show decreased hip mobility, lumbopelvic stability, hip joint position sense, and balance compared to controls.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Part 2: Assessment of functional outcome following lumbar fusion [^11385PBQ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Assessment of functional patient-reported outcomes following lumbar spinal fusion continues to be essential for comparing the effectiveness of different treatments for patients presenting with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. When assessing functional outcomes in patients being treated with lumbar spinal fusion, a reliable, valid, and responsive outcomes instrument, such as the Oswestry Disability Index, should be used. The SF-36 and the SF-12 have emerged as dominant measures of general health-related quality of life. Research has established the minimum clinically important difference for major functional outcomes measures; this should be considered when assessing clinical outcomes. The results of recent studies suggest that a patient's pretreatment psychological state is a major independent variable affecting the ability to detect change in functional outcomes.

### Physical activity, functional limitations, and disability in older adults [^116MkSse]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2000). Low credibility.

To explore initially how low levels of physical activity influence lower body functional limitations in participants of the Longitudinal Study of Aging, changes in functional limitations are subsequently used to predict transitions in the activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL) disability. This investigates a potential pathway for how physical activity may delay the onset of ADL/IADL disability and thus prolong independent living.

- **Design**: Analysis of a complex sample survey of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 70 years and older in 1984, with repeated interviews in 1986, 1988, and 1990.

- **Setting and participants**: Analyses concentrated on 5,151 men and women targeted for interview at all four LSOA interviews.

- **Measurements**: Characteristics used in analyses include gender, age, level of physical activity, comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, and atherosclerotic heart disease, levels of functional limitations, and ADL/IADL disability.

- **Results**: Transitional models provide evidence that older adults who have varying levels of disability and who report at least a minimal level of physical activity experience a slower progression in functional limitations (OR = .45, P < .001 for severe vs. less severe limitations). This low level of physical activity, through its influence on changes in functional limitations, is shown to slow the progression of ADL/IADL disability.

- **Conclusions**: Results from analyses provide supporting evidence that functional limitations can mediate the effect of physical activity levels on disability progression.

### How do validated measures of functional outcome compare with commonly used outcomes in administrative database research for lumbar spinal surgery [^114B1UJh]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical interpretation of health services research based on administrative databases is limited by the lack of patient-reported functional outcome measures. Reoperation, as a surrogate measure for poor outcome, may be biased by patient and surgeon preferences and may even be planned a priori. Other available administrative data outcomes, such as postoperative cross-sectional imaging (PCSI), may better reflect changes in functional outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine if postoperative events captured from administrative databases, namely reoperation and PCSI, reflect outcomes as derived by validated functional outcome measures, such as short form 36 scores and the Oswestry disability index, for patients who underwent discretionary surgery for specific degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine. These conditions included disc herniation, spinal stenosis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and isthmic spondylolisthesis.

After reviewing the records of all patients surgically treated for these conditions at our institution, we recorded the occurrence of PCSI (MRI or CT-myelograms) and reoperations, as well as demographic, surgical, and functional outcome data. We determined how early (within 6 months) and intermediate (within 18 months) term events (PCSI and reoperations) were associated with changes in intermediate (minimum 1 year) and late (minimum 2 years) term functional outcome, respectively. We further evaluated how early (6–12 months) and intermediate (12–24 months) term changes in functional outcome were associated with…

### Identification of scoliosis research society-22r health-related quality of life questionnaire domains using factor analysis methodology [^116zK6gZ]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional mail questionnaire.

- **Objective**: Examination of the underlying construct validity of the Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r) Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Questionnaire using factor analysis.

- **Summary of background data**: The original SRS-24 HRQoL questionnaire has undergone a series of modifications to further improve its psychometric properties and validate its use in patients from 10 years of age until well into adulthood. The SRS-22r questionnaire is the result of this effort. At the time of writing, the underlying construct validity of the original English version has not been analyzed by factor analysis.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire including all questions from the SRS-24, -23, -22, and -22r questionnaires (49 total questions) was mailed to a consecutive series of 235 patients who had received primary posterior or anterior instrumentation and arthrodesis. The domain structure of the SRS-22r questions was analyzed using iterated principal factor analysis with orthogonal rotation.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-one (51%) of the patients, age 23.34 ± 4.52 years (range, 14.16–34.57 years), returned the questionnaire at 8.63 ± 4.00 years (range, 2.32–15.94 years) following surgery. Factor analysis using all 22 questions resulted in 3 factors with many shared items due to significant collinearity of the satisfaction/dissatisfaction with management questions with others. After 18 iterations, factor analysis using the 20 non-management questions revealed 4 factors that explained 98% of the variance. These factors parallel the assigned domains.

### Comparison of quality of life between operated and non-operated adults with painful degenerative scoliosis: A 2-year prospective multicentered observational study [^115P88iw]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Adult scoliosis can lead to severe impairment of quality of life. Conservative and surgical treatment are two available options to improve quality of life. Surgical treatment is effective in correcting severe deformations but comes with significant morbidity. The comparison of the two treatments remains heterogeneous in the literature, with significant cross-over to surgical treatment. The objective of the study was to compare health-related quality of life between operated and non-operated adults with painful degenerative scoliosis at a 2-year follow-up.

- **Methods**: All patients aged between 50 to 80 years with lumbar scoliosis were prospectively included in a 2-year prospective multicentered observational study conducted in 12 French tertiary care centers. Two groups were defined: an operated group and a non-operated group. Demographics, radiological parameters, surgical parameters, and complications were collected. Four clinical scores were self-reported at baseline, at 1-year, and at 2-year follow-up. These included SF-12, VAS, SRS-30, and ODI.

- **Results**: A total of 181 patients were included. Pre-treatment physical and mental components of the SF-12 score were not significantly different between operated and non-operated groups, with respective values of 31.2 ± 6.9 vs. 34 ± 9.4 (p > 0.05) for the physical component and 41.6 ± 9.5 vs. 43.2 ± 13.9 (p > 0.05) for the mental component. Post-treatment SF-12 PCS and MCS scores were not significantly different between operated and non-operated groups, with respective values of 42 ± 8 vs. 42 ± 9 (p = 0.65) for the physical component and 46 ± 11 vs. 49 ± 11 (p = 0.08) for the mental component. At 2 years follow-up, for SF-12 PCS, 41 more patients (52.5%) in the operated group achieved the PASS threshold.

### The smallest worthwhile effect as a promising alternative to the MCID in estimating PROMs for adult idiopathic scoliosis [^114oHJFs]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 134 consecutive participants with AdIS were prospectively recruited from July 2017 to August 2022 at our orthopedic center for spine surgery. The eligibility criteria included an age of 18 to 60 years, a diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis, primary surgery with ≥ 5 fusion levels, and at least 2 years of follow-up. Patients with degenerative scoliosis, infection, spinal tumors, trauma, or intraspinal anomalies were excluded. The institutional review board approved the study protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Demographic data (age, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass index [BMI], income, educational attainment, and preoperative symptoms) and surgical details (fusion levels, surgical duration, osteotomy type, estimated blood loss, complications, and the length of the hospital stay) were collected from the medical records. Radiographic evaluation included the main curve type, Cobb angle, and correction rate.

Chinese versions of the SRS-22r and SRS-30 questionnaires have been adopted. The SRS-22r includes 22 items organized into 5 domains — pain, self-image, function, mental health, and satisfaction — as well as the total score. Each domain is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better outcomes. The SRS-30 contains the 22 items from the SRS-22r and 8 additional questions. The baseline SRS-22r was utilized to determine the SWE estimates, whereas the SRS-30 at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively was utilized for estimating the effects.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172v7LV]. BMC geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The conclusion of this study indicated that the overall pooled prevalence of functional disability in basic activities of daily living was nearly one-fifth. Additionally, nearly half of the participants experienced limitations in instrumental activities of daily living. This emphasizes the need for continued efforts to improve the quality of life and support systems for individuals facing functional disability, particularly in instrumental activities.

### Pain and disability determine treatment modality for older patients with adult scoliosis, while deformity guides treatment for younger patients [^111Y5hG6]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

The study design was a multi-center, retrospective review.

- **Objective**: Identify age-associated clinical and radiographic features correlating with adult scoliosis (AS) treatment.

- **Summary of background data**: There is little information about factors determining treatment for AS. Existing studies have not evaluated age-stratified differences.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, retrospective review was conducted of 290 patients treated for AS. These patients were divided into operative (OP) or nonoperative (NON) groups, and age-stratified into three groups (G1 = 65 years). Demographic and spinopelvic radiographic parameters were evaluated. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures included the SRS-22, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and visual analog pain scale.

- **Results**: Treatment groups (OP, n = 137; NON, n = 153) demonstrated similar age distribution (OP = 52.7 years; NON = 55.5 years; P > 0.05) and comorbidities. The OP group had larger thoracic curves than the NON group (OP = 51 degrees, NON = 45 degrees; P < 0.05) and worse HRQL scores (SRS = 2.95 vs. 3.12, P < 0.05; ODI = 33.4 vs. 28.7, P < 0.05; visual analog pain scale = 6.9 vs. 5.6, P < 0.05, respectively). Age stratification of OP showed larger curves in G1 and G2 versus G3, progressively worsening sagittal imbalance in older age groups, and worse HRQL scores in G3 compared to G1 and G2. Age stratification of NON demonstrated worsening sagittal imbalance with age; however, other radiographic values and HRQL scores were similar between all NON age groups. Treatment stratification by age groups demonstrated that G1-OP had greater deformity than G1-NON…

### Measuring outcomes in adult spinal deformity surgery: A systematic review to identify current strengths, weaknesses and gaps in patient-reported outcome measures [^117SnT4x]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Adult spinal deformity (ASD) causes severe disability, reduces overall quality of life, and results in a substantial societal burden of disease. As healthcare becomes more value-based and to facilitate global benchmarking, it is critical to identify and standardize patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). This study aims to identify the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in PROMs used for ASD.

- **Methods**: Studies were included following a systematic search in multiple bibliographic databases between 2000 and 2015. PROMs were extracted and linked to the outcome domains of WHO's International Classification of Functioning and Health (ICF) framework. Subsequently, the clinimetric quality of identified PROMs was evaluated.

- **Results**: The literature search identified 144 papers that met the inclusion criteria, and nine frequently used PROMs were identified. These covered 29 ICF outcome domains, which could be grouped into three of the four main ICF chapters: body function (n = 7), activity and participation (n = 19), and environmental factors (n = 3); there were none for body structure. A low quantity (n = 3) of papers studied the clinimetric quality of PROMs. The Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 has the highest level of clinimetric quality for ASD.

- **Conclusions**: Outcome domains related to mobility and pain were well represented. We identified a gap in outcome measures regarding neurological and pulmonary function. In addition, no outcome domains were measured in the ICF chapter body structure. These results will serve as a foundation for future research.

### Incidence and risk factors of distal adjacent disc degeneration in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients undergoing fusion surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SsUpQ]. European Spine Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the incidence of disc degeneration in patients with surgically treated adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and identify the associated risk factors.

- **Methods**: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane Collaboration Library databases were searched. The outcomes of interest were the incidence of disc degeneration, SRS-22, and radiological risk factors. The lower instrumented vertebra (LIV) was also evaluated. Fixed effects were used if there was no evidence of heterogeneity. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager.

- **Results**: A meta-analysis was conducted including nine studies with a total of 565 patients. The analysis revealed that the global incidence of intervertebral disc degeneration in patients with surgically treated AIS patients was 24.78% (95% CI 16.59–32.98%) 10 years after surgery, which significantly increased to 32.32% (95% CI 21.16–43.47%) at an average of 13.8 years after surgery. Among patients with significant degenerative disc changes, the SRS-22 functional, self-image, and satisfaction domains showed significantly worse results (MD -0.25, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.05; MD -0.50, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.25; and MD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.03, respectively). Furthermore, instrumentation at or above the L3 level was associated with a lower incidence of intervertebral disc degeneration compared to instrumentation below the L3 level (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10–0.64). It was also found that the preoperative and final follow-up lumbar curve magnitudes (MD 8.11, 95% CI 3.82–12.41) as well as preoperat…

### Health-related quality of life in adulthood in untreated and treated individuals with adolescent or juvenile idiopathic scoliosis [^113QLAri]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Health-related quality of life in adults with idiopathic scoliosis diagnosed before maturity has been reported to be similar between brace-treated and surgically treated individuals. The aim of this study was to compare health-related quality of life in untreated, brace-treated, and surgically treated adults with idiopathic scoliosis diagnosed before skeletal maturity. Subgroup analyses were performed based on age at the time of the study, age of onset, surgical characteristics, and curve magnitude.

- **Methods**: We included 1,187 adults with juvenile or adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, with a mean age (and standard deviation) of 38.8 ± 12.7 years. Of these, 347 were untreated, 459 had been brace-treated, and 381 had been surgically treated. The Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r) and EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) were used. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance.

- **Results**: The mean SRS-22r subscore was 4.15 ± 0.59 points for the untreated group, 4.10 ± 0.57 points for the previously braced group, and 4.01 ± 0.64 points for the surgically treated group (p = 0.007 adjusted for age and sex). The EQ-5D index was 0.82 ± 0.20 for the untreated group, 0.82 ± 0.20 for the previously brace-treated group, and 0.79 ± 0.24 for the surgically treated group (p = 0.026, adjusted for age and sex). Brace cessation was at the mean age of 16.2 ± 1.5 years, and the surgical procedure had been performed at the mean age of 15.3 ± 2.1 years. A more caudal fusion was associated with a lower SRS-22r subscore and EQ-5D index.

### Objective physical measures and their association with subjective functional limitations in a representative study population of older Thais [^115pt2RR]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In women, the mean age of the younger population was 64.1 years, and 73.9 years for the older female population. The younger female group had lower strength in hand grip strength (HGS) and usual walking speed (UWS) than males (21.0 kg, and 0.7 m/s, respectively), while the older female group had an HGS of 18.3 kg and a UWS of 0.6 m/s. Both groups of women reported a greater prevalence of cognitive impairment, diabetes, and hypertension than men. The younger females reported 11.2% cognitive impairment, 19.2% diabetes, 45% hypertension, 1.4% ADL disabilities, 56% IADL disabilities, 24.6% upper-body limitations, 34% lower-body limitations, and 22.6% higher functional limitations. As expected, the older group had a higher prevalence of diseases or limitations (17.2% cognitive impairment, 17.1% diabetes, 52.5% hypertension, 3% ADL disabilities, 81.3% IADL disabilities, 46.8% upper-body limitations, 54% lower-body limitations, and 42.6% higher functional limitations) than the younger group.

Physical strength decreases with increasing age, and overall, women have lower physical performance than men. By age groups and sex, those reporting any conditions of ADL disabilities, IADL disabilities, upper-body limitations, lower-body limitations, and higher functional limitations tend to have lower mean scores in all three physical performances. Respondents with ADL disabilities were likely to be the weakest compared to those with other functional restrictions.

### Effect of core-based exercise in people with scoliosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116T4nPR]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

To systematically assess the effectiveness of core-based exercise for correcting a spinal deformity and improving the quality of life in people with scoliosis, various databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science, were searched from inception up to September 30, 2020.

Clinical controlled trials were deemed eligible if they compared the effectiveness of core-based exercise to other nonsurgical interventions in individuals with scoliosis. Researchers employed the revised Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for randomized trials and the methodological index for non-randomized studies scale to evaluate the risk of bias. The outcomes of interest included the Cobb angle, the angle of trunk rotation, and quality of life. RevMan 5.3 was utilized, and intergroup differences were determined by calculating mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Upon screening 1348 studies, nine studies comprising 325 participants met the inclusion criteria. The exercise group exhibited significantly lower Cobb angles (MD = −2.08, 95% CI: −3.89 to −0.28, P = 0.02) and improved quality of life as assessed by the Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire (MD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.49, P = 0.03) compared to the control groups. However, no significant difference was noted regarding the angle of trunk rotation between groups (MD = −0.69, 95% CI: −2.61 to 1.22, P = 0.48). Moreover, no serious adverse events were reported. The overall quality of evidence was considered to range from low to very low.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YteWX]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Functional disability in older adults refers to difficulties in performing daily activities. It is usually evaluated based on an individual's ability to carry out basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Although existing studies provide valuable insights, comprehensive global data on functional disability in these areas remain limited. This study aims to review existing research worldwide to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of functional disability in these areas.

- **Methods**: Systematic searches were conducted across EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar from May 5 to July 11, 2024. Cross-sectional studies worldwide on functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among adults aged 60 and older, published in English up to July 11, 2024, were included. Studies were excluded if they did not report the outcomes of interest, were inaccessible, were case reports, low quality, review articles, or published in languages other than English.

Data extraction and cleaning were performed using Microsoft Excel, and STATA version 17 was used to compute the pooled effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for functional disability in both basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults. To derive these estimates, we used weighted averages, where each study's prevalence was weighted by the inverse of its variance. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane I² statistic.

### Does treatment (nonoperative and operative) improve the two-year quality of life in patients with adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis: a prospective multicenter evidence-based medicine study [^114V6omZ]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Prospective observational cohort study with matched and unmatched comparisons, providing Level II evidence.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study is to compare the results of adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS) patients who were treated nonoperatively and operatively. This evidence-based prospective multicenter study aims to determine whether nonoperative and operative treatments improve quality of life (QOL) in these patients at a 2-year follow-up.

- **Summary of background data**: Only one paper in the peer-reviewed, published data directly addresses this question. That paper suggested that operative treatment was more beneficial than nonoperative care; however, it is limited by its historical context, as all patients were treated with Harrington implants, and there is an absence of validated patient-reported QOL data.

- **Methods**: This study assessed 160 consecutively enrolled patients (ages 40–80 years) with baseline and 2-year follow-up data from five centers. Lumbar scoliosis without prior surgical treatment was defined as a minimum Cobb angle of 30 degrees (mean: 54 degrees for patients in this study). All patients had either an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of 20 or more (mean: 33), or Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) domain scores of 4 or less in pain, function, and self-image (mean: 3.2) at baseline. Pretreatment and 2-year follow-up data, collected prospectively, included basic radiographic parameters, complications, and SRS QOL, ODI, and Numerical Rating Scale back and leg pain scores.

### Effect of serious adverse events on health-related quality of life measures following surgery for adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis [^1169w8Rp]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

This study presents a secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter cohort to assess the effect of serious adverse events (SAEs) on 2- and 4-year patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in patients surgically treated for adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS).

- **Summary of background data**: Operative treatment for ASLS can improve health-related quality of life but has high rates of SAEs. How these SAEs affect health-related quality of life remains unclear.

- **Methods**: The ASLS study assessed operative versus non-operative ASLS treatment, with randomized and observational arms. Patients were between 40 and 80 years old with ASLS, defined as lumbar coronal Cobb angle ≥ 30° and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) ≥ 20, or Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) ≤ 4.0 in pain, function, and/or self-image domains. SRS-22 subscores and ODI were compared between operative patients with and without a related SAE, and nonoperative patients, using an as-treated analysis combining randomized and observational cohorts.

- **Results**: Two hundred eighty-six patients were enrolled, with 2- and 4-year follow-up rates of 90% and 81%, respectively, although at the time of data extraction, not all patients were eligible for 4-year follow-up. A total of 97 SAEs were reported among 173 operatively treated patients. The most common SAEs were implant failure/pseudarthrosis (n = 25), proximal junctional kyphosis/failure (n = 10), and minor motor deficit (n = 8). At 2 years, patients with an SAE showed less improvement than those without an SAE based on SRS-22 (0.52 vs. 0.79, P = 0.004) and ODI (-11.59 vs. -17.34, P = 0.021).

### Quality of life outcomes in surgically treated adult scoliosis patients: A systematic review [^112SvMe4]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify prospective studies reporting the impact of surgical intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes for adults with scoliosis at a minimum 2-year follow-up.

An electronic database search was conducted for January 2000 to November 2013, in conjunction with a reference list search of two related systematic reviews, for prospective studies of adults with scoliosis reporting HRQL outcome measures. The methodological quality of included articles was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Cohen's d effect size was calculated for Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire (SRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) outcomes for included studies and pooled data.

The database and reference list searches returned 349 potential articles; three articles met the inclusion criteria. Downs and Black scores ranged from 18/28 to 21/28, indicating fair to good quality evidence. A total of 188 patients were treated surgically and had a mean age of 38 years or older. All studies showed significant improvement in reported HRQL outcomes for at least a 2-year follow-up. The Cohen's d effect size for SRS was d = 1.4 (n = 188, 95% CI; 0.9, 1.8) and for ODI d = 0.9 (n = 120, 95% CI; 0.4, 1.4).

Findings from this review suggest surgery improves HRQL in patients with adult scoliosis at a minimum 2-year follow-up. However, these findings are based on limited data of fair to good quality, which needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting the results and highlights the need for additional high-quality research.

### Oblique lumbar interbody fusion versus minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for the treatment of degenerative disease of the lumbar spine: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qkTPC]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

As the average life expectancy increases, degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine, including spondylolisthesis, disc degeneration, and spinal stenosis, have become more common worldwide. Degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine can cause lower back pain, numbness, pain in the lower extremities, lameness, and even disability, all of which can negatively affect a patient's body. Surgical treatment is suitable for patients with poor conservative outcomes. With advancements in medical and nursing technologies, an increasing number of patients are willing to undergo surgery.

Spinal fusion, first proposed by Albee and Hibbs, has gradually become the standard treatment for symptomatic lumbar degenerative diseases. A traditional surgical method is mainly an open approach, but a large number of studies have found that iatrogenic paraspinal muscle injury and other approach-related complications are drawbacks of traditional open-approach surgery. With the development of minimally invasive techniques, there are now many different minimally invasive surgical modalities for surgeons to choose from. OLIF and MIS-TLIF are often used to treat degenerative lumbar spine diseases.

Studies have shown that OLIF can achieve indirect decompression, preserve the structure of the posterior column, correct coronal and sagittal imbalances, reduce paraspinal muscle injury, shorten surgery time, reduce perioperative blood loss, and shorten hospital stay. Some studies report that MIS-TLIF is a modified version of minimally invasive surgery for TLIF that can directly decompress neural structures.

### Patient outcomes after Harrington instrumentation for idiopathic scoliosis: a 15- to 28-year evaluation [^115G2wCn]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was conducted using the Short Form-36 Health Survey and the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire to investigate patient outcomes after fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using Harrington rod instrumentation. The objective was to evaluate health-related quality of life and low back pain in a long-term follow-up study of surgery for this condition.

Vertebral fusion is the commonly accepted surgical treatment for idiopathic evolutive scoliosis. It has been suggested that this procedure may lead to low back pain and a poor quality of life over the long term. Outcome measures after surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have traditionally focused on objective parameters, such as radiographic measures. However, these measures have only weak correlations with outcomes that are more relevant to patients, such as functional status and symptoms. Until recently, only a few long-term outcome studies have used standardized and validated patient-oriented tools to evaluate surgically treated patients with scoliosis.

In the study, 70 patients treated with a standard Harrington technique were recontacted and evaluated through self-administered questionnaires, namely the Short Form-36 Health Survey and the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire, as well as clinical examination and radiographic analysis. Preoperative and follow-up radiographic findings were documented. Relationships between radiographic and patient-oriented data were assessed.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aYi8o]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The pooled prevalence of functional disability in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) was 45.15% (95% CI: 36.02–54.29), with substantial heterogeneity indicated by an I² value of 99.9% (Fig. 3).

- **Forest plot**: Fig. 3 displays the pooled prevalence of functional disability in instrumental activities of daily living among older adults worldwide in 2024.

- **Heterogeneity and publication bias**: The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using I² and its corresponding p-value. This study found significant heterogeneity, with I² values of 99.9% and a p-value of 0.00 for both BADL and IADL, suggesting the need for subgroup analysis. To explore the source of this heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses based on several factors: the continent where the study was conducted, publication year, sample size, age of the participants, and study setting. However, the subgroup analysis did not identify the source of the heterogeneity, as the I² value remained high, indicating significant variability. Other potential sources of heterogeneity may include differing definitions of functional disability, cultural variations in the perception and reporting of disability, and variations in measurement tools or methodologies used across studies. These factors could contribute to the observed differences in prevalence rates.

- **Subgroup analysis by continent**: Studies conducted in Asia had the lowest prevalence of functional disability in both basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities.

### The smallest worthwhile effect as a promising alternative to the MCID in estimating PROMs for adult idiopathic scoliosis [^117M1ptp]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

A total of 134 participants initially met the inclusion criteria, of whom 15 (2 male and 13 female patients; mean age [and standard deviation], 28.3 ± 7.4 years [range, 21 to 39 years]; main Cobb angle, 50.7° ± 12.6°) were lost to follow-up due to failure to contact or refusal to complete questionnaires. Ultimately, 119 Asian participants (19 male and 100 female) with a mean age of 26.5 ± 7.2 years (range, 19 to 54 years) were included in the study. These participants had a preoperative main Cobb angle of 53.4° ± 13.8°, with a correction rate of 72.2% ± 15.4%.

- **Clinical outcome measures**: All SRS-22r domain scores showed significant improvement compared with the preoperative scores. The self-image (standardized response mean [SRM] = 2.0), function (SRM = 1.0), and mental health (SRM = 1.0) domains, as well as the total score (SRM = 1.5), were strongly responsive to surgery. However, the pain domain (SRM = 0.4) displayed relatively low responsiveness. Significant differences were found in the self-image, function, and pain domains, as well as in the total score across the summed anchor response categories, while the difference in the mental health domain was not significant.

- **MCID estimates**: The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) was estimated to be 0.7 for self-image, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.85), and 0.1 for function, with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.61 [text ends abruptly]).

### The health impact of symptomatic adult spinal deformity: Comparison of deformity types to United States population norms and chronic diseases [^113SBJCE]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis of a prospective, multicenter database was conducted with the objective of evaluating the health impact of symptomatic adult spinal deformity (SASD). This was achieved by comparing Standard Form Version 2 (SF-36) scores for SASD with United States normative and chronic disease values.

Recent data have identified radiographic parameters correlating with poor health-related quality of life for SASD. Disability comparisons between SASD patients and patients with chronic diseases may provide further insight into the disease burden caused by SASD.

Consecutive SASD patients, with no history of spine surgery, were enrolled into a multicenter database and evaluated for type and severity of spinal deformity. Baseline SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) values for SASD patients were compared with reported U.S. normative and chronic disease SF-36 scores. SF-36 scores were reported as normative-based scores (NBS) and evaluated for minimally clinical important difference (MCID).

Between 2008 and 2011, 497 SASD patients were prospectively enrolled and evaluated. The mean PCS for all SASD was lower than the U.S. total population (ASD = 40.9; US = 50; P < 0.05). Generational decline in PCS for SASD patients with no other reported comorbidities was more rapid than U.S. norms (P < 0.05). PCS worsened with lumbar scoliosis and increasing sagittal vertical axis (SVA). PCS scores for patients with isolated thoracic scoliosis were similar to values reported by individuals with chronic back pain.

### Outcome instruments to assess scoliosis surgery [^114W56g7]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to review and summarize the knowledge regarding the outcome measures used to evaluate scoliosis surgery.

- **Methods**: Literature review.

- **Results**: Outcome instruments should be tested to ensure they have adequate metric characteristics, including content and construct validity, reliability, and responsiveness. In the evaluation of scoliosis, generic instruments to assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) have been used, such as the SF-36 questionnaire and the EuroQol5D instrument. Nonetheless, it is preferable to use disease-specific instruments for this purpose, such as the SRS-22 Patient Questionnaire and the Quality of Life Profile for Spinal Deformities (QLPSD). More recently, these generic and disease-specific instruments have been complemented with the use of super-specific instruments, i.e. those assessing a single aspect of the condition or specific populations with the condition. Particular attention has been paid to patients' perception of their trunk deformity and body image, with several instruments available to evaluate these aspects, such as the Walter-Reed Visual Assessment Scale (WRVAS), the Spinal Appearance Questionnaire (SAQ), and the Trunk Appearance Perception Scale (TAPS). The impacts of brace use can also be measured with specific scales, including the Bad Sobernheim Stress Questionnaire (BSSQ) and the Brace Questionnaire (BrQ). The available instruments to evaluate the treatment for non-idiopathic scoliosis have not been sufficiently validated and analyzed.

- **Conclusions**: Evaluation of scoliosis treatment should include the patient's perspective on various outcome measures.

### Minimum clinically important difference in patient-reported outcome measures in de novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis: Is it appropriate to apply the values of adult spine deformity [^112ufTDj]. Spine (2023). High credibility.

A retrospective analysis was conducted with the objective of calculating the range of minimum clinically important difference (MCID) threshold values using anchor-based and distribution-based methods. These values were determined for back pain, leg pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the Scoliosis Research Society 22R instrument (SRS-22R) in patients with de novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DNDLS) who underwent long-segment fusion surgery. The study aimed to establish a statistically meaningful MCID for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and compare the results with previously reported values for other adult spine deformity (ASD) populations.

Minimum clinically important difference thresholds for back pain, leg pain, the ODI, and SRS-22R have not been widely described in patients with ASD.

PROMs were obtained preoperatively and two years postoperatively in 128 patients with DNDLS. Different MCID calculation methods were applied to the data, and the results were compared.

There was a statistically significant improvement in two-year postoperative PROM scores compared with preoperative scores. Different preoperative calculation methods yielded a ~10-fold range of values. MCID values were established as 1.9 for back pain, 1.5 for leg pain, 18.9 for the ODI, 0.8 for SRS-22R pain, 0.5 for SRS-22R activity, 1.6 for SRS-22R appearance, 0.8 for SRS-22R mental, and 0.98 for the SRS-22R subscales.

SWE50 estimates were calculated for the baseline tertiles of the SRS-22r domain scores. The results showed that participants with poorer baseline scores exhibited higher estimates, although no test for significance was performed. Additionally, variables such as age, educational level, income, main curve type, and curve magnitude were not associated with either the SWE50 or SWE90 estimates.

### Impact of new motor deficit on HRQOL after adult spinal deformity surgery: Subanalysis from Scoli Risk 1 prospective study [^114dmLP8]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Based on the Scoli-RISK-1 trial, just over 20% of patients who underwent complex adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery experienced a decline in lower extremity motor score (LEMS) at hospital discharge. More recently, follow-up results from the Scoli-RISK-1 trial indicated that 10% of those patients continued to experience lower extremity weakness at the 2-year follow-up. However, the effect of lower extremity weakness and changes in LEMS on tasks of daily life and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes remains to be studied and understood. This is a critical factor in understanding the significance of neurological changes after ASD surgery. We hypothesized that new motor deficits, defined by worsening in LEMS, lead to worsened HRQOL scores. Therefore, in this study, an analysis of the Scoli-RISK-1 trial was performed to determine how worsening LEMS is associated with outcome measures at the 6-week, 6-month, and 2-year time points.

### Impact of new motor deficit on HRQOL after adult spinal deformity surgery: Subanalysis from Scoli Risk 1 prospective study [^116CRaar]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients aged 18 to 80 with a diagnosis of adult spinal deformity were eligible for enrollment at 15 sites worldwide (North America [nine], Europe [three], and Asia [three]). Inclusion criteria were: apex of major deformity between C7 and L2 inclusive, primary scoliosis, kyphosis or kyphoscoliosis with sagittal plane, congenital spinal deformity undergoing corrective spinal osteotomy, revision spinal deformity undergoing corrective spinal osteotomy, any patient undergoing a 3-column spinal osteotomy (i.e. pedicle subtraction osteotomy, vertebral column resection) from C7 to L5 inclusive, any patient with preoperative myelopathy due to their spinal deformity, and any patient with ossification of the ligamentum flavum or posterior longitudinal ligament and a deformity that needs concomitant reconstruction along with decompression of the spinal cord. Patients with a recent history of substance dependency or psychosocial disturbance, spinal trauma or injury, malignancy, and those who are pregnant, institutionalized, or unlikely to comply with follow-up were excluded from the study. Patients were enrolled from 2011 to 2012.

LEMS was computed based on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring system. Each of the five muscles (iliopsoas, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and gastrocnemius) was tested bilaterally for motor strength on a scale from 0 (no movement) to 5 (full strength), resulting in a LEMS range of 0 (paraplegia) to 50. HRQOL tests included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2).

### Psychometric validation and responsiveness of the cross-culturally adapted traditional Chinese version of the early-onset scoliosis self-report questionnaire (EOSQ-SELF) [^113x8P97]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Low credibility.

For convergent validity, the properties of the EOSQ-SELF are comparable with other disease-specific and generic HRQoL measures commonly used in EOS. Apart from the total scores of EOSQ-SELF, SRS-22r, and EQ-5D, specific relevant domains also demonstrated moderate to strong correlations. Discriminative validity was strongest in the EOSQ-SELF transfer domain, whose score was significantly different among etiologies (syndromic vs. idiopathic, syndromic vs. congenital). These coincide with the findings by Ramo et al. that neuromuscular and syndromic EOS were associated with lower parent-reported scores compared with congenital and idiopathic EOS in various EOSQ domains. Underlying etiology is a key determinant of the HRQoL of EOS patients. In fact, the proportion of etiologies in this study population highly resembles that from which EOSQ-SELF was developed. EOSQ-SELF total score was also significantly different between syndromic and idiopathic EOS. In addition, score differences were demonstrated between treatment groups, as surgical patients had lower EOSQ-SELF transfer domain and physical function/daily living domain scores than those under observation. This was echoed by the similarly lower SRS-22r function and pain domain scores.

Overall, the performance of the EOSQ-SELF responsiveness was satisfactory. The GRC scale, a widely used anchor in musculoskeletal research, differentiates patients according to their self-perceived change in overall health over 6 months. Based on the EOSQ-SELF total score, those patients who perceived an improvement in their overall HRQoL demonstrated…

### Association between radiographic spinopelvic parameters and health-related quality of life in de novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis and concomitant lumbar spinal stenosis [^112moMmc]. Spine (2020). Low credibility.

The materials and methods for this study are outlined as follows:

- **Inclusion criteria**: Our hospital's electronic database was retrospectively reviewed. Patients diagnosed with de novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DNDLS) from January 2011 to December 2018 who met the following criteria were included: age over 50 years, presence of DNDLS with a Cobb angle greater than 10°, an apical vertebra in the lumbar region, concomitant lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), and availability of complete radiographs.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The exclusion criteria were as follows: a history of juvenile or adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, spine deformity caused by infection, trauma, or tumor, neuromuscular spinal abnormalities, previous spine surgery or hip arthroplasty history, or radiographic examination showing double curves of scoliosis.

- **HRQOL measurements**: The quality of life was evaluated by HRQOL questionnaires, which included the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for the back and leg, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring system. Additionally, the SRS-22 questionnaire was used for self-assessment of quality of life. All HRQOL values were extracted from our electronic medical database, which recorded the original electronic medical documents.

### Lumbar disc degeneration below a long arthrodesis (performed for scoliosis in adults) to L4 or L5 [^113LaMuJ]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis of adults treated with long instrumented fusion for scoliosis from the thoracic spine proximally to L4 or L5 was conducted to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes, as well as radiological changes in distal unfused mobile segments. It aimed to evaluate factors that may predispose to distal disc degeneration and/or poor outcome. A total of 151 mobile segments in 85 patients (65 female), with a mean age of 43.2 years (range 21–68), were studied. Curve type, number of fused levels, and pelvic incidence were recorded.

Clinical outcome was measured using the Whitecloud function scale, and disc degeneration was assessed using the UCLA disc degeneration score. Measurements of spinal balance, local segmental angulations, and lumbar lordosis were taken pre- and post-operatively, as well as at the most recent follow-up with a mean duration of 9.3 years (range 7–19). A total of 62% of patients had a good or excellent outcome. Eleven patients had a poor outcome, of which ten underwent fusion extension: five for pain alone, three for pain with stenosis, and two for pseudarthroses. Pre-operative disc degeneration was often asymmetric and slightly greater in older patients.

Overall, there was a significant deterioration in disc degeneration (P < 0.0001) that did not correlate with clinical outcome. Disc degeneration correlated with recent sagittal balance (ANOVA F = 14.285, P < 0.001) and the most recent lordosis (ANOVA F = 4.057, P = 0.048). Post-operative sagittal balance and local L5-S1 sagittal angulation correlated to L4 and L5 degeneration, respectively. There was no correlation between degeneration and age or pre-operative degenerative stage.

### Spinal decompensation in degenerative lumbar scoliosis [^112yPpEe]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Due to the aging population, degenerative scoliosis is a growing clinical problem. It is associated with back pain and radicular symptoms. The pathogenesis of degenerative scoliosis lies in degenerative changes of the spinal structures, such as the intervertebral disc, the facet joints, and the vertebrae themselves. Possibly, muscle weakness also plays a role. However, it is not clear what exactly causes the decompensation to occur and what determines the direction of the curve.

It is known that in the normal spine, a pre-existing rotation exists at the thoracic level, but not at the lumbar level. In this retrospective study, we have investigated if a predominant curve pattern can be found in degenerative scoliosis and whether symptoms are predominantly present on one side relative to the curve direction. The lumbar curves of 88 patients with degenerative scoliosis were analyzed and symptoms were recorded. It was found that curve direction depended significantly on the apical level of the curve. The majority of curves with an apex above L2 were convex to the right, whereas curves with an apex below L2 were more frequently convex to the left. This would indicate that also in degenerative scoliosis, the innate curvature and rotational pattern of the spine play a role in the direction of the curve. Unilateral symptoms were not coupled to the curve direction. It is believed that the symptoms are related to local and more specific degenerative changes besides the scoliotic curve itself.

### Minimum detectable measurement difference for health-related quality of life measures varies with age and disability in adult spinal deformity: Implications for calculating minimal clinically important difference [^1126ADS8]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

The study design for this research was a retrospective cohort. The objective was to investigate the minimum detectable measurement difference (MDMD) in the Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r) outcomes instrument for adult spinal deformity (ASD) and to evaluate the effect of baseline data on measurable difference.

- **Summary of background data**: The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is the smallest, clinically relevant change observed and has been proposed for the SRS-22r instrument in ASD as 0.4. The MCID must be greater than the MDMD to be useful. The MDMD for the SRS-22r has not been calculated, nor have the effects of patient baseline values on MDMD.

- **Methods**: A prospective observation cohort was queried for patients treated both operatively and non-operatively for ASD. Patients with baseline and 1-year, 2-year follow-up SRS-22r data were included in the analysis. The MDMD was calculated using classical test theory and item-response theory methods. Effect size and standardized response means were calculated. The effect of baseline data values was evaluated for MDMD.

- **Results**: A total of 839 patients were eligible for cohort inclusion, with 428 (51%) eligible for analysis with complete data. MDMD for Pain (0.6) and Self-Image (0.5) were greater than 0.4. MDMD varied with age (highest for the youngest patients) and with disability (highest for SF-36 Physical Component Summary < 28.6). MDMD was less than 0.4 for Activity (0.3), Mental Health (0.3), and Total Score (0.2). Gender and mental health did not affect MDMD for the SRS-22r instrument.

- **Conclusion**: An MCID of 0.4 for the SRS-22r total score is crucial for appropriate evaluation. The study highlights the necessity of considering baseline values and demographic factors when calculating clinically meaningful changes in quality of life measures for adults with spinal deformity.

### Orthopedic disease burden in adult patients with symptomatic lumbar scoliosis: Results from a prospective multicenter study [^111Pqzwc]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Although the health impact of adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS) is substantial, patients often have other orthopedic problems that have not been previously quantified. This study aimed to assess the disease burden of other orthopedic conditions in patients with ASLS based on a retrospective review of a prospective multicenter cohort.

The ASLS-1 study is an NIH-sponsored prospective multicenter study designed to evaluate operative versus nonoperative treatment for ASLS. Patients were between 40 to 80 years old with ASLS, defined as a lumbar coronal Cobb angle ≥ 30°; Oswestry Disability Index ≥ 20; or Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire score ≤ 4.0 in pain, function, and/or self-image domains. Nonthoracolumbar orthopedic events, defined as fractures and other orthopedic conditions receiving surgical treatment, were assessed from enrollment to the 4-year follow-up.

Two hundred eighty-six patients (mean age 60.3 years, 90% women) were enrolled, with 173 operative and 113 nonoperative patients, and 81% had 4-year follow-up data. At a mean (± SD) follow-up of 3.8 ± 0.9 years, 104 nonthoracolumbar orthopedic events were reported, affecting 69 patients (24.1%). The most common events included arthroplasty (n = 38), fracture (n = 25), joint ligament/cartilage repair (n = 13), and cervical decompression/fusion (n = 7). Based on the final adjusted model, patients with a nonthoracolumbar orthopedic event were older (HR 1.44 per decade, 95% CI 1.07–1.94) and were more likely to have a history of tobacco use (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.00–2.66).

### The smallest worthwhile effect as a promising alternative to the MCID in estimating PROMs for adult idiopathic scoliosis [^1131jq23]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

The estimation of the SWE was determined using the benefit-harm trade-off method. Initially, a formatted script with a standardized description of the estimated benefits, risks, and costs of surgery, as well as the anticipated curve progression, back pain, activity impairment, and mental disturbance without intervention, was presented to participants by a trained interviewer (see Appendix; Supplemental File 2). This information was provided to participants to evaluate whether the forthcoming surgery was deemed worthwhile.

Subsequently, the participants were asked to estimate the expected magnitude of improvement from baseline to at least 2 years of follow-up in each domain of the SRS-22r. To ensure that the improvement represented the minimum change deemed worthwhile, the interviewer systematically decreased the options corresponding to the postoperative outcomes. The process began by selecting the question for which the patient chose the highest score, and then systematically reducing the option from the highest by 1 point. For example, instead of choosing "pretty good" for appearance in clothes, the participant was asked whether a response of "good" would still be a worthwhile result. This approach was iteratively adopted for each item until participants indicated that the perceived benefits of surgery no longer outweighed the associated risks, costs, or inconveniences.

The SWE estimates are presented as absolute and relative values, indicating the improvements in scores and percentages, respectively, that were deemed worthwhile. Interquartile ranges were used to provide additional context to these estimates.

### Psychometric validation and responsiveness of the cross-culturally adapted traditional Chinese version of the early-onset scoliosis self-report questionnaire (EOSQ-SELF) [^112JRUw3]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Low credibility.

EOSQ-SELF is a disease-specific instrument for assessing the functional and emotional aspects of patients with early-onset scoliosis (EOS). It consists of 30 questions across 12 domains: general health, pain/discomfort, pulmonary function, transfer, physical function/daily living, participation, fatigue/energy level, sleep, appearance, relationships, emotion, and satisfaction. Each question has five responses with item values ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). The EOSQ total score is the algebraic mean of all scaled domain scores, calculated from corresponding question items.

The SRS-22r is a questionnaire with 22 items in five domains: function, self-image, pain, mental health, and satisfaction with treatment. This disease-specific measure provides a score for each domain and a total score (from 1.0 to 5.0), with a higher score indicating better health-related quality of life (HRQoL) status.

EQ-5D-Y-5L is a generic measure consisting of the EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ visual analog scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system has five dimensions: "mobility", "looking after myself", "doing usual activities", "having pain or discomfort", and "feeling worried, sad or unhappy". Dimension responses are combined to calculate an index score ranging from 0.000 to 1.000, representing perfect health. EQ VAS, a 0 to 100 scale, represents the worst to the best imaginable health state. Both the SRS-22r patient questionnaire and the EQ-5D were effective in assessing HRQoL in scoliosis.

### Population-based normative data for the Scoliosis Research Society 22r questionnaire in adolescents and adults, including a comparison with EQ-5D [^113kvWP5]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) 22r questionnaire is a widely used instrument to estimate the disorder's impact on quality of life and to gain knowledge about treatment effects. Normative values are needed for this purpose.

Individuals were randomly invited from the general population. A total of 272 individuals (145 females) answered the SRS-22r and EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires. Participants were stratified according to sex and age: ≤ 19 years (n = 61), 20–39 years (n = 66), 40–59 years (n = 84), and ≥ 60 years (n = 61). The correlation between SRS-22r and EQ-5D was analyzed.

The results showed modest variations in mean SRS-22r scores, ranging between 4.3 and 4.7. EQ-5D followed the same pattern. The correlation between the SRS-22r and EQ-5D was 0.62 (p = 0.001) and 0.61 (p < 0.001) for the EQ-5D UK tariff and EQ-5D Swedish tariff, respectively.

In conclusion, we provide the first SRS-22r normative data for adolescents and adults overall. We found a good correlation between SRS-22r and EQ-5D in individuals without spinal deformity.

### Functional limitations due to stiffness as a collateral impact of instrumented arthrodesis of the lumbar spine [^1166gsdK]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Prospective cohort study.

- **Objective**: To understand whether patients actually perceive increased limitations compared with their preoperative state due to stiffness after lumbar arthrodesis.

- **Summary of background data**: Lumbar arthrodesis intentionally eliminates spinal motion to decrease pain, deformity, and instability. Independent of pain, loss of mobility can affect the ability to perform certain activities of daily living. The lumbar stiffness disability index (LSDI) is a validated measure of the effect of lumbar stiffness on functional activities. At the time of writing, no prospective evaluations of stiffness impacts on patient function after lumbar arthrodesis have been reported.

- **Methods**: The LSDI, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Oswestry Disability Index were administered preoperatively and at a minimum 2-year follow-up to 62 adult patients undergoing lumbar fusion for degenerative disease or spinal deformity. Patients also completed a satisfaction questionnaire at 2 years. Patients were separated according to the number of lumbar arthrodesis levels. Pre- and postoperative LSDI, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical composite score, and Oswestry Disability Index scores were compared using paired t-tests.

- **Results**: Significant improvements in the Oswestry Disability Index were observed across all arthrodesis levels, and significant improvements in the physical composite score were observed at level 1 and at 5 or more levels. Patients undergoing 1-level arthrodesis demonstrated statistically significant decreases in LSDI scores, indicating less impact from the procedure.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113dXZLf]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Functional disability in older adults refers to difficulties in performing daily activities. It is usually evaluated based on an individual's ability to carry out basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Although existing studies provide valuable insights, comprehensive global data on functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults remain limited. This study aims to review existing research worldwide to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of functional disability in these areas.

- **Methods**: Systematic searches were conducted across EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar from May 5 to July 11, 2024. Cross-sectional studies worldwide on functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among adults aged 60 and older, published in English up to July 11, 2024, were included. Studies were excluded if they did not report the outcomes of interest, were inaccessible, case reports, low quality, review articles, or published in languages other than English. Data extraction and cleaning were performed using Microsoft Excel, and STATA version 17 was used to compute the pooled effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for functional disability in both basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults. To derive these estimates, we used weighted averages, where each study's prevalence was weighted by the inverse of its variance. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane I² statistic.

### The health impact of symptomatic adult spinal deformity: Comparison of deformity types to United States population norms and chronic diseases [^111zToMs]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis of a prospective, multicenter database was conducted with the objective to evaluate the health impact of symptomatic adult spinal deformity (SASD) by comparing Standard Form Version 2 (SF-36) scores for SASD with United States normative and chronic disease values.

Recent data have identified radiographic parameters correlating with poor health-related quality of life for SASD. Disability comparisons between SASD patients and patients with chronic diseases may provide further insight into the disease burden caused by SASD.

Consecutive SASD patients, with no history of spine surgery, were enrolled into a multicenter database and evaluated for type and severity of spinal deformity. Baseline SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) values for SASD patients were compared with reported U.S. normative and chronic disease SF-36 scores. SF-36 scores were reported as normative-based scores (NBS) and evaluated for minimally clinical important difference (MCID).

Between 2008 and 2011, 497 SASD patients were prospectively enrolled and evaluated. The mean PCS for all SASD was lower than the U.S. total population (ASD = 40.9; US = 50; P < 0.05). A generational decline in PCS for SASD patients with no other reported comorbidities was more rapid than U.S. norms (P < 0.05). PCS worsened with lumbar scoliosis and increasing sagittal vertical axis (SVA). PCS scores for patients with isolated thoracic scoliosis were similar to values reported by individuals with chronic back pain (45.5 vs. [data not provided]).

### The smallest worthwhile effect as a promising alternative to the MCID in estimating PROMs for adult idiopathic scoliosis [^112ij2Jk]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

The smallest worthwhile effect (SWE) enables patients to evaluate the expected value of a treatment by weighing its benefits, risks, and costs. It has emerged as an alternative to the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for interpreting patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The purposes of this study were to determine the SWE estimates and MCID thresholds in patients undergoing surgery for adult idiopathic scoliosis (AdIS) and to verify whether meeting or exceeding the SWE estimates correlates with satisfaction at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively.

- **Methods**: Patients with postoperative satisfaction measured at a minimum of 2 years were prospectively recruited between July 2017 and August 2022. The Scoliosis Research Society-22 revised (SRS-22r) questionnaire was preoperatively administered to estimate the SWE thresholds using the benefit-harm trade-off method. The baseline SRS-22r and the SRS-30 at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively were recorded to determine the MCID estimates using the anchor-based approach, with questions 24 to 30 of the SRS-30 used as anchors. A construct validity assessment was performed to evaluate the association between meeting or exceeding the 50th percentile of the SWE (SWE50) threshold and postoperative satisfaction (defined as a score of ≥ 4 on both SRS-22r satisfaction questions). Race and ethnicity data were collected from the medical records.

- **Results**: A total of 119 Asian participants (19 male and 100 female) with a mean age of 26.5 ± 7.2 years were included. The absolute SWE50 estimates for the SRS-22r were collected, demonstrating an association with postoperative satisfaction.

### Degenerative disorders of the spine [^112Ac8wZ]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with back pain and degenerative disorders of the spine significantly impact health care costs. Some authors estimate that up to 80% of all adults experience back pain at some point in their lives. Disk herniation represents one of the most frequent causes; nevertheless, other degenerative diseases must also be considered. In this paper, pathology and imaging of degenerative spine diseases will be discussed, starting from the pathophysiology of normal age-related changes of the intervertebral disk and vertebral body.

### Operative versus nonoperative treatment for adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis at 5-year follow-up: Durability of outcomes and impact of treatment-related serious adverse events [^112StdvG]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). High credibility.

Although short-term adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS) studies favor operative over nonoperative treatment, longer outcomes are critical for assessing the treatment durability, especially for operative treatment. This is important because the majority of implant failures and nonunions present between 2 and 5 years after surgery. This study aimed to assess the durability of treatment outcomes for operative versus nonoperative treatment of ASLS, report the rates and types of associated serious adverse events (SAEs), and determine the potential impact of treatment-related SAEs on outcomes.

- **Methods**: The ASLS-1 (Adult Symptomatic Lumbar Scoliosis-1) trial is an NIH-sponsored multicenter prospective study assessing operative versus nonoperative ASLS treatment. Patients aged 40–80 years had ASLS characterized by a Cobb angle of ≥ 30° and either an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) of ≥ 20 or a Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 subscore of ≤ 4.0 in the Pain, Function, and/or Self-Image domains. Patients receiving operative and nonoperative treatment were compared using as-treated analysis, with the impact of related SAEs assessed. Primary outcome measures included the ODI and SRS-22.

- **Results**: The 286 patients with ASLS, comprising 107 with nonoperative treatment and 179 with operative treatment, had 2-year and 5-year follow-up rates of 90% (n = 256) and 74% (n = 211), respectively. At 5 years, compared to patients treated nonoperatively, those who underwent surgery had greater improvement in ODI (mean difference -15.2 [95% CI -18.7 to -11.7]) and SRS-22 subscore (mean difference 0.63 [95% CI 0.48–0.7]).

### Long-term health-related quality of life after Harrington instrumentation and fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A minimum 40-year follow-up [^112qoYZG]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2022). Low credibility.

Despite its importance for clinical decisions, the long-term consequences of posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion (PSIF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), particularly in the lower lumbar spine, remain unclear. This study evaluates the long-term health-related quality of life and the need for further surgical procedures in patients treated with Harrington instrumentation from 1961 to 1977 according to the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) and in comparison with age-matched norms.

- **Methods**: A search was performed to identify and contact the 314 identified patients with AIS treated with PSIF by Dr. L. A. Goldstein. The assessment included identified subsequent spine surgery, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Scoliosis Research Society-7 (SRS-7), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29). The health-related quality of life was compared with U.S. norms and, within the cohort, was compared by patient factors, LIV, and subsequent spine surgery.

- **Results**: In this study, 134 patients (42.7%) were identified; 24 (7.6%) had died, 81 (25.8%) consented to participate in the study, and 29 (9.2%) declined participation. The mean follow-up was 45.4 years (range, 40 to 56 years). There were 81 patients who completed the surveys, 77 patients who completed the SRS-7, 77 patients who completed the ODI, and 76 patients who completed the PROMIS-29 and EQ-5D. There were 12.8% of patients with LIV L3 or proximal and 36.4% with LIV L4 or distal who had an additional surgical procedure (odds ratio, 3.98).

### Outcomes evaluating quality of life and their measurement properties in early-onset scoliosis: A systematic review [^114GCbRw]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Low credibility.

Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) is a spinal deformity affecting children under the age of 10. Understanding the impact of EOS on quality of life can be achieved through appropriate patient/carer-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The aim of this systematic review was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the evidence for the measurement properties of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) outcome measures in the EOS population.

- **Methods**: A two-stage search methodology was conducted across the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, PsychINFO, and CINAHL databases. Search one identified PROMs used to evaluate the quality of life in EOS, and search two identified studies of the measurement properties of these PROMs. Two reviewers were involved in searching, study screening and selection, and assessing studies for risk of bias using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias checklist. One reviewer performed data extraction. Evidence for each measurement property per PROM was summarized and evaluated using a modified GRADE approach.

- **Results**: Search one identified 19 PROMs (10 disease-specific, 9 generic) that have been used to assess HR-QoL or a relevant domain in the EOS population. Search two identified only one PROM (the 24-item Early-Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire, EOSQ) with eligible studies (n = 4) evaluating measurement properties. There is low-quality evidence for sufficient content validity, very low-quality evidence for sufficient reliability, and low-quality evidence for sufficient criterion validity.

### The smallest worthwhile effect as a promising alternative to the MCID in estimating PROMs for adult idiopathic scoliosis [^116M3nzW]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

In addition to overlooking important patient-centered factors, the MCID has inherent limitations that affect its clinical application. One major issue is the heterogeneity arising from the arbitrary selection of cutoff points on the anchors that are used to determine clinically important responses. In addition to the conventional anchor-based method, alternative approaches, such as the 15-point Likert scale and latent class analysis, have also been used to select cutoff values for MCID estimations.

Methodologically, the classification of anchor-based responses and the distribution of patients across these response categories may also affect the MCID estimation. Although using the 50th or 90th percentile for SWE estimation is arbitrary, individually determined SWE values are not classified into arbitrarily defined groups for sample-based SWE estimation. Moreover, the ordinal scales of the SRS-22r and SRS-30 introduced bias to the MCID thresholds as well as to the SWE estimates. Although the Likert scaling of the SRS-22r allows for the same numerical improvement between different scores, the improvement may have different clinical implications depending on the baseline scores. Rasch modeling offers a potential strategy to address this issue effectively. In addition, recall bias possibly skewed the anchors that were recorded at least 2 years postoperatively. These limitations raise concerns about the applicability of the MCID for interpreting clinical outcomes.

### Is the SRS-22 instrument responsive to change in adult scoliosis patients having primary spinal deformity surgery [^113UM6cy]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

This multicenter study aims to prospectively analyze the responsiveness of the SRS-22 to changes at 1 and 2 years following primary surgery.

A number of efforts have been directed at the validation of the SRS-22 instrument in the setting of adolescent and adult spinal deformity. However, few studies have extensively analyzed the instrument's ability to detect changes brought on by surgical treatment in adult scoliosis patients.

Methods: A multicenter prospective series of consecutive adult scoliosis patients (all primary/no revisions) were administered SRS-22, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Short Form-12 (SF-12) questionnaires preoperation and 1 and 2 years postoperation. Fifty-six patients had preoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 2-year postoperative data.

Results: The greatest changes from preoperation to 2-year postoperation were observed in the SRS self-image domain, followed by SRS total, SRS pain, and ODI scores. SRS pain and function scores significantly (P < 0.05) improved from 1-year to 2-year postoperation. There were no substantial differences in the outcome measures according to age or curve type. All outcome measures except SF-12 mental health showed statistically significant (P < 0.05) improvement from baseline to 2-year follow-up.

Conclusion: Based on these three outcome tools, the greatest responsiveness to change was demonstrated by the SRS self-image domain, followed by SRS total, then SRS pain, and finally ODI. This suggests that the SRS tool is more responsive than ODI, which, in turn, is more responsive than SF-12.
