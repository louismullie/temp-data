## Question

What are the latest advancements in ARDS treatment and management protocols?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest advancements in ARDS treatment and management protocols. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about scope and source hierarchy so I rely on the most current, high-credibility guidelines. Then, I should verify foundational ventilatory standards versus newly updated recommendations. Next, I will examine pharmacologic updates, adjuncts like ECMO and proning, and fluid strategy. After that, I need to compare ATS 2024 and ESICM 2023 where they diverge. Finally, I will integrate COVID-19–specific considerations, resource adaptation, and remaining knowledge gaps to complete a clinically actionable synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the scope and prioritize sources. I need to ensure we are discussing adult ARDS, not neonatal RDS, and emphasize guideline-grade evidence. The 2024 ATS guideline is the anchor, complemented by ESICM 2023 for respiratory support, with WHO COVID-19 living guidance clarifying applicability to COVID-related ARDS; I should exclude neonatal RDS guidance from the main analysis to avoid conflation given distinct populations and interventions.

> Now, I will verify the bedrock ventilatory strategy because I must not skip established standards. Low tidal volume ventilation at 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with plateau pressure under 30 cm H2O remains the core standard and is reaffirmed across 2017 and 2024 guideline iterations; this is also retained as a performance focus by ATS 2024, so I should keep this central as it frames all adjuncts around lung protection [^116p3RQh] [^116CBaNb] [^112G7AHn] [^113wiDYs].

> Next, I should review PEEP strategy updates carefully. The major 2024 change is a conditional suggestion to use higher PEEP, specifically without lung recruitment maneuvers, in moderate to severe ARDS; I need to remember there is insufficient evidence in mild ARDS and possible harm signals, so I should avoid extrapolating upward PEEP there. ESICM 2023 does not make a routine recommendation for higher versus lower PEEP, which I need to flag as an inter-guideline divergence that hinges on scope and evidence synthesis choices [^1116v4vi] [^11439Z94] [^113uMcQN] [^112MrF8X].

> Hold on, I should verify the position on recruitment maneuvers because practice varies. ATS 2024 recommends against prolonged recruitment maneuvers (for example, maintaining PEEP ≥ 35 cm H2O for more than 60 seconds) due to probable harm, while acknowledging uncertainty about brief maneuvers and esophageal pressure–guided strategies; this means I should actively avoid prolonged maneuvers and not assume brief RMs are benign without individualized risk assessment [^1174TiLC] [^11439Z94].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought recruitment maneuvers had a "performance measure" designation and I even restated the low tidal volume and plateau targets in that context, but that was a mistake; performance measure emphasis in ATS 2024 pertains to maintaining low tidal volumes and to prone positioning in severe ARDS, not to performing recruitment maneuvers, which are in fact discouraged when prolonged, so I need to correct that conflation here [^113wiDYs] [^1174TiLC].

> I will now examine prone positioning because this is often underused despite robust evidence. For severe ARDS, prone positioning for at least 12 hours per day is strongly recommended and remains a high-priority measure; I should confirm that ATS 2024 retains this emphasis and that it continues to be a quality focus, anchoring its use early when hypoxemia is severe [^116p3RQh] [^113wiDYs].

> Let me consider neuromuscular blockade next and be precise about severity and timing. ATS 2024 suggests NMBAs in early severe ARDS with low certainty, supported by pooled analyses showing a mortality signal when compared with deep sedation and possible reductions in barotrauma, but I should counsel about probable increases in ICU-acquired weakness; ESICM 2023 recommends against routine use in moderate to severe ARDS, so I need to target NMBAs to early severe cases with clear ventilator dyssynchrony or refractory hypoxemia rather than employing them indiscriminately [^111VZ4DD] [^113uMcQN] [^115YqN98].

> I need to check the stance on corticosteroids because this is a notable update. ATS 2024 suggests corticosteroids for ARDS with moderate certainty, but warns about heterogeneity in dose, timing, and regimen and limited safety data, which means I should individualize choices and consider borrowing regimens from conditions with clearer evidence when etiologically appropriate; the 2024 SCCM focused update also supports steroid use in ARDS, reinforcing the shift toward conditional adoption while we await regimen standardization [^notfound] [^113crMig] [^1175gJRH].

> Let me verify ECMO indications because this is resource-intensive and should be precisely framed. ATS 2024 suggests venovenous ECMO in selected severe ARDS with probable mortality reduction in pooled trials, but I must ensure referral to experienced centers, careful selection for reversibility, and sequencing after proning and optimized lung-protective ventilation; planning documents from the pandemic era also emphasize systems readiness and safe interfacility transport for ECMO candidates [^111PHjKp] [^11765EBy] [^113b6L3C].

> I should review fluid management, since it influences lung edema and ventilator course. A conservative fluid strategy in ARDS without tissue hypoperfusion remains standard, improving ventilator-free days without increasing shock or renal failure, and WHO COVID-19 guidance aligns with this approach; I need to avoid positive fluid balance while continually reassessing perfusion and fluid responsiveness to prevent iatrogenic pulmonary edema [^116zGogc] [^114hxYYb].

> But wait, what about inhaled pulmonary vasodilators; are they an "advancement" or still rescue only. Routine inhaled nitric oxide is not recommended given lack of outcome benefit, though a short trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator can be considered as a rescue for refractory hypoxemia in severe COVID-19 ARDS, with immediate taper if no rapid improvement, so I should not position these as standard care [^113dtsLT] [^111jzSZb].

> Next, I should review how recommendations are being personalized by severity, because misapplication across strata can cause harm. ATS 2024 limits higher PEEP recommendations to moderate to severe ARDS, targets NMBAs to early severe ARDS, and suggests VV-ECMO in selected severe cases, reflecting a broader push toward phenotyping and treatable traits; ESICM 2023 explicitly highlights phenotyping and respiratory-mechanics–informed strategies, which I should integrate thoughtfully rather than applying one-size-fits-all protocols [^112CEtUu] [^116ZBDsA].

> Hold on, I should verify whether COVID-19 ARDS warrants a fundamentally different approach. Despite initial speculation about unique physiology, guideline consensus is that core ARDS management principles apply to COVID-19 ARDS, including low tidal volume ventilation, cautious PEEP titration, proning, and conservative fluids, with only minor adjustments and the same caution against routine nitric oxide use, so I should not deviate from evidence-based ARDS care solely due to COVID etiology [^114HNg8G] [^1165Gb6U].

> I need to ensure we address implementation in resource-limited settings because feasibility matters. WHO guidance and broader implementation literature emphasize that conservative fluids, low tidal volume ventilation, and prone positioning are feasible cornerstones even where resources are constrained; I should anticipate staffing and training needs for safe proning and develop referral pathways for advanced therapies like ECMO where available [^116zGogc] [^111aakgR].

> Let me now compare key inter-guideline differences so clinicians can navigate divergent advice. ATS 2024 conditionally supports higher PEEP without recruitment maneuvers in moderate to severe ARDS, whereas ESICM 2023 does not make a routine recommendation for higher versus lower PEEP; ATS suggests early NMBAs in severe ARDS while ESICM recommends against routine NMBA use in moderate to severe ARDS, reflecting differences in included evidence and framing, and both caution against prolonged recruitment maneuvers with ongoing uncertainty regarding brief maneuvers [^113uMcQN] [^116ZBDsA].

> Finally, I should outline the main knowledge gaps to temper certainty and guide practice. We still need standardized corticosteroid regimens, better ECMO selection tools, clarity on safe thresholds for brief recruitment maneuvers, and long-term outcomes for NMBA and ECMO strategies; precision medicine approaches and enrichment designs are logical next steps to reconcile ARDS heterogeneity with targeted interventions and should inform future guideline updates [^112M1ecQ] [^111PHjKp] [^11439Z94] [^113fsQWA].

> In summary, the most meaningful 2024 advancements are conditional endorsements of corticosteroids for ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected severe cases, carefully higher PEEP without recruitment maneuvers in moderate to severe ARDS, and early NMBA use limited to severe ARDS, all on the unchanged backbone of low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning in severe disease, and conservative fluid management; careful severity stratification, alignment with COVID-19 ARDS evidence, and resource-aware implementation are essential to translate these into improved outcomes at the bedside [^1175gJRH] [^113wiDYs] [^116p3RQh] [^116zGogc].

This document updates previously published clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

- **Methods**: We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

- **Results**: We suggest the use of 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty). Additionally, we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

- **Conclusions**: We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision-making and implementation of these recommendations.

Our recommendations are largely consistent with recent guidelines published by the ESICM, although differences in methodology and the specific elements of clinical questions addressed account for some areas of divergence. With regard to PEEP, the ESICM guideline makes no recommendation for, or against the routine use of higher versus lower PEEP strategies in ARDS, whereas we suggest the use of higher PEEP in select patients. However, it is important to note that our recommendation is narrower with regard to the patient population (moderate to severe ARDS only) and intervention (higher PEEP without accompanying recruitment maneuvers). Recommendations on NMBAs are also notably different: the ESICM guideline recommends against routine NMBA use in moderate to severe ARDS, whereas we suggest its use in early severe ARDS. This contrast reflects differences in studies and outcomes included in the evidence syntheses and, as with PEEP, our recommendations focus on a more limited patient population (severe ARDS only) and more specific intervention (early use of NMBAs).

- **Peep and recruitment maneuvers**:

	- In patients with ARDS undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, does routine PEEP titration using a higher PEEP/FiO2 strategy compared to a lower PEEP/FiO2 strategy reduce mortality?

- **Background**: In patients with ARDS, surfactant dysfunction, effects of gravity on the edematous lung, and heterogeneous injury predispose to regional lung derecruitment with alveolar collapse and small airways closure. The resulting mechanical heterogeneity of the lung, with regional differences in alveolar compliance and distension, is thought to be an important driver of ventilation-induced lung injury in ARDS. Positive end-expiratory pressure may offset these forces, promoting lung recruitment and attenuating mechanical heterogeneity. PEEP is also routinely applied to facilitate adequate oxygenation. Yet, excessive PEEP can exacerbate over-distension, potentially predisposing to hyperinflation lung injury and hemodynamic compromise. The following analyses evaluate randomized clinical trials for effects of various PEEP strategies on mortality, ventilator-free days, barotrauma, and hemodynamic compromise.

### An official American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: Mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116p3RQh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the use of mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

- **Results**: For all patients with ARDS, the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H₂O). For patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (high confidence in effect estimates) and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure (moderate confidence in effect estimates). Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for, or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

- **Conclusions**: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected ventilatory interventions for adult patients with ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations.

### COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: Is a different approach to management warranted [^1142FyTw]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units worldwide. As the experience of managing patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS has grown, efforts to classify patients according to respiratory system mechanics have increased, aiming to optimize ventilatory management. Personalized lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS.

In this viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS possesses distinctive features that differentiate it from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, whether associated with COVID-19 or not, are broadly similar. In the absence of evidence supporting a shift away from the paradigm of ventilatory management, we strongly recommend adherence to evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, as resources permit.

Although higher PEEP was consistently associated with lower mortality in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, the panel issued a conditional recommendation due to a high level of heterogeneity among higher PEEP strategies in the included RCTs. For patients with mild ARDS, there were insufficient data to make a recommendation on PEEP strategy because these patients were excluded from the network meta-analysis. However, there appears to be no benefit of high PEEP versus low PEEP, and there is a potential trend toward harm.

- **Prolonged LRMs**: The panel issued a strong recommendation against their use in combination with high PEEP strategies based on the network meta-analysis, demonstrating a high posterior probability of harm, presumably due to serious adverse hemodynamic effects. Although shorter LRMs may be better tolerated, the safe upper limit for LRM pressure or duration is not known and may vary between individual patients.

- **Brief LRMs and esophageal pressures**: There was a lack of consensus among the panel on brief LRMs and the use of esophageal pressures to set PEEP due to high levels of uncertainty regarding the true effect of these strategies.

A reasonable implementation approach for patients with moderate to severe ARDS would be to adopt a higher PEEP strategy previously implemented in the RCTs included in the aforementioned meta-analyses. Techniques that have been described include oxygenation-based titration (i.e. using a PEEP/F O2 table), increasing PEEP to a maximal safe plateau pressure, and titration to maximal PEEP.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^112595Uz]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) care pathways evolve slowly as new evidence emerges. We report the sixth version of "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS" by a panel of experienced European neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the end of 2022. Optimising outcomes for babies with RDS includes prediction of the risk of preterm delivery, appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal centre, and appropriate and timely use of antenatal steroids.

Evidence-based lung-protective management includes initiation of non-invasive respiratory support from birth, judicious use of oxygen, early surfactant administration, caffeine therapy, and avoidance of intubation and mechanical ventilation where possible. Methods of ongoing non-invasive respiratory support have been further refined and may help reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease, although minimising time spent on mechanical ventilation by targeted use of postnatal corticosteroids remains essential.

The general care of infants with RDS is also reviewed, including emphasis on appropriate cardiovascular support and judicious use of antibiotics as important determinants of the best outcome. We would like to dedicate this guideline to the memory of Professor Henry Halliday, who died on November 12, 2022. These updated guidelines contain evidence from recent Cochrane reviews and medical literature since 2019. The strength of evidence supporting recommendations has been evaluated using the GR.

Evidence summary

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) were evaluated in seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included 1,598 patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that NMBAs may decrease mortality for patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared with those who did not receive NMBAs (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98; low certainty). However, concerns related to inconsistency and individual study risk of bias led to a low certainty of evidence.

- **Subgroup analyses**: Demonstrated a reduction in mortality for patients receiving NMBAs compared with deep sedation (n = 3 studies, 431 patients; RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.91), an effect not seen in the single RCT that compared NMBAs versus light sedation (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15).

- **Additional findings**: NMBA use was probably associated with a reduced incidence of barotrauma (n = 4 studies, 1,437 patients; RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85; moderate certainty) and a possible increase in ventilator-free days (n = 5 studies; MD, 0.89 days more; 95% CI, 0.38 fewer to 2.18 more; low certainty), but also probably increased the rates of ICU-acquired weakness (n = 4 studies, 885 patients; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.98–1.37; moderate certainty).

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^113qws1E]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, particularly in relation to hemodynamic control, the ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend initiating IV fluids of 70–80 mL/kg/day in a humidified incubator for most infants. More fluids should be considered for very immature infants. Fluid management should be tailored individually based on serum sodium levels, urine output, and weight loss.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111PCbCH]. Neonatology (2023). Low credibility.

Survival of preterm infants continues to improve, with those at 22–23 weeks of gestation now having reasonable chances of making it home to their families. There is a growing trend towards offering initial life support to infants born at lower perceived levels of viability, which in some countries is now defined as low as 22 weeks of gestation. However, we caution that recommendations given in these guidelines are based on evidence from studies, which almost without exception, have been generated in times where the resuscitation of the most preterm infants was not often attempted, and until very recently, infants of the lowest gestations were not included in clinical trials. We therefore recommend caution when applying recommendations to the most preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Until more evidence is available, these guidelines apply mainly to management of RDS in infants with gestational ages of greater than 24 weeks. Managing RDS remains a key component of neonatal intensive care. European data from 2014 to 2016 show that around 50% of all babies born between 22 +0 and 32 +6 weeks receive surfactant; therefore, relevant skills for surfactant administration and mechanical ventilation (MV) remain important.

RDS is caused by pulmonary immaturity and surfactant deficiency, resulting in respiratory insufficiency from soon after birth. There is now less emphasis on radiographic diagnosis and grading of RDS, such as "ground glass with air bronchograms". Definitions based on blood gas analyses are also redundant, as management has evolved to focus more on clinical presentation and response to treatment.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: Diagnosis, outcomes, long-term sequelae, and management [^115vRXwx]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is defined by the Berlin criteria. In this series paper, the diagnosis, management, outcomes, and long-term sequelae of ARDS are reviewed. Potential limitations of the ARDS definition and evidence that could inform future revisions are considered. Guideline recommendations, evidence, and uncertainties in relation to ARDS management are discussed. The future of ARDS strives towards a precision medicine approach, and the framework of treatable traits in ARDS diagnosis and management is explored.

### Nonventilatory treatments for acute lung injury and ARDS [^114hxYYb]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, advances in the ventilatory management of acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS have improved outcomes; however, until recently, the search for other therapies has been less fruitful. Recently, the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial reported that a conservative fluid management strategy, compared with a fluid liberal strategy, increased the mean (± SE) number of ventilator-free days in patients with ALI (14.6 ± 0.5 vs. 12.1 ± 0.5 days, respectively; p < 0.001). In addition to this beneficial effect on outcomes, the study found that the conservative fluid strategy did not increase the incidence of renal failure or the development of shock.

Other studies have demonstrated that albumin and furosemide therapy may be beneficial in hypoproteinemic patients with lung injury, although data on outcomes is still lacking. Although several pharmacologic therapies, such as corticosteroids, surfactant, and nitric oxide, have been demonstrated to be ineffective in improving outcomes, several promising new treatments are being investigated in ongoing or upcoming clinical trials. This article reviews these developments and other recent research on the optimal nonventilatory management of patients with ALI.

### Treatment of ARDS [^114poGVr]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS has led to important advances in the treatment of ALI/ARDS, particularly in the area of ventilator-associated lung injury. Standard supportive care for ALI/ARDS should now include a protective ventilatory strategy with low tidal volume ventilation by the protocol developed by the National Institutes of Health ARDS Network. Further refinements of the protocol for mechanical ventilation will occur as future clinical trials are completed. In addition, novel modes of mechanical ventilation are being studied and may augment standard therapy in the future. Although results of anti-inflammatory strategies have been disappointing in clinical trials, further trials are underway to test the efficacy of late corticosteroids and other approaches to modulation of inflammation in ALI/ARDS.

Regarding respiratory support for COVID-19 infection, particularly in the context of mechanical ventilation, SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend considering a higher PEEP strategy over a lower PEEP strategy in mechanically ventilated adult patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS. It is crucial to monitor patients for barotrauma when using a higher PEEP strategy (> 10 cmH₂O).

Evidence-based, lung-protective management includes the initiation of non-invasive respiratory support from birth, judicious use of oxygen, early surfactant administration, caffeine therapy, and avoidance of intubation and mechanical ventilation where possible. Methods of ongoing non-invasive respiratory support have been further refined and may help reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease, although minimizing time spent on mechanical ventilation by targeted use of postnatal corticosteroids remains essential.

The general care of infants with RDS is also reviewed, with an emphasis on appropriate cardiovascular support and the judicious use of antibiotics as important determinants of the best outcome. We would like to dedicate this guideline to the memory of Professor Henry Halliday, who died on November 12, 2022. These updated guidelines contain evidence from recent Cochrane reviews and medical literature since 2019. The strength of the evidence supporting recommendations has been evaluated.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome - 2016 update [^116jNFtu]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ensure that clinicians must continue to revise practice. We report the third update of the European Guidelines for the Management of RDS by a European panel of expert neonatologists, including input from an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the beginning of 2016. Optimizing the outcome for babies with RDS includes considering when to use antenatal steroids, incorporating good obstetric practice, predicting the risk of preterm delivery, and considering whether transfer to a perinatal center is necessary and safe.

Methods for optimal delivery room management have become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection, including initiation of continuous positive airway pressure and titration of oxygen, should be implemented soon after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of the management of RDS. Newer protocols for surfactant administration aim to avoid exposure to mechanical ventilation, with more evidence of differences among various surfactants in clinical use. New methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been developed, offering potential for greater comfort and less chronic lung disease.

As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease. Minimizing the time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome - 2019 update [^1129Diws]. Neonatology (2019). Low credibility.

As management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) advances, clinicians must continually revise their practice. We report the fourth update of the "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS", developed by a European panel of experienced neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician, based on available literature up to the end of 2018.

Optimizing outcomes for babies with RDS includes predicting the risk of preterm delivery, ensuring appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal center, and timely use of antenatal steroids. Delivery room management has become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection, including the initiation of CPAP and titration of oxygen, should be implemented immediately after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of RDS management; newer protocols recommend early administration and avoidance of mechanical ventilation. Methods for maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been further developed, potentially reducing distress and chronic lung disease.

As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of lung injury should decrease. Minimizing time on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimizing general care of infants with RDS are essential. Good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion, and judicious use of antibiotics are all important determinants of the best outcomes.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^115YqN98]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The aim of these guidelines is to update the 2017 clinical practice guideline (CPG) of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). The scope of this CPG is limited to adult patients and non-pharmacological respiratory support strategies across different aspects of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including ARDS due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These guidelines were formulated by an international panel of clinical experts, one methodologist, and patients' representatives on behalf of the ESICM. The review was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade recommendations and the quality of reporting of each study based on the EQUATOR (Enhancing the Quality and Transparency Of health Research) network guidelines. The CPG addressed 21 questions and formulates 21 recommendations on the following domains:

- **Definition**
- **Phenotyping and respiratory support strategies**: Including high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNO), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), tidal volume setting, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers (RM), prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, and extracorporeal life support (ECLS).

In addition, the CPG includes expert opinion on clinical practice and identifies areas for future research.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^115ScPkE]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, specifically concerning noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, the ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend considering initiating noninvasive ventilation with early rescue surfactant. This should be done using the less invasive surfactant administration technique in infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^112ksMNQ]. Neonatology (2023). Low credibility.

Surfactant administration methods: Surfactant must be delivered directly to the trachea, and in most of the early trials, it was given as a bolus through an endotracheal tube, distributed by IPPV followed by a period of weaning ventilation. The IN-SUR-E technique, involving surfactant bolus administration followed by brief bag ventilation and rapid extubation without ongoing ventilation, seemed to reduce lung injury. The accepted best method is to use a thin catheter for surfactant administration and avoid "bagging" completely, allowing the infant to maintain spontaneous breathing on CPAP while surfactant is gradually instilled in small aliquots. This method, known as less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) or minimally invasive surfactant administration, results in less need for MV and a reduction in the combined outcome of death or BPD as well as a reduction in IVH in head-to-head comparisons with IN-SUR-E at identical treatment thresholds.

However, meta-analyses of multiple, individually small, non-blinded, underpowered studies may lead to over-estimating the benefits of LISA. The largest study (OPTIMIST) randomized 485 babies of 25–28 weeks with blinding of the intervention: LISA surfactant versus sham procedure at FiO2 threshold 30%. Although there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death or BPD, there was a significant reduction in BPD in survivors favoring the treated infants (37% vs. 45%). However, it is unclear if any differences can be attributed solely to the LISA method, as earlier compared to later surfactant in RDS is already known.

### 2021 acute respiratory distress syndrome update, with coronavirus disease 2019 focus [^116usHWQ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous lung disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients, including those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019. Despite recent advances in pathophysiology, diagnostics, and therapeutics, ARDS is dangerously underdiagnosed, and supportive lung protective ventilation and prone positioning remain the mainstay interventions. Rescue therapies, including neuromuscular blockade and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, remain a key component of clinical practice, although benefits are unclear. Even though coronavirus disease 2019 ARDS has some distinguishing features from traditional ARDS, including delayed onset, hyperinflammatory response, and pulmonary microthrombi, it is clinically similar to traditional ARDS and should be treated with established supportive therapies.

### What is the legacy of the National Institutes of Health Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network [^112EN9eX]. Respiratory Care (2009). High credibility.

It has been almost 15 years since the National Institutes of Health created the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Trials Network (ARDS Network) and nearly a decade since the completion of the landmark low-tidal volume (V(T)) trial. In retrospect, the ARDS Network had a profound impact on the design and conduct of clinical trials in critical care. It represented the first time the federal government funded a clinical trials network devoted to Phase-III testing of important, non-pharmacologic therapies. Also, the ARDS Network introduced factorial design into critical-care research, which allowed Phase-II testing of promising therapies.

Other important contributions from the ARDS Network may not become apparent for many years. These contributions include the ongoing mentoring of a new generation of critical-care researchers, as well as continued testing on an enormous store of biological samples that inevitably will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS. Perhaps someday this may lead to another therapeutic breakthrough.

Part of the ARDS Network's legacy surely will have been the opening of a dialog regarding the design of clinical trials in critical care, as well as a concerted effort to improve the protection of subjects enrolled into those trials. Finally, the respiratory care profession itself has benefited, owing both to its critical role in the successful implementation of complicated therapist-driven protocols and also to the ARDS Network's novel practice of utilizing respiratory therapists as clinical coordinators. This has raised the profile and enhanced the capacity of respiratory therapists.

### Current and evolving standards of care for patients with ARDS [^112qpXUj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has changed considerably over the 50 years since its original description. Indeed, standards of care continue to evolve, as does how this clinical entity is defined and how patients are grouped and treated in clinical practice. In this narrative review, we discuss standards — treatments that have a solid evidence base and are well established as targets for usual care — and also evolving standards — treatments that have promise and may become widely adopted in the future.

We focus on three broad domains of ventilatory management, ventilation adjuncts, and pharmacotherapy.

- **Ventilatory management**: Standards include limitation of tidal volume and airway pressure, as well as standard approaches to setting PEEP. Evolving standards may focus on the limitation of driving pressure or mechanical power, individual titration of PEEP, and monitoring efforts during spontaneous breathing.

- **Ventilation adjuncts**: Standards include prone positioning in moderate-severe ARDS and veno-venous extracorporeal life support following prone positioning in patients with severe hypoxemia or who are difficult to ventilate.

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Standards include corticosteroids for patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and employing a conservative fluid strategy for patients not in shock. Evolving standards may encompass steroids for ARDS not related to COVID-19 or specific biological agents being tested in appropriate sub-phenotypes of ARDS.

While much progress has been made, significant work certainly remains to be done.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114LTwuy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The update was proposed by the chairs (E.F. and A.W.) and co-chairs (L.M. N.Q. S.S., and C.S.) to the ATS Critical Care Assembly and was approved by the ATS Board of Directors. The chairs and co-chairs identified a diverse group of panelists with expertise in ARDS epidemiology, clinical trials, methodology, pharmacology, and physiology. We formed four groups to address individual interventions, each led by a co-chair with an assigned methodologist with expertise in Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Panel members were assigned to groups based on their expressed interest and expertise. All guideline meetings were held via video conference.

- **Conflict of interest policy**: All committee members disclosed potential conflicts of interest and financial relationships in accordance with ATS policy. New or updated conflicts of interest were solicited annually by the chair (E.F.).

- **Formulating clinical questions**: The panel co-chairs developed an initial set of four PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome) questions centered around ARDS management that were not addressed in the initial guideline (corticosteroids, NMBAs), or for which substantial and potentially practice-changing new evidence had emerged since the last iteration (VV-ECMO, PEEP, LRMs). Each question was assigned to a subcommittee. Subcommittee members finalized the specific elements of the four questions after detailed discussion and consideration of importance, availability of evidence, and perceived patient preferences.

### Potential reevaluation needed for the meta-analysis of high-pressure recruitment maneuvers in the 2023 ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116PUmB2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The latest guidelines for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) proposed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) have been published a year ago. We appreciate the outstanding contributions made by the experts in the guidelines. We would like to offer the following insights regarding the prolonged high-pressure recruitment maneuvers (RMs) and brief high-pressure RMs mentioned in the guidelines.

First, after reviewing the meta-analysis on prolonged and brief high-pressure RMs in the supplementary materials of the guidelines, we found that, according to Kacmarek et al, their article might be categorized under prolonged high-pressure RMs. Prolonged high-pressure RMs is defined as maintaining airway pressure above 35 cmH₂O for over 1 minute. However, a further review of other literature and guidelines suggests that this classification may be unfounded. No clinical or animal studies indicate a significant difference between prolonged and brief high-pressure RMs in ARDS, especially using 1 minute as the cutoff. Strictly distinguishing them may be meaningless, as they essentially both belong to open lung ventilation (OLV). We believe it may be more reasonable to consider them collectively when analyzing the impact of OLV on ARDS patients.

### Fluid administration and monitoring in ARDS: Which management [^112WeLYB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Modalities of fluid management in patients sustaining acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are challenging and controversial. Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body while avoiding inadvertent increases in lung edema, which further impair gas exchange. In ARDS patients, a positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stays, and higher mortality.

Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings. Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies significantly improved oxygenation and reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation but had no significant effect on mortality.

Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e. early vs. late period). The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, predicting fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficient — hence respiratory detrimental — fluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should preferably be used.

### What's new in ARDS: ARDS also exists in resource-constrained settings [^111aakgR]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Does it matter that ARDS exists in resource-constrained settings but is rarely recognized? Yes. It matters because recognition is necessary to improve outcomes. First, recognition allows implementation of interventions that are clearly feasible in resource-constrained settings, such as conservative fluid management for both prevention and supportive care.

Second, recognition allows research into the risks and benefits of applying interventions that are known to be effective in resource-rich settings but could be less safe in settings with fewer trained staff. For example, proning for severe ARDS is theoretically possible given that it requires no particular technology; however, the ability to perform it safely with the few staff available may be a barrier. A trial in Bangladesh that found possible harm from early enteral feeding in cerebral malaria is a good example of the need to test interventions in both resource-rich and resource-constrained environments, where the risks and benefits may be very different.

Third, recognition allows research into ARDS triggers and lung injury pathways that may differ in various contexts and populations. ARDS associated with malaria, HIV, or tuberculosis in Africa may represent a different set of molecular pathways than ARDS associated with community-acquired pneumonia in Europe. Just as research in sepsis requires pursuing targeted molecular therapies that include resource-limited settings, the heterogeneity of ARDS triggers and presentations also highlights the need for trials in settings beyond resource-rich countries.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^115yNSow]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

- **Recommendations**:
	1. CPAP or (s)NIPPV should be initiated at birth in all babies at risk of RDS, such as those < 30 weeks of gestation who do not require intubation for stabilization (A1).

	2. NIV with early rescue surfactant using the LISA technique is considered optimal management for babies with RDS (A1).

	3. The system delivering CPAP is of minor importance; however, the interface should use short binasal prongs or a mask with a starting pressure of about 6–8 cm H₂O (A2). The ability to escalate to NIPPV can reduce the need for invasive MV in some infants (A1).

	4. BIPAP devices provide no advantages over CPAP alone (A2). However, synchronized NIPPV, when delivered through a ventilator, can decrease the need for ventilation or re-ventilation following extubation and may reduce BPD (A2).

	5. HFNC can be utilized as an alternative to CPAP for some infants, offering the benefit of less nasal trauma, provided centers have access to CPAP or NIPPV for those failing this mode (B2).

- **MV strategies**:
	- Despite efforts to maintain as many preterm babies as possible on NIV, approximately half of babies < 28 weeks will require MV and those undergoing MV have poorer outcomes. Similarly, about half of infants < 28 weeks will not succeed in their first extubation attempt, which also correlates with worse outcomes. It is crucial for those managing infants with RDS to understand MV principles to minimize the risk of iatrogenic lung injury. The goal of MV is to achieve "acceptable" blood gases by ventilating at optimal lung volumes (open lung concept) while avoiding both over-distension and atelectasis.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^113oAzaz]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, specifically with respect to surfactant therapy, the ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend administering rescue surfactant early in the course of the disease. Consider administering surfactant in worsening infants with respiratory distress syndrome when FiO₂ requirements are greater than 0.30 on CPAP of 6 cmH₂O or more, or if a lung ultrasound suggests surfactant is needed.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111FeznM]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Modern ventilators are equipped with flow sensors that measure the volume of gas entering and leaving the endotracheal tube. These sensors help synchronize mechanical ventilation (MV) with the infant's own breathing efforts and may be used to limit support to prevent lung over-distension. Volume-targeted ventilation (VTV) allows for real-time weaning of pressure as lung compliance improves, resulting in less time on ventilation, fewer air leaks, and less bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Setting an initial tidal volume of around 5 mL/kg with a maximum peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at a safe level, around 25–30 cm H₂O, and adjusting initial tidal volumes based on the assessment of work of breathing and blood gas measurements is usually straightforward. However, difficulties may arise if there is a significant endotracheal tube leak. Adjusting positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain an open lung involves finding a point where the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) is at its lowest with hemodynamic stability and acceptable blood gases. Required tidal volumes typically vary around 5–7 mL/kg, with the range tending to increase with postnatal age.

- **Ventilation modes**: Modes that support every spontaneous breath, rather than synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), are logical. However, if volume targeting is not possible, using synchronized IMV where the ventilation rate is clinician-controlled may be safer. Volume targeting can reduce hypocarbia even in the smallest infants. Supporting the infant's own respiratory efforts with modes where both inspiration and expiration are synchronized, such as pressure support or neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA), can improve patient comfort and facilitate weaning. However, no differences have been shown in longer-term clinical outcomes at the time of writing.

- **High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)**: HFOV is a ventilation strategy…

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^116YETcU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The ESICM 2023 guidelines on respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, particularly regarding mechanical ventilation and tidal volume targets, recommend using low tidal volume ventilation strategies, specifically 4–8 mL/kg of predicted body weight, over traditionally high tidal volumes. This approach aims to reduce mortality in patients with ARDS not attributable to COVID-19.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^111g4Qqg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, specifically concerning mechanical ventilation and PEEP targets, the ESICM 2023 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against PEEP titration guided principally by respiratory mechanics over the PEEP/FiO2 strategy to reduce mortality in patients with ARDS, including those with COVID-19.

### Fifty years of research in ARDS. Is acute respiratory distress syndrome a preventable disease [^112DKzhi]? American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in our understanding and management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the morbidity and mortality from ARDS remain high. Given the limited number of effective treatments for established ARDS, the strategic focus of ARDS research has shifted toward identifying patients with or at high risk of ARDS early in the course of the underlying illness. This early identification is crucial when strategies to reduce the development and progression of ARDS and associated organ failures can be systematically evaluated. In this review, we summarize the rationale, evidence, and future directions in ARDS prevention.

### Designing an ARDS trial for 2020 and beyond: Focus on enrichment strategies [^113fsQWA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

With the exception of a few successes in trials of supportive care, the majority of interventional clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have not led to new therapies. To improve the likelihood of benefit from clinical trial interventions in ARDS, clinical trial design must be improved. To optimize trial design, many factors need to be considered, including the type of therapy to be tested, the type of trial (phase 2 or 3), how patients will be selected, primary and secondary endpoints, and the strategy for conducting the trial, including potential newer trial designs such as platform or adaptive trials.

- **Optimization of patient selection**: Optimization of patient selection is central to the likelihood of success and is particularly relevant in ARDS, which is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome, not a homogeneous disease.

Recent advances, including improved understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms and better tools for outcome prediction in ARDS, should facilitate both predictive and prognostic enrichment. This commentary focuses on new information and novel methods for prognostic and predictive enrichment that may be useful to optimize patient selection and increase the likelihood of positive clinical trials in ARDS.

### Early treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1136oW3Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined by acute diffuse inflammatory lung injury invoked by a variety of systemic or pulmonary insults. Despite medical progress in management, mortality remains between 27% and 45%. Patients with ARDS should be managed with low tidal volume ventilation. Permissive hypercapnia is well tolerated. A conservative fluid strategy can reduce ventilator and hospital days in patients without shock. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers reduce mortality in some patients.

Early management of ARDS is crucial in emergency medicine. Identifying ARDS patients who should be transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center is an important task for emergency providers.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112P29t6]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

The understanding of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has evolved greatly since it was first described in a 1967 case series, with several subsequent updates to the definition of the syndrome. Basic science advances and clinical trials have provided insight into the mechanisms of lung injury in ARDS and led to reduced mortality through comprehensive critical care interventions. This review summarizes the understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of ARDS.

Key highlights include a recommended new global definition of ARDS and updated guidelines for managing ARDS on a backbone of established interventions such as low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a conservative fluid strategy. Future priorities for investigation of ARDS are also highlighted.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^117DdrAK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) improves outcomes and has been recommended for patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from acute exacerbations of COPD or patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In most prior guidelines, no specific recommendation has been made for the use of NIV for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from other etiologies due to insufficient evidence. Additionally, concerns have been raised about tolerance of NIV, ability to clear secretions, worsening lung injury from large tidal volumes on inspiratory pressure support (especially given the high inspiratory demand seen in AHRF), and possible harm resulting from delaying intubation.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, NIV was frequently used (up to 47% of ICU patients in Wuhan). Initial clinical practice guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Surviving Sepsis Campaign provided a weak recommendation in favor of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) compared to NIV for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, and for use of NIV if HFNO was not available or had failed. This recommendation was based upon data extrapolated from non-COVID-19 related AHRF, and studies in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that showed a high rate of intolerance and failure of NIV, with high mortality among those who failed NIV. In addition, concerns existed regarding the potential for increased aerosol transmission of the virus with NIV.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112CEtUu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Each group convened to develop initial recommendations for the individual PICO questions. The co-chairs and methodologists led the groups through a discussion of the evidence profiles and the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework to determine the direction and strength of the recommendations (see online supplement).

As part of the GRADE Evidence to Decision process, we considered the certainty of evidence; balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention; patient preferences and values; resource use; implications for health equity; acceptability of the intervention to stakeholders; and clinical feasibility. Evidence across the full spectrum of ARDS severity was unavailable for some interventions. For those interventions, recommendations were limited to the specific severity subgroups (i.e. mild, moderate, or severe) for which evidence was sufficient. No recommendation was made for the subgroups for which it was not. Each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional" (Table 2).

After the individual groups generated draft recommendations, these were presented to the full panel for detailed discussion, input, and approval. Final recommendations were determined by consensus of the full panel. Consistent with the GRADE approach, we had planned to use voting for recommendations that could not achieve consensus through discussion, but this was not required.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: Definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^112ebKE5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

After reviewing the results of the literature search and meta-analyses, members of each domain formulated statements (recommendations) related to each PICO/narrative question. Recommendations were based on the integration of three main criteria:

1. Certainty of evidence (as provided by the methodological assessment).
2. GRADE methodology.
3. Expert opinion.

Proposed recommendations along with corresponding summaries of evidence were presented and discussed in four online panel-wide meetings which included patient representatives. These meetings were recorded for members who were unable to attend and for accurate reporting of the panel discussion. Following each panel-wide meeting, recommendations were revised based on the feedback received. The finalized recommendations were then sent to each panel member for anonymous online voting. Strong recommendations were phrased as "recommendations", and weak recommendations were phrased as "suggestions". Approval of a recommendation required at least 80% of the panel to be in agreement. Recommendations with less than 80% agreement were reformulated and re-voted until more than 80% approval was achieved for all. A detailed description of the methodology is reported in the Supplementary Materials.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113crMig]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

- **Justification and implementation considerations**: There are several factors to consider for implementation. Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials may be considered.

Recommendations

1. Treatment of hypotension is recommended when there is evidence of poor tissue perfusion such as oliguria, acidosis, and poor capillary refill (C2). Treatment will depend on the cause.

2. When a decision is made to attempt pharmacologic closure of hemodynamically significant PDA, indomethacin, ibuprofen, or paracetamol can be used with a similar efficacy (A2). Paracetamol is preferred when there is thrombocytopaenia or concerns about renal function (B2).

3. Thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in infants can be set at 12 g/dL (HCT 36%) for those with severe cardiorespiratory disease, 11 g/dL (HCT 30%) for those who are oxygen dependent, and 7 g/dL (HCT 25%) for stable infants beyond 2 weeks of age (A2).

Miscellaneous

Therapy-resistant severe respiratory distress due to malformations, alveolar-capillary dysplasia, damaging mutations including SP-B, ABCA3, or TTF-1, or due to extreme structural immaturity is beyond the scope of these guidelines. On the other hand, surfactant therapy is reported to be useful in other serious situations where secondary surfactant inactivation occurs such as in pneumonia, pulmonary haemorrhage, or meconium aspiration syndrome. Surfactant has also been trialled in preterm infants with evolving BPD who remain on MV at 2 weeks of age. Although there was no reduction in BPD at 36 weeks, surfactant-treated infants had fewer episodes of rehospitalisation over the first year of life. Routine surfactant therapy is not recommended in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

Recommendations

Surfactant can be used for RDS

### SCCM issued recommendations for corticosteroid use in acutely ill adults with sepsis, ARDS, or CAP [^1176hwpL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) has issued new recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids in acutely ill adults diagnosed with sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This focused update outlines the updated guidelines and emphasizes the important role corticosteroids play in the management of these conditions. The recommendations are based on recent studies, including randomized controlled trials, and aim to improve patient outcomes by providing guidance on dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy.

Healthcare professionals are encouraged to review these guidelines to optimize care for their patients and integrate these findings into clinical practice effectively. This update represents a significant step in evidence-based practice and aims to unify therapeutic strategies for critically ill patients suffering from sepsis, ARDS, or CAP.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1175gJRH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This document updates previously published clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

- **Methods**: We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

- **Results**:
	- We suggest the use of corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).
	- Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is suggested for selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).
	- Neuromuscular blockers are suggested for patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).
	- Higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers is recommended as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty).
	- We recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision-making and implementation of these recommendations.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111PHjKp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

VV-ECMO facilitates oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal in patients with ARDS by draining blood from the venous system, allowing it to pass through a gas-exchange device, and then returning it to the venous system. It is an invasive, resource-intensive technology available at specialized centers that incurs significant cost and requires a considerable amount of human health resources. The use of VV-ECMO has increased substantially during the past several years, with notable increases seen after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and subsequently during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2017 ATS guidelines addressed VV-ECMO in patients with ARDS but found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for, or against its use. Since that time, a multicenter RCT evaluating the effect of early initiation of VV-ECMO on patients with severe ARDS was published, prompting an updated recommendation.

- **Evidence summary**: VV-ECMO was evaluated in two RCTs that included 429 patients. In the first trial, 180 patients were randomized to conventional ARDS management or referral for consideration of VV-ECMO, with follow-up at 6 months; a specific management protocol was not mandated in the control arm. In the second trial, 249 patients were randomized to VV-ECMO or conventional management and followed for 60 days. Ventilator management was protocolized in the control arm, and the use of neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning was encouraged. Pooled analysis demonstrated that VV-ECMO probably decreased mortality at the latest follow-up (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.95; moderate certainty).

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^115SyK9u]. Neonatology (2023). Low credibility.

When to treat with surfactant? If intubation is deemed necessary as part of stabilization for preterm infants, then surfactant should be administered to promote early extubation. Most preterm infants will transition successfully on CPAP, but those with RDS will develop progressively worsening lung disease, presenting clinically as increased work of breathing, sternal recession, and increasing oxygen requirements to maintain normal saturations. Spontaneous recovery usually begins after 48–72 hours of RDS, and infants with milder disease may manage without surfactant, thereby avoiding the discomfort of laryngoscopy and potential deleterious effects of intubation.

Early trials showed that surfactant given earlier in the course of the disease works better than later in terms of reducing air leaks in babies ventilated for RDS and avoiding MV if the IN-SUR-E technique is used. This creates a dilemma for neonatologists as RDS severity is currently determined clinically using a combination of FiO2 requirements, coupled with the judgment of work of breathing and other signs of respiratory distress alongside the degree of lung aeration on chest radiograph (or ultrasound). All of these factors can be influenced by CPAP. Ideally, predicting surfactant deficiency before the infant has deteriorated would enable earlier surfactant therapy for infants on CPAP, likely resulting in less need for MV and improved outcomes. Our previous recommendation to use FiO2 > 0.30 as the threshold for surfactant treatment was based on observations of CPAP failure rates according to early pos.

### Surviving sepsis campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: First update [^111jzSZb]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for COVID-19 infection, specifically concerning mechanical ventilation, the SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend considering a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator as a rescue therapy in mechanically ventilated adult patients with COVID-19, severe ARDS, and hypoxemia, despite optimizing ventilation and other rescue strategies. The guidelines advise to taper off the treatment if no rapid improvement in oxygenation is observed.

### Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [^113b6L3C]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.

The need for ECMO is relatively low, and its use is mostly restricted to specialized centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.

ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialized for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable the safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants — 2013 update [^111MKKNm]. Neonatology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in the perinatal management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), controversies still exist. We report updated recommendations of a European panel of expert neonatologists who developed consensus guidelines after critical examination of the most up-to-date evidence in 2007 and 2010. This second update of the guidelines is based upon published evidence up to the end of 2012.

Strong evidence exists for the role of antenatal steroids in RDS prevention, but it is still not clear if the benefit of repeated courses on respiratory outcomes outweighs the risk of adverse outcomes in the short and long term. Many practices involved in preterm neonatal stabilization at birth are not evidence-based, including oxygen administration and positive pressure lung inflation, and they may at times be harmful.

Surfactant replacement therapy is crucial in the management of RDS, but the best preparation, optimal dose, and timing of administration at different gestations is not completely clear. In addition, the use of very early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has altered the indications for prophylactic surfactant administration.

Respiratory support in the form of mechanical ventilation may be lifesaving but can cause lung injury, and protocols should be directed at avoiding mechanical ventilation where possible by using non-invasive respiratory support such as CPAP. For babies with RDS to have the best outcomes, it is essential that they have optimal supportive care, including maintenance of normal body temperature, proper fluid management, and good nutritional support.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^113s6P9k]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, specifically with respect to surfactant therapy, repeat doses are advised. The ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend administering a second, and occasionally a third, dose of surfactant if there is ongoing evidence of respiratory distress syndrome, such as persistent high oxygen requirement, provided other problems have been excluded.

### How I select which patients with ARDS should be treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^113VD6ht]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

ARDS is a lethal form of acute respiratory failure, and because no specific treatments exist, supportive care remains the primary management strategy in these patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as an intervention in patients with severe ARDS to facilitate gas exchange and the delivery of more lung-protective ventilation. Over the past 20 years, improvements in ECMO technology have increased its safety and transportability, making it far more available to this patient population globally.

Deciding which patients with ARDS should be initiated on ECMO remains a challenging question. Numerous clinical and laboratory markers have been investigated, and multiple risk scores developed, to aid physicians in this decision-making process; however, they are still imperfect, and the choice is often based on institutional guidelines and the clinical impression of the treating physician. Given the potential risks and resource implications for this intervention, patient selection is critical. It is important to provide ECMO only to patients who have a reasonable chance for recovery or a bridge to transplantation.

In patients undergoing ECMO where there is no potential for recovery or transplant, the only option may be withdrawal of ECMO and palliation. These patients may be awake and interactive, which is often a very challenging scenario for patients, families, and the clinical team. In this article, we present a more controversial case and a review of the literature regarding the selection of patients with ARDS who should receive ECMO.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112M1ecQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

There are several unanswered questions about neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although their presumed mechanism of action is through the reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury by decreasing ventilator dyssynchrony, it remains unknown whether NMBAs might also be of benefit in sedated patients who are already fully passively ventilated. It is also unclear if there is a dose–response relationship across the spectrum of passive breathing to strong or dyssynchronous efforts. Some level of spontaneous breathing may be important to prevent diaphragmatic atrophy, whereas too much respiratory effort may cause lung and diaphragm injury; accordingly, NMBAs may have a variable impact on patients. Further research efforts should also focus on answering questions about NMBA agent selection, as well as the impact of the timing of initiation (i.e. early vs. late, immediately after meeting criteria vs. following a period of stabilization), dosing (i.e. partial blockade vs. full blockade, intermittent vs. continuous dosing), and duration. Finally, longitudinal data are needed to understand the impact of NMBAs on long-term outcomes.

- **Question 4: Should patients with ARDS receive higher compared with lower PEEP, with or without LRMs?** We suggest using higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ⩾35 cm H₂O for > 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113wiDYs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The evidence base for supportive modalities for ARDS continues to evolve. As part of this guideline, we provide conditional recommendations supporting the use of corticosteroids in ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers in early severe ARDS, and higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate to severe ARDS. Implementation of these recommendations should take into account individual patient and illness characteristics. These guidelines update and build on those developed in 2017 and will be revisited as new information becomes available.

The ATS Quality Improvement and Implementation Committee reviewed the guideline and determined that none of the new recommendations are suitable for performance measure development. However, two recommendations that remain in place from the 2017 guidelines are suitable for performance measure development:

1. The use of mechanical ventilation strategies that limit tidal volume (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O).
2. The use of prone positioning for at least 12 hours per day in patients with severe ARDS.

This guideline updates and adds to recommendations for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). New recommendations in this guideline include the following:

- **Corticosteroids**: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

- **VV-ECMO**: We suggest using venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

- **Neuromuscular blockers**: We suggest using neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

- **PEEP**:
	- We suggest using higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty).
	- We recommend against using prolonged LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Recommendations from the 2017 guideline that remain in place include guidance on the use of positive end-expiratory pressure, among others not fully listed here.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1165S9xh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in up to 10% of patients with respiratory failure admitted through the emergency department. The use of noninvasive respiratory support has proliferated in recent years; clinicians must understand the relative merits and risks of these technologies and know how to recognize signs of failure. The cornerstone of ARDS care for the mechanically ventilated patient is low-tidal volume ventilation based on ideal body weight. Adjunctive therapies, such as prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may have a role in the emergency department management of ARDS, depending on patient and department characteristics.

### Rand appropriateness panel to determine the applicability of UK guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [^112Rhmun]. Thorax (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 has become the most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) worldwide. Features of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation partially distinguish it from 'classical' ARDS. A Research and Development (RAND) analysis gauged the opinion of an expert panel about the management of ARDS with and without COVID-19 as the precipitating cause, using recent UK guidelines as a template.

- **Methods**: An 11-person panel comprising intensive care practitioners rated the appropriateness of ARDS management options at different times during hospital admission, in the presence or absence of, or varying severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a scale of 1–9 (where 1–3 is inappropriate, 4–6 is uncertain, and 7–9 is appropriate). A summary of the anonymised results was discussed at an online meeting moderated by an expert in RAND methodology. The modified online survey comprising 76 questions, subdivided into investigations (16), non-invasive respiratory support (18), basic intensive care unit management of ARDS (20), management of refractory hypoxaemia (8), pharmacotherapy (7), and anticoagulation (7), was completed again.

- **Results**: Disagreement between experts was significant only when addressing the appropriateness of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Adherence to existing published guidelines for the management of ARDS for relevant evidence-based interventions was recommended. Responses of the experts to the final survey suggested that the supportive management of ARDS should be the same, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis.
