## Question

Hemoglobin A1C of 5.9

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a hemoglobin A1c of 5.9% means, how to interpret it, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify 5.9% against current diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should verify the risk of progression to diabetes and how that risk compares across A1c strata. Next, I will consider assay limitations and whether to confirm with glucose testing. After that, I should review cardiovascular risk implications and whether they differ by sex. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, including lifestyle interventions, monitoring cadence, and when to consider pharmacotherapy, while double-checking guideline nuances and exceptions like pregnancy or assay interference.

> Let me first confirm the classification. An A1c of 5.9% falls within the ADA-defined prediabetes range of 5.7% to 6.4%, which signals increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and it is below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes at ≥ 6.5% [^88472f0f] [^5ec8d461].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of diabetes risk at this level. Multiple prospective cohorts and systematic reviews show a steep, continuous rise in incident diabetes as A1c increases, with 5.5% to 6.0% carrying a roughly 9% to 25% 5-year risk, and 6.0% to 6.5% carrying a 25% to 50% 5-year risk; at 5.9%, the absolute risk is toward the higher end of that 5.5% to 6.0% band, indicating substantial near-term risk that warrants action [^df3d1c2b] [^dbe0d8ae] [^9e29b0dc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis. I should confirm that A1c is a screening tool here and that glucose-based confirmation is prudent when using A1c to identify prediabetes, especially if results are unexpected or if there are factors that could distort A1c. AACE advises using A1c for screening but confirming prediabetes with glucose testing when possible, which aligns with best practice to avoid misclassification [^a46bcf9a] [^7d2a7ea4].

> I need to check for assay limitations and confounders that could make 5.9% misleading. Conditions altering red cell turnover, certain hemoglobin variants, anemia, CKD, and some therapies can bias A1c; if there is discordance between A1c and glucose values, repeating A1c with a standardized NGSP/DCCT-traceable method or using alternative markers like fructosamine or glycated albumin is reasonable, and I should double-check that the lab method is NGSP-certified before anchoring on the number [^a702e6e4] [^454be14c] [^d48bd14e].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular risk. Prediabetes itself confers increased ASCVD risk, and observational data suggest sex-specific patterns: in men, even A1c 5.5% to 5.9% associates with higher CVD risk, whereas in women the risk signal strengthens at A1c ≥ 6.0%. Mechanistically, this supports aggressive risk-factor management even when glucose is not yet diabetic, and I should confirm that guidelines endorse screening and treatment of blood pressure, lipids, and lifestyle factors in prediabetes [^dd9b770f] [^f87313ad] [^8bc6a8e7].

> Let me consider pregnancy-related nuances. In those planning pregnancy or in early pregnancy, an A1c of 5.9% is actually used as a threshold for early dysglycemia screening because it reflects increased risk of gestational diabetes and adverse outcomes; this is one context where 5.9% carries different implications than in nonpregnant adults, so I should ask about pregnancy status before finalizing interpretation [^7a22f834] [^e8268971].

> I will now examine practical next steps. Lifestyle intervention is first-line: aim for at least 5% weight loss if overweight or obese, 150 minutes per week of moderate activity, dietary patterns like Mediterranean or DASH, and behavioral support. These reduce progression to diabetes by about 58% in high-risk groups, and I should set a concrete, measurable plan with follow-up [^notfound]. For monitoring, repeat A1c annually is reasonable in prediabetes, with more frequent checks if risk is high or if multiple risk factors are present, and I should confirm that ADA supports annual surveillance with individualized frequency adjustments [^3c0bf2cd].

> But wait, what if the patient is at very high risk or already has additional prediabetes markers. For individuals with A1c ≥ 6.0% or with both IFG and IGT, guidelines support more aggressive intervention and closer follow-up; in select cases, metformin can be considered for diabetes prevention, particularly in those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², age < 60 years, or prior gestational diabetes, though I should confirm shared decision-making and that lifestyle remains foundational [^ab7a33cd].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency. An A1c of 5.9% equals prediabetes, reflects a 5-year diabetes risk around 15% to 25%, and signals increased cardiovascular risk, especially in men. Confirm with glucose testing when feasible, address modifiable risk factors intensively, and monitor at least annually, escalating frequency and intensity if risk is high or if A1c rises toward 6.0% to 6.4% [^88472f0f] [^df3d1c2b] [^dd9b770f] [^3c0bf2cd].

---

An A1c of 5.9% indicates **prediabetes** and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^88472f0f] [^8fc3e206]. It is not diagnostic for diabetes, but it warrants **lifestyle changes** (weight loss, diet, exercise) and periodic monitoring of A1c and glucose [^3c0bf2cd]. Confirm results with a repeat A1c or glucose test if there is discordance or if symptoms arise, and consider alternative markers (fructosamine, glycated albumin) if A1c is unreliable due to anemia or hemoglobin variants [^83e42e55] [^d48bd14e].

---

## Clinical significance of A1c 5.9%

An A1c of 5.9% falls within the **prediabetes range** (5.7–6.4%) and reflects increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^88472f0f] [^8fc3e206]. It is not diagnostic for diabetes, which requires A1c ≥ 6.5% or confirmatory glucose testing [^d7abde3d].

---

## Risk of progression to diabetes

The risk of progression to diabetes increases with higher A1c within the prediabetes range; at 5.9%, the **annual risk is about 5–10%**, with higher risk in the presence of additional factors such as obesity, hypertension, or family history [^aef9b564] [^df3d1c2b].

---

## Cardiovascular risk implications

Prediabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including higher rates of coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality; risk is further elevated with additional risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity [^8fc3e206] [^f87313ad].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight reduction if overweight or obese.
- **Dietary changes**: Emphasize whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and reduce refined carbohydrates and saturated fats.
- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended.

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

- **Annual A1c testing**: Monitor progression to diabetes [^3c0bf2cd].
- **Blood pressure and lipid monitoring**: Assess cardiovascular risk factors.
- **Glucose testing**: Consider fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test if A1c is discordant or symptoms arise [^83e42e55].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: A1c may be affected by anemia, hemoglobin variants, or altered red cell turnover; confirm results if discordant [^a702e6e4].
- **Individual variability**: A1c may not reflect true glycemia in some individuals; consider alternative markers (fructosamine, glycated albumin) if needed [^d48bd14e].
- **Clinical context**: Interpret A1c alongside patient demographics, comorbidities, and risk factors [^a702e6e4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical action** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Lifestyle modifications | - Weight loss <br/> - Dietary changes <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Smoking cessation |
| Monitoring | - Annual A1c <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Lipids <br/> - Glucose testing if needed |
| Confirmation | Repeat A1c or glucose testing if discordant or symptomatic [^83e42e55] |

---

An A1c of 5.9% indicates prediabetes and increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It calls for **lifestyle changes**, periodic monitoring, and confirmation of results when indicated.

A1C measurement and interpretation — Mean A1C represents glycemic control over the lifespan of the red blood cell (100 to 120 days), but 50% of A1C is determined by glycemia during the month preceding measurement, and A1C should be measured at least twice yearly in persons with DM and at least quarterly in persons not at target. Currently, 99% of laboratories in the United States use a standardized and certified assay traced to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.

Since the beginning of clinical use in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was broadened in 2010, when the American Diabetes Association added A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Because of hemoglobin A1c's integral role in diagnosis and treatment, it is important to recognize clinical scenarios and interfering factors that yield false results. The purpose of this review is to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may yield false results, and describe alternative laboratory biomarkers.

AACE 2022 diabetes guideline — glucose testing and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) interpretation defines normal, prediabetes, and diabetes thresholds using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG), random plasma glucose (PG), and A1C. Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Implications of using hemoglobin A1c for diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^808e61f3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Until 2010, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based solely on glucose concentration, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations now include a new criterion: hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%. Because this change may have significant implications for diabetes diagnosis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review including peer-reviewed articles not referenced in the ADA report. We conclude that A1C and plasma glucose tests are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies fewer individuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria. Convenience of A1C test might increase the number of patients diagnosed, but this is unproven. Diagnostic cut-points for both glucose and A1C are based on consensus judgments regarding optimal sensitivity and specificity for the complications of hyperglycemia. A1C may not accurately reflect levels of glycemia in some situations, but in comparison with glucose measurements, it has greater analytic stability and less temporal variability. When choosing a diagnostic test for diabetes, the limitations of each choice must be understood. Clinical judgment and consideration of patient preference are required to appropriately select among the diagnostic alternatives.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes screening and new-onset diabetes prediction: a 6-year community-based prospective study [^b28419ea]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The main finding of this study is that the A1C assay was useful as a screening test for type 2 diabetes and as a predictor of future diabetes. In our population, an A1C cutoff of 5.9% was able to identify people with undiagnosed diabetes, and individuals with an A1C ≥ 5.6% had an increased risk for progression to type 2 diabetes independent of other confounding factors.

This was a large, prospective cohort study that used stringent criteria to diagnose diabetes and to evaluate the usefulness of A1C level in diabetes screening and in the prediction of new-onset diabetes. In this homogeneous population-based study, we applied the OGTT to all participants and used the same instruments and personnel for all clinical and biochemical assessments during the 6 years.

Use of the A1C level in the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes has been debated for many years. Most A1C assays, such as the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, are standardized, and recent expert committee reports suggest an A1C cutoff of 6.5% for diagnosing diabetes. For screening a general population, the A1C level has several advantages over the currently used FPG concentration or 2-h glucose concentration after an OGTT. The A1C assay does not need a fasting or timed sample. It is a better indicator of chronic glycemic level, has less preanalytic instability, and has a more consistent relationship with diabetic microvascular complications than does FPG concentration. However, concerns remain about the risk of underdiagnosing people with overt diabetes when using an A1C cutoff of 6.5%.

Several cross-sectional studies have evaluated the accuracy of the A1C cutoffs in screening for diabetes. In analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, Buell et al. reported that an A1C level of 5.8% showed the highest sensitivity (86%) and specificity (92%) in identifying undiagnosed diabetes when using FPG concentration as the diagnostic test for type 2 diabetes. In the current study, the definition of diabetes was based on plasma glucose results from the 75-g OGTT, and the A1C value of 5.9% was appropriate for detecting undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in this Korean cohort population. In a Japanese study of OGTT results in 1,904 people, an A1C cut point of 5.6% identified undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, and this value is used as a supplementary diagnostic criterion by the Japanese Diabetes Society.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^df3d1c2b]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This systematic review of prospective studies confirms a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes risk. Persons with an A1C value of ≥ 6.0% have a very high risk of developing clinically defined diabetes in the near future with 5-year risks ranging from 25 to 50% and relative risks frequently 20 times higher compared with A1C < 5%. However, persons with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% also have a substantially increased risk of diabetes with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%. The level of A1C appears to have a continuous association with diabetes risk even below the 5.5% A1C threshold, but the absolute levels of incidence in that group are considerably lower.

In light of recent interest in adopting A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes, these findings may be useful to guide policies related to the classification and diagnosis of persons at high risk of developing diabetes prior to preventive intervention. The progression of risk of diabetes with A1C is similar in magnitude and shape as previously described for fasting plasma glucose and 2-h glucose and suggests that A1C may have a similar application as an indicator of future risk. The ideal decision about what A1C cut point is used for intervention should ultimately be based on the capacity for benefit as shown in clinical trials. Our findings suggest that A1C range of 5.5 and 6.5% will capture a large portion of people at high risk, and if interventions can be employed to this target population, it may bring about significant absolute risk reduction. Given the current science and evidence of the cost-effectiveness of intensive interventions conducted in clinical trials, the use of a threshold somewhere between 5.5 and 6.0% is likely to ensure that persons who will truly benefit from preventive interventions are efficiently identified. It is also reassuring that the mean A1C values of the populations from the Diabetes Prevention Program, the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, and the Indian Diabetes Prevention Program, wherein the mean A1C was 5.8 to 6.2% and SDs of at least 0.5 percentage points, span the range from 5.5 to 6.5%.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — HbA1c assay and interpretation considerations state: "HbA1c assays should be based on the NGSP reference standard. Clinicians should obtain information regarding the coefficient of variation (CV) from the methodology used at their site." The "HbA1c range reflects an 'HbA1c average goal' over time" and "Intensification or relaxation of therapy should be undertaken based on individual clinical circumstances and treatment options." The guideline adds, "We discourage medication changes in response to a single HbA1c test that falls slightly outside target ranges, especially if it is discordant with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results." It notes "African Americans, on average, have HbA1c levels about 0.4% higher than Whites," and "The VA/DoD DM CPG does not recommend the use of estimated average glucose derived from HbA1c levels."

### Hemoglobin A1c as a predictor of incident diabetes [^6cafcb7c]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We found that baseline HbA 1c was significantly predictive of the subsequent development of a diagnosis of diabetes over an 8-year period. The risk of developing diabetes increased progressively at HbA 1c levels ≥ 5.0%, with an odds ratio exceeding 16 in those with HbA 1c 6.0–6.4%. This latter group had a cumulative incidence of diabetes approaching 80%. Not surprisingly, significant predictors for diabetes incidence included clinical parameters, such as blood pressure, BMI, serum creatinine, prevalent cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. From these data, we also developed risk–calculating equations for determining the probability of developing a diabetic diagnosis within 5 years. We believe that these data will inform clinicians on how to risk–stratify individuals who are screened for diabetes using HbA 1c but whose levels do not reach the recommended diagnostic threshold of ≥ 6.5%.

Several studies have evaluated HbA 1c as a predictor of subsequent diabetes or as a tool to diagnose treatment-requiring diabetes (.). A number of threshold values have been previously proposed for diagnosing diabetes, such as ≥ 7.0%, ≥ 6.5%, > 2 SD above the normal mean (i.e. > 6.1%). In addition, a number of HbA 1c levels have also been proposed to identify individuals at risk for diabetes (i.e. prediabetes), such as 6.1–6.9% [7], 6.0–6.4% [8], or 5.7–6.4% [1]. The implementation of new guidelines for diagnosing diabetes using HbA 1c will help standardize the way in which clinicians apply results from this test. However, there remains uncertainty on how to classify and whether to intervene in individuals whose levels fall below this threshold.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^c45c9a69]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

2. Testing frequency.

There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of HbA 1c testing. The ADA recommends, "For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician." In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, expert opinion recommends HbA 1c testing "at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control)… and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals". These testing recommendations are for nonpregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients with diabetes who are admitted to a hospital should have HbA 1c measured if the results of testing in the previous 2–3 months are not available. Diabetes quality-assurance programs [e.g. Provider Recognition Program and HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set)] have generally required documentation of the percentage of diabetic patients who have had at least one HbA 1c measurement during the preceding year. Studies have established that serial HbA 1c measurements (quarterly for 1 year) produce large improvements in HbA 1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.

3. Interpretation.

HbA 1c values in patients with diabetes constitute a continuum. They range from within the reference interval in a small percentage of patients whose mean plasma glucose concentrations are close to those of nondiabetic individuals, to markedly increased values (e.g. two- to threefold increases in some patients) that reflect an extreme degree of hyperglycemia. A proper interpretation of HbA 1c test results requires that physicians understand the relationship between HbA 1c values and mean plasma glucose, the kinetics of HbA 1c, and specific assay limitations/interferences. Small changes in HbA 1c (e.g. ± 0.3% HbA 1c) over time may reflect assay imprecision rather than a true change in glycemic status.

5. Emerging considerations

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c MAY BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES, WITH VALUES ≥ 6.5% BEING DIAGNOSTIC. AN NGSP-CERTIFIED METHOD SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY. ANALOGOUS TO ITS USE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE HbA 1c ASSAY WILL PRECLUDE ITS USE IN DIAGNOSIS A (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: POINT-OF-CARE HbA 1c ASSAYS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE TO USE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES B (moderate).

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^1e9c91b8]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

This is the first of a series of articles based on presentations at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions held 5–9 June 2009 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

A series of elegant investigations some 4 decades ago led to the realization that elevated levels of certain hemoglobin components are found in individuals with diabetes. The useful measurement of A1C became standard in assessment of glycemia. A1C, rather than direct measures of glycemia, is now used as the "goal" for diabetes treatment.

A1C cutoff for detecting undiagnosed diabetes and predicting progression to diabetes

Table 2 shows the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of A1C level for detecting undiagnosed diabetes and predicting 6-year incident diabetes at A1C cutoff values of 5.0–6.6%. For detecting undiagnosed diabetes, an A1C cutoff of 5.9% produced the maximum sum of sensitivity (68%) and specificity (91%) by ROC analysis. The positive and negative predictive values of this cut point were 34 and 98%, respectively.

Table 2
Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of increasing A1C cutoff levels for detecting undiagnosed diabetes and for predicting the incidence of type 2 diabetes at the 6-year follow-up

For predicting incident diabetes at 6 years, an A1C level of 5.6% was the optimal cutoff; the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of this cut point were 59, 77, 31, and 91%, respectively.

To test the A1C cut points to predict future diabetes, we tested reliability by randomly dividing our cohort into the two groups. Half of the cohort was used to define the cut point and the other half to test reliability by calculating the incidence and adjusted RRs. The incidences and RRs were 31.7, 37.6, 46.5, 53.3, 58.9, 67.6, and 89.7% and 4.9, 5.9, 8, 9.4, 10.8, 13.8, and 51.5 at the A1C cutoff of 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 6, 6.2, and 6.6%, respectively.

### Relationship between A1c and fasting plasma glucose in dysglycemia or type 2 diabetes: an analysis of baseline data from the ORIGIN trial [^574f3236]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The strength of the study was the large number of subjects available for the overall and subgroup analyses. The numbers were high for subgroup analysis in relation to the use of OAD. The large sample size with a wide range of A1C and FPG levels facilitated analysis of data at clinically relevant A1C levels. Important limitations include the fact that participants were all volunteers and were all deemed to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Whether similar relationships would be apparent in individuals from the general population at lower risk for cardiovascular disease is unknown, although there is no compelling reason to believe that they would be different. These observations are also limited by the fact that glucose and A1C values were locally measured using a variety of assays worldwide and that a mathematical approach was used to adjust for differences in each laboratory's normal range for A1C. Thus, laboratory-related variability may have influenced the results. Also, information on the presence of variant hemoglobins or other physiologic factors that might affect A1C values was not available, and whether such factors may have altered the FPG-A1C relationships observed is unknown. However, the fact that clear FPG-A1C relationships were observed despite these potential sources of variability strengthens the conclusions and suggests that a stronger relationship would be apparent if the measurements were all made in the same laboratory.

In summary, our cross-sectional analyses in a large population of persons with dysglycemia or early T2DM confirm a strong relationship between FPG in the range of 5.6–9.0 mmol/L and concurrent A1C measurements across different geographic regions and ethnic groups. They also show a clear effect of oral therapies on this relationship, with a smaller increase in A1C per unit increase in FPG for persons taking an OAD. These data highlight the relevance and appropriateness of the A1C test as a useful measure of glycemic status throughout the world and also suggest that OAD use or nonuse should be considered when interpreting A1C level.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^9e29b0dc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Table 2
A1C levels and incidence of diabetes

Using data from these seven studies (,–), we modeled A1C as a function of diabetes incidence (Fig. 2). The curve demonstrated that A1C was positively associated with the incidence of diabetes with a change-in-slope occurring at an A1C level of about 5.5%. In other words, when diabetes incidence increased 0.3 to 1.8%, the A1C increased from 5.0 to 5.5%, or on average about a 0.33 percentage point increase in A1C per 1.0 percentage point increase in incidence. When diabetes incidence increased from 1.8 to 5.0%, the A1C increased from 5.5 to 6.0%, or about a 0.16 percentage point increase in A1C per 1.0 percentage point increase in incidence. Furthermore, when diabetes incidence increased from 5.0 to 9.5%, the A1C increased from 6.0 to 6.5%, or about a 0.11 percentage point increase in A1C per 1.0 percentage point increase in incidence. These associations convert to a 5-year incidence of < 5 to 9% across A1C of 5.0 to 5.5%, 9 to 25% across the A1C range of 5.5 to 6.0%, and 25 to 50% across the A1C range of 6.0 to 6.5%. We noted that in one very large study that used Kaplan-Meier curves to depict the relationship between time before developing diabetes and baseline A1C values, the curves appeared to diverge between A1C values of 5.0 to 5.4% and 5.5 to 5.9%.

### Hemoglobin A1c predicts diabetes but not cardiovascular disease in nondiabetic women [^1a7bcae0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a marker of cumulative glycemic exposure over the preceding 2- to 3-month period. Whether mild elevations of this biomarker provide prognostic information for development of clinically evident type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease among individuals at usual risk for these disorders is uncertain.

Methods

We examined baseline HbA1c levels as a predictor of incident clinical diabetes and cardiovascular disease (nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) in a prospective cohort study beginning in 1992 of 26,563 US female health professionals aged 45 years or more without diagnosed diabetes or vascular disease (median follow-up 10.1 years).

Results

During follow-up, 1238 cases of diabetes and 684 cardiovascular events occurred. In age-adjusted analyses using quintiles of HbA1c, a risk gradient was observed for both incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease. After multivariable adjustment, HbA1c remained a strong predictor of diabetes but was no longer significantly associated with incident cardiovascular disease. In analyses of threshold effects, adjusted relative risks for incident diabetes in HbA1c categories of less than 5.0%, 5.0% to 5.4%, 5.5% to 5.9%, 6.0% to 6.4%, 6.5% to 6.9%, and 7.0% or more were 1.0, 2.9, 12.1, 29.3, 28.2, and 81.2, respectively. Risk associations persisted after additional adjustment for C-reactive protein and after excluding individuals developing diabetes within 2 and 5 years of follow-up.

Conclusions

These prospective findings suggest that HbA1c levels are elevated well in advance of the clinical development of type 2 diabetes, supporting recent recommendations for lowering of diagnostic thresholds for glucose metabolic disorders. In contrast, the association of HbA1c with incident cardiovascular events is modest and largely attributable to coexistent traditional risk factors.

### Point-of-care HbA1c in clinical practice: caveats and considerations for optimal use [^0fc63125]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is widely used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Accurate measurement of A1C is necessary for optimal clinical value. Assay standardization has markedly improved the accuracy and consistency of A1C testing. Devices to measure A1C at point of care (POC) are commercially available, allowing rapid results when the patient is seen. In this review, we describe how standardization of A1C testing was achieved, leading to high-quality results in clinical laboratories. We address the use of POC A1C testing in clinical situations and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of POC A1C testing. We emphasize the importance of considering the limitations of these devices and following correct testing procedures to ensure that accurate A1C results are obtained for optimal care of patients.

Other A1C topics at the ADA Scientific Sessions

At a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program review at the ADA Scientific Sessions, Little discussed interesting observations based on CAP surveys of A1C assay performance. Average CV decreased from 6 to 7% in 2003 to current mean levels around 4%. An important statistical notion is that of critical difference — the difference for a given patient between two test results that should be considered significant. For A1C, at an average method CV of 4%, the critical difference is 0.8%, suggesting that the typical approach of clinicians in considering relatively small changes to be of consequence may not be statistically accurate. In fact, even if an A1C method had a 1% CV, the critical difference would still be an A1C change of at least 0.3%. In grading of the CAP A1C survey, the acceptable limit in 2009 is ± 10%, although the plan is to reduce this to ± 6% over coming years. Other characteristics of A1C assays were discussed at the session. Many methods do not show assay interference with hemoglobin variants, but 6.5% of labs use methods for which A1C of samples with hemoglobin S or C is incorrect by > 10%, 20% of labs use methods in which hemoglobin E causes interference, and 6% of labs use methods in which hemoglobin D causes interference. It should be noted that the CAP surveys do not include information on "point of care" A1C methods, as this is a "waived" test for quality standardization; the use of such methods may, if accuracy is limited, further limit the value of A1C.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^b3ffdded]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^859575ff]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large as to the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to an enhanced detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests somewhat inconvenient to patients and clinicians and therefore often not optimally implemented. In this issue of Diabetes Care, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically, the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by either of the associations (or other organizations), it does represent a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), handy, and, ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been dogged by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state (most people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state) or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, i.e. the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test — the latter done rarely in clinical practice for obvious reasons: inconvenience and cost. In addition, considerable variability not only in 2-h postglucose load values but also in fasting glucose has been a problem. Appropriately, clinicians have long wondered why they cannot use another diagnostic index, such as A1C, an inherently attractive option because it recapitulates long-term ambient glycemia as opposed to a single point in time. With the recent introduction of the standardized global assay for the measurement of A1C, greater accuracy and precision than achieved with plasma glucose have been predicated. The overall edge of A1C over plasma glucose is accurately summarized in Table 1 of the International Expert Committee's report.

### The clinical use of hemoglobin A1c [^65f309d6]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been accepted as an index of glycemic control since the mid-1970s and is the best marker for diabetic microvascular complications. Clinically, it is now used to assess glycemic control in people with diabetes. Assays are most reliable when certified by the National Hemoglobin Standardization Program but are subject to confounders and effect modifiers, particularly in the setting of hematologic abnormalities. Other measures of chronic glycemic control-fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol-are far less widely used. The relationship of HbA1c to average blood glucose was intensively studied recently, and it has been proposed that this conversion can be used to report an "estimated average glucose, eAG" in milligrams/deciliter or millimolar units rather than as per cent glycated hemoglobin. Finally, HbA1c has been proposed as a useful method of screening for and diagnosing diabetes.

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^4f29db9b]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

For nearly a decade, diabetes care guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have recommended that the goal of glycemic control should be to lower the A1C to < 7.0% for adults living with diabetes. This recommendation currently motivates diabetes public health programs and diabetes care translational research. All of these efforts have the overall intention of shifting the national distribution of A1C levels downward in order to improve diabetes outcomes and may lead to overtreatment of A1C levels in certain diabetes populations.

Although the standard A1C target of < 7.0% is probably the best-known feature of the ADA guidelines, the ADA guidelines also recommend that A1C targets should be based on individual clinical circumstances. Similar recommendations for individualized targets have been supported by the Veterans Health Administration-Department of Defense (VA-DoD), American Geriatric Society, American College of Physicians (ACP), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). Recommendations to individualize targets are based on major type 2 diabetes trials that found different levels of benefit, and even harm, from lower A1C levels depending on diabetes population characteristics (e.g. duration of diabetes, age, and comorbidity). According to the ADA, lower A1C targets are recommended for patients with a short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant cardiovascular disease. Conversely, higher A1C targets are recommended for patients with longstanding diabetes, advanced age, limited life expectancy, a history of macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, extensive comorbidities, or a high risk for severe hypoglycemia. Although guidelines have identified these special populations, recommendations on how to set individualized A1C targets have been open to interpretation.

### A new look at screening and diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^ccce3482]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetes is underdiagnosed. About one third of people with diabetes do not know they have it, and the average lag between onset and diagnosis is 7 yr. This report reconsiders the criteria for diagnosing diabetes and recommends screening criteria to make case finding easier for clinicians and patients.

Participants

R.M.B. invited experts in the area of diagnosis, monitoring, and management of diabetes to form a panel to review the literature and develop consensus regarding the screening and diagnosis of diabetes with particular reference to the use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants met in open session and by E-mail thereafter. Metrika, Inc. sponsored the meeting.

Evidence

A literature search was performed using standard search engines.

Consensus Process

The panel heard each member's discussion of the issues, reviewing evidence prior to drafting conclusions. Principal conclusions were agreed on, and then specific cut points were discussed in an iterative consensus process.

Conclusions

The main factors in support of using HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test include: 1) HbA1c does not require patients to be fasting; 2) HbA1c reflects longer-term glycemia than does plasma glucose; 3) HbA1c laboratory methods are now well standardized and reliable; and 4) errors caused by nonglycemic factors affecting HbA1c such as hemoglobinopathies are infrequent and can be minimized by confirming the diagnosis of diabetes with a plasma glucose (PG)-specific test. Specific recommendations include: 1) screening standards should be established that prompt further testing and closer follow-up, including fasting PG of 100 mg/dl or greater, random PG of 130 mg/dl or greater, or HbA1c greater than 6.0%; 2) HbA1c of 6.5–6.9% or greater, confirmed by a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), should establish the diagnosis of diabetes; and 3) HbA1c of 7% or greater, confirmed by another HbA1c- or a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) should establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The recommendations are offered for consideration of the clinical community and interested associations and societies.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d48bd14e]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Serum glycated proteins as alternatives to A1C — Fructosamine and glycated albumin are alternative measures of glycemia that are approved for clinical use for monitoring glycemic status in people with diabetes and, due to serum protein turnover, reflect glycemia over the past 2–4 weeks. However, there have been few clinical trials and the evidence base supporting their use to monitor glycemic status is much weaker than that for A1C, though in people with diabetes where A1C interpretation may be problematic or when A1C cannot be measured (e.g., homozygous hemoglobin variants), fructosamine or glycated albumin may be useful alternatives to monitor glycemic status.

### Haemoglobin A1c in the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus [^e37628c2]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) is due to celebrate its 40th birthday. Many people would argue that the clinical studies relating the test to diabetes complications while in its late 20s are likely to be its finest ever achievement. However, this article looks at how HbA(1c) has matured since then and discusses in detail how its many strengths and idiosyncrasies as a marker of glycaemic risk have, as a 30-something, become more clearly understood. As HbA(1c) approaches middle age, this paper also describes how the test appears to be developing a mid-life crisis, as debate over how its results should be expressed seems likely to divide opinion among clinicians for some time to come.

### Hemoglobin A1c assay variations and implications for diabetes screening in obese youth [^eff36f9d]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standardization of the hemoglobin A1c (A1c) assay has led to its increasing utilization as a screening tool for the diagnosis of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in youth. However, significant A1c assay variability remains and has implications for clinical management.

Objective

To describe our center's experiences with A1c results in youth and to evaluate inter-method differences and their clinical implications.

Subjects

Seventy-five youth (aged 10-18yr old), body mass index (BMI) ≥ 85th‰ participated.

Methods

Seventy-two participants had two A1c values performed on the same sample, one via immunoassay (DCA Vantage Analyzer, A1c1) and the other via high performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Variant II, A1c2). Nineteen had A1c run on two immunoassay devices (A1c1 and Dimensions Vista, A1c3).

Results

Mean age of participants was 13.9years, BMI% 97.89%, 33% male, 16% white, 21% black, and 61% Hispanic (H). Mean A1c1 was 5.68% ± 0.38 vs. a mean A1c2 of 5.73% ± 0.39, p = 0.049. Concordance in diabetes status between methods was achieved in 79% of subjects. Nineteen subjects with A1c3 results had testing performed an average of 22 ± 9 days prior to A1c1. Mean A1c3 was 6.24% ± 0.4, compared to a mean A1c1 of 5.74% ± 0.31, (p < 0.0001). A1c1 was on average systematically -0.5 ± 0.28 lower compared to A1c3. There was poor agreement in diabetes classification between A1c1 and A1c3, with a concordance in classification between methods of only 36.8%.

Conclusions

Clinically significant inter-method A1c variability exists that impacts patient classification and treatment recommendations. In the screening of obese youth for diabetes, A1c results should be interpreted with caution.

Definitions of prediabetes (intermediate glycemia) — Table 3 specifies organizational thresholds. For ADA, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 2-h OGTT) is 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), and high risk by A1c is 5.7%–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol), with the comment that "Any one of the three is sufficient." For WHO 2011, IFG is 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) and "A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of intermediate glycemia." For IEC 2009, high risk by A1c is 6.0%–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) and the comment states "Restricted to higher risk group than ADA definition for T2DM prevention."

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^bf8b4f8a]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes — HbA1c interpretation and screening criteria indicate that racial differences in HbA1c exist, with African Americans having higher HbA1c (6.2%) than Whites (5.8%), and that these differences should be considered when a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is suggested by HbA1c values between 6.5% and 7.0% or when making treatment decisions based on small changes in HbA1c. One may consider screening for T2DM or prediabetes in adults who are overweight or obese with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 or ≥ 23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans and who have additional risk factors such as a first-degree relative with T2DM, membership in a high-prevalence population, hypertension defined as blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level < 35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L), a triglyceride level > 250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L), or both, and history of cardiovascular disease. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are noted as forms of prediabetes.

### Diabetes treatment and cardiovascular safety [^2002b9d0]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

There may be similar issues with POC A1C testing. At the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) Clinical Advisory Committee meeting at the ADA, David Sacks (Boston, MA) discussed this matter, noting that POC testing may incorporate immunoassay or boronate affinity chromatography, the latter infrequently used in clinical laboratories. Between laboratory A1C, c.v. values are typically < 3.5%, and within a given laboratory, the c.v. may be < 1.0%. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) act of 1988 allows waiver of "test systems [which] are simple… cleared by FDA for home use… so simple and accurate as to render the likelihood of erroneous results negligible, or pose no reasonable risk of harm." Based on this waiver, six POC A1C devices have been NGSP-certified. Advantages are these devices' rapidity, convenience, and the CLIA waiver, allowing testing to be performed in the physicians' office. There is evidence that immediate A1C feedback improves outcome. Disadvantages are greater expense and the lack of requirement for proficiency testing; thus, there is very limited objective data regarding performance in patient care and potential lack of precision in the hands of those who use them. How accurate, Sacks asked, should one expect the A1C measurement to be? If a specimen has A1C 6.5%, with a c.v. of 4%, the 2 SD range would be 5.98–7.02, with 3%, 6.11–6.89, and with 2%, 6.24–6.76. Is it necessary then for the c.v. to be < 2% for acceptable precision? Sacks argued that if A1C is used for diagnosis and even if it is used for management, the between-laboratory c.v. should be low. Sacks reviewed a study of eight commercial POC A1C devices. Two of the manufacturers withdrew their devices after initial poor results, but only two of the others had c.v. < 3%, and only one device met current NGSP criteria with two different lots. The bias of the devices ranged from −0.9% to +0.4%. Noting that a positive 0.4% A1C bias would more than double the number of individuals diagnosed with diabetes, Sacks reviewed current ADA guidelines, which suggest that POC devices not be used for the diagnosis of diabetes. Of course, one must be concerned about both positive and negative biases in use of these devices in clinical care.

B. Diagnosis of diabetes

Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 2. Three ways to diagnose diabetes are recommended at the time of this statement, and each must be confirmed on a subsequent day unless unequivocal symptoms of hyperglycemia are present. Although the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is more sensitive and modestly more specific than the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to diagnose diabetes, it is poorly reproducible and difficult to perform in practice. Because of ease of use, acceptability to patients, and lower cost, the FPG has been the preferred diagnostic test. Though FPG is less sensitive than the OGTT, the vast majority of people who do not meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes by FPG but would by OGTT will have an A1C value well under 7.0%.

Though the OGTT is not recommended for routine clinical use, it may be useful for further evaluation of patients in whom diabetes is still strongly suspected but who have normal FPG or IFG (see Section I.C).

The use of the A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes has previously not been recommended due to lack of global standardization and uncertainty about diagnostic thresholds. However, with a world-wide move toward a standardized assay and with increasing observational evidence about the prognostic significance of A1C, an Expert Committee on the Diagnosis of Diabetes was convened in 2008. This joint committee of ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation will likely recommend that the A1C become the preferred diagnostic test for diabetes. Diagnostic cut-points are being discussed at the time of publication of this statement. Updated recommendations will be published in Diabetes Care and will be available at diabetes.org.

C. Diagnosis of pre-diabetes

Hyperglycemia not sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes is categorized as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), depending on whether it is identified through the FPG or the OGTT:
IFG = FPG 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l)
IGT = 2-h plasma glucose 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l)

IFG and IGT have been officially termed "pre-diabetes." Both categories of pre-diabetes are risk factors for future diabetes and for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Association between hemoglobin A1c and development of cardiovascular disease in Canadian men and women Without diabetes at baseline: a population-based study of 608 474 adults [^dd9b770f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, among individuals with no diabetes at baseline, sex differences exist in the association between levels of HbA1c and risk of CVD. Among men, normal levels of HbA1c (5.5%–5.9%) as well as higher values consistent with prediabetes (HbA1c 6.0%–6.4%) or diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) were associated with an increased risk of CVD; whereas among women CVD risk was restricted to those with HbA1c ≥ 6.0% (prediabetes or diabetes). These findings highlight the importance of optimizing CVD risk factor management at all levels of glycemia among men; and for vigilant surveillance and early intervention among all individuals diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes.

### Diagnosis of diabetes using hemoglobin A1c: should recommendations in adults be extrapolated to adolescents? [^ec786ca8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare test performance of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for detecting diabetes mellitus/pre-diabetes for adolescents versus adults in the United States.

Study Design

Individuals were defined as having diabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-hour plasma glucose (2-hr PG) ≥ 200 mg/dL) or pre-diabetes (100 ≤ FPG < 126 mg/dL; 140 ≤ 2-hr PG < 200 mg/dL. HbA1c test performance was evaluated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses.

Results

Few adolescents had undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (n = 4). When assessing FPG to detect diabetes, an HbA1c of 6.5% had sensitivity rates of 75.0% (30.1% to 95.4%) and 53.8% (47.4% to 60.0%) and specificity rates of 99.9% (99.5% to 100.0%) and 99.5% (99.3% to 99.6%) for adolescents and adults, respectively. Additionally, when assessing FPG to detect diabetes mellitus, an HbA1c of 5.7% had sensitivity rates of 5.0% (2.6% to 9.2%) and 23.1% (21.3% to 25.0%) and specificity rates of 98.3% (97.2% to 98.9%) and 91.1% (90.3% to 91.9%) for adolescents and adults, respectively. ROC analyses suggested that HbA1c is a poorer predictor of diabetes mellitus (area under the curve, 0.88 versus 0.93) and pre-diabetes (FPG area under the curve 0.61 versus 0.74) for adolescents compared with adults. Performance was poor regardless of whether FPG or 2-hr PG measurements were used.

Conclusions

Use of HbA1c for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes in adolescents may be premature, until information from more definitive studies is available.

### The pros and cons of diagnosing diabetes with A1c [^005a71dc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A1C has a poor sensitivity in diabetes diagnosis and would change the epidemiology of diabetes

Diabetes diagnosis based on A1C misses a large proportion of asymptomatic early cases of diabetes that can only be identified by the OGTT. According to a recent Chinese study, A1C sensitivity is inferior compared with fasting blood glucose at the population level. Also, people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), in whom the efficacy of diabetes prevention has been unequivocally proven, cannot be detected by A1C.

Epidemiological studies carried out in the general population showed that A1C and plasma glucose (FPG and/or 2-h OGTT) identify partially different groups of diabetic subjects. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies ~30–40% of previously undiagnosed patients with diabetes. A larger percentage is detected by FPG (~50%) and 2-h PG (~90%). These findings are based on several recent studies, including the 2003–2006 NHANES (30% of diabetic individuals detected by A1C ≥ 6.5%, 46% by FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, and 90% by 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL) and the IRAS (32, 45, and 87%, respectively). In Qingdao, China, the ≥ 6.5% A1C cut point detects 30% of individuals with diabetes according to 2003 ADA criteria. In Chennai, India, however, A1C ≥ 6.5% detects 78% of individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes according to these criteria. In the IRAS, A1C of 5.7–6.4% predicted type 2 diabetes better with increasing BMI, and there were significant ethnic differences in the performance of A1C of 5.7–6.4% to detect diabetes. The ethnic differences in A1C compared with glucose measurements were also well demonstrated in the Diabetes Prevention Program population and in a recent multiethnic database by Christensen et al. that showed that there are no systematic interpretations as to why a shift to an A1C-based diagnosis for diabetes has substantially different consequences for diabetes prevalence across ethnic groups and populations.

### Longitudinal changes in the relationship between hemoglobin A1c and glucose tolerance across pregnancy and postpartum [^eb23ff27]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the relationship between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and glucose tolerance across pregnancy and postpartum.

Design and Participants

In a longitudinal study of pregnant women with gestational diabetes risk factors (N = 102), we performed oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and HbA1c measurements at 10–15 weeks of gestation, 24–30 weeks of gestation (N = 73), and 6–24 weeks postpartum (N = 42). Complete blood counts were obtained from clinical records. We calculated HbA1c-estimated average glucose levels and compared them with mean OGTT glucose levels (average of fasting, 1- and 2-hour glucose levels). Linear mixed effects models were used to test for longitudinal changes in measurements.

Results

Mean OGTT glucose increased between 10–15 and 24–30 weeks of gestation (β = 8.1 mg/dL, P = 0.001), while HbA1c decreased during the same time period (β = -0.13%, P < .001). At 10–15 weeks of gestation and postpartum the discrepancy between mean OGTT glucose and HbA1c-estimated average glucose was minimal (mean [standard deviation]: 1.2 [20.5] mg/dL and 0.16 [18.1] mg/dL). At 24–30 weeks of gestation, the discrepancy widened (13.2 [17.9] mg/dL, β = 12.7 mg/dL, P < .001, compared to 10–15 weeks of gestation, with mean OGTT glucose being higher than HbA1c-estimated average glucose). Lower hemoglobin at 24–30 weeks of gestation was associated with a greater discrepancy (β = 6.4 mg/dL per 1 g/dL lower hemoglobin, P = 0.03 in an age- and gestational age-adjusted linear regression model).

Conclusions

HbA1c accurately reflects glycemia in the 1st trimester, but underestimates glucose intolerance in the late 2nd trimester. Lower hemoglobin level is associated with greater underestimation. Accounting for gestational age and maternal hemoglobin may improve the clinical interpretation of HbA1c levels during pregnancy.

Background

Point-of-care instruments for the measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) may improve the glycemic control of people with diabetes by providing a rapid result if the performance of the instruments used is acceptable. A 0.5% HbA1c difference between successive results is considered a clinically relevant change. With this in mind, the In2it from Bio-Rad and the DCA Vantage from Siemens were evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocols.

Methods

The CLSI protocols EP-5 and EP-9 were applied to investigate precision, accuracy, and bias. The bias was compared with three certified secondary reference measurement procedures. Differences between capillary and venous blood were investigated by an end-user group consisting of nurse practitioners at a diabetes care center.

Results

At HbA1c levels of 5.1 and 11.2%, total coefficients of variation (CV) for the In2it were 4.9 and 3.3%, respectively, and for the DCA Vantage were 1.7 to 1.8% and 3.7 to 5.5% depending on the lot number of the cartridges. Method comparisons showed significant lot number-dependent results for the In2it and the DCA Vantage compared with the three reference methods. No overall difference was observed between capillary and venous blood for both methods.

Conclusion

Performance results of the In2it and the DCA Vantage showed variable and lot number-dependent results. To maintain the interlaboratory CV of 5% for HbA1c, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments rules for waived point-of-care instruments should be revised. An obligation for participating in external quality schemes and taking adequate action should be considered for POC instruments that perform poorly.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^ab7a33cd]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025: A1C-based identification of high-risk states — An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) identifies a group of individuals at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular complications; these individuals should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risk, and aggressive intervention and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk, such as those with A1C ≥ 6.0% [≥ 42 mmol/mol] and individuals with both impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Analyses also note that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of high-risk Diabetes Prevention Program participants.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to restrict point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. FDA at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratories performing testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a predictor of incident diabetes [^bfc7d487]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

HbA 1c is a well-established test to track long-term glucose control and the risk for developing microvascular complications in patients with diabetes. However, until recently, HbA 1c was not an accepted test for diagnosing diabetes because of concerns about both lower specificity and sensitivity compared with fasting plasma glucose. A number of threshold values that relate HbA 1c to a diabetic diagnosis have been proposed in the past, but none were broadly adopted. A recent report by an International Expert Committee proposed that HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% on two repeated tests may be used to diagnose diabetes. These recommendations were subsequently accepted by the American Diabetes Association. Implementation of the recommendations will increase the number and frequency of HbA 1c tests obtained in patients at risk for diabetes. Indeed, the Expert Committee raised concerns about how to identify and manage higher risk individuals, as there is yet no accepted HbA 1c threshold value for initiating preventive strategies.

Evidence suggests that clinicians have been using HbA 1c in the evaluation of patients without known diabetes in the absence of clearly accepted threshold values for establishing a diagnosis. As an example, in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 there were > 500,000 patients without a prior diagnosis of diabetes who had HbA 1c tests — representing 37 and 39% of all patients having an HbA 1c test performed in those years (P.R.C. unpublished observations).

To better understand the relationship between HbA 1c levels and the subsequent risk of diagnosed diabetes, we identified a cohort of patients without diabetes in whom an HbA 1c was obtained and tracked these individuals for up to 8 years for evidence of a diabetic diagnosis. We hypothesized that a baseline HbA 1c level has predictive information for the future development of diabetes and can be used to risk stratify patients. Our data confirm the continuum of risk associated with increasing levels of HbA 1c and also identify a HbA 1c threshold value, below which the risk is nominal.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^57c4e330]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Nathan took the position that such eAG reporting with A1C will serve a useful purpose. He began by commenting that "diabetes has always been sugar-centric" and noted that what was subsequently found to be glycated hemoglobin was first described as a minor hemoglobin fraction in 1958; Rahbar found an increase in levels with diabetes a decade later. The 1997 ADA Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) intervention trials, he said, "cement A1C as the means by which we measure our targets." The goal of treatment is, he continued, an A1C < 7%, observing that "we're guiding people based on A1C." This led him to question the use of both glucose and A1C, two different measures, in treating diabetes, suggesting that this might be confusing for patients, and he suggested that the use of eAG would allow all values discussed with patients to be expressed in the same units, which he considered desirable. Such conversions have been proposed by a number of investigators, beginning with a European study and one he carried out more than 25 years ago, with robust correlation of A1C with mean self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). These considerations led to the A1C-derived average glucose (ADAG) study of more than 500 type 1 and type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, 83% of whom were Caucasian, 8% black, and 8% Hispanic, who performed continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 2–3 days monthly as well as pre- and postprandial SMBG for 4 months, giving ∼2,500 CGM and 230 SMBG values per patient. Both forms of monitoring gave similar findings, with CGM leading to the following formula: [average glucose] = 2.87 × A1C − 46.7, with r 2 0.84. Nathan suggested that the correlation might have been even higher, but that there are always measurement errors and incomplete glucose monitoring, and he acknowledged that there may be variability among individuals in rates of erythrocyte formation and hemoglobin glycation. He commented that the study was carried out in a fashion designed to minimize variability and noted that "we had screened… to try to strip the population of these errors." He agreed that the study was therefore somewhat limited because there were few people of non-Caucasian ethnicity and no data in children, pregnancy, or renal disease and that "we also had people who were generally more stable." He concluded that the use of eAG would be greatly advantageous in helping more people to understand their level of glycemia and noted that only a quarter of diabetic individuals think that they know what their A1C is, and few of these are correct.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5ec8d461]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening tests and diagnostic thresholds state that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Type 2 diabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater; prediabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55–6.94 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77–11.04 mmol/L). Because HbA1c measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an OGTT; the OGTT is performed fasting and measures blood glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

Section 1 — diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) — Diagnosis can be made by any of the following: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (after ≥ 8 h or overnight fast), plasma glucose (PG) concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load following an overnight fast, a random PG concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia, or hemoglobin A1c (A1c) level ≥ 6.5%. Diagnosis of DM requires 2 abnormal test results from the same sample or on different days; however, a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms confirms DM.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^4e1bf6f1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The most recent glycemic goal recommended by the American Diabetes Association, selected on the basis of practicality and the projected reduction in complications over time, is, in general, an A1C level of < 7%. The most recent glycemic goal set by the International Diabetes Federation is an A1C level of < 6.5%. The upper limit of the nondiabetic range is 6.1% (mean ± SD. A1C level of 5 ± 2%) with the DCCT/UKPDS-standardized assay, which has been promulgated through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and adopted by the vast majority of commercially available assays. Several recent clinical trials have aimed for A1C levels ≤ 6.5% with a variety of interventions. The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, which had the primary objective of decreasing CVD with interventions aimed at achieving an A1C level of < 6.0% vs. interventions aimed at achieving an A1C level of < 7.9%, showed excess CVD mortality in the intensive treatment group. Results from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial, both of which had different interventions and study populations than ACCORD, did not demonstrate any excess total or CVD mortality with intensive regimens that achieved A1C levels comparable with the 6.5% in ACCORD. However, none of the studies has demonstrated a benefit of intensive glycemic control on their primary CVD outcomes. Our consensus is that an A1C level of ≥ 7% should serve as a call to action to initiate or change therapy with the goal of achieving an A1C level of < 7%. We are mindful that this goal is not appropriate or practical for some patients, and clinical judgement based on the potential benefits and risks of a more intensified regimen needs to be applied for every patient. Factors such as life expectancy, risk of hypoglycemia, and the presence of CVD need to be considered for every patient before intensifying the therapeutic regimen.

Assiduous attention to abnormalities other than hyperglycemia that accompany type 2 diabetes, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, has been shown to improve microvascular and cardiovascular complications. Readers are referred to published guidelines for a discussion of the rationale and goals of therapy for the nonglycemic risk factors, as well as recommendations on how to achieve them.

### Association between prediabetes and risk of cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8fc3e206]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Prediabetes is defined as an intermediate metabolic state between normoglycaemia and diabetes and includes those with impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose. Although impaired glucose tolerance is consistently defined as a 2 hour plasma glucose concentration of 7.8–11.0 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test, the cut-off point for diagnosis of impaired fasting glucose remains controversial. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines impaired plasma glucose as fasting plasma glucose of 6.1–6.9 mmol/L, while the 2003 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline recommended a cut-off point of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L. The ADA's proposal for defining impaired fasting glucose is contentious and has not been adopted by other international guidelines for diabetes management. Some researchers opposed to the change believe that it greatly increases the prevalence of what is classified as impaired fasting glucose without any clear association with clinical complications, especially for cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality. Although some prospective studies have shown that the 2003 ADA category of impaired fasting glucose with the lower cut-off point is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, other studies have not found a similar association. Several previous meta-analyses have led to conflicting conclusions, which might be because of differences in endpoint assessments and inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the ADA also suggested haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) of 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%) could be used as another marker to define prediabetes, while the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)and the International Expert Committeesuggested using a higher cut point of 42–47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%) for prediabetes. It is unclear whether the raised HbA 1c for defining prediabetes is useful for predicting future cardiovascular disease.

Considering these inconsistencies, we performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies from general populations to evaluate associations between different definitions of prediabetes and the risk of composite cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease, stroke, and all cause mortality.

### Prevalence and prognostic value of the novel consensus definition of metabolic hyperferritinemia in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction across different glucose metabolism States [^338ad65d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

MD is defined as the presence of 1 of the following conditions: type 2 diabetes, obesity (body mass index ≥ 28 kg/m 2), or fatty liver disease, or the presence of ≥ 2 metabolic abnormalities associated with insulin resistance (overweight [body mass index > 24 kg/m 2], abdominal circumference > 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women, circulating triglycerides level > 150 mg/dL, high‐density lipoprotein level < 45 mg/dL in men and < 55 mg/dL in women, fasting blood glucose > 100 mg/dL, blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg or use of antihypertensive regimens, or homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ≥ 2.7). The diagnostic criteria for MHF encompass MD along with elevated serum ferritin levels (> 300 ng/mL in men and > 200 ng/mL in women). MHF severity was categorized into 3 grades based on serum ferritin levels: Grade 1 (300–550 ng/mL in men, 200–550 ng/mL in women), Grade 2 (550–1000 ng/mL), and Grade 3 (> 1000 ng/mL). To enhance model stability and clinical interpretability, Grades 2 and 3 were combined into a single category (Grade 2/3) due to the relatively smaller sample size of Grade 3 patients (n = 218, 2.9% of the cohort).

Abnormal glucose metabolism encompasses both prediabetes and diabetes. Prediabetes is defined as having a fasting plasma glucose level of 100–125 mg/dL or a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 5.7% to 6.4%. Diabetes is defined as having an fasting plasma glucose level of ≥ 125 mg/dL, a hemoglobin A1c level of ≥ 6.5%, a self‐reported history of the disease, or a history of using antidiabetic medications. Chronic kidney disease is defined as eGFR < 60 mL/(min×1.73 m 2). The H2FPEF score was retrospectively calculated using data abstracted from electronic health records and interpreted in accordance with current clinical guidelines.

### ACP releases updated guidance statement on A1c targets for… [^6e77c902]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Goals of glycemic control should be individualized to each patient, after discussing harms and benefits, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense.
- An A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients, because targets of 7% or less do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events.
- The medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients with an A1C level less than 6. 5%, because there is no evidence of clinical benefit in patients at this level. From the AFP Editors More than 9% of persons in the United States have type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased blood glucose levels in these patients can lead to polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and dehydration. Although lowering blood glucose levels can decrease the risk of these symptoms and the associated complications, there are still disadvantages to doing so, including adverse effects, increased treatment burden, and expense.

A1C measurement is one method for determining blood glucose levels, but it is inconsistent and can change based on a patient's race and ethnicity. Previous guidelines have recommended the use of medications to reach A1C targets; however, an ideal target remains debatable. This guidance statement from the American College of Physicians aims to help physicians achieve appropriate A1C targets via medication for nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes based on a review of six health care organization guidelines. In a review of these guidelines, the authors found no studies indicating that A1C targets less than 6. 5% improve clinical outcomes. Moreover, using medication to achieve this level had associated harms. Guidance Statements Goals of glycemic control via medication should be individualized to each patient, after talking about benefits and harms of more vs. less control, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense. Because targets of 7% or less vs.

approximately 8% do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events, an A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients. Because there is no evidence that an A1C level lower than 6. 5% has clinical benefit, and evidence has shown associated harms, the medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients who achieve an A1C level lower than
6. 5%.

### Utility of hemoglobin A1c in predicting diabetes risk [^10a298b1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There is controversy surrounding the issue of whether, and how, to screen adults for type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to measure the incidence of new diabetes among outpatients enrolled in a health care system, and to determine whether hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values would allow risk stratification for patients' likelihood of developing diabetes over 3 years.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study with 3-year follow-up at a single large, tertiary care, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). A convenience sample of 1,253 outpatients without diabetes, age 45 to 64, with a scheduled visit at the VAMC, were screened for diabetes using an initial HbA1c measurement. All subjects with HbA1c ≥ 6.0% (normal, 4.0% to 6.0%) were invited for follow-up fasting plasma glucose (FPG). We then surveyed patients annually for 3 years to ascertain interval diagnosis of diabetes by a physician. The baseline screening process was repeated 3 years after initial screening. After the baseline screening, new cases of diabetes were defined as either the self-report of a physician's diagnosis of diabetes, or by HbA1c ≥ 7.0% or FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L at 3-year follow-up. The incidence of diabetes was calculated as the number of new cases per person-year of follow-up.

Results

One thousand two hundred fifty-three patients were screened initially, and 56 (4.5%) were found to have prevalent unrecognized diabetes at baseline. The 1,197 patients without diabetes at baseline accrued 3,257 person-years of follow-up. There were 73 new cases of diabetes over 3 years of follow-up, with an annual incidence of 2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7% to 2.7%). In a multivariable logistic regression model, baseline HbA1c and baseline body mass index (BMI) were the only significant predictors of new onset diabetes, with HbA1c having a greater effect than BMI. The annual incidence of diabetes for patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 5.5 was 0.8% (CI, 0.4% to 1.2%); for HbA1c 5.6 to 6.0, 2.5% (CI, 1.6% to 3.5%); and for HbA1c 6.1 to 6.9, 7.8% (CI, 5.2% to 10.4%). Obese patients with HbA1c 5.6 to 6.0 had an annual incidence of diabetes of 4.1% (CI, 2.2% to 6.0%).

Conclusions

HbA1c testing helps predict the likelihood that patients will develop diabetes in the future. Patients with normal HbA1c have a low incidence of diabetes and may not require rescreening in 3 years. However, patients with elevated HbA1c who do not have diabetes may need more careful follow-up and possibly aggressive treatment to reduce the risk of diabetes. Patients with high-normal HbA1c may require follow-up sooner than 3 years, especially if they are significantly overweight or obese. This predictive value suggests that HbA1c may be a useful test for periodic diabetes screening.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a predictor of incident diabetes [^7b370fd4]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Several studies have suggested that HbA(1c) levels may predict incident diabetes. With new recommendations for use of HbA(1c) in diagnosing diabetes, many patients with HbA(1c) results below the diagnostic threshold will be identified. Clinicians will need to categorize risk for a subsequent diabetic diagnosis in such patients. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of HbA(1c) to predict the incidence of a diabetic diagnosis.

Research Design and Methods

We performed a historical cohort study using electronic medical record data from two Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Patients (n = 12,589) were identified with a baseline HbA(1c) < 6.5% between January 2000 and December 2001 and without a diagnosis of diabetes. Patients (12,375) had at least one subsequent follow-up visit. These patients were tracked for 8 years for a subsequent diagnosis of diabetes.

Results

During an average follow-up of 4.4 years, 3,329 (26.9%) developed diabetes. HbA(1c) ≥ 5.0% carried a significant risk for developing diabetes during follow-up. When compared with the reference group (HbA(1c) < 4.5%), HbA(1c) increments of 0.5% between 5.0 and 6.4% had adjusted odds ratios of 1.70 (5.0–5.4%), 4.87 (5.5–5.9%), and 16.06 (6.0–6.4%) (P < 0.0001). Estimates of hazard ratios similarly showed significant increases for HbA(1c) ≥ 5.0%. A risk model for incident diabetes within 5 years was developed and validated using HbA(1c), age, BMI, and systolic blood pressure.

Conclusions

The incidence of diabetes progressively and significantly increased among patients with an HbA(1c) ≥ 5.0%, with substantially expanded risk for those with HbA(1c) 6.0–6.4%.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes screening and new-onset diabetes prediction: a 6-year community-based prospective study [^cb669f62]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Various cutoff levels of hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) have been suggested to screen for diabetes, although more consensus about the best level, especially for different ethnicities, is required. We evaluated the usefulness of A1C levels when screening for undiagnosed diabetes and as a predictor of 6-year incident diabetes in a prospective, population-based cohort study.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A total 10,038 participants were recruited from the Ansung-Ansan cohort study. All subjects underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and at each biennial follow-up. Excluding subjects with a previous history of diabetes (n = 572), the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the A1C cutoff. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to predict diabetes at 6 years.

RESULTS

At baseline, 635 participants (6.8%) had previously undiagnosed diabetes. An A1C cutoff of 5.9% produced the highest sum of sensitivity (68%) and specificity (91%). At 6 years, 895 (10.2%) subjects had developed incident diabetes. An A1C cutoff of 5.6% had the highest sum of sensitivity (59%) and specificity (77%) for the identification of subsequent 6-year incident diabetes. After multivariate adjustment, men with baseline A1C ≥ 5.6% had a 2.4-fold increased risk and women had a 3.1-fold increased risk of new-onset diabetes.

CONCLUSIONS

A1C is an effective and convenient method for diabetes screening. An A1C cutoff of 5.9% may identify subjects with undiagnosed diabetes. Individuals with A1C ≥ 5.6% have an increased risk for future diabetes.

### HbA1c 5. 7–6 · 4% and impaired fasting plasma glucose for diagnosis of prediabetes and risk of progression to diabetes in Japan (TOPICS 3): a longitudinal cohort study [^4ae1ac59]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The clinical relevance of the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes to prediction of progression to diabetes has been little studied. We aimed to compare the prevalence of prediabetes when assessed by the new glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) 5·7–6·4% criterion or by impaired fasting glucose, and assessed differences in progression rate to diabetes between these two criteria for prediabetes in a Japanese population.

Methods

Our longitudinal cohort study included 4670 men and 1571 women aged 24–82 years without diabetes at baseline (diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7·0 mmol/L, self-reported clinician-diagnosed diabetes, or HbA(1c) ≥ 6·5%) who attended Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) for a routine health check between 1997 and 2003. Participants with a baseline diagnosis of prediabetes according to impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 5·6–6·9 mmol/L) or HbA(1c) 5·7–6·4%, or both, were divided into four groups on the basis of baseline diagnosis of prediabetes. Rate of progression to diabetes was assessed annually.

Findings

Mean follow-up was 4·7 (SD 0·7) years. 412 (7%) of 6241 participants were diagnosed with prediabetes on the basis of the HbA(1c) 5·7–6·4% criterion. Screening by HbA(1c) alone missed 1270 (61%) of the 2092 prediabetic individuals diagnosed by a combination of impaired fasting glucose and HbA(1c) 5·7–6·4%. Overall cumulative probability of progression to diabetes did not differ significantly between participants with prediabetes discordantly diagnosed by either HbA(1c) or impaired fasting glucose alone (incidence was 7% for HbA(1c) alone [n = 412 individuals and 30 incident cases] and 9% for impaired fasting glucose alone [n = 1270, 108 cases]; log-rank test, p = 0·3317). Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for incident diabetes were 6·16 (95% CI 4·33–8·77) for those diagnosed with prediabetes by impaired fasting glucose alone and 6·00 (3·76–9·56) for diagnosis by HbA(1c) alone, and were substantially increased to 31·9 (22·6–45·0) for diagnosis by both impaired fasting glucose and HbA(1c) compared with normoglycaemic individuals.

Interpretation

Diagnosis of prediabetes by both the new HbA(1c) criterion and impaired fasting glucose identified individuals with an increased risk of progression to diabetes. Although the new HbA(1c) criterion identified fewer individuals at high risk than did impaired fasting glucose, the predictive value for progression to diabetes assessed by HbA(1c) 5·7–6·4% was similar to that assessed by impaired fasting glucose alone. The two tests used together could efficiently target people who are most likely to develop diabetes and allow for early intervention.

### Hemoglobin A1c: need to standardize the term [^5593d763]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To discuss studies that investigate the understanding of patients with diabetes and the information provided by physicians regarding the terminology and meaning of tests for glycated hemoglobin.

Findings

Patients with diabetes seldom know or remember the terminology for glycated hemoglobin assay techniques, even when they are participating in self-monitoring of blood glucose. Physicians use a variety of terms for the glycated hemoglobin test and are not consistent in their terminology.

Conclusion

One term for glycated hemoglobin assay should be used and promoted by all health-care professionals and patients. Because it is most readily remembered, "A1C" is the preferred lay term.

### Impact of A1c screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^9ce13add]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

New clinical practice recommendations include A1C as an alternative to fasting glucose as a diagnostic test for identifying pre-diabetes. The impact of these new recommendations on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes is unknown.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2006 (n = 7,029) were analyzed to determine the percentage and number of U.S. adults without diabetes classified as having pre-diabetes by the elevated A1C (5.7–6.4%) and by the impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dl) criterion separately. Test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) using IFG as the reference standard were calculated.

RESULTS

The prevalence of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults was 12.6% by the A1C criterion and 28.2% by the fasting glucose criterion. Only 7.7% of U.S. adults, reflecting 61 and 27% of those with pre-diabetes by A1C and fasting glucose, respectively, had pre-diabetes according to both definitions. A1C used alone would reclassify 37.6 million Americans with IFG to not having pre-diabetes and 8.9 million without IFG to having pre-diabetes (46.5 million reclassified). Using IFG as the reference standard, pre-diabetes by the A1C criterion has 27% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 61% positive predictive value, and 77% negative predictive value.

CONCLUSIONS

Using A1C as the pre-diabetes criterion would reclassify the pre-diabetes diagnosis of nearly 50 million Americans. It is imperative that clinicians and health systems understand the differences and similarities in using A1C or IFG in diagnosis of pre-diabetes.

Incidence of diabetes associated with A1C levels

Among the eight studies that reported A1C categories (,–) (Table 2), the range of A1C from 4.5 to 7.1% was associated with diabetes incidences ranging from 0.1% per year to 54.1% per year. In general, studies that categorized A1C across a full range of A1C values (,–) showed that 1) risk of incident diabetes increased steeply across the A1C range of 5.0 to 6.5%; 2) both the relative and absolute incidence of diabetes varied considerably across studies; 3) the A1C range of 6.0 to 6.5% was associated with a highly increased risk of incident diabetes, frequently 20 or more times the incidence of A1C < 5.0%); 4) the A1C range of 5.5 to 6.0% was associated with a substantially increased relative risk (frequently five times the incidence of A1C < 5.0%); and 5) the A1C range of 5.0 to 5.5% was associated with an increased incidence relative to those with A1C < 5% (about two times the incidence of A1C < 5.0%).

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^df70b640]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Prediabetes — individuals whose blood glucose levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are higher than normal are classified as having prediabetes, and they have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke; age, race, and co-morbid hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia are significant risk factors associated with progression. Persons with prediabetes have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or abnormal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels, with IGT diagnosed only by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and defined by a 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g OGTT of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L), IFG defined as fasting glucose 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), and an A1C test level between 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent considered prediabetes.

### Impact of A1c screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^ff6a493c]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

New clinical practice recommendations include A1C as an alternative to fasting glucose as a diagnostic test for identifying pre-diabetes. The impact of these new recommendations on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes is unknown.

Research Design and Methods

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2006 (n = 7,029) were analyzed to determine the percentage and number of U.S. adults without diabetes classified as having pre-diabetes by the elevated A1C (5.7–6.4%) and by the impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dl) criterion separately. Test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) using IFG as the reference standard were calculated.

Results

The prevalence of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults was 12.6% by the A1C criterion and 28.2% by the fasting glucose criterion. Only 7.7% of U.S. adults, reflecting 61 and 27% of those with pre-diabetes by A1C and fasting glucose, respectively, had pre-diabetes according to both definitions. A1C used alone would reclassify 37.6 million Americans with IFG to not having pre-diabetes and 8.9 million without IFG to having pre-diabetes (46.5 million reclassified). Using IFG as the reference standard, pre-diabetes by the A1C criterion has 27% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 61% positive predictive value, and 77% negative predictive value.

Conclusions

Using A1C as the pre-diabetes criterion would reclassify the pre-diabetes diagnosis of nearly 50 million Americans. It is imperative that clinicians and health systems understand the differences and similarities in using A1C or IFG in diagnosis of pre-diabetes.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a predictor of incident diabetes [^235d6ad3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that HbA 1c may not only predict diabetes but also cardiovascular disease and death. Among women without diabetes, HbA 1c levels were significantly associated with both, although the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors may contribute additionally to this risk. Selvin et al. showed that, in a community-based population, HbA 1c was significantly associated with risk of developing both diabetes and cardiovascular disease independent of fasting glucose levels. As with our results, they showed that levels ≥ 6.0% carried the greatest risk. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that individuals with HbA 1c levels ≥ 6.0% should be targeted for prevention strategies to reduce not only incident diabetes but possibly also cardiovascular disease.

Many clinicians have been attracted to using HbA 1c as a screening test for diabetes since the test reflects longer-term glucose control, does not require fasting, has less day-to-day biologic variability, and is a well-accepted marker of risk of long-term microvascular complications. Such usage is evidenced by our large cohort of patients in whom HbA 1c levels were obtained in patients without a diagnosis of diabetes. However, prior guidelines discouraged use of HbA 1c for diagnosing diabetes, largely as a result of standardization and reproducibility issues that precluded its use in such broad settings. Current instrumentation and standardization methods aligned with the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial have abrogated most of these issues. Such evidence was cited by the International Expert Committee and affirmed by the American Diabetes Association in their acceptance of HbA 1c for screening and diagnosis.

Fig. 1
Linear regression analysis of fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c in this study population (a) (n = 4481) and in persons with diabetes by HbA1c criteria (b) (n = 199)

Based on these calculations, the correspondence of A1C to specific FPG were shown in Table 2. We found similar results of the linear regression between all study population and diabetics diagnosed only by the FPG criteria. However, A1C levels in the subjects diagnosed only by FPG criteria are slightly lower than those found in all study population. A FPG of 5.5 mmol/L predicted an A1C of 5.75% in the study population and of 5.43% in the subjects diagnosed only by FBS criteria. A FPG of 7 mmol/L also predicted an A1C of 6.42 and 6.32% respectively. However, in the subjects with diabetes diagnosed only by the A1C criteria, 5.5 and 7 mmol/L predicted 6.49 and 7.14% in the A1C respectively. From these regression equations, FPG levels for A1C of 6.5% were calculated at approximately 7.3 mmol/L in diabetics diagnosed by the FPG criteria, and 5.5 mmol/L only by A1C criteria. Mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations for specific A1C groups are summarized in Table 3. The average FPG needed to achieve specified A1C levels of lower than 5, 5.0–5.9, 6.0–6.9, 7.0–7.9, 8.0–8.9, and 9.0–9.9% and more than 10% were 4.8 mmol/L with 95% CI 2.8–6.8, 5.1 mmol/L (3.3–8.9), 6.1 mmol/L (4.0–8.7), 7.7 mmol/L (5.4–10.2), 8.8 mmol/L (7.4–12.1) 11.2 mmol/L (6.1–13.2) and 13.9 mmol/L (11.1–16.2) respectively. These results showed that mean FPG concentrations for specified A1C levels in this study were lower than those in previous western studies (Table 3).

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^dbe0d8ae]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

We examined ranges of A1C useful for identifying persons at high risk for diabetes prior to preventive intervention by conducting a systematic review. From 16 included studies, we found that annualized diabetes incidence ranged from 0.1% at A1C < 5.0% to 54.1% at A1C ≥ 6.1%. Findings from 7 studies that examined incident diabetes across a broad range of A1C categories showed 1) risk of incident diabetes increased steeply with A1C across the range of 5.0 to 6.5%; 2) the A1C range of 6.0 to 6.5% was associated with a highly increased risk of incident diabetes, 25 to 50% incidence over 5 years; 3) the A1C range of 5.5 to 6.0% was associated with a moderately increased relative risk, 9 to 25% incidence over 5 years; and 4) the A1C range of 5.0 to 5.5% was associated with an increased incidence relative to those with A1C < 5%, but the absolute incidence of diabetes was less than 9% over 5 years. Our systematic review demonstrated that A1C values between 5.5 and 6.5% were associated with a substantially increased risk for developing diabetes.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a screen for previously undiagnosed prediabetes and diabetes in an acute-care setting [^000aabd7]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In an acute-care setting, we found that an HbA 1c of 5.7% is the optimal screening cutoff for prediabetes, and 6.0% is the optimal screening cutoff for diabetes. These findings are very similar to a number of previous studies in which individuals from different ethnic and racial groups and geographic regions were tested in outpatient settings. This includes HbA 1c cutoffs for prediabetes that have been identified, respectively, from Asian Indian, Chinese, and British populations. In addition, our findings are consistent with reports from more recent studies that use retinopathy as the criterion for identifying glycemic-related vascular disease. It is important to note that our HbA 1c findings of 5.7% as a screen for prediabetes coincide with recent ADA recommendations for identifying individuals at risk for incident diabetes.

Our findings indicating an HbA 1c of 6.0% as the optimal diabetes-screening cutoff are consistent with data from other studies that use the FBS or 2-h OGTT to define diabetes (,–). The diabetes-screening cutoff that we and others have identified is lower than the diagnostic mark of 6.5% that the ADA guidelines now recommend. The difference in cutoffs can be explained in part by the desired outcome of a screening test to miss fewer people with the target disease, and, therefore, screening cutoffs typically are lower than diagnostic cutoffs. Differences also may occur because of known inconsistencies between the use of glucose and HbA 1c -based testing to diagnose diabetes because there will be patients with HbA 1c values < 6.5% who have an FBS ≥ 126 mg/dL or a 2-h OGTT ≥ 200 mg/dL. Regardless, a diabetes-screening cutoff of 6.0% effectively identifies higher-risk individuals who require referral for additional evaluation and management.

### The association of hemoglobin A1c with incident heart failure among people without diabetes: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^06133ff9]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses.

We categorized A1C using the following cut-points: < 5.0, 5.0–5.4, 5.5–5.9, and 6.0–6.4%. Baseline characteristics of the population were compared across these A1C categories. We evaluated the continuous association between A1C and the incidence rates of heart failure using a Poisson regression model incorporating linear spline terms for A1C (knots at 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0%) with adjustment for age, sex, and race. Cox proportional hazards models were used to quantify the association between the above categories of A1C and incident heart failure. We tested for interactions using the likelihood-ratio test. For 10,866 participants (98.3%) who provided fasting (≥ 8 h) blood samples, we also evaluated the association of fasting glucose levels and incident heart failure by using clinical categories of glucose concentration as follows: < 5.0, 5.0–5.5, 5.6–6.0, 6.1–6.9 mmol/l (< 90, 90–99, 100–109, and 110–125 mg/dl). We used the most prevalent category within a normal range as a reference group for both A1C (5.0–5.4%) and fasting glucose (5.0–5.5 mmol/l) levels.

### Can hemoglobin A1c levels predict diabetes risk? [^3cf2983b]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends diabetes screening every three years for patients with hypertension because they have an increased risk of developing diabetes. Experts do not agree on the usefulness of screening because no study has found early intervention to be more effective than intervention when symptoms appear. The role of hemoglobin A1C screening is unclear, but some evidence suggests that the use of A1C levels is more sensitive than fasting blood glucose levels. In addition, A1C levels can define treatment goals and risk of complications in patients with established disease. Edelman and colleagues examined whether A1C levels could predict new-onset diabetes in an outpatient population. Of the 957 patients who completed the follow-up screening, 73 developed diabetes. None of these patients had a baseline A1C level of 4. 5 percent or lower. Diabetes incidence steadily increased with increasing baseline A1C level. The annual incidence rate was 0.

8 percent for patients with normal A1C levels,
2. 5 percent for patients with high-normal levels, and 7. 8 percent for patients with elevated levels. After considering other possible associated characteristics, the authors found that only baseline body mass index was additionally associated with increased diabetes risk, with obese patients at the highest risk. The authors conclude that A1C levels can identify patients at high risk for diabetes. Obese patients are particularly at risk. The authors suggest that physicians screen their patients, paying special attention to those with risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and a family history of diabetes. Identifying patients with A1C levels from 6. 1 to
6. 9 percent might be beneficial in terms of lifestyle counseling or pharmacotherapy to delay onset of diabetes. 1 gives a B recommendation to screening high-risk patients for diabetes but states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening. No randomized controlled trials have compared outcomes based on diabetes screening with outcomes based on symptom detection. Contrary to this article, hemoglobin A1C testing is described as relatively insensitive to lower-level elevations of fasting blood glucose: 87 percent of patients with glucose intolerance determined by fasting blood glucose levels also have a normal A1C level. — c. w.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f87313ad]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes — definition and glycemic thresholds: People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol). IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) and 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L). The World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), whereas in 2003 the ADA adopted the range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L). Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension; the presence of prediabetes should prompt comprehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors and risk management.

The glucose-independent racial difference in A1C is small (~0.3 percentage points) and may reflect genetic differences in hemoglobin or red cell turnover that vary by ancestry; accordingly, the text emphasizes that we do not use race or ancestry as proxies for poorly understood genetic differences, while noting that the field lacks adequate genetic data in diverse populations.

### Establishing an evidence base for frequency of monitoring glycated haemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes: projections of effectiveness from a regression model [^d41b69dd]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is monitored to guide treatment decisions in relation to glycaemic goals over time. Changes between two consecutive HbA1c tests result not only from deterioration or improvement in glycaemic control, but also from biovariability and measurement error. We model how this short-term variability impacts on HbA1c monitoring.

Methods

Using data from a randomized trial of non-insulin treated patients with Type 2 diabetes we fitted a random-effects model for progression and variability of HbA1c. We estimated how many tests where HbA1c ≥ 7.5% (58.5mmol/mol) would be false-positive (underlying HbA1c < 7.5% but test ≥ 7.5% owing to variability) vs. true-positive, in people with initial HbA1c between 6.5% and 7.3% (48mmol/mol and 56mmol/mol).

Results

Participants (n = 320) had mean (SD) age 66 (10)years, BMI 31.3 (6.0)kg/m2 and median HbA1c was 7.1% (54mmol/mol) with interquartile range 6.6% (49 mmol/mol) to 7.7% (61 mmol/mol). Mean (95% CI) change in HbA1c was 0.1% (1mmol/mol) with 95% confidence interval 0.05% (0.5 mmol/mol) to 0.15% (2 mmol/mol) per 6months. The minimum interval at which a true-positive test is more likely than a false positive test is 270days for a starting HbA1c of 6.9% (52mmol/mol) and 360days at a starting value of 6.5% (48mmol/mol).

Conclusion

In patients with initial HbA1c close to treatment goal, retesting at 6months would yield more true-positive than false-positive tests. For patients with lower initial HbA1c, retesting at 6months would yield more false than true-positive tests. In all patients, retesting at 12months yields more true than false-positive tests. In very few patients would retesting at 3months be justified.

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1c-based diagnostic criteria [^6a01dd57]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Although A1C screening may be of limited value, better test characteristics appear to be provided by measuring random plasma glucose or glucose 1 h after a 50-g oral glucose challenge; either could be obtained opportunistically during office visits, at any time of day, and without a prior fast. Other tests or combinations of tests may also be useful, and it is possible that health economics analyses would identify one or another test as being more cost-effective in different patient populations and clinical settings. We still need to identify previously unrecognized diabetes and pre-diabetes to initiate preventive management.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^aef9b564]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic tests for identifying elevated glycemia — Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and/or HbA1c can be used; the FPG test is automated and inexpensive but reflects only a single time point, the OGTT is more sensitive but more time-consuming, costly, and variable than FPG, and some evidence suggests the OGTT is a better predictor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than FPG. HbA1c is a more long-term measure of glycemia with less sensitivity and less variability than glucose tests and can be performed in the nonfasting state; marked discrepancies between HbA1c and plasma glucose may indicate Hb variant assay interference, for which an assay without analytic interference should be used. In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease or hemodialysis), plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes; emerging data suggest that genetic variants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can significantly impact HbA1c levels. There is a strong, continuous association between HbA1c and subsequent diabetes risk, and within the HbA1c spectrum of prediabetes the yearly incidence of diabetes increases from ~3% with an HbA1c of 5.7% to ~9.5% with an HbA1c of 6.5%.

T2DM remains a highly prevalent disease and a major ASCVD risk factor. An HbA1c is the optimal screening method, with a level ≥ 6.5% indicating T2DM.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^e9302508]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic threshold, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes. Admittedly, in most circumstance the "nondiabetic" test is likely to be in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis. The healthcare professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.

The current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in Table 2.

### Translating the hemoglobin A1c with more easily understood feedback: a randomized controlled trial [^835bb567]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Previous work has indicated that for patients with diabetes, there is value in understanding glycemic control. Despite these findings, patient understanding of the hemoglobin A1C value (A1C) is notably poor. In this study, we test the effect of two alternative communication formats of the A1C on improving glycemic control among patients with poorly controlled diabetes.

Methods

177 patients with poorly controlled diabetes were randomized to one of three study arms that varied in the information they received: (1) a "diabetes report card" containing individualized information about glycemic control for each participant with letter grades ranging from A to F; (2) a "report card" containing a face whose emotion reflected current glycemic control; or (3) a "report card" with glycemic control expressed with the A1C value (standard arm). The primary study outcome was change in A1C at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in participant perceptions of their glycemic control.

Results

The average A1C for enrolled participants was 9.9% (S.D. 1.7) and did not differ significantly among study arms. We noted no significant differences in change in A1C at 6 months between the standard and experimental arms. Using multiple imputation to account for missing A1C values, the changes in A1C for the letter grade, face, and standard arms were -0.55% (-1.15, 0.05), -0.89% (-1.49, -0.29), and -0.74% (-1.51, 0.029), respectively (p = 0.67 for control vs. grade, p = 0.76 for control vs. face).

Discussion

Feedback to patients with poorly controlled diabetes in the form of letter grades and faces did not differentially impact glycemic control at 6 months or participant perceptions of current control. These efforts to improve communication and patient understanding of disease management targets need further refinement to significantly impact diabetes outcomes.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1c 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^ca2b7a54]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) at a range of 5.7–6.4% was proposed as an indicator of increased risk for type 2 diabetes in addition to the currently used criteria of intermediate hyperglycemia (IH) as follows: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

The use of A1C in a nondiabetic range may detect a different prevalence of IH compared with IFG or IGT. However, the degree of overlap between these markers is not well reported. Recent studies from diabetic populations have yielded conflicting data regarding differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor profiles among those diagnosed by A1C ≥ 6.5% and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Studies comparing CVD risk factor profiles among individuals with IH diagnosed by A1C 5.7–6.4% and OGTT are lacking.

We hypothesized that these three different markers of IH, in part, detect different individuals and that individuals with A1C 5.7–6.4% would be characterized by a more unfavorable CVD risk profile than individuals diagnosed by OGTT. To this aim, we conducted a population-based observational study to compare 1) diagnosis of IH based on A1C 5.7–6.4% with OGTT and 2) differences in CVD risk factors among the three groups.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^83e42e55]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes diagnosis — confirmatory testing and discordance management: Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis with random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L], diagnosis requires confirmation by two abnormal screening test results obtained at the same time or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed in a timely manner; for example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) both above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points also confirm the diagnosis. If results from two different tests are discordant, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test; for instance, if A1C shows two results ≥ 6.5% [= 48 mmol/mol] but FPG is < 126 mg/dL [< 7.0 mmol/L], the person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes. If abnormal A1C and FPG results are near diagnostic margins, repeat the test in 3–6 months, and substantial discordance between glucose values and A1C should prompt additional follow-up and consideration of other biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin for monitoring glycemic management.

### Identifying dysglycemic States in older adults: implications of the emerging use of hemoglobin A1c [^c3f2df20]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) was recently added to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes.

Objective

Our objective was to examine performance of A1c in comparison with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in diagnosing dysglycemia in older adults.

Design and Setting

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study at yr 4 (2000–2001) when FPG and standardized A1c measurements were available.

Participants

Of 3075 persons (aged 70–79 yr, 48% men, 42% Black) at study entry, 1865 participants without known diabetes who had appropriate measures were included.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity and specificity of A1c-based diagnoses were compared with those based on FPG and the proportion of participants identified with dysglycemia by each measure.

Results

Of all participants, 2.7 and 3.1% had undiagnosed diabetes by FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl and A1c ≥ 6.5%, respectively. Among the remaining participants, 21.1% had prediabetes by impaired fasting glucose (≥ 100 mg/dl) and 22.2% by A1c ≥ 5.7%. Roughly one third of individuals with diabetes and prediabetes were identified by either FPG or A1c alone and by both tests simultaneously. Sensitivities and specificities of A1c compared with FPG were 56.9 and 98.4% for diabetes and 47.0 and 84.5% for prediabetes, respectively. Blacks and women were more likely to be identified with dysglycemia by A1c than FPG.

Conclusions

In this older population, we found considerable discordance between FPG- and A1c-based diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes, with differences accentuated by race and gender. Broad implementation of A1c to diagnose dysglycemic states may substantially alter the epidemiology of these conditions in older Americans.

### Interplay of glycated hemoglobin and traditional risk factors for the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in people without diabetes [^588a898d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the world's leading cause of mortality, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a major contributor to the global CVD burden, accounted for approximately 23% of all deaths globally in 2021. Assessing cardiovascular risk in individuals without CVD relies on identifying the presence or absence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). Over 50% of new CVD cases in both men and women can be attributed to traditional modifiable CVRFs, including diabetes. Despite significant improvements in certain CVRFs, the prevalence of ASCVD among U.S. adults has remained relatively stable, while the overall burden of CVD has progressively increased over the past 20 years.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), defined in part by a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level ≥ 6.5%, is a major metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance, resulting in hyperglycemia and an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. Recent evidence indicates that prediabetes, as defined by HbA1c levels, is associated with an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in the general population, although findings vary significantly across studies. An analysis of individual participant data from 73 prospective studies involving 294,998 participants without a known history of diabetes mellitus or CVD at baseline showed that incorporating HbA1c values into cardiovascular risk assessment provided little additional predictive value. Additionally, low HbA1c levels (< 5.0%) have been linked to an increased risk of all-cause but not cardiovascular mortality in individuals without diabetes. The current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on diabetes, prediabetes, and CVD focus solely on individuals with diabetes, largely overlooking prediabetes due to a lack of clear evidence. In the United States, the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk score does not include HbA1c as a predictor; Similarly, the recently proposed Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs (PREVENT) equations incorporate HbA1c only as an optional variable, intended to improve risk stratification when clinically indicated, such as in individuals with diabetes or prediabetes.

Screen-detected diabetes by FPG and HbA1c

Across all studies, 16% of participants had diagnosed or previously undiagnosed screen-detected diabetes. Diagnosed diabetes was calculated based on reporting a previous diagnosis and screen-detected diabetes as having FPG and/or HbA1c levels at or above the thresholds of 7.0 mmol l −1 and 6.5% (refs. –) (Fig. 2). After age-standardization, the total prevalence of diabetes became 12%. The age-standardized prevalence of diagnosed and screen-detected diabetes were 7% and 5%, respectively. Those without a previous diabetes diagnosis had a lower BMI than those with a previous diagnosis in every region, by an average of 2.9 kg m −2 across all studies (Table 1). Among those without a previous diagnosis, participants with screen-detected diabetes (FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol l −1 and/or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) had a mean BMI that was higher than those who did not have diabetes (FPG < 7.0 mmol l −1 and HbA1c < 6.5%) by an average of 2.4 kg m −2.

The contents in b are the same as the segment of a that is below the zero line, scaled to 100% so that the composition of screen-detected diabetes can be compared across regions, regardless of its total prevalence. Having elevated levels of both biomarkers has high positive predictive value for subsequent clinical diagnosis and risk of complications, and hence this group is similar to clinically diagnosed diabetes. In a, regions are ordered by the total proportion of participants who had diagnosed and screen-detected diabetes. In b, regions are ordered by the crude proportion of participants with screen-detected diabetes who had elevated levels of both FPG and HbA1c. Extended Data Fig. 1 provides sex-specific results.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c SHOULD BE MEASURED ROUTINELY IN ALL PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS TO DOCUMENT THEIR DEGREE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL A (moderate).

Measurement of glycated proteins, primarily HbA 1c, is widely used for routine monitoring of long-term glycemic status in patients with diabetes. [The terms "glycated hemoglobin," "glycohemoglobin," "glycosylated" (which should not be used), "glucosylated hemoglobin," "HbA 1," and "HbA 1c " have all been used to refer to hemoglobin that has been modified by the nonenzymatic addition of glucose. These terms are not interchangeable, however. The current acceptable term for glycation of hemoglobin in general is "glycated hemoglobin" (GHb). HbA 1c is the specific glycated species that is modified by glucose on the N terminus of the hemoglobin β chain. "HbA 1c " is also the internationally accepted term for reporting all GHb results. Assay methods that measure total GHbs (e.g. boronate affinity methods) should be calibrated to report an equivalent HbA 1c and be reported as HbA 1c for purposes of harmonization of results. HbA 1 is composed of HbA 1a, HbA 1b, and HbA 1c and should not be measured or reported. The term "A1C test" is used by the ADA in place of HbA 1c to facilitate communication with patients. As described in the text, most of the clinical-outcome data that are available for the effects of metabolic control on complications (at least for the DCCT and UKPDS) involved the use of assay methods that quantified HbA 1c. In this report, we use the abbreviation GHb to include all forms of glycated hemoglobin.] HbA 1c is used both as an index of mean glycemia and as a measure of risk for the development of diabetes complications. HbA 1c testing and maintenance of specified concentrations during pregnancy in patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes are important for maximizing the health of the newborn and decreasing perinatal risks for the mother. Specifically, stringent control of HbA 1c values during pregnancy decreases the risk of congenital malformations, large-for-date infants, and the complications of pregnancy and delivery that can otherwise occur when glycemic control is not carefully managed. A recent consensus statement recommends an HbA 1c value of < 6% (42 mmol/mol) in these patients if it can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia. HbA 1c is also being used increasingly by quality-assurance programs to assess the quality of diabetes care (e.g. requiring that healthcare providers document the frequency of HbA 1c testing in patients with diabetes and the proportion of patients with HbA 1c values below a specified value).

### Position statement executive summary: guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^454be14c]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

8. HbA 1c

a. HbA 1c should be measured routinely in all patients with diabetes mellitus to document their degree of glycemic control. A (moderate)

b. Laboratories should use only HbA 1c assay methods that are certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) as traceable to the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) reference. The manufacturers of HbA 1c assays should also show traceability to the IFCC reference method. GPP

c. Laboratories that measure HbA 1c should participate in a proficiency-testing program, such as the College of American Pathologists (CAP) HbA 1c survey, that uses fresh blood samples with targets set by the NGSP Laboratory Network. GPP

d. Laboratories should be aware of potential interferences, including hemoglobinopathies, that may affect HbA 1c test results, depending on the method used. In selecting assay methods, laboratories should consider the potential for interferences in their particular patient population. In addition, disorders that affect erythrocyte turnover may cause spurious results, regardless of the method used. GPP

e. Desirable specifications for HbA 1c measurement are an intralaboratory CV < 2% and an interlaboratory CV < 3.5%. At least two control materials with different mean values should be analyzed as an independent measure of assay performance. B (low)

f. Samples with HbA 1c results below the lower limit of the reference interval or > 15% HbA 1c should be verified by repeat testing. B (low)

g. HbA 1c values that are inconsistent with the clinical presentation should be investigated further. GPP

h. Treatment goals should be based on American Diabetes Association recommendations, which include generally maintaining HbA 1c concentrations at < 7% and more-stringent goals in selected individual patients if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse treatment effects. Somewhat higher intervals are recommended for children and adolescents and may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy, extensive comorbid illnesses, a history of severe hypoglycemia, or advanced complications (note that these values are applicable only if the NGSP has certified the assay method as traceable to the DCCT reference).

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^1388b133]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Impact of A1c screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^709e1624]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes, a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality, has reached epidemic status among Americans. At present, 24 million Americans have diabetes with indirect and direct costs exceeding 174 billion dollars annually. The high burden and prognostic implications of diabetes have led to increasing attempts to prevent its development. Interventions for individuals and populations at high risk for diabetes or with pre-diabetes are a major focus for these prevention efforts.

Until recently, clinical practice guidelines have defined pre-diabetes as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] of 100–125 mg/dl) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (glucose of 140–199 mg/dl on a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]). Using these definitions, ∼57 million Americans have pre-diabetes. In clinical practice, FPG is a more commonly used test, compared with an OGTT, because of its logistical advantages. However, IFG still requires individuals to fast for at least 8 h before testing.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently updated its screening recommendation for pre-diabetes to include A1C, a nonfasting test, as another diagnostic testing option. Specific to pre-diabetes, these recommendations state that A1C from 5.7 to 6.4% identifies individuals at high risk for diabetes and that the label of pre-diabetes can be applied. The revised recommendations imply that the practical advantages of A1C over FPG and OGTT will make screening more widespread and help clinicians identify and intervene in this high-risk population. The guidelines do not comment on whether clinicians should use each test in isolation or in combination, but logistical advantages may make A1C a clinician's preferred test.

In this study, we used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2006 to evaluate the impact of this new recommendation on the proportion of Americans in the general population who would be classified as having pre-diabetes. Specifically, we examined the concordance in the number of U.S. adults identified as having pre-diabetes via FPG and A1C. In addition, we determined differences and similarities among the populations identified as having pre-diabetes by the A1C criterion and also by the IFG screening criterion.

The GMI is a new metric that replaces the estimated A1C and provides an estimate of the A1C based on an average of the CGM glucose levels an individual has been experiencing; Table 2 relates CGM-derived average glucose (mg/dL) to GMI (%) with examples 100→5.7, 150→6.9, 200→8.1, and 300→10.5. In a recent study of 641 individuals with T1D, 11% of participants had discordance between the A1C and the GMI of < 0.1%, although 50% and 22% had differences of ≥ 0.5% and ≥ 1.0%, respectively.

4.1.3 Limitations of

Clinical states associated with altered rates of hemoglobin turnover or erythrocyte survival will affect HbA1c measurements and therefore clinical utility (Table 1). As HbA1c directly reflects average glucose levels, highly variable glucose levels with fluctuating hypo‐ and hyperglycemia can result in the same HbA1c measurement as an individual with stable glucose levels. This is important as glycemic variability predicts severe hypoglycemia, and there is a growing body of evidence that glycemic variability is an independent risk factor for short ‐ and long‐term complications. Arguably, CGM, by virtue of providing metrics for both average glucose, glucose out of target range and glycemic variability, as well as having a very high correlation with HbA1c, provides a better reflection of overall glycemia. CGM offers an alternative proxy for HbA1c [the Glucose Management Index (GMI)], however, there is some discordance between GMI and laboratory HbA1c, and hence, the term "estimated" HbA1c should be avoided. Evidence supports the association of diabetes complications and CGM derived measures, particularly time in range. However as widespread CGM uptake has been a more recent phenomenon, it will take time for large registry data to definitively connect CGM metrics with the development of micro‐ and macrovascular complications. However, where CGM data are not available, evaluation of fructosamine and/or 1,5‐anhydroglucitol (1,5‐AG) may be the only alternative when HbA1c is not truly reflective of glycemia (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Clinical states affecting erythrocyte turnover and their effects on HbA1c

Fructosamine is the generic term for plasma protein ketoamines or 1‐amino‐1‐deoxy‐D‐fructose, and more specifically is the measurement of the total stable irreversible serum glycated proteins at any given time. The half‐life of serum proteins is significantly shorter than that of erythrocytes, and the degree of glycation is therefore more reflective of shorter‐term alterations in plasma glucose concentrations that is estimated to be 2–3 weeks, which is consistent with the half‐life of albumin (20 days) which comprises 80% of total serum proteins.1,5‐AG has been proposed in the assessment of glycemic variability. Low 1,5‐AG values are indicative of both high circulating plasma glucose concentration, as well as fluctuations in plasma glucose concentrations (hyperglycemic excursions). 1,5‐AG concentration reflects plasma glucose concentrations over the preceding 2–14 days.

Table 2.4 — Staging of type 1 diabetes defines three stages by autoimmunity and glycemia. Stage 1 includes autoimmunity with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, with multiple islet autoantibodies and no impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), normal A1C. Stage 2 includes autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic; diagnostic criteria include islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) plus dysglycemia defined by IFG: FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), or IGT: 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥ 10% increase in A1C. Stage 3 includes autoimmunity with overt hyperglycemia and symptomatic disease; diagnostic criteria are diabetes by standard criteria, and autoantibodies may become absent. Alternate additional stage 2 criteria used in trials are 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥ 18 years; dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria.
