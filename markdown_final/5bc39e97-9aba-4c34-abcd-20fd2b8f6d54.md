## Question

What are the dosing equivalents between Test E (testosterone enanthate) and testosterone cypionate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dosing equivalence between testosterone enanthate (Test E) and testosterone cypionate — whether they can be interchanged milligram-for-milligram, and what clinically meaningful differences, if any, should guide practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing for each ester and route. Then, I should review pharmacokinetics to see if half-life differences matter clinically. Next, I will look for comparative or synthesis data that treat these esters as interchangeable. After that, I need to consider formulation and indication nuances that could confuse dosing decisions. Finally, I will synthesize practical implications for switching and monitoring, ensuring safety considerations are addressed.

> Let me first confirm the labeled dosing ranges, because if the FDA labels align, that strongly supports clinical equivalence. For hypogonadal male replacement therapy, both testosterone cypionate and testosterone enanthate list 50–400 mg IM every 2–4 weeks, with dose adjusted to response, which suggests therapeutic interchangeability at the same total mg and interval, when using the same route and indication [^114kkr5h] [^115SqbcH] [^112qXEzx].

> Wait, let me verify pharmacokinetics before jumping to conclusions, because small half-life differences might tempt a dosing change that is not evidence-based. I initially thought cypionate had a clearly longer half-life than enanthate and therefore would require less frequent dosing, but hold on, I should double-check the sources. A low-certainty review lists enanthate ~4.5 days and cypionate ~4 days, while another source reports cypionate ~8 days, and the enanthate label emphasizes that IM dosing intervals are 2–4 weeks rather than specifying a half-life, underscoring that modest PK differences do not translate into different labeled intervals; this discrepancy calls for caution in overinterpreting half-life tables that are not harmonized with labeling or clinical outcomes [^1179nr16] [^115BPfjx] [^111bQ6Xt].

> Next, I should review comparative clinical evidence to see if differences between esters drive outcomes. I need to check whether head-to-head IM enanthate vs IM cypionate trials exist; hold on, I don't see direct IM-vs-IM ester comparisons provided here. However, a Bayesian network meta-analysis grouped intramuscular enanthate/cypionate together for hematologic effects, effectively treating them as a class, and a cohort comparing IM testosterone cypionate to subcutaneous enanthate focused on route-related differences rather than ester potency; taken together, these patterns support clinical interchangeability of the esters when route and dosing are aligned [^113AVqwA] [^115zm9sV].

> But wait, what if formulation or indication details confound the equivalence message. I need to ensure I'm not mixing route-specific labels with ester potency. Subcutaneous enanthate (Xyosted) is labeled as 50–100 mg weekly via autoinjector and has a boxed warning for BP, which reflects route/formulation and not higher intrinsic potency of enanthate; likewise, a label entry for gender dysphoria cites 100–200 mg IM every 2 weeks for enanthate — again an indication-specific regimen, not an ester superiority signal over cypionate; vial and strength presentations may differ between products, but these do not mandate different mg-for-mg IM dosing for hypogonadism [^115YEMzr] [^113F5JDZ] [^111KKzJJ] [^115mdiQ9].

> I should also consider safety and monitoring, because if one ester systematically produced different adverse profiles, that could argue against simple substitution. Let me think about hematological effects first: network meta-analysis shows that short-acting IM enanthate/cypionate is associated with larger mean hematocrit increases versus some other formulations; an RCT also showed significant hematocrit rise with IM cypionate over 4 months, while intranasal gel did not, fitting the known class effect of short-acting IM esters; for subcutaneous enanthate, I need to remember the BP warning and plan BP monitoring when that route is used, but this does not change IM mg-for-mg equivalence between enanthate and cypionate [^113AVqwA] [^112b87mw] [^1145TiQt].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the practical guidance: IM testosterone enanthate and IM testosterone cypionate can be considered dosing-equivalent on a 1:1 milligram basis for hypogonadal replacement, following the labeled 50–400 mg every 2–4 weeks and individual titration to clinical response and serum levels; a patient on 200 mg IM enanthate every 2 weeks can be switched to 200 mg IM cypionate every 2 weeks with similar expectations, while being mindful that individual PK variability may warrant interval or dose adjustments to avoid peaks and troughs; before and after switching, confirm diagnosis and monitor response per label, and consider safety caveats such as avoiding cypionate in severe hepatic impairment and severe renal dysfunction, and using caution with lesser renal impairment, while monitoring hematocrit and blood pressure as clinically appropriate [^114kkr5h] [^112qXEzx] [^115SxgD3] [^111pAXRP] [^112rojbJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line one more time to ensure no hidden exception undermines equivalence. The identical IM labeled dosing ranges for the same indication, the absence of compelling head-to-head evidence favoring one ester, and synthesis data grouping IM enanthate and cypionate together all support 1:1 mg-to-mg interchangeability for IM replacement; minor half-life discrepancies across lower-certainty sources do not mandate different IM dosing strategies in practice, so choice often comes down to product availability, cost, and patient preference, with routine monitoring guiding fine-tuning of dose and interval [^114kkr5h] [^112qXEzx] [^113AVqwA].

---

Testosterone enanthate and cypionate are **clinically interchangeable** for TRT, with **equivalent dosing** because their pharmacokinetics and clinical effects are nearly identical [^113AVqwA]. Both are dosed at 50–400 mg IM every 2–4 weeks [^112qXEzx], with typical maintenance of 100–200 mg every 1–2 weeks. Small differences in half-life (enanthate ~4.5 days [^1179nr16], cypionate ~8 days [^115BPfjx]) are not clinically significant, so **no dose adjustment is needed** when switching between them. Dosing should be individualized to maintain mid-normal testosterone levels, with regular monitoring of testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA.

Prior to initiating testosterone cypionate, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days, and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

Testosterone cypionate injection is for intramuscular use only and should not be given intravenously. Intramuscular injections should be administered deep into the gluteal muscle.

The suggested dosage for testosterone cypionate injection varies depending on the patient's age, sex, and diagnosis. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient's response and the appearance of adverse reactions.

Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males. Some experts advocate for lower initial dosages, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes, while lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. Chronological and skeletal ages must be considered when determining the initial dose and adjusting the dose.

For replacement therapy in the hypogonadal male, 50 to 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit. Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed during storage.

Dosage and duration of therapy with testosterone enanthate injection will depend on age, sex, diagnosis, patient's response to treatment, and appearance of adverse effects. When properly given, injections of testosterone enanthate are well tolerated. Care should be taken to slowly inject the preparation deeply into the gluteal muscle, being sure to follow the usual precautions for intramuscular administration, such as the avoidance of intravascular injection (see PRECAUTIONS).

In general, total doses above 400 mg per month are not required because of the prolonged action of the preparation. Injections more frequently than every two weeks are rarely indicated.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^1179nr16]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for male hypogonadism is a critical area in adolescent healthcare. Androgenic drugs are the primary medicines used in this treatment. The most frequently used formulations in adolescents are testosterone esters, such as enanthate, cypionate, and propionate, available as oil-based compounds for slow-release intramuscular (IM) injections. Testosterone enanthate is available in 200- or 250-mg ampoules or ready-to-use syringes. It has a half-life of 4.5 days and is cleared 90% through the kidneys and 10% through the bile. Testosterone cypionate is available in 100-mg or 200-mg vials, with a half-life of 4 days. A mixture of 100 mg decanoate, 60 mg isocaproate, 60 mg phenylpropionate, and 30 mg propionate exists in 250-mg ampoules. IM testosterone undecanoate has not been used in pediatric patients due to its long-acting period.

In adolescents over 12 years old, the anabolic as well as androgenic effects induced by replacement therapy are expected to mimic the timing and tempo observed during normal pubertal development. Androgen supplementation should start at low doses with progressive increases so that adult testosterone serum levels are attained 2 to 3 years later. This progression, approximately one Tanner stage every year, helps avoid precocious early closure of the epiphyses. The most commonly used protocols with testosterone enanthate or cypionate consist of an initial dose of 50–100 mg every 4 weeks. Due to the pharmacokinetics of these formulations, circulating testosterone attains supraphysiological levels in the first week after IM injection and subphysiological levels in the fourth week.

### Testosterone cypionate [^115BPfjx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Testosterone esters are less polar than free testosterone. Testosterone esters in oil, when injected intramuscularly, are absorbed slowly from the lipid phase; thus, testosterone cypionate can be administered at intervals of two to four weeks. Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, with about 2 percent remaining free. Generally, the amount of this sex-hormone binding globulin in the plasma determines the distribution of testosterone between its free and bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration influences its half-life.

About 90 percent of a testosterone dose is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; approximately 6 percent is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver, and it is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The half-life of testosterone cypionate, when injected intramuscularly, is approximately eight days.

In many tissues, the activity of testosterone appears to depend on its reduction to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. The steroid-receptor complex is then transported to the nucleus, where it initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action.

### Testosterone cypionate [^117XTtY2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Warnings:

- **Hypercalcemia risk**: Hypercalcemia may occur in immobilized patients. If this occurs, the drug should be discontinued.

- **Prolonged androgen use**: Prolonged use of high doses of androgens (principally the 17-α alkyl-androgens) has been associated with the development of hepatic adenomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and peliosis hepatis — all potentially life-threatening complications.

- **Geriatric patient considerations**: Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk of developing prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma, although conclusive evidence to support this concept is lacking.

- **Venous thromboembolic events**: There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone cypionate. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth, and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone cypionate and initiate appropriate workup and management.

- **Cardiovascular safety**: Long-term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. At the time of writing, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with the use of testosterone.

### Long vs short acting testosterone treatments: A look at the risks [^112UZF2p]. Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Prescriptions for testosterone therapy (TT) to treat testosterone deficiency have increased in recent years. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the risks of several treatment modalities to better counsel patients. Both short-acting and long-acting TT have been shown to restore normal serum testosterone levels and improve symptoms of testosterone deficiency. Short-acting pharmacology mimics normal physiology more closely than long-acting TT but requires multiple doses per day. Long-acting TT has a higher rate of patient adherence but is more likely to create supraphysiologic serum testosterone and pathologic sequelae.

### Testosterone therapy with subcutaneous injections: A safe, practical, and reasonable option [^117F6xua]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Injections with intramuscular (IM) testosterone esters have been available for almost eight decades and not only result in predictable serum testosterone levels but are also the most inexpensive modality. However, they are difficult to self-administer and associated with some discomfort. Recently, subcutaneous (SC) administration of testosterone esters has gained popularity, as self-administration is easier with this route. Available data, though limited, support the feasibility of this route. Here we review the pharmacokinetics and safety of SC testosterone therapy with both long- and ultralong-acting testosterone esters. In addition, we provide guidance for clinicians on how to counsel and manage their patients who opt for the SC route.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Systematic review of available literature on SC testosterone administration including clinical trials, case series, and case reports. We also review the pharmacology of testosterone absorption after SC administration.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Available evidence, though limited, suggests that SC testosterone therapy in doses similar to those given via the IM route results in comparable pharmacokinetics and mean serum testosterone levels. With appropriate training, patients should be able to safely self-administer testosterone esters SC with relative ease and less discomfort compared with the IM route.

- **Conclusion**: Although studies directly comparing the safety of SC vs. IM administration of testosterone esters are desirable, clinicians should consider discussing the SC route with their patients because it is easier to self-administer.

### Comparison of hematocrit change in testosterone-deficient men treated with intranasal testosterone gel vs intramuscular testosterone cypionate: A randomized clinical trial [^112b87mw]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Our primary aim was to compare changes in hematocrit in testosterone-deficient men treated with intranasal testosterone gel versus intramuscular testosterone cypionate.

- **Materials and methods**: This 2-arm, open-label, randomized trial recruited men with testosterone deficiency at the University of Miami between August 2020 and October 2022. Men with two total testosterone levels < 350 ng/dL and hypogonadal symptoms, aged 18–75 years, were randomly assigned to receive either intranasal testosterone gel 11 mg 3 times daily or intramuscular testosterone cypionate 200 mg every 2 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in hematocrit after 4 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes were changes in serum testosterone, estradiol, prostate-specific antigen, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and the 6-item International Index of Erectile Function.

- **Results**: Of the 81 men randomized, 54 completed treatment (intranasal n = 23; intramuscular n = 31). The mean age was 47.5 versus 49.5 years, with mean baseline testosterone of 244.6 versus 240.7 ng/dL and mean hematocrit of 44.4% versus 42.7% in intranasal versus intramuscular groups, respectively. Men who received intramuscular injections had a significant increase after 4 months of treatment in mean hematocrit from 42.7% to 46.6% (P < .0001), but there was no significant change in men who received intranasal gel (P = 0.233). Men in both groups experienced significantly increased serum testosterone levels throughout the study period, though a larger increase was seen in men treated with intramuscular injections (mean change 511 vs 283, P = 0.025).

### Safety of a new subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector: Results of a 26-week study [^112m6UVh]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with testosterone deficiency (TD) can be treated with exogenous testosterone (T) to achieve and maintain physiologic T levels and prevent negative clinical symptoms. With many testosterone replacement therapies currently available, this registration safety study was conducted to further characterize the clinical profile of chronically administered, concentration-guided subcutaneous testosterone enanthate (TE) dosing.

- **Aim**: The purpose of this study was to confirm the safety and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the subcutaneous TE auto-injector (SCTE-AI) in adult men with TD.

- **Methods**: In this phase III, 26-week study, 133 men aged 18–75 years with symptomatic TD self-administered SCTE-AI 75 mg once weekly for 6 weeks from July 2015 to June 2016. Dosing was adjusted when indicated to 50 mg or 100 mg to maintain T trough levels between 350 and 650 ng/dL (12.1–22.5 nmol/L). PK data were collected from a subgroup of patients receiving 75 mg SCTE-AI through week 12. Safety, including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), lipid levels, and adverse drug reactions, and PK were assessed.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes were the documentation of the reproducibility of trough concentration-guided exposure to SCTE, the 6-month safety profile, and PK data for the 75 mg dose SCTE.

- **Results**: In total, 34 patients (25.6%) experienced adverse drug reactions. The most frequently reported were increased hematocrit (≥ 52%) in 10 patients (7.5%), injection-site hemorrhage in 6 patients (4.5%), and injection-site bruising in 4 patients (3.0%).

### Effects of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate on body composition and bone mineral density in female-to-male transsexuals [^114jkV6o]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). High credibility.

The most common treatment regimen in female-to-male transsexuals is the administration of short-acting testosterone esters intramuscularly every two weeks. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of long-acting intramuscular testosterone undecanoate on body composition and bone mineral density during cross-sex hormone therapy in female-to-male transsexuals.

Forty-five female-to-male transsexuals (FtMs) were treated with injections of testosterone undecanoate 1,000 mg intramuscularly every 12 weeks over 24 months. The main outcome measures included comparisons of body composition, bone mineral density, hormone parameters, and lipids after 12 months and after 24 months with baseline values. Sonographic findings in the ovaries and endometrium, clinical and adverse effects during the study period were also recorded.

There was a significant increase in lean mass in the FtMs during the study period compared to baseline values, whereas no change in BMI, fat mass, and bone mineral density was observed. There was a significant decline in gonadotropins, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, sex hormone-binding globulin, and high-density lipoprotein, while testosterone and triglyceride levels increased significantly after 12 and 24 months. The ovaries remained unchanged and no noticeable endometrial pathology was observed. No mortality or morbidity was reported during the study period. Additionally, there was a cessation of menstrual bleeding, an increase in clitoral growth, libido, body and beard hair growth, deepened voices, and a decline in breast size.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111gK2zf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations pertaining to the associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and female sexual function show that the associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and sexual function in women remain uncertain. This uncertainty is due to issues relating to the sensitivity and specificity of androgen assays in some studies and insufficient data (Insufficient). The physiology of androgens is complex because of their conversion in tissues and possible intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues (Insufficient). No cutoff blood level can be used for any measured circulating androgen to differentiate women with and without sexual dysfunction (Grade C).

- **Recommendations regarding systemic testosterone therapy**: For postmenopausal women, doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women should be based on findings from meta-analyses of placebo/comparator-controlled RCTs. There are insufficient data to make any recommendations regarding the use of testosterone in premenopausal women for treatment of sexual function or any other outcome (Insufficient).

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone treatment**: This pertains to naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), with or without concurrent estrogen therapy. Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual function. This includes increases, above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy, of an average of one satisfying sexual event per month, and increases in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm.

### Randomized cross-over clinical trial of injectable vs. implantable depot testosterone for maintenance of testosterone replacement therapy in androgen deficient men [^1153Kc1o]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Life-long testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for younger men with organic androgen deficiency is best provided by depot testosterone (T) products. This study directly compared the two long-acting depot T products: subdermal T implants (TI) and injectable T undecanoate (TU), for maintenance of TRT.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Men with organic androgen deficiency (n = 38) undergoing regular TRT at an academic andrology centre were recruited for a two-period, randomized-sequence, cross-over clinical trial without an intervening wash-out period of TRT maintenance.

- **Outcomes**: For both depot T products, their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were evaluated using a range of androgen-sensitive clinical, laboratory, and quality of life measures, as well as preference for ongoing treatment after experience with both products.

- **Results**: The two depot T products had distinct pharmacokinetics and were not bioequivalent. However, there were no consistent clinical differences in a comprehensive range of pharmacodynamic measures reflecting androgen effects on biochemistry, hematology, muscle mass and strength, and quality of life, mood, and sexual function. The majority (91%) of participants chose TU over TI at study completion.

- **Conclusion**: Despite significant pharmacokinetic differences, the two depot T products are clinically interchangeable, allowing for choice dependent on patient and physician delivery preference in practice; however, most patients preferred the injectable over the implantable form.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^115ZWYe5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Mean and median changes in PSA were small and comparable between the treatment groups. In addition, the study did not observe a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for the proportion of patients with PSA values > 4 ng/mL or with a change from baseline > 1.4 ng/mL at the end of study (1.9% oral TU; 3.8% topical T). Consistent with the PSA data, both treatment groups showed only minimal and clinically insignificant effects on urinary symptoms measured by I-PSS.

The cosyntropin stimulation sub-study was included to evaluate the effect of oral TU on cortisol production. This inclusion was due to findings of adrenal cortex atrophy and reduced cortisol levels in dogs treated with high doses of oral TU. Although the oral TU group had a significantly lower proportion of patients achieving a post-cosyntropin stimulation cortisol value ≥ 18 µg/dL compared to the topical T group (79% vs. 100%), there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups on Day 1 and at the final study day for maximum cortisol concentrations post-injection and changes in cortisol concentrations from pre-injection.

Four oral TU patients had cortisol values following cosyntropin stimulation that slightly fell below the response cutoff level of 18 µg/dL. However, these cortisol level responses (range: 16.5 to 17.6 µg/dL) were not consistent with adrenal insufficiency and were not considered clinically significant. Notably, during T treatments, and similar to SHBG levels, cortisol binding globulin levels were suppressed in the oral TU group compared to the topical T group.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^114Aftya]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Simulation results evaluating the mean T concentration (C avg) versus time of single sample collection after oral TU serve as a surrogate for true C avg. Concordance between the decision to adjust oral TU dose based on the single sample determination of circulating T concentration at 4 and 6 hours after the morning oral TU dose is considered, focusing on the outcome of decisions for the first and second dose-titration cycles.

To monitor T levels in patients receiving oral TU, standard blood collection techniques require a derived conversion factor. This accounts for the TU-to-T conversion in serum from clotted blood at room temperature versus NaF-EDTA blood collection tubes held on ice, which prevents conversion, as employed in the Phase 3 clinical trial. Previous findings demonstrated that the amount of T generated from TU-to-T conversion is partly a function of TU concentration. NaF directly decreased T levels assayed by LC/MS-MS when blood was collected into NaF-containing tubes. Consequently, we calculated a conversion factor based on the regression equations or the estimated TU concentration 6 hours post-dose, specifically 52 ng/mL, obtained from a non-published study.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Ubn9i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on the evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. Evaluated outcomes included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient's preferences.

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction if warranted by the reevaluation.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^116Apomu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Oral delivery of testosterone (T) is simple, convenient, and should foster improved patient adherence, a well-described problem with topical T products. In addition, oral T administration avoids the potentially painful injection of T-esters (including testosterone undecanoate, TU) and eliminates all risk of T transference to women and children, a risk associated with topical gel/solution products. Oral TU was not associated with liver toxicity in the present study nor in prior clinical studies of this oral TU formulation, in which men were treated with oral TU at higher dosages for up to two years (ClinTrials.gov: NCT01403116 and NCT01699178). Additionally, the new oral TU product was not observed to have an overall safety profile different from T replacement products as a class, with the possible exception of effects on blood pressure (BP). However, the magnitude of the oral TU effect on BP was the same as that observed for a weekly injected (subcutaneously) T-enanthate formulation when BP was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).

Our study has several strengths and weaknesses. This is the first published study of oral TU in hypogonadal men to demonstrate pharmacokinetic efficacy in line with U.S. regulatory approval standards. We have demonstrated through two different but related analyses that a single blood sample can be collected about 4–6 hours after the morning oral TU dose to assess the approximate average concentration of T over the dosing interval, thereby reliably guiding needed dose adjustments. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the dose titration scheme prospectively evaluated in this study is robust based on the overall percentage of men who achieved…

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^115APBbx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Although the efficacy of TRT therapies in the U.S. is based solely on T PK parameters, the clinical benefit is better assessed using patient-reported outcomes, such as the PDQ questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses the patient's sexual health across several domains. In the Testosterone Trials, question 4 of the PDQ questionnaire was one of the primary endpoints, and clinically meaningful score change was determined using data from this study. In the present study, there were statistically significant improvements in all domains of the questionnaire in both treatment groups. Of particular note, oral TU was associated with a significant increase (both statistically and from a clinical perspective) in the sexual activity domain — a finding consistent with that observed with topical T in this study and in the T trial in older men.

Oral TU was associated with a small but significant increase in systolic BP versus topical T. The observed increase in systolic BP in some oral TU patients is consistent with effects reported for a new parenteral (subcutaneous) form of T-enanthate now marketed in the US, an older formulation of TU available outside the US, and an oral TU product in phase 3 development [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT No. 03868059]. In an effort to determine the etiology of elevated BP, we explored the potential relationship between the rise in BP and numerous other factors (data not included herein), including oral TU dose, total and free T, estradiol and DHT concentrations, and changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin (as a surrogate for viscosity and increase in).

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^114G6eEa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Two approaches were taken to determine the optimal time for the assessment of circulating testosterone based on a single blood sample after the morning oral TU dose. This was aimed at providing dosing guidance for oral TU in real-world clinical settings where the testosterone response to TRT is determined from a single blood sample.

First, extensive simulation and modeling of pharmacokinetic (PK) data were used to identify a discrete blood sampling range (e.g. 4 to 6 hours after oral TU) that would consistently yield a testosterone value in close agreement with the actual testosterone C_avg based on serial PK samples. The population PK of testosterone following oral TU dosing were modeled with a one-compartment model with first-order absorption following a time lag. This included a central volume of distribution and first-order clearance. Inter-subject and inter-occasion variability were incorporated into the time-lag, absorption, volume, and clearance parameters. Testing of each candidate status sample collection time and choice of cut-off thresholds utilized 1,000 simulated patients. These patients were run through the protocol-designated TU dose titration schedule and maintenance treatment period. The sources of inter-occasion variability introduced random variability among multiple testosterone concentration assessments (i.e. each titration visit and end of study) made for each simulated subject.

Second, concordance analysis was performed to identify the best post-dose testosterone assay time point to guide any necessary dose adjustment in oral TU patients. Concordance is defined herein to describe the extent of agreement between a decision.

### Testosterone enanthate [^111bQ6Xt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Testosterone esters are less polar than free testosterone. Testosterone esters in oil injected intramuscularly are absorbed slowly from the lipid phase; thus, testosterone enanthate can be given at intervals of two to four weeks.

Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, and about two percent is free. Generally, the amount of this sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in the plasma will determine the distribution of testosterone between free and bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration will determine its half-life.

About 90 percent of a dose of testosterone is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about six percent of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. There are considerable variations of the half-life of testosterone as reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes.

In responsive tissues, the activity of testosterone appears to depend on reduction to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. The steroid-receptor complex is transported to the nucleus where it initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action.

### Single-dose testosterone administration increases men's preference for status goods [^116ANTFu]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

To increase the ecological validity of our pharmacological treatment, we administered testosterone (T) using a widely prescribed gel at a typical daily dose (100 mg), which leads to elevated serum T levels within the normal male physiological range. This design choice might have led to effects that are moderate in size (task 1: d = 0.18; task 2: d = 0.28), though sufficiently large for detection in our study. Future research should explore whether dose, timing of exposure (i.e. the lag between T administration and the behavioral task), and delivery type (e.g. topical, oral) might lead to different effects on behavior.

Moreover, the causal connection between T and status appears to be bi-directional. We find that changes in T causally promote attitudes toward status-enhancing goods, and other studies have shown that consumption of such goods changes T levels. This relationship suggests a T-mediated process in which status consumption and T level might reinforce each other, calling for further investigations into the mutual influence of T and status consumption over time. Given that a reliable association between baseline T levels and consumer preferences emerged only in the first task, and as this is the first study testing this relationship, more research is needed to establish the robustness and variation of a dispositional effect of T on consumer preferences.

Furthermore, while the effects reported here were robust when controlling for mood, beliefs about treatment, and levels of other hormones that might have influenced behavior, we cannot entirely rule out other potential effects.

### Cardiovascular risks and elevation of serum DHT vary by route of testosterone administration: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115A26fD]. BMC Medicine (2014).

Potential cardiovascular (CV) risks associated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) are currently a topic of intense interest. However, no studies have specifically addressed CV risk as a function of the route of administration of TRT.

- **Methods**: Two meta-analyses were conducted. The first analyzed CV adverse events (AEs) in 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRT lasting 12 weeks or more. The second examined 32 studies reporting the effect of TRT on serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

- **Results**: Out of 2,313 studies identified, 35 were eligible, including 3,703 mostly older men who experienced 218 CV-related AEs. No significant risk for CV AEs was present when all TRT administration routes were grouped (relative risk (RR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76 to 2.13, P = 0.34). When analyzed separately, oral TRT produced significant CV risk (RR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.45 to 3.55, P = 0.015), while neither intramuscular (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.28 to 1.56, P = 0.32) nor transdermal (gel or patch) TRT (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.62 to 2.62, P = 0.48) significantly altered CV risk. Of the 419 studies identified, 32 were eligible, which included 1,152 men receiving TRT. No significant difference in the elevation of serum testosterone was observed between intramuscular or transdermal TRT. However, transdermal TRT elevated serum DHT (5.46-fold, 95% CI: 4.51 to 6.60) to a greater magnitude than intramuscular TRT (2.20-fold, 95% CI: 1.74 to 2.77).

- **Conclusions**: Oral TRT produces significant CV risk. While no significant effects on CV risk were observed.

### Pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of absorbed testosterone after administration of a 1.62% testosterone gel to different application sites in men with hypogonadism [^112yahmq]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and safety of a new formulation (1.62%) of testosterone gel that produces eugonadal serum testosterone levels with the use of a lower amount of gel than the currently available 1% gels.

- **Methods**: In an open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study, 36 male patients with hypogonadism applied 5 g of 1.62% testosterone gel (81 mg of testosterone) once daily to the abdomen, to the upper arms/shoulders, or alternating between both sites according to an established schedule for seven days. Serum levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol were measured to compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the three treatments.

- **Results**: Each application method produced average serum testosterone concentrations within the eugonadal range (300 to 1,000 ng/dL), and steady-state testosterone concentrations were achieved after two days of gel application to either the abdomen or the upper arms/shoulders. When testosterone gel was applied to the abdomen, approximately 30% to 40% lower bioavailability (based on the area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours) was observed in comparison to application to the upper arms/shoulders. The 1.62% testosterone gel was found to be safe and well-tolerated in men with hypogonadism.

- **Conclusion**: Although lower testosterone bioavailability was observed after abdominal application of the 1.62% testosterone gel compared to application to the upper arms/shoulders, application to either site yielded eugonadal levels of serum testosterone.

### Long-term treatment patterns of testosterone replacement medications [^114xa9VV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is prescribed to men diagnosed with hypogonadism to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life, and improve overall health. However, most men use TRT for only a short duration.

- **Aim**: To evaluate the long-term treatment patterns in hypogonadal men using topical TRT or short-lasting TRT injections.

- **Methods**: Using the Truven MarketScan® Database, 15,435 men who received their first (index) topical TRT prescription and 517 men who received their short-lasting TRT injection index prescription in 2009 were followed from 12 to 30 months after treatment initiation. Treatment interruption was defined as a medication gap of more than 30 days. Patients who remained off treatment were classified as having discontinued treatment. Patients who restarted therapy after 30 days were classified as cyclic users. Patients were required to have continuous insurance coverage during 1 year prior to treatment initiation and at least 1 year afterward.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: Main outcome measures were length of therapy, discontinuation, and restarts of topical TRT or short-lasting TRT injections.

- **Results**: The patient characteristics were similar for patients who received topical TRT or short-lasting TRT injections. Of the patients who discontinued therapy during the follow-up period, the percentages of patients who were still on therapy after 3 months were 52% and 31% for topical TRT and short-lasting TRT users, respectively. For cyclic users, there was an attrition rate of approximately 40% to 50% of patients in each cycle.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, despite uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label. Women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, a global consensus position statement on testosterone therapy for women, based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provides a compelling case.

This position statement was developed by consensus between participating organizations to inform healthcare professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. **Objectives**: The aims were to provide clear guidance on which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^115yTexP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

There was no clinically significant difference in dose-normalized T C avg among the meal types, indicating that dose titration based on post-AM blood samples was not significantly impacted by the AM meal fat composition between 15 to 45 g fat. There was also no significant effect of food on peak T (C max) concentrations. These data demonstrate the reproducibility of PK responses of patients on a particular diet (i.e. with respect to fat content) over the PK visits, regardless of their oral TU dose. Dose normalization compensates for any dose titration changes between PK visits. The PK patterns were similar with both the AM and PM doses, and even though the high fat and very low fat patients had the most variability in the between visit PK values, they were not substantially different between visits, nor substantially different from patients on diets with other fat content.

### Testosterone cypionate [^113Sk1sn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy may develop acute urethral obstruction. Priapism or excessive sexual stimulation may occur. Oligospermia is possible after prolonged administration or excessive dosage. If any of these effects appear, the androgen should be stopped. If restarted, a lower dosage should be used. Testosterone cypionate should not be interchangeably used with testosterone propionate due to differences in duration of action. Additionally, testosterone cypionate is not for intravenous use.

Patients should be instructed to report any nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, ankle swelling, or too frequent or persistent erections of the penis.

- **Laboratory tests**: Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be checked periodically in patients receiving long-term androgen administration to detect polycythemia. Serum cholesterol may increase during androgen therapy.

- **Drug interactions**: Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants; thus, the dosage of the anticoagulant may need reduction to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia. Co-administration of oxyphenbutazone as well as androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone. In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements.

- **Drug/laboratory test interferences**: Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Note that free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged.

### Longitudinal changes in liver enzyme levels among transgender people receiving gender affirming hormone therapy [^1131J9HG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Four US-based studies and one study from Belgium evaluated the effects of shorter-acting testosterone esters, administered as weekly or biweekly injections at doses ranging from 25 to 300 mg. All but one of these studies relied on retrospective chart reviews. The only study with prospective follow-up was based on a relatively small cohort (n = 12) of patients who received masculinizing GAHT at a clinical center in Boston, MA.

The average ALT levels in that study increased from 19 IU/L at baseline to 24 IU/L after 12 months of treatment with 50–125 mg of testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate injected every two weeks. The corresponding increase for AST was from 21 to 25 IU/L; however, none of the observed differences was statistically significant due to the small sample size.

Statistically significant upward trends in ALT and AST concentrations following weekly or biweekly testosterone injections were also reported in a study from Ghent, Belgium, and a recent study from Dallas, TX. By contrast, two other US-based studies found no evidence that testosterone was associated with higher levels of either enzyme.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^115Jh6UV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

As the primary intervention for evaluation in this review, androgens, including testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), are considered in all formulations, doses, and routes of administration. These may be used either alone or in combination with another active treatment, such as estrogens, progestogens, or low-dose antidepressants. Testosterone and DHEA are currently used in clinical practice to treat peri- and postmenopausal women, with numerous randomized controlled trials assessing their effectiveness and risks. Future updates of this review will include new interventions emerging from clinical trials, such as phytopharmaceuticals, complementary therapies, and steroids.

The timing of the intervention is between peri- and postmenopause, i.e. during the period when ovarian follicular activity declines, typically between 45 and 55 years of age. The duration of the intervention is typically between 4 and 24 weeks, during which time clinically significant effects can be achieved.

Studies that compare these two types of androgen therapy (testosterone or DHEA) versus placebo, no treatment, or another active treatment (such as estrogens, progestogens, or low-dose antidepressants) will be included. The studies will be categorized into the following comparisons:

- **Androgens alone**: Regardless of formulation, dose, or route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention.
- **Androgens in combination with estrogen**: Regardless of formulation, dose, or route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention.

Studies of the ergogenic effects of supraphysiological concentrations of circulating testosterone require the administration of graded doses of exogenous testosterone for extended periods. Due to ethical concerns regarding risks of unwanted virilization and hormone-dependent cancers, few studies have administered supraphysiological testosterone doses to healthy women. However, a well-designed, randomized placebo-controlled study of postmenopausal women investigated the effects of different testosterone doses on muscle mass, performance, and physical function.

Sixty-two women (mean age, 53 years) all received a standard estrogen-replacement dose during a 12-week run-in period to eliminate any potential confounding effects of estrogen deficiency. After this period, they were randomized into five groups receiving weekly injections of testosterone enanthate (doses: 0, 3 mg, 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, and 25 mg, respectively) for 24 weeks. The increasing doses of testosterone produced an expected dose response in serum testosterone concentrations (measured by LC-MS), with the highest testosterone dose (25 mg/week) producing a mean nadir concentration of 7.3 nmol/L.

The participants whose testosterone concentrations were increased to 7.3 nmol/L achieved significant increases in muscle mass and strength, ranging from 4.4% for muscle (lean) mass to between 12% and 26% for measures of muscle strength (chest and leg press, loaded stair climb). As muscle strength measurement is effort-dependent, the placebo-controlled design of the Huang et al. study supports the further interpretation that the increased testosterone levels contributed to these significant improvements.

### The effect of route of testosterone on changes in hematocrit: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113AVqwA]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

We sought to compare testosterone formulations and determine the degree that hematocrit increases vary by testosterone therapy formulation. As head-to-head trials are rare, network meta-analysis of the contemporary studies is the only way to compare hematocrit changes by testosterone type, including topical gels and patches, injectables (both short-acting and long-acting), and oral tablets.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a thorough search of listed publications in Scopus®, PubMed®, Embase®, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 29 placebo-controlled randomized trials (3,393 men) met inclusion criteria for analysis of mean hematocrit change after testosterone therapy. Randomized controlled trial data for the following formulations of testosterone were pooled via network meta-analysis: gel, patch, oral testosterone undecanoate, intramuscular testosterone undecanoate, and intramuscular testosterone enanthate/cypionate.

- **Results**: All types of testosterone therapies result in statistically significant increases in mean hematocrit when compared with placebo. Meta-analysis revealed all formulations, including gel (3.0%, 95% CI 1.8–4.3), oral testosterone undecanoate (4.3%, 0.7–8.0), patch (1.4%, 0.2–2.6), intramuscular testosterone enanthate/cypionate (4.0%, 2.9–5.1), and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate (1.6%, 0.3–3.0) result in statistically significant increases in mean hematocrit when compared with placebo. When comparing all formulations against one another, intramuscular testosterone cypionate/enanthate were associated with a significantly higher increase in hematocrit.

### Efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in men: An evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^113esc8W]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Testosterone treatment rates in adult men have increased in the United States over the past two decades. This study aims to assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.

- **Data sources**: English-language searches of multiple electronic databases (January 1980 to May 2019) and reference lists from systematic reviews were used.

- **Study selection**: The selection included 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least six months' duration that evaluated transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment. These trials reported prespecified patient-centered outcomes. Additionally, 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels that reported harms information were included.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was conducted by a single investigator and confirmed by a second; two investigators assessed risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: The studies enrolled mostly older men who varied in age, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. Testosterone therapy improved sexual functioning and quality of life in men with low testosterone levels, although effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Testosterone therapy had little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. Evidence on harms reported in trials was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^116ymx14]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean testosterone (T) concentration (C avg) after two dose-adjustment cycles. The objective was to demonstrate that at least 75% (with a lower 95% CI of 65%) of patients treated with oral TU (JATENZO®) achieved a T C avg in the eugonadal range of 252 to 907 ng/dL (9 to 31 nmol/L) for blood collected in NaF-EDTA tubes. A topical testosterone solution (i.e. Axiron®) was used as the active T comparator.

Peak testosterone concentrations (C max) were measured over 24 hours at several points during the study, forming the basis of a secondary efficacy assessment based on FDA criteria. Specifically, T-replacement products must yield a C max response that aligns closely with the following targets:

- **Target alignment**: ≥ 85% of patients with a C max ≤ 2500 ng/dL (87 nmol/L). These C max categories were ostensibly based on the upper eugonadal limit in serum of 1000 ng/dL (35 nmol/L).

However, the eugonadal T range in NaF-EDTA plasma, when assayed by LC/MS-MS, only extended to 907 ng/dL. Therefore, C max was also evaluated (post hoc) in light of a second set of C max categories based on T assays in this matrix:

- **Matrix-based evaluation**:
	- ≥ 85% of patients with a C max ≤ 1361 ng/dL (47 nmol/L).
	- ≤ 5% of patients with C max between 1633–2268 ng/dL (57–79 nmol/L).
	- No patients with a C max > 2268 ng/dL (79 nmol/L).

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^1159FYNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism, or androgen deficiency, is diagnosed when unequivocally low serum testosterone (T) levels, typically less than 300 ng/dL (~10 nmol/L), and consistent signs and symptoms are present. Regardless of the etiology, several signs and symptoms often can be managed with exogenous T replacement.

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is administered by various delivery routes, including transdermal gels and lotions; intramuscular and subcutaneous injections; surgically implanted pellets; dermal patches; intranasal gels; and oral capsules and tablets, such as methyltestosterone. Each of these delivery routes is associated with drawbacks well known to healthcare practitioners (HCP) and their patients, such as pain of injection, dermal irritation, T transference, and liver toxicity (oral methyltestosterone). What has been absent from the HCP's armamentarium of TRT products in the U.S. is an oral T formulation that meets regulatory standards for safety and efficacy. For example, the FDA requires average serum T concentrations in the eugonadal range of 300–1000 ng/dL (10–35 nmol/L) for at least 75% of treated men, with peak T concentrations largely below 1500 ng/dL (52 nmol/L).

Historically, efforts to administer oral T have taken two primary paths: alkylation of T at the C-17 position to create T analogs that are resistant to first-pass hepatic metabolism, exemplified by methyltestosterone, which was first synthesized and used clinically by Ruzika in 1935; or fatty acid esterification of T to create a T-ester, exemplified by T-undecanoate (TU), which is absorbed via the intestinal lymph.

### Comparison of outcomes for hypogonadal men treated with intramuscular testosterone cypionate versus subcutaneous testosterone enanthate [^115zm9sV]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2), hematocrit (HCT), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to treatment with intramuscular testosterone cypionate (IM-TC) versus subcutaneous testosterone enanthate autoinjector (SCTE-AI). IM-TC is known to cause significant rises in E2, HCT, and PSA due to its supraphysiological testosterone peaks, whereas the novel SCTE-AI was designed with a lower testosterone peak-to-trough ratio to mitigate these reactions.

A total of 234 hypogonadal men were treated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) via IM-TC 100 mg weekly or SCTE-AI 100 mg weekly. TT, E2, HCT, and PSA levels were obtained at baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment. Significant differences in baseline and post-treatment levels were identified by univariate analysis. Linear regression models determined whether treatment modality was independently associated with post-TRT levels of TT, E2, HCT, and PSA.

Post-TRT, both cohorts had significant increases in trough TT compared to their baseline levels (IM-TC: 313.6 ng/dL to 536.4 ng/dL, p < 0.001; SCTE-AI: 246.6 ng/dL to 552.8 ng/dL, p < 0.001). After linear regression, the type of TRT modality was not found to be associated with TT levels (p = 0.057). SCTE-AI was independently associated with lower post-therapy E2 (p < 0.001) and HCT (p < 0.001). Neither TRT modality was associated with significant post-therapy elevation of PSA (p = 0.965).

In conclusion, while both IM-TC and SCTE-AI provide a significant increase in TT levels, SCTE-AI is associated with lower levels of post-therapy HCT.

### Effects of oral androstenedione administration on serum testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women [^114JfQwB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Androstenedione is a steroid hormone and an intermediate in the synthetic pathway of both testosterone and estradiol in men and women. It is available without a prescription and taken with the expectation that it may have beneficial effects on strength, general well-being, libido, and quality of life. Although studies have shown that oral androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estradiol levels in men, the hormonal effects of androstenedione in postmenopausal women are unknown.

We randomly assigned 30 healthy postmenopausal women to receive 0, 50, or 100 mg androstenedione as a single oral dose. After androstenedione administration, we made hourly measurements of serum androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone concentrations during 12 hours of frequent blood sampling.

- **Results**: The mean change (± SD) in serum androstenedione area under the curve (AUC) was greater in both the 50-mg (79 ± 39%) and 100-mg dose groups (242 ± 184%) compared to the control group (-29 ± 28%). The comparison between the control and 50-mg group, as well as the control and 100-mg group, showed high statistical significance (P < 0.0001). The mean change in serum androstenedione AUC was also greater in the 100-mg than the 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0026).

- **Serum estrone levels**: The mean change in serum estrone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (108 ± 72%) and 100-mg dose groups (116 ± 119%) than in the control group (-5 ± 19%). However, the control vs. 100-mg group comparison did not quite meet statistical significance (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group, P = 0.0631 controls vs. 100-mg group).

- **Serum estradiol levels**: The mean change in serum estradiol AUC remained stable after supplementation in all groups.

### A 52-week study of dose adjusted subcutaneous testosterone enanthate in oil self-administered via disposable auto-injector [^115L1TUM]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

In this open-label, single-arm, dose-blinded, 52-week registration phase study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector administered weekly to men with hypogonadism.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 150 patients were initiated on a 75 mg subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector self-administered weekly. Dose adjustments were made at week 7 to 50, 75, or 100 mg testosterone enanthate based on the week 6 total testosterone trough concentration. If required, dose adjustments continued through the extended treatment phase. Pharmacokinetic and clinical laboratory parameters, treatment-emergent adverse events, and injection site reactions were captured.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint was met, as 92.7% of patients achieved an average total testosterone concentration of 300 to 1,100 ng/dl (mean ± SD 553.3 ± 127.29) at week 12. A maximum concentration of less than 1,500 ng/dl was achieved by 91.3% of patients, and no patient had a level greater than 1,800 ng/dl at week 12. The mean total testosterone trough concentration was 487.2 ± 153.33 ng/dl at week 52. More than 95% of patients reported no injection-related pain. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were increased hematocrit, hypertension, and increased prostate-specific antigen, which led to discontinuation in 30 men. There were no study drug-related serious adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: The dose-adjusted subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector demonstrated a steady serum total testosterone pharmacokinetic profile.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^113VpEAL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation results for circulating T confirmed that dose titration decisions based on a single blood sample taken 3–5 hours, or at 4 hours after the morning oral TU dose, was an effective means to guide dose adjustment to achieve and maintain T concentrations in the eugonadal range. As shown in Table 4, regardless of the three measures used to determine the need to adjust the oral TU dose (i.e. Cavg based on serial PK blood sampling, a single blood sample 4 hours after the morning dose, or a single sample taken any time between 3 to 5 hours after oral TU), efficacy was high with 95% of patients achieving a mean T concentration in the eugonadal range and less than 5% of patients with a mean T level below normal.

- **Concordance analysis of dose-titration visits**: These results demonstrated that for the first and second PK visits, total concordance was 88% and 93%, respectively, when a single blood sample for T assay was collected 4 hours after the oral TU dose. When total concordance was analyzed on the basis of a single T concentration at 6 hours after oral TU at the first and second PK visit, total concordance was 98% and 96%, respectively.

### Patient satisfaction with testosterone replacement therapies: The reasons behind the choices [^116EA6b1]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for male hypogonadism is rapidly gaining popularity and acceptance. Options include gels, injections, and implantable subcutaneous pellets.

- **Aims**: The aim of this study was to determine rates of patient satisfaction and reasons for patient preferences in hypogonadal men on TRT.

- **Methods**: An anonymous, prospective survey was distributed to men presenting for TRT at an academic urology clinic. The survey was organized into multiple domains including patient satisfaction and treatment motivation.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patient satisfaction responses obtained via anonymous survey.

- **Results**: The average patient age was 49 ± 0.7 years (n = 382). Injectable testosterone was chosen by 53%, gel-based regimens by 31%, and pellets by 17%. Overall, 70% of patients were satisfied with their TRT and 14% reported dissatisfaction. Satisfaction rates were similar between gels (68%), injections (73%), and implantable pellets (70%). Doctor recommendation was the sole significant reason for patients preferring gel-based TRT (66% vs. 37% injection users vs. 31% pellet users). Injectable TRT was favored because of lower cost (35% vs. 21% gel users vs. 19% pellet users). Pellets were favored for ease of use (64% vs. 44% injection users vs. 43% gel users) and convenience (58% vs. 26% injection users vs. 19% gel users). Pellets had increased rates of satisfaction within the first 12 months. Improvements in concentration and mood occurred at higher percentages in satisfied patients.

- **Conclusions**: Patients are satisfied with TRT. Lower costs are important factors in therapy selection.

### SPL drug information for testosterone cypionate [^113uRoLt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of testosterone cypionate IM:

- **Bacillary peliosis hepatis, liver cancer, cholestatic jaundice**: Use caution in patients on prolonged high doses of testosterone cypionate.

- **Decreased serum total T4**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate may decrease TBG concentrations.

- **Decreased sperm concentration**: Use caution in patients on large doses of testosterone cypionate, as it may suppress spermatogenesis and reduce sperm count. If this occurs, interrupt therapy and resume at a lower dose.

- **Dependence and withdrawal reactions**: Use caution with testosterone cypionate outside approved dosages or indications, as abuse may lead to dependence, addiction, and withdrawal symptoms.

- **Depression, suicidal ideation**: Use caution in patients with depression.

- **Drug abuse**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate is often abused at higher-than-recommended doses and in combination with other anabolic steroids, leading to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects. Counsel patients on these risks. If abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone levels, noting they may appear normal or subnormal in men using synthetic derivatives, and consider abuse in patients with severe cardiovascular or psychiatric symptoms.

- **Dyslipidemia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate is associated with a risk of dyslipidemia. Periodically monitor the lipid profile, particularly at the start of therapy.

- **Erythrocytosis, polycythemia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as testosterone cypionate is associated with these conditions.

### A new oral testosterone undecanoate formulation restores testosterone to normal concentrations in hypogonadal men [^1156Q4kg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The Phase 3 clinical trial detailed herein was approved by a central or site-specific Institutional Review Board before study initiation at each clinical site. It was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all relevant federal regulations, including Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from trial participants before any study-related procedures were conducted (CLAR-15012; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02722278).

- **Study design**: This trial was an open-label, repeat-dose, dose-titration study in hypogonadal men. It assessed the safety and efficacy of oral TU administered for approximately 3–4 months with a minimum of 90–105 days of treatment prior to the final PK visit. The Screening Phase was followed by a Titration Phase, which included two opportunities for dose-titration based on T C avg calculated from a 24-hour serial pharmacokinetics (PK) evaluation, a 35-day Maintenance Phase, and an end-of-study PK visit. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to either oral TU or a 2% topical T solution.

	- The starting dose for oral TU was 237 mg TU (150 mg of unesterified T equivalents), administered twice daily (BID) immediately prior to a breakfast and dinner meal, approximately 12 hours apart. The starting dose for topical T was 60 mg once daily (QD) in the morning. For dose titrations, serial PK samples over 24 hours were obtained around Days 21 and 56 to determine C avg for dose titrations that occurred about 14 days after the PK visits. Based on the T C avg, oral TU doses could be adjusted.

### Intramuscular testosterone undecanoate and norethisterone enanthate in a clinical trial for male contraception [^1148pXRw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Recent trials for hormonal male contraception are based on gestagens or GnRH antagonists combined with oral or injectable testosterone substitution. However, the efficacy of most trials remained disappointing. Norethisterone enanthate (NETE) has been used as a long-acting injectable female contraceptive and has shown sustained suppression of spermatogenesis in male monkeys and prolonged suppression of gonadotropins in men. This study was designed to prove the efficacy of the long-acting testosterone undecanoate ester (TU) alone or in combination with NETE in a phase II clinical trial.

Fourteen healthy men received injections of 1000 mg TU in combination with injections of 200 mg NETE every 6 weeks over a period of 24 weeks, followed by a control period of 28 weeks. Another 14 volunteers received TU alone. During the study, semen variables, reproductive hormones, clinical chemistry and lipid parameters, well-being, and sexual function were monitored. Scrotal content and prostates were checked sonographically. During the entire treatment period, mean testosterone serum concentrations remained within the normal limits.

Marked suppression of gonadotropins in both treatment groups resulted in azoospermia in 7 of 14 and 13 of 14 volunteers, and in oligozoospermia in 7 of 14 and 1 of 14 in the groups given TU only or TU/NETE, respectively. However, the highest azoospermia rate in the TU/NETE group was achieved 8 weeks after the end of the treatment period, and 1 volunteer with very high initial sperm counts (mean, 190 million/mL at baseline) remained oligozoospermic (10.2 million/mL).
