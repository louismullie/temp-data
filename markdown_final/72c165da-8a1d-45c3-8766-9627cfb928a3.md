## Question

Can infliximab be used to treat Graves ophthalmopathy crisis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether infliximab can be used to treat a Graves' ophthalmopathy "crisis". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define a TED/GO crisis and confirm the immediate threats to vision. Then, I should verify the current first-line standard of care and dosing. Next, I will review credible second-line options endorsed by guidelines. After that, I need to examine what evidence exists for infliximab in GO and how guidelines position it. Finally, I should assess safety concerns and synthesize a clinically sound recommendation with an algorithm for steroid-resistant cases.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct of a "GO crisis". In practice, this refers to severe active disease with rapid orbital inflammation progression, high CAS, and imminent visual threat from dysthyroid optic neuropathy or corneal breakdown requiring urgent intervention; I need to ensure that the presence of DON is actively sought because it changes the urgency and modality of treatment, including consideration of urgent decompression alongside medical therapy [^113SjuSF] [^111C4S35].

> Next, I should review the first-line standard of care. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; oral steroids were historically used, but I need to verify whether IV glucocorticoids are superior. The ATA/ETA consensus and related documents consistently endorse intravenous methylprednisolone as preferred over oral glucocorticoids for active moderate-to-severe TED, using a cumulative dose of 4.5 g over approximately 12 weeks, given as 0.5 g weekly for 6 weeks followed by 0.25 g weekly for 6 more weeks, with caution to avoid cumulative doses greater than 8.0 g because of toxicity risk [^114y3mE8] [^116sy9Yn] [^111xeDRj].

> Wait, let me verify dosing flexibility in severe inflammatory presentations. Some expert statements allow higher cumulative dosing up to about 7.5 g in selected severe cases, but I need to ensure this is individualized and safety-checked; if there is sight-threatening disease such as DON, urgent escalation including IV steroids, consideration of orbital radiotherapy in specific contexts, and low threshold for urgent surgical decompression should be part of the plan under subspecialty care [^111xeDRj] [^111C4S35].

> Now I will examine evidence-based options when IV glucocorticoids are inadequate or not tolerated. I should confirm that guideline-endorsed biologics and adjuncts include rituximab and tocilizumab in steroid-refractory disease, with mycophenolate as a well-supported adjunct and teprotumumab for proptosis reduction; I also need to remember that rituximab RCTs have shown mixed results, which is why it is considered in selected refractory cases and not as a blanket replacement for IV steroids [^115dvwDT] [^114y3mE8] [^113SjuSF] [^117HEqQT] [^116EKCa5] [^115vHEM6] [^111C4S35].

> I will now examine infliximab specifically. Let me first confirm regulatory status: infliximab labels list indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, but GO is not an approved indication, which already raises a red flag for routine use in a GO crisis [^112gF2X3] [^111RVdFy] [^111HC6Et] [^115RPWTX]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical literature; preliminary, nonrandomized or anecdotal reports have described TNF-α blockade in ocular inflammation, with a few uncontrolled cases touching GO or thyroid-associated orbital disease, but these are low-credibility data and insufficient to guide crisis management; moreover, reviews emphasize that the currently available evidence is preliminary and provides rationale for trials rather than practice change [^116uJRcX] [^117MYJtb] [^112M91Ei].

> But wait, what if guidelines at least mention TNF inhibitors as options? Hmm, wait a minute, I need to check carefully; while consensus documents catalogue many agents that have been tried, they do not endorse infliximab as a recommended therapy for steroid-refractory TED, and when TNF-α inhibitors are discussed, their roles are described as questionable or with modest effects, not as preferred or acceptable standards, reinforcing that infliximab is not part of the evidence-based algorithm for GO crisis [^114y3mE8] [^116sy9Yn] [^112M91Ei].

> I should double-check the quality of evidence and society positions. No randomized controlled trials supporting infliximab for GO are identified in the provided materials, and high-credibility guidelines from ATA/ETA and EUGOGO do not list infliximab among recommended second-line therapies; instead, they point clinicians to rituximab or tocilizumab and to other targeted options with stronger clinical evidence, further arguing against infliximab in this setting [^114y3mE8] [^116sy9Yn] [^115dvwDT].

> Next, I should review safety, since crisis management often involves concurrent high-dose steroids and comorbidities, which could magnify risks. Infliximab carries boxed and serious warnings for severe infections including TB and HBV reactivation, malignancy signals, serious infusion and delayed hypersensitivity reactions including serum sickness-like syndromes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and drug-induced lupus; in a fragile orbit with edema and congestion, acute hypersensitivity with facial edema or dyspnea could be particularly problematic, and layering TNF blockade on top of IV steroids may compound infection risk in an acutely inflamed orbit without proven benefit in GO [^112gF2X3] [^1128AyHi] [^1176b1YP] [^115d7pkP] [^111KRSf8].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is both evidence-based and safe. In a Graves' ophthalmopathy crisis, infliximab is not recommended; the standard is prompt IV methylprednisolone as outlined, rapid evaluation for DON, and, if steroid-resistant or intolerant, transition to guideline-supported alternatives such as rituximab or tocilizumab, with mycophenolate as an evidence-based adjunct and teprotumumab when the therapeutic goal includes proptosis reduction; urgent decompression and targeted radiotherapy can be considered in sight-threatening scenarios under specialty care, whereas infliximab should be viewed as experimental and, if contemplated at all, restricted to a clinical trial setting rather than routine practice [^114y3mE8] [^115dvwDT] [^117HEqQT] [^111C4S35].

---

Infliximab is **not recommended** for Graves ophthalmopathy crisis due to **limited evidence** and **significant risks**. Current guidelines **do not support its use**; consider it only in rare, refractory cases when standard therapies fail and other biologics are unavailable [^115dvwDT] [^112M91Ei]. Infliximab has not shown consistent benefit in GO [^116EKCa5] and carries risks of serious infections, infusion reactions, and malignancy [^112gF2X3] [^111KRSf8]. First-line treatment remains **high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids** [^114y3mE8], with rituximab [^115vHEM6], tocilizumab [^116TmjRz], or teprotumumab as preferred second-line options [^113SjuSF] [^115dvwDT].

---

## Pathophysiological rationale for infliximab use in GO

GO is driven by autoimmune inflammation with **TNF-α as a key cytokine** [^117KFbeu]; TNF-α promotes orbital fibroblast activation, glycosaminoglycan production, and tissue edema, contributing to proptosis, diplopia, and optic neuropathy [^113SjuSF]. Infliximab, a chimeric anti–TNF-α antibody, is hypothesized to reduce orbital inflammation and tissue remodeling by neutralizing TNF-α [^116uJRcX].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting infliximab use in GO

Evidence for infliximab in GO is limited to small case series and anecdotal reports, with no robust RCTs [^112M91Ei] [^116EKCa5]. A small retrospective series (n = 5) [^117MYJtb] reported symptom relief in orbital inflammation, including thyroid-associated orbital inflammation; however, effects were transient, with symptoms recurring around week 5 post-infusion. Another report [^114ZVwdR] described initial improvement in autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis with infliximab, but relapse occurred, necessitating rituximab for sustained remission. Overall, **evidence is insufficient** to support routine use in GO [^116uJRcX].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

High-dose intravenous glucocorticoids (IVGCs) are **first-line** for moderate-to-severe active GO, with established efficacy in reducing inflammation and preventing vision loss [^114y3mE8] [^116EKCa5]. Rituximab, tocilizumab, and teprotumumab are preferred second-line options with demonstrated efficacy in steroid-resistant GO [^114Xzver] [^113SjuSF]. Current guidelines do not recommend infliximab due to limited evidence and safety concerns [^112M91Ei].

---

## Safety profile and potential risks

Infliximab **carries significant risks**, including:

- **Serious infections**: Reactivation of latent tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and opportunistic infections [^112gF2X3].
- **Infusion reactions**: Anaphylaxis, serum sickness–like reactions, and delayed hypersensitivity [^1128AyHi] [^1176b1YP].
- **Malignancy**: Increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly with prolonged use.
- **Autoimmune reactions**: Drug-induced lupus and other autoimmune phenomena [^112gF2X3] [^115d7pkP].

These risks are **substantial**, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with comorbidities.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA), European Thyroid Association (ETA), and European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) do **not recommend infliximab** for GO. Rituximab, tocilizumab, and teprotumumab are preferred second-line options for steroid-resistant GO. It is generally omitted from recommended regimens because of limited evidence and safety concerns [^112M91Ei].

---

## Patient selection criteria and clinical scenarios

Given the limited evidence and significant risks, infliximab should **only be considered in rare, refractory cases** in which standard therapies (IVGCs, rituximab, tocilizumab, teprotumumab) have failed or are contraindicated. Careful patient selection and close monitoring are essential [^114Xzver].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up protocols

If infliximab is used, **strict monitoring is required**, including:

- **Baseline screening**: Tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and other infections [^112gF2X3].
- **Regular monitoring**: Clinical activity score (CAS), visual acuity, proptosis measurements, and adverse events [^114Xzver].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Liver function tests, complete blood count, and inflammatory markers.
- **Imaging**: Orbital MRI or CT to assess disease progression and response [^114Xzver].

---

## Long-term outcomes and relapse rates

Long-term outcomes and relapse rates with infliximab in GO are **unknown** due to limited data [^116uJRcX]. Available reports suggest transient benefits with frequent relapses, indicating limited sustained efficacy [^117MYJtb].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Infliximab is expensive and requires intravenous administration, which increases healthcare costs. Given limited evidence of efficacy and significant safety concerns, its cost-effectiveness in GO is **questionable** compared to established therapies [^113SjuSF].

---

Infliximab is **not recommended** for Graves ophthalmopathy crisis due to limited evidence and significant risks. Consider it only in rare, refractory cases when standard therapies fail and other biologics are unavailable [^112M91Ei].

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^114Xzver]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune condition closely related to Graves' disease. It is characterized by endomysial interstitial edema, expansion, and proliferation of cells within the fibrofatty compartment, resulting in the clinical manifestations of periorbital edema, lid retraction, proptosis, diplopia, corneal breakdown, and, in rare cases, optic nerve compression. TED remains challenging for clinicians to evaluate and manage. Novel therapies have recently emerged, and their specific roles are still being determined.

Most patients with TED develop eye disease while being treated for hyperthyroidism under the care of endocrinologists. Endocrinologists, therefore, have a key role in diagnosis, initial management, and selection of patients who require referral to specialist care. Given that the need for guidance to endocrinologists charged with meeting the needs of patients with TED transcends national borders, and to maximize an international exchange of knowledge and practices, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) joined forces to produce this consensus statement (CS).

The scope was to address clinical assessment, to develop criteria for referral to specialty care and treatment, and to focus on medical and surgical treatment in nonpregnant adults (age ≥ 18 years) with TED. This CS is primarily aimed at endocrinologists and, in particular, those involved in the management of nonpregnant adult (> 18 years) patients with TED. A CS was selected as the forum, rather than a clinical practice guideline, to provide comprehensive insight and recommendations.

- **Cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular reactions have been observed during and within 24 hours of initiation of infliximab infusions.

- **Drug-induced lupus**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for developing autoimmune disease.

- **Exacerbation of COPD**: Use caution in patients with COPD and a history of tobacco smoking.

- **Infections, immunosuppression**: Use caution in patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids or methotrexate.

- **Malignancy**: Use caution in all patients, especially children, adolescents, and young adults receiving concomitant immunosuppressants and risk factors for new malignancies.

- **Pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia**: Use caution in patients who have ongoing or a history of significant hematological disease.

- **Reactivation of HBV infection**: Use extreme caution in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus.

- **Reactivation of tuberculosis**: Use caution in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis.

- **Seizures, vasculitis, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome**: Use caution in patients with these conditions.

### Renflexis [^111KRSf8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blocking agents, including infliximab products, more malignancies (excluding lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) have been observed in patients receiving TNF-blockers compared with control patients. During the controlled portions of infliximab trials in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis, 14 patients were diagnosed with malignancies (excluding lymphoma and NMSC) among 4,019 infliximab-treated patients versus 1 among 1,597 control patients. This corresponds to a rate of 0.52 per 100 patient-years among infliximab-treated patients versus a rate of 0.11 per 100 patient-years among control patients, with a median duration of follow-up of 0.5 years for infliximab-treated patients and 0.4 years for control patients. Of these, the most common malignancies were breast, colorectal, and melanoma. The rate of malignancies among infliximab-treated patients was similar to that expected in the general population, whereas the rate in control patients was lower than expected.

In a clinical trial exploring the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, the majority of lung or head and neck origin, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Prescribers should exercise caution when considering the use of Renflexis in patients with a history of heavy smoking.

### The 2021 European Group on Graves' orbitopathy (EUGOGO) clinical practice guidelines for the medical management of Graves' orbitopathy [^115dvwDT]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

The EUGOGO 2021 guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of thyroid eye disease, particularly focusing on the management of moderate-to-severe orbitopathy. For second-line therapy, it is recommended to consider administering rituximab in patients with moderate-to-severe and active Graves' orbitopathy of recent onset (less than 12 months) when the condition is refractory to intravenous corticosteroids. It is essential to ensure that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is excluded before proceeding with this treatment. Rituximab should only be administered in experienced centers that are equipped to manage potentially serious adverse events.

### Renflexis [^1176b1YP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Infliximab products have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions that vary in their time of onset and have required hospitalization in some cases. Most hypersensitivity reactions, which include anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, and/or hypotension, have occurred during or within two hours of infusion.

However, in some cases, serum sickness-like reactions have been observed in patients after initial therapy with infliximab products, as early as after the second dose, and when therapy with infliximab products was reinstituted following an extended period without treatment. Symptoms associated with these reactions include fever, rash, headache, sore throat, myalgias, polyarthralgias, hand and facial edema, and/or dysphagia. These reactions were associated with a marked increase in antibodies to infliximab products, loss of detectable serum concentrations of infliximab products, and possible loss of drug efficacy.

RENFLEXIS should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. acetaminophen, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and/or epinephrine) should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis clinical trials, re-administration of infliximab following a period of no treatment resulted in a higher incidence of infusion reactions relative to regular maintenance treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Management of Graves thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease: An update [^117HEqQT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Recent in vitro and in vivo research aims to introduce and establish new treatments for the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism and its associated extrathyroidal manifestations. Both the TSH-R and the IGF-1R are the primary targets for these novel, but still exploratory, approaches. Other targets include molecules relevant to the pathogenesis of GD/GO that play an important role within the immunological synapse and are expressed on the surface of B cells (e.g. CD40 and CD20) or important proinflammatory cytokine receptors, such as IL-6R or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α.

In line with this, two TNFα blockers, etanercept and adalimumab, were tested with modest benefit. In contrast, far better results were observed with mycophenolate, an immunosuppressive drug with dual antiproliferative effects on T and B cells as well as on orbital target cells. Two randomized controlled trials encompassing more than 300 patients with active and severe GO demonstrated the safety and good tolerability of mycophenolate, as well as beneficial effects on eye symptoms and signs, clinical disease severity (proptosis, motility disturbances, and/or diplopia), and clinical activity (orbital inflammation). This clinical benefit was convincingly accompanied by a markedly improved disease-specific quality of life. Overall, the risk–benefit ratio of mycophenolate treatment in GO was highly favorable. Hence, mycophenolate is recommended as an efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated add-on drug to IVGCs in active/severe GO.

### Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy after treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs or iodine-131 [^117PNHWm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Previous randomized trials have suggested an association between radioiodine treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). The aim of the study was to compare the occurrence of worsening or development of TAO in patients who were treated with radioiodine or antithyroid drugs.

We conducted a randomized trial (TT 96) with a follow-up of four years. Patients with a recent diagnosis of Graves' hyperthyroidism were randomized to treatment with iodine-131 (163 patients) or 18 months of medical treatment (150 patients). Early substitution with T(4) was given in both groups.

- **Main outcome measure**: Worsening or development of TAO was significantly more common in the iodine-131 treatment group (63 patients; 38.7%) compared with the medical treatment group (32 patients; 21.3%) (P < 0.001).

The risk for de novo development of TAO was greater in patients treated with iodine-131 (53 patients) than with medical treatment (23 patients). However, worsening of TAO in the 41 patients who had ophthalmopathy already before the start of treatment was not more common in the radioiodine group (10 patients) than in the medical group (nine patients). Smoking was shown to influence the risk of worsening or development of TAO, and smokers treated with radioiodine had the overall highest risk for TAO. However, in the group of smokers, worsening or development of TAO was not significantly associated with the choice of treatment for hyperthyroidism.

Radioiodine treatment is a significant factor in the development of TAO.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^116sy9Yn]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

- **Summary of key points**: This document outlines substantial components of management strategies for thyroid eye disease (TED).

- **Introduction**: The consensus statement presents methodologies and findings on TED, highlighting its epidemiology, natural history, and pathogenesis. It addresses risks for TED development and discusses opportunities for prevention. Early diagnosis and referral for specialized care in TED are crucial, delineating roles for endocrinologists and ophthalmologists in patient care coordination.

- **Patient assessment**: The document elaborates on assessing disease activity and severity, evaluating the quality of life, the necessity of formal ophthalmology evaluations, and imaging techniques.

- **Overall approach to therapy**: Various therapeutic strategies include local and lifestyle measures as well as systemic medical and surgical treatments for TED. The statement discusses settings for TED care and criteria for ophthalmology referral.

- **Therapy for mild TED**: It covers options for medical therapy and surgical interventions addressing minimal changes in proptosis and lid retraction.

- **Management of moderate-to-severe TED**: The focus is on medical therapies such as glucocorticoids and alternatives for patients unresponsive or intolerant to intravenous glucocorticoids. Treatments include teprotumumab, rituximab, mycophenolate, tocilizumab, and other agents, distinguishing between those clinically available and those under investigation for potential benefits in TED.

### Management aspects of medical therapy in Graves disease [^1125GEYS]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is a rare but well-known side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, often associated with positive TPO antibodies. The clinical course typically involves a brief period of hyperthyroidism transitioning to hypothyroidism, which requires thyroid hormone replacement. ICI has been reported, to a lesser extent, to cause Graves disease (GD). Some of these reports are limited due to unknown TRAb status prior to receiving ICI. Offending agents include programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors such as ipilimumab and tremelimumab.

Cases of ipilimumab-associated GD have been reported, where thyroid eye disease (TED) was the presenting manifestation but with normal thyroid function tests, and instances of ipilimumab-induced thyroid storm in patients with negative TSI and TRAb were noted. In most cases of ICI-induced GD, methimazole (MMI) proved to be an effective treatment. Assessing for TRAb/TSI along with TPO antibodies can be useful in ICI-induced hyperthyroidism when GD is suspected.

Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody used effectively for multiple sclerosis, has been linked to the development of GD; however, the mechanism remains unclear. GD has also been documented in several cases of HIV patients undergoing high activity antiretroviral therapy.

- **Future directions**: Several new therapies for GD are under investigation. These new drugs are categorized into four groups based on their mechanism of action: B lymphocyte immunomodulators (rituximab, iscalimab, and belimumab), TSH receptor antagonists, and others.

### Clinical and imaging evaluation of the response to intravenous steroids in patients with Graves' orbitopathy and analysis on who requires additional therapy [^117Y2KoQ]. Clinical ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Administration of additional oral steroids and comparison between the two groups:

Oral steroids were administered to patients who continued to present active GO at the end of IV treatment (at the 12th week). At that point, as expected, CAS was significantly higher in Group 1 (P = 0.002). At the 24th week, CAS did not present a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.157). For both groups, a statistically significant reduction in CAS was observed at the 12th and 24th weeks (P < 0.001).

Mean TES did not present a statistically significant difference between the two groups either at the 12th week or at the 24th week (P = 0.685 and P = 0.856, respectively). For Group 1, a statistically significant improvement in TES was not observed at the 12th week (P = 0.185), but it was observed at the 24th week (P = 0.001). For Group 2, a statistically significant decrease in TES was observed at the 12th and 24th weeks (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).

Table S4 and Figures 3C and D show the comparison of the components of QoL between the two groups. For Group 1, a statistically significant increase in visual function-QoL was not observed at the 12th week (P = 0.429), but it was observed at the 24th week (P < 0.001). For Group 2, a statistically significant improvement in visual function-QoL was observed at the 12th and 24th weeks (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). In terms of psychosocial life-QoL, both groups showed significant improvement at the 24th week (Group 1: P < 0.001; Group 2: P < 0.001).

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^111xeDRj]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

An overview of the management of thyroid eye disease (TED) requires an individualized approach. This approach should be based on factors such as disease activity, severity, duration, trends over time, impact on daily living, treatment goals, patient age, comorbidities, and the availability and costs of therapies. Therapeutic approaches are categorized by the task force members as either "preferred", "acceptable", or "may be considered" (refer to Section 2.1 for definitions). Except for the mildest cases, local measures are often effective, as indicated in Table 8.

In most patients with mild TED, a "watchful monitoring" strategy, incorporating simple measures (see Section 5.1 and Fig. 1), is typically sufficient. However, selected cases with a significant decrease in quality of life (QOL) may require treatment akin to moderate-to-severe TED.

- **Symptomatic inflammatory soft tissue involvement**: In cases involving symptomatic inflammatory soft tissue involvement or when radioactive iodine is used, oral glucocorticoids are recommended for prophylaxis. This is particularly critical in selenium-insufficient regions.

- **Standard treatment**: Intravenous glucocorticoids (IVGC) with a cumulative dose of 4.5 g is the standard treatment. In certain selected patients, a higher cumulative dose of methylprednisolone (7.5 g) may be considered, especially for those with prominent soft tissue involvement and diplopia, or in patients experiencing a short duration of TED (< 9 months), or those intolerant or resistant to IVGC.

In selected patients with moderate-to-severe TED, a "watchful monitoring" strategy may be acceptable. For coexistent active disease, medical treatment consistent with moderate-to-severe disease is recommended in parallel with surgical intervention (see Section 7.3.2, and Supplementary Figure S2a, b).

### Efficacy of anti-thyroid medications in patients with Graves' disease [^114wzLsH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

A total of 103 out of 189 patients (54.5%) achieved remission from Graves' disease. The free T4 level at the time of diagnosis was significantly lower in patients who achieved remission compared to those who did not, with a mean difference of 3.0 pmol/L (P = 0.038). Similarly, the TRAb level at diagnosis was significantly lower in patients who achieved remission than in those who did not, with a median difference of 5.4 IU/L (P = 0.001).

A significant proportion of female patients (61.7%) achieved remission, while only 35% of male patients did. The only two patients with severe ophthalmopathy and 67% of the patients with moderate ophthalmopathy did not achieve remission. Of the patients who did not achieve remission, 22 underwent thyroidectomy, 17 received RAI, and 47 continued on anti-thyroid drugs (ATD).

### Graves orbitopathy: A perspective [^111kTg5H]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Advances in the past few years have helped clinicians understand some of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Graves orbitopathy (GO), particularly the role of receptors for TSH and insulin-like growth factor I in the orbit. Optimal treatment strategies have been formulated and published by the European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy, which are hoped to improve the management of patients with this condition.

The administration of intravenous pulses of steroids has been established as a superior treatment approach compared with other steroid regimens. In addition, orbital radiotherapy was effective in a subgroup of patients with GO who had eye dysmotility. The use of immunotherapies for the treatment of GO is currently being explored; of these, rituximab has emerged as a promising new agent.

### Autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis in association with autoimmune eye disease and sequential treatment with infliximab and rituximab [^114ZVwdR]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis predominantly associates with other autoimmune endocrinopathies and is most commonly treated with glucocorticoids and/or decompressive pituitary surgery. Here, we report a new association and treatment modality for lymphocytic hypophysitis.

- **Methods**: A 52-year-old woman presented with scleritis, uveitis, facial palsy, and central diabetes insipidus, accompanied by a thickened pituitary stalk and enlarged pituitary on cranial MRI. Neurosarcoidosis was suspected, and treatment with glucocorticoids and methotrexate was initiated. Since symptoms persisted, infliximab (a monoclonal antibody that antagonizes tumor necrosis factor alpha) was added to her regimen. The patient initially improved, but after 6 months developed pituitary enlargement, bilateral optic neuritis, and panhypopituitarism. To ascertain the nature of the pituitary lesion, she underwent transsphenoidal biopsy, which revealed lymphocytic hypophysitis with numerous CD20-positive B lymphocytes. The pathological finding suggested to us that administration of rituximab (a monoclonal antibody that lyses B cells expressing CD20) could be useful. Following two courses of rituximab, the pituitary mass resolved, and the corticotroph axis partially recovered. The patient has remained in remission during 3 years of follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This is the first report of hypophysitis occurring with the triad of scleritis, uveitis, and optic neuritis, as well as the first immunotherapy based on the sequential use of infliximab and rituximab.

### Ten year outcome of anti-thyroid drug treatment for first episode Graves' thyrotoxicosis: The predictive importance of TRAb [^113a4MHc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

In contrast to other reports, we did not find thyroid hormone levels at presentation to be significantly associated with recurrence risk. Relatively straightforward (and easily measured) metrics such as time to normalization of TSH and fT4 were associated with recurrence risk but not independently of TRAb. We did not have reliable access to metrics which have previously been associated with recurrence risk such as goiter size, ophthalmopathy, and smoking status. Incorporating multiple features into a risk score improves prognostic performance but arguably not decisively enough to influence management beyond consideration of TRAb alone. More sophisticated scoring systems that incorporate HLA subtypes appear to have superior prognostic performance, but these have not, at the time of writing, been incorporated into routine clinical practice.

This study specifically reports outcomes in people who have completed a course of ATD, and, to broaden generalizability, it would be of value to assess long-term outcomes in a cohort including all individuals commencing ATD, not just those deemed suitable for discontinuation at 12–18 months. This was an evaluation of a single center's outcomes, which raises questions of generalizability, but outcomes are, in general, broadly consistent with the literature.

The key strength of this study is the robust assessment of thyroid outcomes over a long period of follow-up. The information presented is likely to be relevant to healthcare professionals and patients when considering treatment options, including the predicted time course of recurrence and chances of avoiding recurrence altogether.

### Tumor necrosis factor antagonists: Preliminary evidence for an emerging approach in the treatment of ocular inflammation [^116uJRcX]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

The anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody infliximab and the soluble TNF receptor etanercept inhibit the pleiotropic actions of TNF and are widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), spondyloarthropathies (SpA), Crohn's disease, and psoriasis with an acceptable safety profile. A pathogenetic role of TNF in ocular inflammatory conditions has recently emerged from small trials reporting preliminary results on the efficacy of these agents in patients with noninfectious uveitis, regardless of the origin of the disease. The authors review the published experience, derived mostly from investigator-sponsored trials and uncontrolled case series, on the use of TNF antagonists in approximately 280 patients with various ocular conditions who were inadequately controlled on currently available therapy. These reports suggest that TNF antagonists, mainly infliximab, which may have better efficacy than etanercept, are useful in the treatment of ocular inflammation associated with Adamantiades-Behçet's disease, RA, JIA, SpA, Crohn's, sarcoidosis, and Graves' disease ophthalmopathy. Infliximab was also beneficial in small numbers of patients with idiopathic uveitis or scleritis, birdshot retinochoroiditis, uveitic and diabetic cystoid macular edema, and age-related macular degeneration. The currently available data are nonrandomized and thus preliminary, providing the foundation and justification for randomized trials to assess efficacy and safety. Until such results are available, knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNF rheumatology agents in ocular inflammation remains limited.

### Insights into current management strategies for dysthyroid optic neuropathy: A review [^111C4S35]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, strong evidence has implicated the IGF-IR in the pathogenesis of GO. The safety and efficacy of teprotumumab were evaluated sequentially in two RCTs, including 170 patients with active GO. Both trials had similar designs, and patients were randomly assigned, with 83 patients receiving teprotumumab every 3 weeks IV for eight doses over 24 weeks and 87 patients receiving placebo. Seventy-three percent in the teprotumumab group (vs 14% in the placebo group) were overall responders, with both CAS and proptosis improvement. Individually, the proptosis response was much more common in the teprotumumab group.

Recently, systematic analyses and off-treatment follow-up results from the two RCTs were published. Although the clinical use of teprotumumab for DON has not been sufficiently evaluated, it is considered to have become a very important future treatment option.

- **Janus kinase inhibitors**: JAK inhibitors are molecular agents that inhibit the JAK receptors. JAK-mediated pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Graves' disease, and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and infectious disease with cytokine storm, including COVID-19. There are some members of the tyrosine kinase family of protein kinases. Tofacitinib and baricitinib are first-generation JAK inhibitors. Tofacitinib inhibits JAK 1 and JAK 3, and baricitinib inhibits JAK 1 and JAK 2. In combination with teprotumumab, it may suppress much of the inflammatory cascade in GO.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: A review [^117PgLGC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of the ophthalmopathy that occurs in approximately 40% of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism and, less often, in a less severe form, in 25% of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis remains controversial. While most authors favor the hypothesis that autoimmunity against the TSH receptor (TSHr), expressed in the orbital fibroblasts, preadipocytes, and fibrocytes, is the dominant autoimmune reaction that leads to orbital inflammation, not all evidence supports this. Namely, Graves' disease and worsening ophthalmopathy may be associated with decreasing levels of TSHr antibodies in individual patients, and ophthalmopathy may develop many years after the onset of hyperthyroidism. Most importantly, patients with so-called euthyroid Graves' disease have similar ophthalmopathy but no evidence for thyroid autoimmunity, including negative TSHr antibodies as measured in the TRAb assay and as thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in a Thyreporter bio-assay, suggesting that other possibilities should be considered. Moreover, in a recent case report, it was shown that eye signs and other soft tissue manifestations of Graves' disease worsened in the context of psychological stress, with reduced levels of TSHr antibody following stress.

Regardless of the nature of the inflammatory process in the orbital connective tissue, fat, and extraocular muscles (EOM), the eye disorder is presumed to begin in the thyroid since the great majority of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) have active thyroid inflammation.

### What to do for moderate-to-severe and active Graves' orbitopathy if glucocorticoids fail [^113TgKRQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is a major challenge, and the outcome of medical therapy is unsatisfactory in about one-third of cases. Glucocorticoids are the first-line therapy for moderate-to-severe and active GO, more commonly given through the intravenous route. Uncertainty remains as to the best therapeutic approach when the initial glucocorticoid treatment provides an incomplete response or no response. The choice largely depends on personal experience due to the limited evidence in this field.

If a first course of glucocorticoids provides a suboptimal response, a second course of intravenous (or oral) glucocorticoids associated with orbital radiotherapy should be considered. Alternatively, oral glucocorticoids combined with cyclosporine may be used. The use of biological agents, with rituximab being the most promising, is currently experimental and requires support from randomized clinical trials.

### Tocilizumab for thyroid eye disease [^116TmjRz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune disorder that constitutes a major clinical and therapeutic challenge. Treatment options for moderate-to-severe TED include immunotherapy, orbital radiotherapy, and decompression surgery. Limited drugs of proven efficacy are available for the treatment of people with TED. Given the role in the pathogenesis of TED of interleukin (IL)-6 expression in adipocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages, the proposed theory is that inhibition of IL-6 by tocilizumab may be an effective treatment in TED by directly reducing the inflammatory response. Additionally, there is an unmet need for a new treatment that can modify the natural course of the disease and reduce the incidence of late complications that can occur as a result of fibrosis following inflammation.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the efficacy and harms of tocilizumab for the treatment of people with TED.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2018, Issue 6); MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; LILACS BIREME; OpenGrey; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP); and the EU Clinical Trials Register. The date of the search was 31 July 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We searched for trials of tocilizumab administered by intravenous infusion using any dosage regimen, compared with placebo or intravenous glucocorticoid therapy for people with TED.

### Autoimmunity and Graves' disease [^115esrNF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment options for Graves' hyperthyroidism and the related ophthalmopathy (GO) are not uniformly effective and carry with them potentially serious side effects. As a result, efforts have been focused on the development of novel therapies. Progress has been made, particularly in the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antagonists, as either monoclonal blocking antibodies or small-molecule ligands. In addition, rituximab (RTX) is the first targeted biological therapy to be studied as treatment for these conditions.

### Relationship between longitudinal behaviour of some markers of eye autoimmunity and changes in ocular findings in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy receiving corticosteroid therapy [^113D7J8c]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether variations over time of TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) and antibodies against G2s (G2sAb) and extraocular muscles (EMAb) can predict worsening of ophthalmopathy in Graves' patients treated with intravenous glucocorticoid (IVGC) therapy.

- **Patients**: Of 65 consecutive patients with treated Graves' disease and severe and active ophthalmopathy (GO) chosen to undergo IVGC treatment, only 57 patients, persistently euthyroid under methimazole therapy, were studied longitudinally for ocular parameters, TRAb, G2sAb, and EMAb at three time points: before therapy, at the end of therapy, and every month for a total of 21 months.

- **Measurements**: TRAb was detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA), G2sAb by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and EMAb by indirect immunofluorescence.

- **Results**: Forty-three out of 57 patients (75.4%, group 1) responded positively to therapy, showing improvement in diplopia and a decrease in proptosis and clinical activity score (CAS), but 14 patients (24.6%) did not respond positively (group 2). During follow-up after IVGC therapy, 12 out of 43 patients in group 1 (28%) showed worsening in GO (group 1a), while 31 (72%) had stable ocular conditions or further improvement (group 1b). At the start of the study, TRAb, G2sAb, and EMAb levels were not significantly different among the three groups. By the end of IVGC therapy, TRAb levels decreased significantly relative to the starting values in all three groups of patients, whereas G2sAb and EMAb levels decreased significantly in groups 1a and 1b but not in group 2. During the subsequent follow-up, 10 patients in group 1a exhibited changes one or two months before a noted worsening, and these trends were consistent across all individuals in group 1a.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: A review [^112emHcR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

**Conclusion**: The orbital reactions in patients with Graves' disease are complex, involving antibodies and T lymphocytes, as well as other mononuclear cells, homing receptors on orbital cells, and cytokines. Moreover, it is crucial to determine why only approximately 50% of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism develop ophthalmopathy. Environmental and genetic factors play a role; an example being the presence of a recently identified informative single nucleotide polymorphism in the CASQ1 gene, which is linked to ophthalmopathy. Smoking is well recognized as a major risk factor for ophthalmopathy, and stress is likely to contribute to its initiation. In conclusion, it seems appropriate to give serious attention to the possibility that the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy is not solely about the TSH receptor but also involves contributions from thyroglobulin and other thyroid antigens.

### Inflectra [^111HC6Et]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study RA I, all doses and schedules of infliximab + MTX resulted in an improvement in signs and symptoms, as measured by the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20), with a higher percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50, and 70 compared to placebo + MTX. This improvement was observed at Week 2 and maintained through Week 102. Greater effects on each component of the ACR 20 were observed in all patients treated with infliximab + MTX compared to placebo + MTX. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

In Study RA II, after 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of infliximab + MTX resulted in a statistically significantly greater response in signs and symptoms compared to MTX alone, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

### Monokine induced by interferon gamma (IFNgamma) (CXCL9) and IFNgamma inducible T-cell alpha-chemoattractant (CXCL11) involvement in Graves' disease and ophthalmopathy: Modulation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists [^117KFbeu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

CXC alpha-chemokine CXCL10/IP-10 plays an important role in the initial phases of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). Human thyrocytes, orbital fibroblasts, and preadipocytes are stimulated to produce CXCL10 when treated with interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and TNFalpha. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) activation plays an inhibitory role in this process.

- **Objective**: Until now, no data are present in literature about the involvement of CXCL9 and CXCL11 in Graves' disease and GO, or of PPARgamma activators' effect on these chemokines.

- **Methods**: It has been studied how IFNgamma and TNFalpha stimulation and PPARgamma activation affect CXCL9 and CXCL11 secretion in primary cultures of thyrocytes, orbital fibroblasts, and preadipocytes.

- **Results**: In primary cultures of thyrocytes, retrobulbar fibroblasts, and retrobulbar preadipocytes obtained from GO patients, CXCL9 and CXCL11 production was absent under basal conditions; CXCL9 and CXCL11 secretion was not induced by TNFalpha alone, whereas it was dose-dependently stimulated by treating cells with IFNgamma. The treatment with TNFalpha plus IFNgamma has a synergistic effect on CXCL9 and CXCL11 release. Treating all cell types with the PPARgamma agonist, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone, the IFNgamma plus TNFalpha-induced CXCL9 and CXCL11 release was dose-dependently (0.1–20 microm) suppressed.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that thyrocytes and retrobulbar cell types from patients with Graves' disease and ophthalmopathy participate in the self-perpetuation of inflammation, releasing CXCL9 and CXCL11 chemokines when stimulated appropriately.

### New insights into the pathogenesis and nonsurgical management of Graves orbitopathy [^113SjuSF]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Graves orbitopathy, also known as thyroid eye disease or thyroid-associated orbitopathy, is visually disabling and cosmetically disfiguring, significantly impacting a patient's quality of life. There is increasing awareness of the need for early diagnosis and rapid specialist input from endocrinologists and ophthalmologists. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment; however, recurrence occurs frequently upon withdrawal. Furthermore, in more than 60% of cases, normal orbital anatomy is not restored, necessitating skilled rehabilitative surgery.

Clinical trials have demonstrated considerable benefits from incorporating antiproliferative agents, such as mycophenolate or azathioprine, to prevent deterioration following steroid cessation. Additionally, targeted biologic therapies have shown promise: teprotumumab reduces proptosis; rituximab (anti-CD20) reduces inflammation; and tocilizumab may benefit both parameters. However, the widespread role of orbital radiotherapy in combination therapy has been questioned.

The pathophysiology of Graves orbitopathy has been revised with the identification of new potential therapeutic targets. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the field, outlines optimal management strategies for Graves orbitopathy, and summarizes research developments to highlight future research questions and guide clinical trials.

Measurement of TRAb is useful both as a diagnostic and prognostic tool and can help inform shared decision-making regarding the optimal therapy choice in Graves' thyrotoxicosis. High TRAbs suggest a greater likelihood of recurrence; however, an individual may value the opportunity to avoid long-term medication despite this. These data suggest that the chance of recurrence is approximately 50% in those who complete a course of ATD.

### Rituximab for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy [^115Zyy3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease, affecting up to 50% of patients, and significantly impacts quality of life. Rituximab is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B lymphocytes, but not on stem cells, pro-B lymphocytes, or plasma cells. Preliminary work has demonstrated that blocking the CD20 receptor on B-lymphocytes with rituximab influences the clinical course of TAO by reducing inflammation and the degree of proptosis.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of rituximab for the treatment of TAO.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1950 to April 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to April 2013), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com).

### Management of Graves thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease: An update [^112xCtQr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The CD40 molecule is abundantly expressed by thyrocytes and orbital target cells, and the CD40–CD154 interaction modulates humoral immunity within the immunological synapse. Iscalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a potent inhibitor of the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD154) costimulatory pathway, was administered to patients with untreated Graves' disease (GD). Iscalimab was very well tolerated, with half of the subjects responding to the drug.

In comparison, B cell targeting therapies include rituximab, an anti-CD20 humanized mAb causing B cell depletion, and an anti-BAFF mAb (belimumab) preventing BAFF from interacting with its receptors. Rituximab has been tested in GD, leading to a decline of TSH-R-Abs. When administered to Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) patients, grossly conflicting results were registered. High costs, low efficacy, and potential drug-related side effects (such as orbital edema and optic neuropathy) are major hurdles for the generalized use of rituximab in GO.

- **Open-label study**: When tested in an open-label study, a humanized recombinant IL6-R mAb (tocilizumab) positively improved the clinical course of the disease and extraocular muscle motility in patients with steroid-resistant GO. However, a subsequent tocilizumab placebo-controlled randomized trial in GO patients only partially reproduced the earlier reported impressive findings.

In conclusion, further controlled randomized studies are warranted to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and clinical role of the above new compounds for GD and GO.

### Advances in treatment of active, moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy [^116EKCa5]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Graves' ophthalmopathy is defined as autoimmune inflammation of extraocular muscles and orbital fat or connective tissue, usually in patients with Graves' disease. About one in 20 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism has moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment, but new evidence about immune mechanisms has provided a basis to explore other drug classes. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses are more effective and better tolerated than oral prednisone in the treatment of active, moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. Rituximab has also been suggested as a possible replacement for intravenous corticosteroids.

Two randomised controlled trials of rituximab reached seemingly contradictory conclusions. Rituximab was not better with respect to the primary outcome (clinical activity score) than placebo in one trial (which, however, was confounded by rather long Graves' ophthalmopathy duration) but was slightly better than intravenous methylprednisolone pulses in the other (disease flare-ups occurred only in the latter group). On the basis of evidence published so far, rituximab cannot replace intravenous methylprednisolone pulses but could have a role in corticosteroid-resistant cases. Open-label studies of tumor-necrosis-factor-α blockade had limited efficacy, but other studies showed that interleukin-6 receptor antibodies were effective. Results of randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of the IGF-1 receptor antibody teprotumumab and the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab are expected shortly.

### Efficacy of anti-thyroid medications in patients with Graves' disease [^115aKU4S]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

TSH receptor antibodies are known to predict clinical and biochemical outcomes among patients with Graves' disease (GD) treated with anti-thyroid drugs (ATD). The American Thyroid Association and European Thyroid Association recommend measuring TRAb at the end of the treatment period and before stopping the ATD to guide the decision of whether to discontinue ATD, prolong low-dose ATD, or proceed with definitive therapy (radioactive iodine [RAI] or surgery). We found that the remission rate was inversely related to the initial TRAb level; a lower TRAb level was observed in patients who achieved remission than in those who did not. Additionally, we established that remission was achieved more frequently among females, patients with low baseline free T4, and those with mild Graves's ophthalmopathy.

These findings are, to an extent, consistent with previous studies. Karmisholt et al. determined that patients with higher free T4 and TRAb levels upon diagnosis were less likely to experience remission; however, there was no difference in the likelihood of remission based on gender or eye disease status. In contrast, Song et al. found that only the free T4 level at diagnosis predicts remission. Similarly, Zuhur et al. observed that females achieved sustained remission more often than males did. Previous studies have also associated the severity of Graves's ophthalmopathy and remission rates with ATD.

### New therapeutic horizons for Graves' hyperthyroidism [^1142XSF1]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Adverse effects have been reported with RTX, the most frequent of which is a mild infusion reaction including throat itching and nasal congestion, which resolves on slowing the infusion with or without the administration of hydrocortisone. There have also been reports of articular and gastrointestinal symptoms, specifically colitis, related to circulating immune complexes following RTX. The rare complication of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has largely been reported in patients with predisposing comorbidities who have received multiple immunosuppressive agents. An increased risk of serious infection has been reported in RTX-treated patients, but this tends to occur in patients with concomitant severe immunodeficiency or those with underlying malignancy.

RTX has been used for many years in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases, and a review over 9.5 years involving repeated courses of RTX in rheumatoid arthritis patients demonstrated no evidence of an increased safety risk or increased reporting rates of any type of adverse events compared with placebo plus methotrexate. In addition, the vast majority of studies using RTX in Graves' hyperthyroidism or GO have demonstrated no serious adverse events. Newer second-generation CD20-depleting strategies, including ocrelizumab and ofatumumab, which theoretically have lower immunogenicity and improved tolerability, may provide a future option for Graves' patients.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: a review [^116bNr55]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis and ophthalmopathy are interconnected conditions. Subacute thyroiditis and radioiodine treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism may serve as useful models for understanding the orbital changes in patients with thyroiditis. Following radioactive iodine treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism, there is a flare-up in thyroiditis, with the release of thyroid proteins and increased production of the corresponding antibodies against Tg, TPO, and TSHr.

In addition, recent unpublished observations have shown an increase in serum Tg concentrations following radioiodine treatment, which correlated with an increase in TSHr antibody titer, leading to initial worsening of eye signs but later improvement (Wall et al, 2013). It is also likely, though not yet demonstrated, that the number of thyroid antigen-sensitized T cells increases in the thyroid following radioactive iodine treatment. These antibodies and sensitized T cells could migrate to the orbital tissues, exacerbating existing eye disease.

Indeed, studies confirm that radioactive iodine treatment may lead to worsening of eye signs or even the development of new ophthalmopathy, although this remains controversial. Such findings would support the hypothesis that autoimmunity against thyroid antigens contributes to the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with thyroid autoimmunity. While there is no mechanistic data proving that radioactive iodine worsens Graves' ophthalmopathy by increasing thyroid destruction, Tg release, and the production of Tg/anti-Tg immune complexes, this remains the working hypothesis for current in vitro and clinical studies.

### Comparative effectiveness of various orbital decompression techniques in treating thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ovwoN]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), an organ-specific autoimmune disorder, is the most prevalent adult orbital disease. TAO, also known as Graves' orbitopathy and Graves' ophthalmopathy, is the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease. It is characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the retrobulbar and periorbital tissues, leading to a range of symptoms including eyelid retraction, edema of the periorbital tissues and conjunctivae, exophthalmos, ocular surface irritation symptoms such as grittiness and watering, and the occurrence of restrictive strabismus and diplopia caused by the involvement of the extraocular muscles. In cases of severe disease progression, TAO can lead to vision-threatening conditions such as exposure keratopathy and dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON), which can result in irreversible vision loss and potential disfigurement, significantly impacting the patient's quality of life and mental well-being.

Depending on the activity and severity of TAO, treatment options include drug therapy, orbital radiotherapy, surgery, or a combination. Surgical interventions for TAO include orbital decompression, strabismus correction, and blepharoplasty. Among these, orbital decompression surgery stands out as the cornerstone of surgical rehabilitation. The orbital walls are divided into four segments: medial, lateral, orbital roof, and floor. Owing to suboptimal outcomes and the potential for severe intracranial complications, the excision of the orbital roof is not commonly favored. Orbital decompression is accomplished by removing one or more of these orbital walls, thereby alleviating pressure and creating more space for the inflamed tissues.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: a review [^1151bTtB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

While most authors believe that autoimmunity against the TSH receptor expressed in the orbital connective tissue cells is the main reaction leading to the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, an older hypothesis that deserves fresh consideration is based on the notion that thyroglobulin (Tg) in the thyroid gland passes in a retrograde fashion to the orbit where it is recognized by Tg autoantibodies, leading to inflammation. Here, we review new evidence that supports a role of Tg and propose a new hypothesis based on the notion that Tg is targeted in the orbit, leading to a complex cascade of reactions that leads to Graves' ophthalmopathy.

### Disease presentation and remission rate in Graves disease treated with antithyroid drugs: Is gender really a factor [^112AJEij]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Low credibility.

The male gender is considered an adverse prognostic factor for remission of Graves disease treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), although published data are conflicting. This often results in early consideration of radioiodine treatment and surgery for men. The objective of this study was to compare disease presentation and outcome in men versus women treated with ATDs.

Retrospective analysis was performed on 235 patients (64 men, 171 women) with Graves disease who were evaluated for features at disease presentation and outcome at the end of follow-up between 2010 and 2015.

Disease presentation was similar in men and women for the age at diagnosis (41.4 ± 14 years vs. 40 ± 15 years), duration of follow-up (6.6 ± 7 years vs. 7.7 ± 6 years), rates of comorbid autoimmune diseases, and rate of Graves ophthalmopathy. Smoking was more prevalent in males (31% vs. 15%; p = 0.009).

Free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were comparable. Antithyroid drugs were first-line treatment in all males and in 168 out of 171 females, for a median duration of 24 and 20 months, respectively (P = 0.55). Remission rates were 47% in men and 58% in women (P = 0.14). Males experienced fewer adverse events (9% vs. 18%) and less treatment discontinuation (5% vs. 16%). Disease recurrence was comparable between genders (14% vs. 20%; p = 0.32), as was the requirement for second-line treatment, either radioiodine therapy or thyroidectomy.

In conclusion, Graves disease presentation is similar in men and women. Men treated with ATDs have high remission rates and similar recurrence rates compared to women, with fewer adverse events and less discontinuation of treatment.

### Opdivo [^11192LYA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Approximately 19% of patients with hyperthyroidism received methimazole, 7% received carbimazole, and 4% received propylthiouracil. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 9% (5/54) of patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 76% of the 54 patients. Of the 7 patients in whom Opdivo was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 4 reinitiated Opdivo after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of hyperthyroidism.

- **Opdivo with ipilimumab**: Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg resulted in hyperthyroidism occurring in 9% (42/456) of patients with melanoma or HCC who received Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (4.2%) adverse reactions. Hyperthyroidism led to the permanent discontinuation of Opdivo with ipilimumab in no patients and withholding of Opdivo with ipilimumab in 2.4% of patients.

	- Approximately 26% of patients with hyperthyroidism received methimazole and 21% received carbimazole. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 17% (7/42) of patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 91% of the 42 patients. Of the 11 patients in whom Opdivo with ipilimumab was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 8 reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 1 (13%) had recurrence of hyperthyroidism.

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^114y3mE8]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

The summary of evidence indicates that oral glucocorticoids (OGC) and intravenous glucocorticoids (IVGC) have been extensively used and studied in active moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease (TED). Available evidence shows efficacy for disease inactivation, marginal benefits on eye motility, and negligible benefits on proptosis. Adverse effects (AEs) are common from glucocorticoid therapy, but overall, the safety profile is acceptable. The evidence also favors IVGC over OGC.

- **Ivgc therapy**: IVGC therapy is a preferred treatment for active moderate-to-severe TED when disease activity is the prominent feature in the absence of either significant proptosis (see Section 2.1 for definition) or diplopia.

- **Standard dosing with IVGC**: Standard dosing consists of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) at cumulative doses of 4.5 g over approximately three months (0.5 g weekly for six weeks followed by 0.25 g weekly for an additional six weeks).

- **Poor response to IVMP**: A poor response to IVMP at six weeks should prompt consideration for treatment withdrawal and evaluation of other therapies. Clinicians should be alert for worsening diplopia or onset of dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) that have occurred even while on IVMP therapy.

- **Cumulative dose caution**: A cumulative dose of IVMP greater than 8.0 g should be avoided.

- **Therapies for unresponsive or intolerant patients**: For patients who do not respond, partially respond, or are intolerant to IVGC therapy, rituximab (RTX) and tocilizumab (TCZ) may be considered (see Section 7.1.4 and Section 7.1.6). Teprotumumab (TEP) has not been evaluated as salvage therapy in this setting. Other options, based on anecdotal evidence, include an additional course of IVGC (in patients with a previous partial response, aiming not to exceed 8 g of methylprednisolone).

### Avsola [^111RVdFy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Clinical response**: In Study RA I, all doses/schedules of infliximab + MTX resulted in improvement in signs and symptoms as measured by the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20), with a higher percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50, and 70 compared to placebo + MTX. This improvement was observed at Week 2 and maintained through Week 102. Greater effects on each component of the ACR 20 were observed in all patients treated with infliximab + MTX compared to placebo + MTX. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients. In Study RA II, after 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of infliximab + MTX resulted in a statistically significantly greater response in signs and symptoms compared to MTX alone, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses. More patients treated with infliximab reached a major clinical response than placebo-treated patients.

### 99mTc-anti-TNF-α scintigraphy: A new perspective within different methods in the diagnostic approach of active Graves ophthalmopathy [^1124rf7d]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Different imaging methods applied in the evaluation of a patient with unilateral active Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) are discussed in the present paper. 99mTc-anti-TNF-α scintigraphy is proposed as a promising method, not yet described, for the diagnosis of active ocular disease.

This technique involves labeling a human monoclonal antibody, adalimumab, directed against the TNF-α molecule with technetium (99mTc). The method is based on demonstrating TNF-α as one of the cytokines involved in the initial active phase of GO development. This approach may provide a new perspective to link diagnosis and therapy, including potential new target-based modalities.

### Long-term outcomes in corticosteroid-refractory Graves' orbitopathy treated with tocilizumab [^112B3RNM]. Clinical endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Graves' orbitopathy (GO), also known as thyroid eye disease, is an inflammatory disorder that affects the orbital structures, causing oculomotor muscles and adipose tissue hypertrophy. Exophthalmos, eyelid retraction, strabismus, and inflammation of the conjunctival and periorbital tissues are typical signs of the disease. In severe cases, the enlargement of orbital content can result in sight-threatening complications such as compressive optic neuropathy and corneal ulceration. Symptoms including intense pain, dryness, photophobia, diplopia, and aesthetic consequences negatively impact patients' quality of life.

GO occurs in approximately 25% of patients affected by Graves' disease (GD), representing the most common extrathyroidal disorder. Rarely, GO is diagnosed before the occurrence of thyroid signs. Women are at higher risk than men, but severe forms occur more frequently in men aged over 50 years.

It is thought that GO arises from crossed immunological activity between the thyroid gland and orbital tissue antigens, due to recognition of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor (IGF-1R) as autoantigens on the cell surface of fibroblasts. The differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts or adipocytes following the upregulation of the TSHR/IGF-1R complex results in expanded orbital soft tissues. Histologic findings show mononuclear infiltrate, predominantly characterized by CD4+ T cells and the overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and IL-17.

### Inflectra [^1128AyHi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Infliximab products have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions that vary in their time of onset and have required hospitalization in some cases. Most hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, dyspnea, and/or hypotension, have occurred during or within two hours of infliximab product infusion. However, serum sickness-like reactions have been observed in some patients after initial therapy with infliximab products. These reactions can occur as early as after the second dose and when therapy is reinstituted following an extended period without treatment. Symptoms associated with these reactions include fever, rash, headache, sore throat, myalgias, polyarthralgias, hand and facial edema, and/or dysphagia. These reactions are associated with a marked increase in antibodies to infliximab products, loss of detectable serum concentrations, and possible loss of drug efficacy.

Inflectra should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, such as acetaminophen, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and/or epinephrine, should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In RA, CD, and Ps clinical trials, re-administration of infliximab following a period without treatment resulted in a higher incidence of infusion reactions relative to regular maintenance treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Management of thyroid eye disease: A consensus statement by the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association [^112M91Ei]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Other agents tested in TED patients and clinically available have been explored. Several additional agents have been tried in TED, including atorvastatin, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), azathioprine, cyclosporine, somatostatin analogs, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors. Only a few of these agents have been studied through randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

An RCT comparing atorvastatin (20 mg daily for 24 weeks) plus intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) (500 mg IV weekly for six weeks followed by 250 mg weekly for six weeks) with IVMP alone found significantly greater improvement in the EUGOGO composite index. This was seen in 51% (21/41) of patients in the atorvastatin plus IVMP arm versus 28% (11/39) of patients in the IVMP alone arm. Additionally, relapses at 24 weeks were less likely in the atorvastatin plus IVMP arm (0/41 patients) compared to the IVMP alone arm (15%, 6/39 patients). The GO-QOL score improved significantly more in the combined therapy group, increasing by 6.4 points compared to the IVMP group.

Despite the greater improvement in the composite index when atorvastatin was added to IVMP, no significant differences were found between groups in individual eye components such as the Clinical Activity Score (CAS) and diplopia, both of which improved in both groups. Moreover, improvements were not observed in proptosis, visual acuity, and eye aperture in either group.

IVIG appeared to demonstrate efficacy comparable to oral glucocorticoids (OGC) in the one RCT available. However, due to the high cost, the risk of transmission of infections, and the availability of other treatments, IVIG is not currently recommended for use in TED.

The roles of azathioprine (one RCT), cyclosporine (two RCTs), TNF alpha inhibitors, somatostatin analogs (four RCTs), and methotrexate remain questionable as the evidence is either anecdotal or indicates a lack of efficacy.

### Efficacy profile and safety of very low-dose rituximab in patients with Graves' orbitopathy [^114BWF1h]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Rituximab (RTX), a chimeric human-murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been used for the treatment of active moderate-severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO) since 2004 as a second-line therapy in patients unresponsive to intravenous steroids. We conducted an open-label prospective study (EUDRACT 2012–001980–53) in which patients were treated with a single infusion of only 100 mg RTX to analyze the efficacy and safety of this low dose.

- **Methods**: Seventeen patients, of whom nine had disease unresponsive to intravenous methylprednisolone and eight with newly diagnosed GO, were enrolled. Disease activity was assessed with the clinical activity score (CAS) and severity with a composite ophthalmic score. Long-term surgical treatment and quality of life were also assessed, including treatment-related adverse events.

- **Results**: The mean baseline CAS was 4.56 ± 0.96 and decreased to 1.25 ± 1.14 at 24 weeks (p = 0.001). Disease inactivation occurred within 24 weeks in over 90% of patients and was unrelated to disease duration. Severity improved in about 60% of patients, with no relapses. All patients showed peripheral depletion of CD20+ and CD19+ cells at the end of RTX infusion (60 minutes). Two patients required surgical orbital decompression due to optic neuropathy (ON). Among adverse events observed, there was one patient who developed a cytokine release syndrome.

A dose of 100 mg RTX is effective in patients with active moderate-severe GO. Low doses are better tolerated, expose patients to immune suppression for a shorter period of time, and are extremely cost effective.

### Risk factors for development or deterioration of Graves' ophthalmopathy [^113D8ETv]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) significantly impairs the quality of life of affected individuals, and the most severe cases can be sight-threatening. Given the limited therapeutic options, a strong emphasis should be placed on disease prevention to diminish the significant morbidity associated with this disease.

- **Summary**: GO is most prevalent in women and most severe in men. Although some genetic differences between GO patients and Graves' disease patients without ophthalmopathy have been identified, none of the polymorphisms identified at the time of writing impart a high enough risk of GO to justify genetic testing to guide therapy or preventive strategies. Poorly defined mechanical factors that appear to play a role in GO susceptibility will likely be better elucidated with advances in imaging techniques. Tobacco smoking has been consistently linked to the development or deterioration of GO. Smokers who receive radioactive iodine have the highest incidence of unfavorable GO outcomes, which is proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Several studies have reported an association between radioactive iodine treatment for Graves' disease and worsening or development of GO. Observational studies suggest that the same appears to be true for thyroid dysfunction, including both hyper- and hypothyroidism. While thyrotropin receptor antibody levels appear to be useful in predicting the course of disease and response to therapy, it is not known whether they are predictive of GO development. The puzzling scenarios of euthyroid or clinically unilateral GO, the large number of factors involved, and the limited understanding of their interactions pose a challenge to effective management strategies.

A47 A single center experience with weekly adalimumab versus infliximab therapy in refractory uveitis.

Adalimumab is currently the only non-corticosteroid therapy approved for the treatment of pediatric uveitis. Although it is approved for every 2-week (Q2 week) dosing, many rheumatologists will increase the frequency to weekly (Q1 week) dosing if uveitis remains uncontrolled. We sought to assess the effectiveness of this approach compared to switching to infliximab in treating uveitis refractory to Q2 week adalimumab.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of children with uveitis treated with Q2 week adalimumab who switched to Q1 week adalimumab or monthly infliximab due to persistent uveitis. Patients seen in the Boston Children's Hospital rheumatology clinic between 2000 and 2018 with an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code of uveitis were included. The primary outcome measure was the percent of patients achieving sustained uveitis control. Time to control, frequency of uveitis recurrence, and ocular complications were also collected.

- **Results**: We identified 24 patients with persistent uveitis despite treatment with Q2 week adalimumab who were switched to either Q1 week adalimumab or Q4 week infliximab. Twelve of 19 patients (63%) who were switched to Q1 week adalimumab achieved sustained uveitis control.

### Does autoimmunity against thyroglobulin play a role in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy: A review [^111S41QU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

While most authors believe that autoimmunity against the TSH receptor expressed in the orbital connective tissue cells is the main reaction that leads to the development of ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, an older hypothesis deserving of fresh consideration is based on the notion that thyroglobulin (Tg) in the thyroid gland passes in a retrograde fashion to the orbit where it is recognized by Tg autoantibodies, leading to inflammation. Here, we review new evidence that supports a role of Tg and propose a new hypothesis based on the notion that Tg is targeted in the orbit, leading to a complex cascade of reactions that results in Graves' ophthalmopathy.

### Ten year outcome of anti-thyroid drug treatment for first episode Graves' thyrotoxicosis: The predictive importance of TRAb [^111RpCPV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs) are safe and effective in promptly restoring euthyroidism in people with Graves' thyrotoxicosis. Treatment is typically administered for a 12–18 month period, but recurrence following withdrawal is common, occurring in approximately 50% of cases in Europe and up to 80% in North America. TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) are elevated at diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in approximately 97% of people with Graves' disease. In addition to their role in establishing the diagnosis of Graves' disease, TRAb has been associated with predicting the risk of recurrence following withdrawal of ATD, as well as the risk of radioiodine treatment failure.

Other features associated with an increased risk for recurrence include younger age, large goitre size, male sex, orbitopathy, and cigarette smoking, although there is significant variability in the published evidence. Previous studies have not been consistent in assessing people who have completed a physician-directed course of ATD with planned cessation, and most studies have been limited by extremely short follow-up periods, typically 1–2 years. This study sought to report the natural history of recurrence over a 10-year period and to establish risk factors for recurrence of thyrotoxicosis following ATD withdrawal.

### Carotid cavernous fistula in a patient with Graves' ophthalmopathy [^116p5S4t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of carotid cavernous fistula, an abnormal arteriovenous connection between the cavernous sinus and the carotid artery, can closely mimic the cardinal signs of Graves' ophthalmopathy, an inflammatory disorder of the orbit usually associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. Therefore, carotid cavernous fistulas are generally considered in the differential diagnosis of Graves' ophthalmopathy, especially when the eye involvement is unilateral or asymmetric, necessitating the exclusion of rarer etiologies of orbital disease. This is the first report of the simultaneous occurrence of Graves' ophthalmopathy and carotid cavernous fistula.

The patient was a 67-year-old woman with a history of Graves' disease and mild bilateral ophthalmopathy treated with radioiodine following a 10-year therapy with methimazole. After radioiodine treatment, ophthalmopathy deteriorated. At the time of our initial clinical evaluation, the ocular involvement of the patient was symmetric, and no evidence of any associated condition was found. However, the response of eye disease to corticosteroid treatment was markedly unequal, resulting in evident asymmetry. This prompted a reconsideration of the diagnosis and a new evaluation of the patient with sensitive techniques, leading to the further diagnosis of carotid cavernous fistula.

### Rituximab for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy [^115vHEM6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease, affecting up to 50% of patients. It has a significant impact on quality of life. Rituximab (RTX) is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 receptor on B-lymphocytes. Preliminary work has shown that blocking this CD20 receptor with RTX may influence the clinical course of TAO by reducing inflammation and the degree of proptosis.

- **Objectives**: This review update, originally published in 2013, assesses the efficacy and safety of using RTX for the treatment of TAO.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2022, Issue 2), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), and the ISRCTN registry.

### The use of infliximab in ocular inflammation [^117MYJtb]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Experience with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medications in ophthalmology has mainly been in the treatment of resistant uveitis and scleritis. There have been a few case reports and one case series detailing the use of infliximab in the treatment of orbital inflammatory disease, but there is still limited experience with these agents in a variety of orbital inflammatory conditions. This study describes successful suppression of inflammation with infliximab in idiopathic orbital inflammation, thyroid-associated orbital inflammation, and chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy.

This retrospective observational case series includes five cases of orbital and ocular inflammation. We describe the effects of infliximab in the treatment of three cases of orbital inflammation and two cases of chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy, all of which were unresponsive to alternative immune modulators. The patients experienced relief from symptoms and signs of inflammation in all five cases. However, this relief was not absolute, as symptoms returned around the fifth week post-inflammation.

This report highlights the expanding role of biological agents in ophthalmology. Although not the definitive solution for treatment, they offer a valuable alternative to steroids in cases of refractory inflammation.
