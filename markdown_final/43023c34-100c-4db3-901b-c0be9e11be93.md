## Question

83 yo M wants sildenafil treatment, is it safe

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sildenafil is safe for an 83-year-old man with erectile dysfunction and how to approach prescribing it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics in older adults and whether dose adjustment is needed. Then, I should verify absolute contraindications, especially nitrates and guanylate cyclase stimulators. Next, I will review cardiovascular risk stratification and when to consider stress testing. After that, I need to check for drug interactions and organ impairment that would modify dosing. I will then examine adverse effects and counseling points, including priapism and vision or hearing loss. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and follow-up, ensuring alignment with guidelines and labeling.

> Let me first confirm the geriatric pharmacokinetics, because that drives dosing. In adults 65 years and older, sildenafil clearance is reduced, increasing exposure by roughly 84% for parent drug and 107% for the active metabolite, which means higher plasma levels and a higher likelihood of adverse effects at standard doses, so I should start low and go slow in an 83-year-old [^112Xw3vs] [^1176gUgT] [^111sRs1Y].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled starting dose for older adults. The FDA labeling recommends considering a starting dose of 25 mg in older subjects due to higher systemic exposure, which fits this 83-year-old scenario, and I should titrate based on efficacy and tolerability rather than starting at 50 mg or 100 mg as in younger men [^112Xw3vs] [^1176gUgT] [^111sRs1Y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without addressing absolute contraindications. I need to ensure there is no concomitant nitrate therapy or nitric oxide donors, because coadministration can cause profound hypotension and is absolutely contraindicated; I should also confirm he is not on a guanylate cyclase stimulator such as riociguat, which is likewise contraindicated due to hypotension risk [^114P3RR7] [^113CyeaR].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular risk and whether sexual activity is advisable. ED often coexists with cardiovascular disease, and the Princeton Consensus advises that men with ED and risk factors be screened for vascular disease and, when appropriate, undergo exercise testing to stratify cardiac risk before initiating ED therapy. I should confirm resting blood pressure is acceptable and that there has been no recent MI, stroke, life-threatening arrhythmia, unstable angina, or decompensated heart failure within the last 6 months before prescribing [^111PZkra] [^1127YsjC] [^115KgjfN].

> I will now examine drug interactions that could raise sildenafil levels and precipitate hypotension or adverse effects. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir or cobicistat can markedly increase sildenafil exposure, warranting a 25 mg every 48 hours maximum in some regimens; alpha-blockers can cause additive hypotension, so I should ensure alpha-blocker therapy is stable and start sildenafil at the lowest dose if combined; amlodipine can add a modest blood pressure reduction, which is usually tolerated but warrants caution in frail patients [^1175JW9e] [^114ssM6p] [^114P3RR7] [^113CyeaR].

> Let me consider organ impairment next. In severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, exposure approximately doubles, so a 25 mg starting dose is prudent. Similarly, in hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and a 25 mg starting dose should be considered, with avoidance in severe hepatic dysfunction when data are lacking. I should confirm his renal and hepatic status before prescribing [^112Xw3vs] [^1176gUgT] [^111sRs1Y].

> I should double-check the adverse effect profile and counseling points. Common effects include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, and dizziness, which are dose-related and generally mild; I must counsel on priapism and instruct immediate care for erections lasting more than 4 hours; I should also warn about rare but serious events such as NAION and sudden hearing loss and advise stopping the drug and seeking urgent care if visual or auditory symptoms occur [^115Sb5cV] [^1127YsjC] [^115x8mrG].

> But wait, what about cardiovascular outcomes with sildenafil itself. Large pooled analyses and postmarketing data do not show an increased risk of myocardial infarction or serious cardiovascular events attributable to sildenafil when used appropriately, and in men with stable coronary artery disease, sildenafil has been shown to be effective and safe without excess cardiovascular events. Nonetheless, events reported temporally with use often reflect underlying disease and sexual activity rather than the drug per se, so careful selection and counseling remain essential [^113FQQ8C] [^113CyeaR] [^112Qsamm] [^114iHoJ7].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan. I would start with 25 mg about 1 hour before anticipated sexual activity, not more than once daily, taken on an empty stomach or after a light meal to optimize absorption. I would titrate to 50 mg only if 25 mg is ineffective and well tolerated, and consider 100 mg only if needed and without adverse effects. I would ensure he understands that sexual stimulation is required for efficacy and that more than one attempt may be needed to judge response [^112Xw3vs] [^115Sb5cV] [^113qGcLa].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking any red flags. Before the first prescription, I would confirm no nitrate use, no recent unstable cardiovascular events, no severe hepatic dysfunction, and no strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If there is uncertainty about cardiac reserve, I would arrange exercise stress testing or cardiology input. If he is on an alpha-blocker, I would ensure hemodynamic stability and consider separating doses or further reducing the initial sildenafil dose if symptomatic hypotension occurs [^111PZkra] [^1127YsjC] [^114P3RR7].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety monitoring. I would plan a check-in within 2 to 4 weeks to assess efficacy, tolerability, blood pressure, and any cardiovascular symptoms. I would reinforce priapism precautions, vision or hearing warnings, and avoidance of nitrates. If efficacy is suboptimal, I would confirm correct use, consider dose optimization or an alternative PDE5 inhibitor, and reassess for underlying contributors such as hypogonadism or medication effects before declaring treatment failure [^115Sb5cV] [^117DtUMB] [^113qGcLa].

Sildenafil can be used safely in an 83-year-old man if he has **no contraindications** (notably nitrates or recent major cardiovascular events) and starts at a **low dose (25 mg)** [^112Xw3vs] due to higher exposure in older adults [^1176gUgT]. The main risks are **hypotension** [^115KgjfN], **cardiovascular events** [^114iHoJ7], and rare vision or hearing loss [^115x8mrG]; these are mitigated by careful screening, dose adjustment, and monitoring. Sildenafil is effective in older men [^113FQQ8C], but efficacy declines with age, so expectations should be managed and dose titration guided by response and tolerability [^115Sb5cV].

---

## Pharmacokinetics in elderly patients

Elderly patients have **reduced clearance** and **higher exposure**: healthy volunteers ≥ 65 years have ~84% higher sildenafil AUC and ~107% higher N-desmethyl metabolite AUC than younger adults [^112Xw3vs] [^1176gUgT]. Protein binding also shifts with age, increasing free drug exposure by ~45% for sildenafil and ~57% for the metabolite [^112Xw3vs] [^111sRs1Y]. Given this, a **lower starting dose** of 25 mg is recommended in older adults to reduce adverse effects [^112Xw3vs] [^1176gUgT].

---

## Clinical efficacy in elderly patients

Efficacy remains significant but **declines with age**: pooled trials show sildenafil improves erectile function across age groups, with response rates of 80% (< 65), 69% (65–74), and 59% (≥ 75) [^113FQQ8C]. Quality of life also improves, as treating ED can enhance **quality of life and mood** in older men, including those with comorbidities [^111rTtYJ].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, and dizziness are dose-related and usually mild to moderate [^115Sb5cV] [^111uCxqL].

- **Cardiovascular risks**: sildenafil causes modest BP reductions (mean ~8/5 mmHg) [^115KgjfN]; serious cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, arrhythmias) are rare but reported, often in patients with preexisting disease or during sex [^114iHoJ7] [^115o2t6v].

- **Vision and hearing risks**: rare NAION and sudden hearing loss have been reported; caution is advised in patients with risk factors [^112wvREf] [^1161SLgT].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

| **Contraindications** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|
| Nitrates or nitric oxide donors (severe hypotension risk) [^114P3RR7] | Recent MI, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia (< 6 months) [^1127YsjC] |
| Guanylate cyclase stimulators (e.g. riociguat) [^114P3RR7] | Resting hypotension (BP < 90/50) or uncontrolled hypertension (BP > 170/110) [^1127YsjC] |
| Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [^notfound] | Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) [^112Xw3vs] |
| Retinitis pigmentosa or history of NAION [^1161SLgT] | Alpha-blockers or antihypertensives (start low, monitor for hypotension) [^114P3RR7] |

---

## Drug interactions

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors**: ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and others increase sildenafil levels; start at 25 mg and consider max 25 mg every 48 hours with strong inhibitors [^1175JW9e] [^114ssM6p].

- **Alpha-blockers**: risk of symptomatic hypotension; ensure alpha-blocker stability before starting sildenafil at the lowest dose [^114P3RR7] [^113CyeaR].

- **Antihypertensives**: generally safe, but monitor for additive hypotension [^116miqYQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

First-line therapy is appropriate when **no contraindications** are present, with counseling on use and dose titration to effect [^117DtUMB] [^114eqZHH]. Cardiovascular assessment should precede therapy in men with **cardiovascular risk factors** or recent events, with exercise testing considered when appropriate [^111PZkra] [^1127YsjC].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Initial monitoring**: assess BP, heart rate, and symptoms after the first dose; titrate based on efficacy and tolerability [^115Sb5cV].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: periodic review of cardiovascular status, renal/hepatic function, and adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: emphasize contraindications, use with nitrates, and when to seek urgent care (e.g. chest pain, vision changes, priapism) [^114P3RR7].

---

## Alternative treatments

Alternatives include **other PDE5 inhibitors** (tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) with similar efficacy and safety but differing half-lives and interaction profiles [^115Sb5cV] [^112GTZFH]. Non-pharmacologic options include vacuum devices, penile injections, and implants for refractory cases or when PDE5 inhibitors are contraindicated [^117CYr6h].

---

Sildenafil is **safe and effective** for an 83-year-old man if there are no contraindications and he starts at 25 mg with careful monitoring and dose titration. The main risks — hypotension, cardiovascular events, and rare vision or hearing loss — are mitigated by screening, dose adjustment, and patient education.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, side effects, renewal patterns, and other relevant practice issues of the use of sildenafil in urologic practice after approval of this medication and release for public use.

Methods

Consecutive male patients with erectile dysfunction were evaluated by one urologist and sildenafil was prescribed when appropriate. Patients were monitored at two follow-up visits: at 3 to 4 months and then at 3 to 8 months (6 to 12 months after the initial prescription). At the follow-up visits, each patient was given a questionnaire assessing his improvement in erectile function, satisfaction with sildenafil, and expectations. Data were obtained on side effects, medical history, tablets taken, subsequent treatment in sildenafil failures, and renewal patterns.

Results

A total of 164 and 82 patients were evaluated at the first and second follow-up visits, respectively. Patients used a mean of 1.2 to 1.4 tablets per week. At the first follow-up visit, an improvement in erection was noted in 68.2% of patients. At the second follow-up visit, an improvement in erection was noted in 80.5% of patients. Sixty-two percent and 78% of patients renewed sildenafil at the first and second follow-up visits, respectively. In those patients who did not renew, a lack of efficacy was the most frequent reason. Intracavernous injection therapy was the most common treatment after sildenafil failure, followed by penile implants.

Conclusions

Sildenafil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. At the first and second follow-up visit, most patients requested and received renewal.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Nitrates

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil citrate with regular and/or intermittent use of nitric oxide donors, such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil citrate with use of guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat [see Contraindications (4.3)].

Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure

Physicians should advise patients of the potential for sildenafil citrate to augment the blood pressure lowering effect of alpha-blockers and anti-hypertensive medications. Concomitant administration of sildenafil citrate and an alpha-blocker may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, when sildenafil citrate is co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil citrate treatment and sildenafil citrate should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Cardiovascular Considerations

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, dizziness, nausea) upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Lack of awareness of erectile dysfunction in many men with risk factors for erectile dysfunction [^1143pKL6]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Men were recruited for a men's health study without mention of erectile dysfunction. At the screening visit for this sildenafil flexible-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, written informed consent was obtained, and demographic data and the patient's history of risk factor(s) were collected. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating center, and the study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Men ≥ 30 years of age who presented with at least 1 risk factor or comorbidity for erectile dysfunction (controlled hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, metabolic syndrome, stable coronary artery disease, diabetes, depression, lower urinary tract symptoms [LUTS], obesity [defined as body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m 2] or waist circumference ≥ 40 inches) and who had not been previously diagnosed with erectile dysfunction were eligible for screening.

Key exclusion criteria included hypotension, current or anticipated nitrate or nitric oxide donor treatment, significant cardiovascular disease within the past 3 months, and previous use of more than 6 doses of any phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor.

Men were asked the screening question, "Do you have erectile dysfunction?" and administered the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF). Those who answered "no" or "unsure" to the erectile dysfunction question and who had any degree of erectile dysfunction (scored ≤ 25 out of 30 on the IIEF-EF) were eligible for inclusion into the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The results of the screening analysis are reported here.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy young volunteers (18 to 45 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of sildenafil tablets, 18% were 65 years and older, while 2% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger (< 65 years of age) subjects.

However, since higher plasma levels may increase the incidence of adverse reactions, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in older subjects due to the higher systemic exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is required for mild (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr = 30 to 49 mL/min) renal impairment. In volunteers with severe renal impairment (Clcr < 30 mL/min), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (~2 fold), approximately doubling of Cmax and AUC. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (47% for Cmax and 85% for AUC). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors.

Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular

Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of sildenafil tablets. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil tablets without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of sildenafil tablets and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil tablets, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Clinical evaluation of erectile dysfunction in the era of PDE-5 inhibitors [^116AjeYi]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common disorder that has gained attention since the introduction of relatively safe treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. ED is a multi-factorial disorder and a common presentation for several systemic illnesses, particularly vascular occlusive diseases. The clinical evaluation of ED should be thorough and systematic, with attention to the appropriate use of sexual symptom questionnaires and symptom scales, detailed medical and sexual history, physical examination, and basic screening laboratory tests. Patients should be referred for specialized evaluations when appropriate. The clinician must be familiar with the pathophysiologic mechanisms of ED, its associations with other systemic diseases, the indications for specialist referrals, and the role of specialized testing to diagnose and treat this disorder effectively.

### Microvascular complications in diabetic erectile dysfunction: do we need other alternatives? [^1161SLgT]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Safety

PDE5 inhibitors are safe drugs, and the main contraindications for their use is the concomitant use of nitrates and use in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Although several cardiovascular safety issues have been raised since their clinical introduction, the results of recent clinical trials and clinical pharmacologic surveillance data have demonstrated no increase in myocardial infarction rates in patients taking these agents compared with the expected rates in age-matched populations. Furthermore, the results of numerous studies have proven not only the cardiovascular safety of PDE5 inhibitors, but even possible cardiovascular benefits.

One important safety issue is the co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors with α-adrenoceptor blockers in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. All PDE5 inhibitors appear to have some interaction with α-adrenoceptor blockers with respect to lowering blood pressure, but co-administration rarely results in clinically significant orthostatic hypotension.

Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alerted health providers about a possible association between the use of PDE5 inhibitors and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in response to a small number (> 50 cases) of postmarketing reports of vision loss in men taking PDE5 inhibitors. Based on currently available data, it is recommended that patients with a history of mono-ocular NAION be cautioned that the administration of PDE5 inhibitors may increase the risk of NAION in the fellow eye. Patients who have risk factors for the development of NAION should be referred to an ophthalmologist before being prescribed PDE5 inhibitors. Furthermore, any man taking a PDE5 inhibitor who develops visual problems should stop taking the PDE5 inhibitor and be seen by an ophthalmologist.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure — phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (sildenafil) use is characterized by limited evidence in HF, potential hemodynamic benefits, short‑term tolerability, and a nitrate contraindication. Few patients with HF were enrolled in controlled trials with sildenafil, and thus, the efficacy and safety of this drug in patients with HF are not known, although patients with HF appear to tolerate short‑term administration of the drug without difficulty; however, sildenafil should not be given to patients taking nitrates, who may experience profound hypotension due to potentiation of vasodilator effects.

### Sildenafil (viagra) for male erectile dysfunction: a meta-analysis of clinical trial reports [^113Zhj6n]. BMC Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Evaluation of company clinical trial reports could provide information for meta-analysis at the commercial introduction of a new technology.

Methods

Clinical trial reports of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction from September 1997 were used for meta-analysis of randomised trials (at least four weeks duration) and using fixed or dose optimisation regimens. The main outcome sought was an erection, sufficiently rigid for penetration, followed by successful intercourse, and conducted at home.

Results

Ten randomised controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (2123 men given sildenafil and 1131 placebo). NNT or NNH were calculated for important efficacy, adverse event and discontinuation outcomes. Dose optimisation led to at least 60% of attempts at sexual intercourse being successful in 49% of men, compared with 11% with placebo; the NNT was 2.7 (95% confidence interval 2.3 to 3.3). For global improvement in erections the NNT was 1.7 (1.6 to 1.9). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 30% of men on dose optimised sildenafil compared with 11% on placebo; the NNH was 5.4 (4.3 to 7.3). All cause discontinuations were less frequent with sildenafil (10%) than with placebo (20%). Sildenafil dose optimisation gave efficacy equivalent to the highest fixed doses, and adverse events equivalent to the lowest fixed doses.

Conclusion

This review of clinical trial reports available at the time of licensing agreed with later reviews that had many more trials and patients. Making reports submitted for marketing approval available publicly would provide better information when it was most needed, and would improve evidence-based introduction of new technologies.

### Sex and the patient with cardiovascular risk factors: focus on sildenafil [^112BdmrJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in men with cardiovascular disease. The introduction of sildenafil citrate, the first oral agent for the treatment of this disorder, has increased awareness about the risks of sexual activity in cardiac patients and raised concerns about the safety of sildenafil in patients being treated for coronary disease. Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Sildenafil acts along the same general pathway as nitric oxide donors to increase cGMP levels and enhance erections. Sildenafil is a modest vasodilator that causes small decreases in systemic arterial pressure and mild preload and afterload reductions. It does not cause major decreases in blood pressure when administered with one or more standard antihypertensive agents. Because PDE5 is also present in small amounts in the systemic vasculature, sildenafil can cause a synergistic and major decrease in pressure when combined with organic nitrates. Use of organic nitrates is the only contraindication to sildenafil use. Data on sildenafil in patients with recent (less than 6 months) myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, stroke, and recent life-threatening arrhythmias are not available, so the drug should be used with caution in patients with unstable cardiac conditions. Placebo-controlled and open-label phase 2/3 trials including men with ischemic heart disease did not show an increase in MI or serious cardiovascular events in patients treated with sildenafil versus placebo. None of the serious cardiovascular events reported in these trials were considered treatment related by the investigators. There is a small but finite increased risk of developing ischemia or infarction with sexual activity. Therefore, before prescribing sildenafil or any current or future treatment for ED to patients with known cardiac disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, physicians should discuss the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity and perform a complete medical assessment, including an exercise stress test if appropriate.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111uCxqL]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Combining all information on 50 mg and 100 mg with dose optimised regimens, both all cause and lack of efficacy withdrawals reported in about 5600 men, were lower with sildenafil than with placebo, with NNTp values of 23 (17 to 37) and 25 (21 to 34) respectively. Adverse event withdrawals were higher with sildenafil than with placebo, with an NNH of 120 (67 to 560).

Combining all information on 50 mg and 100 mg with dose optimised regimens, particular adverse events were reported in 2600 to 6300 men, and were generally higher with sildenafil than with placebo, except serious adverse events, which were not different. NNH values varied between 4.9 (4.2 to 6.0) for men reporting at least one adverse event (49% of men taking sildenafil), to 18 (15 to 23) for men reporting dyspepsia. Headache was the most commonly reported individual adverse event in 17% of men taking sildenafil, followed by flushing reported in 13% and dyspepsia in 7.8%. The majority of trials reported that adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and frequently transient.

### Cardiovascular effects of tadalafil [^1128TgoN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of tadalafil on the cardiovascular system, safety assessments were performed on a database of > 4000 subjects who received tadalafil in > 60 clinical pharmacology, phase 2, phase 3, and open-label studies. In healthy subjects, tadalafil resulted in small changes in blood pressure, which are not believed to be clinically relevant. Daily administration of tadalafil 20 mg for 26 weeks in healthy male subjects or patients with mild erectile dysfunction resulted in blood pressure changes similar to those observed after placebo administration. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), tadalafil administration before nitrate administration resulted in small decreases in blood pressure. The resulting mean maximal change in standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) after coadministration of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with chronic stable angina was -36 mm Hg for tadalafil 5 mg, -31 mm Hg for tadalafil 10 mg, and -28 mm Hg for placebo. In addition, a larger number of men had a standing SBP < 85 mm Hg after coadministration of sublingual nitroglycerin and tadalafil 5 mg (p < 0.001 vs placebo) or tadalafil 10 mg (p < 0.01 vs placebo) compared with coadministration with placebo. In patients with chronic stable angina taking doses of isosorbide mononitrate on a long-term basis, the mean maximal change in standing SBP was -23 mm Hg for placebo, -23 mm Hg for tadalafil 5 mg, and -26 mm Hg for tadalafil 10 mg. In a study of older subjects (≥ 55 years of age) with no overt evidence of CAD, the resulting mean maximal change in standing SBP after coadministration of sublingual nitroglycerin was -25 mm Hg for tadalafil 10 mg, -29 mm Hg for sildenafil 50 mg, and -25 mm Hg for placebo. Cardiac mortality rates in tadalafil studies are consistent with the expected rate in this male population. Across all studies, the incidence rate of myocardial infarction was low in tadalafil-treated patients (0.43 per 100 patient-years) compared with patients who received placebo (0.6 per 100 patient-years), and the incidence rate was comparable to that observed in the age-standardized male population (0.60 per 100 patient-years). The incidence rate of presumed thrombotic strokes in tadalafil studies (0.27 per 100 patient-years) is comparable to the expected rate in this patient population. The data presented herein suggest that tadalafil can be safely used by healthy subjects and by patients with cardiovascular diseases. As with sildenafil, the use of tadalafil is contraindicated in patients receiving nitrate therapy because of the potential for significant hypotensive effects.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease [^1158mXNe]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that erectile dysfunction (ED) may be an early marker of endothelial dysfunction and coronary artery disease (CAD). Conversely, patients with CAD commonly have ED. The phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are very effective for the treatment of ED in patients with CAD. Numerous studies show that this class of drugs is in general safe in patients with stable CAD and these agents do not exacerbate ischemia in men with CAD undergoing exercise stress testing. Analysis of placebo-controlled trials did not show an increase in cardiovascular events among men receiving PDE5 inhibitors, and post-marketing surveillance studies with sildenafil did not observe an increase in cardiovascular events compared to expected age-matched rates. Organic nitrates remain a contraindication for PDE5 inhibitors and alpha blockers have precautions/contraindications depending upon specific drugs. The Princeton Consensus Guidelines (soon to be updated) suggest a logical approach to the patient with CAD seeking therapy for sexual dysfunction.

### Is chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 cardioprotective and safe? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113oHgBy]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Limitations

Our review has some limitations. The first concerns the differences in the baseline characteristics. Subgroup analyses for length of treatment (less than or more than six months) were not possible due to the small number of studies. Similarly, the majority of eligible trials provided data obtained in patients older than 60 years, using sildenafil. Furthermore, the lack of data on gender differences in cardiac outcomes did not permit the exploration of male and female behavior, whereas there have been significant advances with respect to cardiovascular disease in women in the last decade.

The second limitation pertains to the often missing information on cardiac geometry parameters; while considering that for all outcomes, 25% of trials had a risk of reporting bias.

The third concern is that the findings of this study are nonetheless prone to publication bias and that 13 out of 24 trials had unclear potential for selection bias (although none with a high risk), that may threaten their validity. On the positive side, industrial bias seems limited, as most trials were spontaneous studies that received only external support. The fact that some studies did not report data on all basic outcomes reinforces the value of the COMET initiative aimed at defining the minimum standardized set of outcomes that each clinical trial should report for specific health conditions.

A fourth concern is on the high heterogeneity found in the main analysis. In most, but not all, cases, this was reasonably explained by the inclusion criteria of the trials, degree of hypertrophy and chamber dilation, or by duration of treatment.

Finally, conclusions drawn from subgroup analyses considering only two studies are only indicative and should be interpreted with care. See specific limitations in Additional file 1 - Limitations.

### Sildenafil: emerging cardiovascular indications [^111G2pDX]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The discovery in 1989 of sildenafil, a highly selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), was the result of extensive research on chemical agents targeting PDE-5 that might potentially be useful in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Initial clinical studies on sildenafil in the early 1990s were not promising with respect to its antianginal potential. However, the incidental discovery of its antiimpotence effect led to its approval of for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Thereafter, several reports of adverse cardiac events in patients on sildenafil raised concerns about its safety in cardiovascular disorders. Novel therapeutic indications are emerging for sildenafil with the recent discovery that PDE-5 is expressed in various other tissues such as the arterial vasculature, including pulmonary and coronary arteries, venous vasculature, skeletal muscles, platelets, and visceral and tracheobronchial muscles. In this review we briefly summarize the pharmacology of sildenafil and the current available evidence on its potential therapeutic applications in cardiovascular disorders.

### The efficacy of sildenafil citrate (viagra) in clinical populations: an update [^111DnrcR]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Although certain risk factors are known to be associated with erectile dysfunction (ED), the demographic and ED characteristics of the population of men with ED are quite diverse. We examined results from randomized trials of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) to ascertain if efficacy differed across various subgroups of men with ED. In addition, we reviewed findings from long-term extension studies and published accounts of sildenafil use in clinical practice to determine if effectiveness is maintained with long-term sildenafil treatment and to determine if effectiveness in the clinic practice setting is consistent with that reported in clinical trials. Data were pooled from 11 double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose (taken as needed) studies to assess efficacy (N = 2667) of sildenafil in men (aged 23 to 89 years) with ED of broad-spectrum etiology who were not receiving concomitant nitrate therapy. Efficacy evaluations included the International Index of Erectile Function, a global efficacy question ("Did treatment improve your erections?"), and a patient-recorded event log of sexual activity. Significantly improved erectile function was demonstrated for sildenafil compared with placebo for all efficacy parameters analyzed (P < 0.02 to 0.0001), regardless of patient age, race, body mass index, ED etiology, ED severity, ED duration, or the presence of various comorbidities. Long-term effectiveness was assessed in 3 open-label extension studies. Of those who continued long-term therapy (1 to 3 years) with sildenafil, > 95% of patients reported that they were satisfied with the effect of treatment on their erections, and that treatment had improved their ability to engage in sexual activity. Findings from published accounts of sildenafil use in the clinical practice setting further demonstrated that sildenafil is an effective treatment for a wide range of patients with ED.

### Efficacy and safety of sildenafil by age in men with erectile dysfunction [^113FQQ8C]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sildenafil, an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, has been extensively investigated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in randomized controlled trials.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and safety of sildenafil vs placebo according to age subgroups (< 65, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years) in 11,364 men with erectile dysfunction using pooled data from 48 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose trials.

Methods

Most trials had a 12-week treatment duration. The starting sildenafil dose was 50 mg, taken 1 hour before sexual activity, with subsequent adjustment to 100 or 25 mg based on efficacy and safety. Men taking nitrate therapy or nitric oxide donors and men with severe cardiac failure, unstable angina, or recent stroke or myocardial infarction were excluded. Efficacy analyses included all subjects with baseline and at least one postrandomization evaluation. Safety analyses included subjects who received study medication.

Main Outcome Measures

The International Index of Erectile Function and a global assessment question ("Did the treatment improve your erections?").

Results

Mean International Index of Erectile Function scores for question 3 (frequency of penetration), question 4 (maintenance of erections after penetration), and the erectile function domain were statistically significantly improved with sildenafil vs placebo for each age subgroup; orgasmic function, intercourse satisfaction, sexual desire, and overall satisfaction domain scores also were statistically significantly improved with sildenafil vs placebo. The percentage of men reporting improved erections on the global assessment question was statistically significantly higher with sildenafil vs placebo for all age subgroups; the percentage with sildenafil tended to decrease with increasing age (< 65 years, 80%; 65–74 years, 69%; ≥ 75 years, 59%). The most common adverse events with sildenafil were headache and flushing in each age subgroup.

Conclusion

Sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for erectile dysfunction regardless of patient age, including men at least 75 years old.

### Sildenafil misuse for its psychoactive properties? A case report [^114rPQxj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sildenafil is a widely used drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in a dosage ranging from 50 to 100mg per day. Recreational use is reported among youth for its sexual function enhancing effects. To date, however, no study has reported the use of sildenafil for its nonsexual, psychoactive effects. We report a case of a 38-year-old male with opioid and sedative use disorder who self-administered sildenafil orally in a dose of up to 2000mg per day for its psychoactive effects (primarily) for 10 years before seeking treatment and discuss the literature relevant to the case.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors in male sexual dysfunction [^115NnRDP]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors are preferred by most men for the oral treatment of erectile dysfunction. In many guidelines, this therapy is recommended as first-line therapy because of convenience, high efficacy, and low rates of side-effects. Sildenafil was the first drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, introduced in 1998. There are now two new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and tadalafil, for which approval was recently given in the European Union and is expected this year in the United States.

Recent Findings

Sildenafil has proved to be a very effective medicinal product. According to initial studies, vardenafil and tadalafil have demonstrated efficacy comparable to that of sildenafil. However, fewer data are available evaluating the adverse effects of vardenafil and tadalafil, particularly on their long-term use and their use in high-risk groups. Interestingly, vardenafil and tadalafil have a higher potency than sildenafil. Moreover, the long life of tadalafil has been associated with an erectogenic potential of the drug lasting for more than 24 h. The advantage of this is the possibility of a patient engaging in sexual activity more than once after a single administration of the drug.

Summary

In the future, in addition to sildenafil, the new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors vardenafil and tadalafil will play an important role in the management of erectile dysfunction, depending on the patient's health profile.

### Sildenafil (Sildenafil citrate) [^1176gUgT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy young volunteers (18 to 45 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of sildenafil citrate, 18% were 65 years and older, while 2% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger (< 65 years of age) subjects.

However, since higher plasma levels may increase the incidence of adverse reactions, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in older subjects due to the higher systemic exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is required for mild (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr = 30 to 49 mL/min) renal impairment. In volunteers with severe renal impairment (Clcr < 30 mL/min), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (~2 fold), approximately doubling of Cmaxand AUC. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (47% for Cmaxand 85% for AUC). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of REVATIO have been established in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years old, for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group I) to improve exercise ability and, in patients too young to perform standard exercising testing, pulmonary hemodynamics thought to underlie improvements in exercise. Use of REVATIO for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional PK and safety data in pediatric patients aged 1 year and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety and effectiveness of REVATIO have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age.

During the conduct of the pediatric studies (STARTS-1 and STARTS-2) [see Clinical Studies (14)], an imbalance in the number of deaths was noted: 5/55 (9.1%), 10/74 (13.5%), and 22/100 (22%) in the sildenafil low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. The causes of death were related to the progression of PAH. This safety observation in pediatrics was not confirmed in a study conducted in adults designed to evaluate this risk (Study A1481324). Given the beneficial effects on clinical worsening and death observed in adults with increasing doses (Study A1481324) and the expected similarity of disease in pediatrics and adults, a causal association for the observed dose-related effect on mortality in pediatric patients is unlikely, and therefore, the available data support dosing in pediatric patients > 45 kg up to a maximum of 40 mg three times a day.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of REVATIO did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment is required. Severe impairment has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is required (including severe impairment CLcr < 30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In the open label extension, the first pivotal portion involved a forced masked upward titration (figure). The participants originally randomised to receive placebo or sildenafil 20 or 40 mg in the double masked study received a starting dose of sildenafil 40 mg three times daily during the first six weeks, after which the dose was increased to 80 mg three times daily. Those randomised to 80 mg sildenafil three times daily in the double masked study remained on this dose for the first six weeks of the extension and had a sham dose escalation. One down-titration was permitted for tolerability during the first 12 weeks of the extension study. The open label extension study was unmasked after the last participant had completed at least three months of extension treatment. After unmasking, sildenafil was titrated according to clinical need as determined by the investigator and the participant to a maximum of 80 mg three times daily or to a minimum of 20 mg three times daily. Participants were to continue taking their optimised dose of sildenafil until the last enrolled patient had completed three years of treatment or until sildenafil was shown to be ineffective, poorly tolerated, or unsafe in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Is the sildenafil product information adequate to facilitate informed therapeutic decisions? [^1134nrw6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal therapeutics and the prevention of adverse drug effects begin with complete information. When new drugs are released, the manufacturer's product information is the main and often only readily available source of drug information and, therefore, greatly influences treatment strategies. Thus, it is vital that the information in the package insert is not only complete, but also as relevant as possible for the great diversity of patients that physicians encounter.

Objective

To review the product information for sildenafil for comprehensiveness and accuracy, with respect to whether the information is sufficient to facilitate optimal therapeutics and to prevent avoidable adverse events in the wide diversity of patients with erectile dysfunction seen in clinical practice.

Data Sources

Sildenafil package inserts, unpublished information provided by the manufacturer, Food and Drug Administration reports, and articles retrieved through MEDLINE through March 2000.

Data Synthesis

Deficiencies or inaccuracies persist in the sildenafil product information regarding sildenafil's effects on blood pressure; potential drug interactions with cimetidine, protease inhibitors, some antihypertensive drugs, alcohol, and drugs that may competitively inhibit cytochrome P450 pathways; and recommended sildenafil doses for older patients.

Conclusions

For physicians to practice optimal therapeutics, adequate, clinically relevant drug information is required. Several brief changes and additions in the sildenafil product information would assist physicians in making therapeutic decisions regarding the use of sildenafil in a very diverse patient population and in avoiding preventable adverse events.

### Microvascular complications in diabetic erectile dysfunction: do we need other alternatives? [^115xwiW9]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The unique mechanism of action and high efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors has generated immense interest among researchers dealing with sexual dysfunction. From the launch of sildenafil, which occurred > 10 years ago, a new focus for basic and clinical research had emerged regarding the safety profile and effect on other organs (vascular, pulmonary, and urinary system) of PDE5 inhibitors because of their potential to treat other chronic diseases. Moreover, use of PDE5 inhibitors, which have been established as an efficacious and safe class of drugs when prescribed to most men with ED, restored sexual function to normal. One of the major breakthroughs recently achieved is probably the accumulating evidence that chronically administered PDE5 inhibitors can improve endothelial and sexual function. Daily treatment with PDE5 inhibitors is now the preferred method of treatment in several groups of men with ED due to radical prostatectomy and with severe endothelial and vascular dysfunction such as diabetes. This treatment regimen has also been shown to benefit younger men, in whom this new treatment approach is able to restore their sexual habits to normal, thereby removing the stigma of having a disease. Nevertheless, lack of knowledge regarding detailed mechanisms, safety and tolerability concerns, and costs may prevent a broad application of this regimen.

Conclusion

Our study provides no evidence of any association between the sildenafil use in men with ED and the risk of developing AMD. Our study design, which used real-world data, makes it the first of the pharmacoepidemiological studies to assess such an association. The lack of a significant association between sildenafil use and AMD in our study suggests that sildenafil is unlikely to have a clinically meaningful preventive effect on AMD. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the potential effects of commonly prescribed medications on the development of AMD.

Results

Population and exposure

In both trials, each treatment group comprised ∼100 men, most of whom had ED that was of organic or mixed etiology and that was mild to moderate in severity (Table 1).

At week 2, 88% (92/104) of patients randomized to flexible-dose sildenafil and 92% (97/105) randomized to flexible-dose placebo increased their dose from 50 mg to 100 mg; at the end of the DBPC treatment, 87% (90/104) and 92% (97/105), respectively, remained on the higher dose. During the DBPC phase of each trial, patients in each treatment group received an average of seven or eight doses per month. Across both trials, only one man discontinued sildenafil (flexible dose) because of lack of efficacy and only two men discontinued sildenafil because of treatment-related AEs: moderate dyspepsia (100-mg fixed dose) and moderate headache (100-mg flexible dose).

### A baseline-controlled, open-label, flexible dose-escalation study to assess the safety and efficacy of sildenafil citrate (viagra) in patients with erectile dysfunction [^116tcCiQ]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Although sildenafil citrate (Viagra) has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), the dosing regimens often used in clinical trials may not always match those employed in clinical practice. This study was undertaken to further assess the efficacy and safety of sildenafil taken as required in male outpatients 18 years of age and older with ED (n = 71). It was conducted as a placebo-baseline-controlled, open-label, flexible dose-escalation study, with sildenafil (25,50, or 100 mg) administered for 8 weeks following a 4-week placebo run-in. Efficacy variables included questions 3 and 4 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), other IIEF domains, patient event logs, and quality-of-life (QOL) assessments. Treatment with sildenafil resulted in improvements from baseline in all IIEF domains analyzed (all P < 0.0001), as well as overall QOL and amelioration of specific sexual and social relationships (all P& < 0.0001). Sildenafil was well tolerated. One participant discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Results suggest that flexible dosing with oral sildenafil is safe and has beneficial effects on all indices of erectile function and QOL.

### Novel phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors: assessing hemodynamic effects and safety parameters [^1138h5D7]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The relaxing effect of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors on vascular smooth muscle has attracted much attention, especially in persons with cardiovascular disease. The results of early studies showed that sildenafil slightly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressures and has no effect on heart rate, while being safe and well tolerated. Studies also indicate that sildenafil does not contribute to the development of myocardial infarction or ischemia. Similar benign effects on hemodynamics and cardiac events have also been demonstrated for tadalafil and vardenafil. None of the PDE5 inhibitors adversely affects total exercise time or time to ischemia during exercise testing in men with stable angina. It is key to avoid concomitant administration of nitrates with any of the PDE5 inhibitors, because this combination can cause increased vasodilation and a subsequent drop in blood pressure. Sildenafil has an alpha-blocker precaution; tadalafil is contraindicated with alpha blockers except for 0.4 mg tamsulosin; vardenafil is contraindicated with alpha blockers.

### Efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate in men with erectile dysfunction and stable coronary artery disease [^112Qsamm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study of the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) and clinically stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients were randomized to receive sildenafil or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were questions 3 and 4 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Secondary outcomes included the other IIEF questions and functional domains, the Life Satisfaction Checklist, the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction, 2 global efficacy assessment questions, and intercourse success rate. By week 12, sildenafil-treated patients (n = 70) showed significant improvements on questions 3 and 4 compared with placebo-treated patients (n = 72; p < 0.01). Larger percentages of sildenafil-treated patients reported improved erections (64%) and improved intercourse (65%) compared with placebo-treated patients (21% and 19%, respectively). Sildenafil-treated patients were highly satisfied with treatment and their sexual life compared with placebo-treated patients. Forty-seven percent of sildenafil- and 32% of placebo-treated patients experienced adverse events, including transient headache, hypertension, flushing, and dyspepsia. There were no serious drug-related cardiovascular effects. Thus, sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED in men with CAD. Sildenafil was not associated with additional safety risks in this patient population.

Adverse events

The overall number of AEs and numbers of patients reporting AEs were similar between treatment groups in the double-blind and open-label portions of the study; treatment-related AEs (number of AEs and patients reporting AEs) increased with increasing dose (Table 5). Sildenafil was generally well tolerated, with most AEs being mild or moderate in severity. Dyspnea was the most common AE reported in both phases of the study; headache was the most common treatment-related AE (Table 5). No patients discontinued as a result of abnormal laboratory test results, and there was no evidence of dose-related increase in laboratory test abnormalities with increasing sildenafil dose.

### Cardiovascular safety of sildenafil citrate (viagra): an updated perspective [^113CyeaR]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) relaxes vascular smooth muscle, resulting in modest reductions in blood pressure that are insufficient to stimulate a reflex increase in heart rate. These blood pressure reductions are similar for healthy men and men with coronary artery disease (CAD) or who use antihypertensive drugs. Sildenafil does not affect the force of cardiac contraction, and cardiac performance is unaffected. Sildenafil is mildly vasodilating in the coronary circulation and does not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. During exercise and recovery, sildenafil does not cause clinically significant alterations in hemodynamic parameters in men with CAD, and it has no negative effects on coronary oxygen consumption, ischemia, or exercise capacity. Clinical trial data from > 13,000 patients, 7 years of international postmarketing data, and observational studies of > 28,000 men in the United Kingdom and 3813 men in the European Union reveal that (1) there are no special cardiovascular concerns when sildenafil is used in accordance with product labeling and (2) the risk for serious events such as myocardial infarction or death is not increased. However, because safety has not been established in patients with recent serious cardiovascular events, hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, or retinitis pigmentosa, physicians should consult their current local prescribing information before prescribing sildenafil for these patients. Among men with erectile dysfunction treated with sildenafil, the adverse event profile is similar overall to that in men with comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is similar between those with and without CAD, and it is similar between those who take and those who do not take antihypertensive drugs (regardless of the number or class). In a controlled interaction study of sildenafil and amlodipine, the mean additional reduction in supine blood pressure was 8 mm Hg systolic and 7 mm Hg diastolic. Sildenafil should be used with caution in patients who take alpha-blockers because coadministration may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some individuals. When sildenafil is coadministered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy before initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Also, in the absence of information specific to mixed alpha/beta blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, similar care should be taken as for alpha-blockers. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, is contraindicated. Before prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying CVD could be affected adversely by resuming sexual activity. Management recommendations based on cardiovascular risk, from the Second Princeton Consensus Conference, are presented.

### Sildenafil citrate (revatio) [^11121TpE]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sildenafil citrate IV (also known as Viagra):
- Cardiovascular events: use caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia, resting hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, HF, unstable angina, or LV outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.
- Exacerbation of hypotension: use caution in patients with resting hypotension, fluid depletion, severe LV outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant use of antihypertensives or α-blockers.
- Hearing loss: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden hearing loss, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.
- Increased serum sildenafil levels: use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
- Priapism: use caution in patients with anatomic penile abnormalities, such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease, or conditions predisposing to priapism, such as sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or leukemia.
- Vision loss, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden vision loss.

### Minimal time to successful intercourse after sildenafil citrate: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111ezzMs]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the minimal time to successful intercourse after taking sildenafil citrate for erectile dysfunction (ED).

Methods

Male patients with ED (mean age 60 years; mean ED duration 7.0 years) who were successfully treated with sildenafil (100 mg) for 2 months or longer were randomized to sildenafil (n = 115) or placebo (n = 113) for 4 weeks of double-blind treatment. Using a stopwatch, patients recorded the time needed to obtain an erection hard enough for sexual intercourse after taking the study drug at least 2 hours after eating.

Results

Within 14 and 20 minutes of sildenafil dosing, 35% and 51% of sildenafil-treated patients, respectively, versus 22% and 30% of placebo-treated patients, respectively, had an erection that led to successful intercourse (P < 0.05 for both). The median time to erection leading to successful intercourse after sildenafil dosing was 36 minutes compared with 141 minutes for placebo.

Conclusions

In this study, slightly more than one half of a population of prior sildenafil responders achieved an erection that led to successful sexual intercourse within 20 minutes of sildenafil administration, suggesting that the onset of action of sildenafil can be less than 30 minutes in men with ED.

### Pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113gVDok]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — Sildenafil added to stable IV epoprostenol was tested in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial over 16 weeks in patients on epoprostenol generally between 10 ng/kg/min and 50 ng/kg/min; the trial included 267 patients, most with WHO FC II (25%) or III (65%) symptoms and a 6MWD of 100 to 450 m, with sildenafil started at 20 mg by mouth every 8 h and often titrated up to 80 mg every 8 h over 8 weeks with transient epoprostenol adjustments of 1 to 2 ng/kg/min every 1 to 2 weeks, yielding an adjusted treatment difference in 6MWD of +28.8 m (95% CI, 13.9–43.8 m) compared with placebo, more headaches and dyspepsia, and apparently greater benefit when pretreatment 6MWD was > 325 m.

### The second princeton consensus on sexual dysfunction and cardiac risk: new guidelines for sexual medicine [^111PZkra]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a highly prevalent disorder associated with a significant burden of illness. The prevalence and incidence of ED are strongly age-related, affecting more than half of men > 60 years. The first Princeton Consensus Conference (Princeton I) in 1999 developed guidelines for safe management of cardiac patients regarding sexual activity and the treatment of ED.

Aim

The second conference (Princeton II) was convened to update the recommendations based on the expanding knowledge base and new treatments available. This article reviews and expands on the Princeton II guidelines to address sexual dysfunction and cardiac risk.

Methods

A consensus panel of experts reviewed recent multinational studies in safety and drug interaction data for three phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), with emphasis on the safety of these agents in men with ED and concomitant cardiovascular disease.

Results

Erectile dysfunction is an early symptom or harbinger of cardiovascular disease, due to the common risk factors and pathophysiology mediated through endothelial dysfunction. Major comorbidities include diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and heart disease. Any asymptomatic man who presents with ED that does not have an obvious cause (e.g., trauma) should be screened for vascular disease and have blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure measurements. Ideally, all patients at risk but asymptomatic for coronary disease should undergo an elective exercise electrocardiogram to facilitate risk stratification. Lifestyle intervention in ED, specifically weight loss and increased physical activity, particularly in patients with ED and concomitant cardiovascular disease, is literature-supported.

Conclusions

The recognition of ED as a warning sign of silent vascular disease has led to the concept that a man with ED and no cardiac symptoms is a cardiac (or vascular) patient until proven otherwise. Men with ED and other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., obesity, sedentary lifestyle) should be counseled in lifestyle modification.

### PDE5 inhibitors beyond erectile dysfunction [^113ZWke9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

The phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5) inhibitors sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil are widely used first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED). Since the advent of sildenafil in 1998, more than 40 million men worldwide have been successfully treated with these compounds. The safety and high tolerability of PDE5 inhibitors make them an attractive tool to investigate further physiological functions of PDE5, for example the modulation of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) pools. As cGMP is a key component of intracellular signaling this may provide novel therapeutic opportunities beyond ED even for indications in which chronic administration is necessary. The approval of sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in 2005 was a notable success in this area of research. A number of other potential new indications are currently in various phases of preclinical research and development. In recent years, extensive but very heterogeneous information has been published in this field. The aim of this review is to summarize existing preclinical and clinical knowledge and critically discuss the evidence to support potential future indications for PDE5 inhibitors.

### Sildenafil citrate (viagra) treatment for erectile dysfunction: an updated profile of response and effectiveness [^116VNETx]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2006). Low credibility.

In the 7 years since sildenafil citrate (VIAGRA) was introduced as the first oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor therapy for erectile dysfunction, it has been used to treat nearly 27 million men with erectile dysfunction worldwide. Patient populations with erectile dysfunction of varying etiologies and with diverse comorbidities have benefited from sildenafil treatment. This update focuses on relatively recent research that further defines the response and effectiveness profiles of sildenafil and provides additional insight into optimizing treatment. In addition to providing recent data on sildenafil efficacy and safety/tolerability, the update provides data on assessments of erection hardness, measures of psychosocial outcomes (e.g., emotional well-being and treatment satisfaction), and treatment approaches to maximize response and effectiveness (e.g., by titrating to the maximum tolerated dose). Increased understanding of the sildenafil response and effectiveness profiles and optimal sildenafil treatment are central to the appropriate management of erectile dysfunction using sildenafil.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 3 years in patients > 20 kg in weight at baseline were 94%, 93%, and 85% in the low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively; for patients ≤ 20 kg in weight at baseline, the survival estimates were 94% and 93% for patients in the medium and high dose groups, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Study A1481324 (NCT02060487) - Study to Assess the Effects of REVATIO on Mortality in Adults with PAH

A study to assess the effects of multiple doses of sildenafil on mortality in adults with PAH was conducted following the observation of a higher risk of mortality in pediatric patients taking a high dose of REVATIO TID, based on body weight, compared to those taking a lower dose of REVATIO in the long-term extension of the pediatric clinical trial.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in 385 adults with PAH. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups (5, 20, and 80 mg TID). Most patients were PAH treatment naïve (83%). For most patients the etiology of PAH was idiopathic (72%). The most common WHO Functional Class was Class III (58% of patients). Treatment groups were well balanced with respect to baseline demographics of strata history of PAH treatment and etiology of PAH, as well as the WHO Functional Class categories.

### Safety and efficacy of transition from subcutaneous treprostinil to oral sildenafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116bP7db]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Sildenafil is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), and has been shown to improve 6-minute walk distance (SMWD) and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) and PAH associated with connective tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts. Despite the efficacy of sildenafil in patients on conventional therapy with diuretics and anti-coagulants, little is known of the safety and efficacy of transitioning patients already established on parenteral prostanoid therapy to sildenafil.

Methods

We studied 14 patients on long-term subcutaneous treprostinil for PAH (from a cohort of 51 patients [27%]), who wished to discontinue treatment because of injection-site pain. The etiology of their PAH included iPAH (7 of 14), PAH secondary to scleroderma (2 of 14), thromboembolic disease (3 of 14) and PAH post-surgical correction of ventricular septal defect (2 of 14). Treprostinil was gradually weaned and all patients were started open-label with 50 mg sildenafil four times per day for 3 months. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, SMWD, echocardiogram and quality-of-life (QOL) measures were determined at baseline and after 3 months of therapy with sildenafil.

Results

Of 14 patients, 4 discontinued the transition because of deterioration during treprostinil withdrawal, despite the introduction of sildenafil. Replacement of chronic subcutaneous treprostinil with sildenafil was possible in 10 of 14 patients (71%), who demonstrated stable NYHA class (mean ± SD: 3.1 ± 0.3 at baseline to 2.6 ± 0.8 at 3 months, p = 0.138), stable SMWD (434 ± 83 m at baseline, 451 ± 72 at 3 months, p = 0.23) and significantly improved QOL measures at 3 months.

Conclusions

The transition from subcutaneous treprostinil to sildenafil was safely achieved in most (71%), but not all, patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension of varied etiology. These patients had an improvement in both NYHA functional class and QOL, and maintained stable walk distances over a 3-month period on sildenafil therapy.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In clinical studies, sildenafil tablets was assessed for its effect on the ability of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) to engage in sexual activity and in many cases specifically on the ability to achieve and maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity. Sildenafil tablets were evaluated primarily at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in 21 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months in duration, using a variety of study designs (fixed dose, titration, parallel, crossover). Sildenafil tablets were administered to more than 3,000 patients aged 19 to 87 years, with ED of various etiologies (organic, psychogenic, mixed) with a mean duration of 5 years. Sildenafil tablets demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in all 21 studies. The studies that established benefit demonstrated improvements in success rates for sexual intercourse compared with placebo.

Efficacy Endpoints in Controlled Clinical Studies

The effectiveness of sildenafil tablets were evaluated in most studies using several assessment instruments. The primary measure in the principal studies was a sexual function questionnaire (the International Index of Erectile Function -IIEF) administered

during a 4-week treatment-free run-in period, at baseline, at follow-up visits, and at the end of double-blind, placebo-controlled, at-home treatment. Two of the questions from the IIEF served as primary study endpoints; categorical responses were elicited to questions about (1) the ability to achieve erections sufficient for sexual intercourse and (2) the maintenance of erections after penetration. The patient addressed both questions at the final visit for the last 4 weeks of the study. The possible categorical responses to these questions were (0) no attempted intercourse, (1) never or almost never, (2) a few times, (3) sometimes, (4) most times, and (5) almost always or always. Also collected as part of the IIEF was information about other aspects of sexual function, including information on erectile function, orgasm, desire, satisfaction with intercourse, and overall sexual satisfaction. Sexual function data were also recorded by patients in a daily diary. In addition, patients were asked a global efficacy question and an optional partner questionnaire was administered.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors.

Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular

Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of sildenafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of sildenafil and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy young volunteers (18–45 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of sildenafil, 18% were 65 years and older, while 2% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger (< 65 years of age) subjects.

However, since higher plasma levels may increase the incidence of adverse reactions, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in older subjects due to the higher systemic exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is required for mild (CLcr = 50–80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr = 30–49 mL/min) renal impairment. In volunteers with severe renal impairment (Clcr < 30 mL/min), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (~2 fold), approximately doubling of Cmaxand AUC. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (47% for Cmaxand 85% for AUC). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A 4-year update on the safety of sildenafil citrate (viagra) [^115qjgFr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for erectile dysfunction. Despite its established safety profile, concern about its cardiovascular safety persists among some physicians and the general public. This concern has stemmed primarily from sporadic reports of adverse events published in the literature and sensationalized by the media. However, the only absolute contraindication for sildenafil is concurrent use of nitrates. Because sildenafil has been on the market for 4 years and under clinical investigation for even longer, we can now evaluate its long-term safety in men who have been taking the drug for several years. We review this issue from 3 perspectives. First, we reassess the overall safety profile of sildenafil by reviewing the initial controlled clinical trials and open-label studies. We present new data from patients who have been exposed to sildenafil for up to 4.5 years. We also evaluate the results from independent postmarketing studies. Second, we review the cardiovascular-specific results from the clinical trials, long-term extension, and postmarketing studies. Lastly, we review the specific effects on the visual system based on findings from studies conducted during drug development and post marketing.

5.1 Cardiovascular

There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil citrate, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.

Sildenafil citrate has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing sildenafil citrate, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.

Use with caution in patients with the following underlying conditions which can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including sildenafil citrate – those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.

There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil citrate in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.

Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;
Patients with resting hypotension (BP < 90/50 mmHg) or hypertension (BP > 170/110 mmHg);
Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina.

5.2 Prolonged Erection and Priapism

Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of sildenafil tablets. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result.

Sildenafil citrate should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). However, there are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil citrate in patients with sickle cell or related anemias.

Background

We present here the case of a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension and NYHA Class II symptoms who transitioned from PDE-5i therapy to riociguat. No protocol currently exists for transitioning between these PAH medications.

Case presentation

A 59-year old male with a history of anorexigen use initially presented in 2008 and was felt to have non-operable small vessel disease. His care was transitioned to our center after insurance would not cover high-dose sildenafil in addition to ERA therapy.

Conclusion

This case demonstrates a safe and successful transition from higher dose PDE-5is to riociguat with no interruption in therapy.

### Do vardenafil and tadalafil have advantages over sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction? [^112GTZFH]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2006). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects up to 50% of men between the ages of 40 and 70 years of age. Sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil have all been shown to be similarly effective in the treatment of men with ED of vary etiologies, to have similar adverse effects profiles, and to improve quality-of-life by similar amounts. As these phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors all increase the hypotensive effects of nitrates, they are not suitable for use in patients taking nitrates for the treatment of ischaemic heart disease. All three inhibitors must be used with caution in patients taking alpha(1)-adrenoceptors antagonists for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although nonarteritic anterior ischaemic neuropathy has been reported in some users of the PDE5 inhibitors, there is no conclusive evidence that PDE5 inhibitors cause this rare effect. Tadalafil has a longer half-life than sildenafil or vardenafil, and a longer duration of action than sildenafil and vardenafil. Most preference studies have shown tadalafil to be preferred, but there are serious limitations to some of these studies. One approach to treatment is to give each patient a short- and long-acting agent, and for individuals to decide their preference.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) safety and counseling — men taking nitrates regularly should not use PDE5i medications, and in men with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment or men with spinal cord injury, PDE5i should be used with caution at least initially at lower doses; in men with severe renal or liver disease, use of PDE5i is generally not recommended. Given that incorrect use of PDE5i accounts for a large percentage of treatment failures, men should be carefully instructed in appropriate use, including that sexual stimulation is necessary and that more than one trial may be required, and initial doses may be titrated up or down until the optimal dose is identified.

### Efficacy of 1, 5, and 20 mg oral sildenafil in the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized, double-blind study with open-label extension [^111MPAvd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, results from the open-label phase suggest the possibility of further improvement in 6MWD after the first 3 months of therapy with sildenafil 20 mg TID. The mean increase in 6MWD from baseline at the end of the double-blind phase (41 m) was maintained in the sildenafil 5-mg group uptitrated to sildenafil 20 mg TID in the extension study (50 m), yet larger increases were observed from the end of the double-blind study to the end of the open-label study in the sildenafil 1- and 20-mg groups (from 14–47 m and from 38–70 m, respectively). Thus, sildenafil 20 mg TID maintains treatment effects regardless of prior low-dose treatment. However, 6MWD did not increase to the same degree in patients previously treated with lower doses as in patients who continuously received 20 mg TID, suggesting that a longer duration of an adequate dose may confer a larger improvement in 6MWD. Interestingly, the total improvement observed after 24 weeks in the 20-mg group (70 m) was larger than in the SUPER-1 study at 12 weeks (48 m) or 1 year (51 m) for all sildenafil doses combined. It may be possible that in a population of young and mainly incident cases, as in our study, further improvements in 6MWD may be observed with continued sildenafil treatment.

There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.

Sildenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.

Use with caution in patients with the following underlying conditions which can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including sildenafil - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.

There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution.

Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months;
Patients with resting hypotension (BP < 90/50 mmHg) or hypertension (BP > 170/110 mmHg);
Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina.

5.2 Prolonged Erection and Priapism

Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of sildenafil tablets. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result.

Sildenafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). However, there are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil in patients with sickle cell or related anemias.

### Sildenafil citrate (revatio) [^113797Pt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to compare sildenafil 80 mg TID versus 5 mg TID for mortality, with success defined by ruling out twice the mortality at 80 mg.

The key secondary efficacy endpoint was time to first event of clinical worsening, defined as a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for worsening PAH or disease progression. An additional secondary endpoint was 6MWD at Months 6 and 12.

Overall Survival

At the time of a planned interim analysis (50% deaths) it was identified that the primary efficacy objective of this protocol was met and therefore the study was stopped. Based on the primary efficacy endpoint (mortality), the non-inferiority of sildenafil 80 mg TID arm versus 5 mg TID arm was met using a 2-sided significance level of 0.003 for the interim analysis. Primary comparison of the 80 mg TID group to the 5 mg TID group yielded the HR (99.7% CI) = 0.51 (0.22, 1.21); i.e., non-inferiority was established.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 3 years were 66%, 79%, and 85% in the 5-, 20-, and 80-mg TID dose groups, respectively.

Clinical Worsening

Sildenafil 80 mg was also superior to 5 mg for time to first event of clinical worsening with HR (99.7% CI) = 0.44 (0.22, 0.89).

6MWD at Months 6 and 12

At baseline, the median of 6MWD for the intent‑to‑treat (ITT) population was 332 to 352 m. At Month 6, the median change from baseline was highest for sildenafil 80 mg TID with 28 m compared to 18 m and 19 m for sildenafil 5 mg TID and sildenafil 20 mg TID groups, respectively. The same was seen at Month 12, the median change from baseline for sildenafil 80 mg TID group was 33 m compared to 17 m for sildenafil 5 mg TID and 31 m in sildenafil 20 mg TID groups.

Overall, the safety data for sildenafil 20 mg TID and for the higher sildenafil 80 mg TID dose were consistent with the established safety profile of sildenafil in previous adult PAH studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Figure 1 shows the literature search process in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and SCOPUS (March 2012 to December 2013 and updated in May 2014). We identified 9,168 studies as potentially relevant. Of these, 8,727 were excluded based on title and abstract content and 417/441 were excluded after full text analysis due to: non-English language, non-human studies, not RCTs, no outcome of interest, PDE5i co-administered with other drugs. RCTs with PDE5i given on demand or for less than 30 consecutive days were excluded. A total of 24 RCTs were eligible and included in the review (18 administering sildenafil, 4 tadalafil and 2 vardenafil).

### Use of sildenafil is safe in men with congestive heart failure… [^112X9dDF]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Webster et al1 found that the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate can be safely used in the treatment of ED in men with NYHA classes II and III heart failure. The study by Webster and colleagues1 may include additional data of further clinical importance. It is generally recognized that the concomitant use of nitrates and PDE5 inhibitors is strictly contraindicated. Caution in using PDE5 inhibitors in patients receiving treatment with α-blockers has also been warranted, and combination therapy cannot be recommended. In the product summary of the most recent commercial available PDE5 inhibitor vardenafil hydrochloride, it is emphasized that clinical data addressing the safety of combination therapy with vardenafil and α-blockers are insufficient. Similar conclusions can most likely be drawn for therapy with sildenafil or tadalafil. Mickley H, Poulsen TS. Use of Sildenafil Is Safe in Men With Congestive Heart Failure.

Background

We present here the case of a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension and NYHA Class II symptoms who transitioned from PDE-5i therapy to riociguat. No protocol currently exists for transitioning between these PAH medications.

Case Presentation

A 59-year old male with a history of anorexigen use initially presented in 2008 and was felt to have non-operable small vessel disease. His care was transitioned to our center after insurance would not cover high-dose sildenafil in addition to ERA therapy.

Conclusion

This case demonstrates a safe and successful transition from higher dose PDE-5is to riociguat with no interruption in therapy.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^115Sb5cV]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction — Men with ED should be informed regarding the treatment option of an FDA-approved oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), including discussion of benefits and risks/burdens, unless contraindicated. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). When men are prescribed an oral PDE5i for the treatment of ED, instructions should be provided to maximize benefit/efficacy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For men who are prescribed PDE5i, the dose should be titrated to provide optimal efficacy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The FDA-approved oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) available for management of ED in the U.S. include sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil. PDE5i medications have been extensively studied, with nearly a quarter of a million men evaluated from the general ED population and approximately 25,000 men evaluated from various special populations; analyses and systematic reviews suggest that sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil have similar efficacy in the general ED population, dose-response effects across PDE5i are small and non-linear, and on-demand dosing versus daily dosing for tadalafil appears to produce the same level of efficacy; the data suggest that men with diabetes and men who are post-prostatectomy respond less robustly to PDE5i. The most frequently reported adverse events in men using PDE5i are dyspepsia, headache, flushing, back pain, nasal congestion, myalgia, visual disturbance, and dizziness; average rates are similar across medications with the exception of dyspepsia (lowest with avanafil), flushing (lowest with tadalafil), and myalgia (lowest with vardenafil and avanafil), and most AEs followed a dose-response pattern such that men who were randomized to active treatment reported statistically significantly higher rates of AEs than did men who were randomized to placebo.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) WHO FC II — initiation and dose-adjustment guidance for oral agents includes the following: "ETRAs and PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the approved doses". For sildenafil, "the US FDA approved dose… is 20 mg tid", and "titration of therapy up to 80 mg tid has been done in clinical trials". For inadequate response to sildenafil, "we recommend consideration of increasing the dose in 20-mg increments to a maximum of 80 mg tid, or adding another agent". For bosentan, "Treatment with bosentan > 125 mg bid is associated with greater incidence of transaminase elevation and is not recommended". For ambrisentan, "patients should be started at the 5-mg daily dose… and, if well tolerated and treatment goals have not been reached, the dose should be increased to 10 mg", based on "greater improvement in 6MWD" with "10 mg… than 5 mg". For riociguat, "The dose of riociguat requires dose titration", and due to hypotension risk with PDE5 inhibitors, "male patients treated with riociguat should also be cautioned not to use PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction".

### Cardiac safety in clinical trials of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors [^117GSwhc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Those safe and effective agents were originally developed for their cardiovascular effects and were incidentally found to enhance erections. Since the introduction of the first PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, in 1998, there has been concern about the effects of these agents on the heart and their safety in patients with cardiovascular disease. The concerns focused on the effects on blood pressure and heart rate, cardiac electrophysiology, and cardiovascular adverse events in clinical trials. Since there are currently three PDE5 inhibitors, attention has been given to class effects as well as unique individual safety and adverse events. Since these drugs are mild vasodilators, all three have blood pressure-lowering effects. These effects are usually mild and produce few symptoms. When combined with the nitric oxide donor nitroglycerine, however, blood pressure drops may be profound and life threatening. All three agents are contraindicated with nitrates. Cardiac electrophysiology effects, especially as manifested by changes in the QT interval, have been studied. None of the three agents are dangerously associated with QTc prolongation, although vardenafil has a warning for patients at risk for QTc prolongation. In evaluating cardiovascular adverse events in clinical trials, no signal to danger can be convincingly cited. Indeed, with the vasodilator effects of these drugs, many studies point to the improved exercise tolerance and coronary dilation in patients taking PDE5 inhibitors. PDE5 inhibitors are effective in treating ED, and their safety profile is excellent. There do not appear to be significant cardiovascular safety issues in the man with satisfactory cardiac and performance status.

### Erectile dysfunction in the elderly: epidemiology, etiology and approaches to treatment [^113wqp5W]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Erectile dysfunction is experienced at least some of the time by most men who have reached 45 years of age, and it is projected to affect 322 million men worldwide by 2025. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction is high in men of all ages and increases greatly in the elderly.

Materials and Methods

This paper reviews the epidemiology of erectile dysfunction with an emphasis on the experience of older men, normal age related changes in the structure and function of the penis that may contribute to increased risk with age, how the accumulation of risk factors with age may contribute to the high prevalence of the disease in older men, and established and emerging therapies. The normal aging process and age related risk factor accumulation contribute to the increased prevalence of erectile dysfunction in the elderly.

Results

Remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. At present inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5 with oral agents such as sildenafil would appear to be the initial treatment of choice. These drugs have been shown to be safe and effective, and sildenafil has demonstrated efficacy in patients with many of the comorbidities observed in older men with erectile dysfunction. New treatments, in particular transfection with genes for key mediators of erectile function that are known to be down-regulated in elderly men, also hold promise.

Conclusions

Further research into the neural, vascular and molecular mechanisms involved in penile erection will lead to the development of even safer, more effective and more convenient therapies for men with erectile dysfunction.

### Sildenafil: efficacy and safety in daily clinical experience [^112NysBF]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is a potent selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 proposed for the oral treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The aim of this study was to evaluate its efficacy and safety when used in daily practice in patients with ED of various aetiology.

Patients and Methods

From September 1998 to April 1999, 380 patients chose sildenafil as treatment for their ED. One hundred and forty-five (38%) of them suffered from psychogenic ED, 125 (33%) organic and 110 (29%) of mixed aetiology. The grade of erection achieved and the occurrence of satisfactory sexual intercourse assessed the efficacy. Safety and tolerance were evaluated recording any side effect or adverse event.

Results

The overall efficacy of Viagra was 77%, with a response of 100% among the group of hormonal patients, 88% for psychogenic, 72% for mixed, 69% for diabetes, 65% for vascular and 60% for neurological symptoms. A few and mild to moderate side effects were recorded.

Conclusion

These results indicate that the use of sildenafil citrate is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for men with ED of various aetiology with an overall success rate of 77%.

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors with antihypertensive medications — Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are described as a safe and effective therapy for erectile dysfunction that can be administered with antihypertensive medications; caution should be exercised when sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil are coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors or ingested with grapefruit juice or alcohol, which may increase the risk of hypotension, and these drugs should not be taken with nitrates due to the risk of severe hypotension.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy young volunteers (18–45 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of VIAGRA, 18% were 65 years and older, while 2% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger (< 65 years of age) subjects.

However, since higher plasma levels may increase the incidence of adverse reactions, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in older subjects due to the higher systemic exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is required for mild (CLcr = 50–80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr = 30–49 mL/min) renal impairment. In volunteers with severe renal impairment (Clcr < 30 mL/min), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (~2 fold), approximately doubling of Cmaxand AUC. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (47% for Cmaxand 85% for AUC). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Use of sildenafil for safe improvement of erectile function and quality of life in men with New York heart association classes II and III congestive heart failure… [^111rTtYJ]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background Erectile dysfunction is common in patients with congestive heart failure and is often associated with symptoms of depression. Although sildenafil citrate, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, is effective in treating ED, its use is considered a relative contraindication in CHF. We hypothesized that sildenafil is a safe and effective treatment for ED in patients with New York Heart Association classes II and III CHF and that treatment of ED will improve symptoms of depression and enhance perceived of quality of life. Conclusion Sildenafil is a safe and effective treatment for ED in men with New York Heart Association classes II and III CHF and provides relief of depressive symptoms, explaining an improvement in the perception of quality of life. We hypothesized that in patients with moderately severe CHF who undergo appropriate screening and selection, sildenafil is safe and effective.

To study safety, we used ambulatory blood pressure monitors and observed the patients for several hours after the intake of sildenafil. To study efficacy, we used the standard International Index for Erectile Function 18 to compare the effects of sildenafil vs placebo in patients with NYHA classes II and III CHF in a prospective crossover trial. The major finding of this study is that sildenafil is safe and effective in treating ED in men with moderate heart failure who undergo appropriate screening. There was also a remarkably clear beneficial effect of treating ED for symptoms of depression and quality of life in this CHF cohort. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the safety and efficacy of this commonly used drug in a population with moderately severe CHF.

The primary safety end point used to ensure that these patients could tolerate sildenafil, a weak vasodilator, was the absence of hypotension for 4 hours after a single ingestion of 50 mg of sildenafil citrate. Using an ambulatory recording system, we were able to measure blood pressure and heart rate at multiple points. We showed that at no point did the blood pressure drop more than 10% from baseline, although there was a small decrease at 60 minutes that was not associated with any symptoms. In conclusion, this study provides new evidence that it is safe and effective to treat men with ED and moderate heart failure with sildenafil. It is necessary to complete baseline safety measurements to ensure adequate physical fitness for sexual activity and absence of myocardial ischemia that would necessitate nitrate use. Sildenafil is a reasonable alternative to the invasive solutions of the past for many CHF patients with ED.

6.2 Post-marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil (marketed for both PAH and erectile dysfunction). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Cardiovascular Events

In postmarketing experience with sildenafil at doses indicated for erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages have been reported in temporal association with the use of the drug. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after use concurrent with sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these or other factors.

Objectives

To evaluate the orthostatic effects and safety of coadministration of silodosin with the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil.

Methods

In this placebo-controlled, open-label crossover study, 22 healthy men aged 45–78 years received 8 mg silodosin for 21 days. On days 7, 14, and 21, subjects also received a single dose of sildenafil 100 mg, tadalafil 20 mg, or placebo in random sequence. Orthostatic tests were performed before (baseline) and 1–12 hours after single-dose treatment. A positive orthostatic test was defined as decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 30 mm Hg, decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 20 mm Hg, increase in heart rate (HR) > 20 bpm, or presence of orthostatic symptoms. Treatment effects were compared by analysis of covariance.

Results

In comparison with placebo, sildenafil or tadalafil caused small but statistically significant reductions in blood pressure; however, no statistically significant orthostatic changes in SBP, DBP, or HR (P > .05) were caused. Time-matched maximum mean difference (95% confidence interval) vs placebo in 1-minute orthostatic change was -2.3 (-6.8–2.2) mm Hg for SBP, -2.2 (-5.6–1.2) mm Hg for DBP, and 1.7 (-1.5–4.9) bpm for HR. The number of postdose positive orthostatic tests was similar for all treatments (sildenafil, 57; tadalafil, 59; placebo, 53). Adverse events (in 7 subjects) were mild (26) or moderate (2). No orthostatic symptoms occurred.

Conclusions

Coadministration of silodosin and maximum therapeutic doses of sildenafil or tadalafil in healthy men caused no clinically important orthostatic changes in blood pressure or HR and no orthostatic symptoms.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^115YAcyU]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

At baseline, participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) to 20, 40, or 80 mg of sildenafil or placebo administered three times daily. Participants randomised to receive 80 mg initially received 40 mg for one week and then were titrated to 80 mg. All other participants had a sham titration. Study drug was added to the participant's baseline drug treatment regimen and administered for 12 weeks.

The study used an automated interactive voice response system incorporating a central randomisation and drug supply scheme. The randomisation scheme was stratified by baseline walking distance (< 325 m, ≥ 325 m) and cause (primary pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease, pulmonary hypertension with surgical repair). The interactive voice response system assigned numbers sequentially to the participants from the appropriate randomisation stratification group as they were determined to be eligible for treatment by the investigator. The drug supply scheme consisted of a list of pack numbers and corresponding treatment types. A unique pack number identified each drug pack. The interactive voice response system assigned participants a pack number from the list corresponding to the treatment assigned. At the start of the masked study, the study site was instructed on the method for unmasking, which was either a manual or an electronic process. Masking codes were broken only in emergency situations for reasons of participants' safety. The investigator was encouraged to contact the study sponsor before unmasking. When the code was broken, the reason was fully documented and entered on the study report form.

### Use of sildenafil as treatment for erectile dysfunction… [^113KJ1DW]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Sildenafil is the first oral drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of erectile dysfunction. Although other drugs have been on the market for some time, they have met with mixed success because of the need for injection or insertion into the urethra. Sildenafil enhances the physiologic response that causes penile erection after sexual arousal. It inhibits the enzyme conversion that produces the contraction of the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, allowing engorgement to be maintained. Other unpublished studies evaluated men with erectile dysfunction who took 25, 50 or 100 mg of sildenafil or placebo at home for up to six months. The drug did not affect the frequency of attempted intercourse. However, in four fixed-dose trials, improvement in erections was reported by 63 percent of the 214 men taking 25 mg of sildenafil, 74 percent of the 391 men taking 50 mg and 82 percent of the 380 men taking 100 mg of the drug.

Sildenafil lowers blood pressure slightly in normal patients and substantially in patients who are undergoing nitrate therapy for angina. The most common side effects are headache, flushing and dyspepsia. Transient abnormal vision, usually a color tinge or increased sensitivity to light, is uncommon and is usually dose-related. No incidence of priapism has been reported. Sildenafil should be used cautiously in patients taking cimetidine, erythromycin, rifampin and ketoconazole. Sildenafil is available in 25-, 50- and 100-mg tablets. The manufacturer recommends an initial dosage of 50 mg taken one hour before intercourse. Patients older than 65 years of age, those with hepatic or renal dysfunction and those who are taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor should start with a 25-mg dosage. Sildenafil should not be taken more than once a day. The cost to the pharmacist for 30 tablets of any size is about $263.

Medical Letter consultants conclude that sildenafil appears to be an effective oral drug for treatment of erectile dysfunction, although not all patients respond, and long-term safety has not been established. The hypotensive effects may be troublesome in some patients; persons using nitrates for treatment of angina should not take sildenafil.

### Is chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 cardioprotective and safe? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115wum9c]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Effect of PDE5i on hemodynamic parameters and endothelial function

No statistically significant chronotropic effect was found for PDE5i in the main analysis, except for the subgroup of patients with right heart disease [see Additional file 1: Figure S1], where PDE5i reduced HR, without heterogeneity (see Table 2 and Additional file 1 - Heterogeneity). For this group, the finding could be explained in terms of better oxygenation. The chronotropic effects of PDE5i have never been investigated, but a previous human study shows that sildenafil can blunt beta-adrenergic stimulation and the findings are also consistent with a general improvement in cardiac contractility. A reduction of just 5 bpm in patients with HF has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization, but drugs with a proven negative chronotropic effect, such as beta-blockers, produce HR reductions in the 8- to15-bpm range.

Regarding the effects of PDE5i on BP, our analysis shows that PDE5i given in a continuous regimen have no sustained effects on systemic BP, in a large group of disorders. This effect is confirmed by the absence of any relevant effect of PDE5i on SVRi in the main analysis. Our results confirm the findings described in men with anatomically severe coronary disease where the hypothesis of a coronary steal syndrome due to PDE5i-related vasodilation was excluded using cardiac catheterism, and are consistent with those of a smaller meta-analysis.

Analysis of the little data available on endothelial function seems to confirm a beneficial effect of continuous treatment with PDE5i, although the data were almost entirely derived from ED patients, the effects did not reach statistical significance in patients with left heart disease, and there was very high heterogeneity (I 2 = 99%, P < 0.001). Only the smallest of the four trials analyzed is within the 95% CIs, and no relevant improvement was obtained by subgroup or sensitivity analysis [see Additional file 1 - Heterogeneity], thus limiting the validity of the findings.

Adverse events

Our analysis of the side effects of long-term daily use of PDE5i showed that only flushing, headache, epistaxis and gastric symptoms are statistically related to these drugs, confirming their cardiovascular safety and good tolerability. This is relevant in case future studies are planned to test PDE5i for cardiovascular disorders. It is worth noting that the majority of retrieved studies were performed in aging subjects, supporting the safety profile of these drugs when administered as a daily or continuous regimen even in this age group.

Sildenafil is a drug used for male erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil's fatal cardiac effects except due to hypotension with simultaneous nitrate use have not been reported. We reported in this case a 70-year-old man admitted to the emergency service with chest pain, which occurs in an hour after sildenafil use. Electrocardiogram showed inferoposterior ST-segment elevation. In angiography, total circumflex artery occlusion has been seen.

### Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) [^112wvREf]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sildenafil citrate PO (also known as Viagra):
- Cardiovascular events: use caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia, resting hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, HF, unstable angina, or LV outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.
- Hearing loss: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden hearing loss, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.
- Hypotension: use caution in patients with resting hypotension, fluid depletion, severe LV outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant use of antihypertensives or α-blockers.
- Increased serum sildenafil levels: use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Reduce starting dose to 25 mg daily.
- Increased serum sildenafil levels: use caution in patients taking ritonavir. Maximum dose of 25 mg every 48 hours for erectile dysfunction.
- Priapism: use caution in patients with anatomic penile abnormalities, such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease, or conditions predisposing to priapism, such as sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or leukemia.
- Vision loss, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden vision loss.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114cmtLu]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We sought randomised trials of three PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), with placebo or active comparator, in men with erectile dysfunction of any causation. Previous systematic reviews were used to source trials or trial data, supplemented by electronic searches of PubMed (to June 2005) and the Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2005) using drug names and randomis(z)ed trial.

For inclusion a trial had to be randomised and double blind, use one of the three oral PDE-5 inhibitors in men with erectile dysfunction, be conducted in the home setting, last three weeks or longer, have a minimum of 10 men per group, and report useful information on efficacy or adverse events. Abstracts were read, and potentially useful reports retrieved in full paper copy. Decisions on inclusion or exclusion were made by consensus. No information was taken from posters or abstracts, and studies were read carefully to avoid including duplicate material. Studies were scored for reporting quality using a common method utilising reporting of randomisation, blinding and withdrawals. The maximum score possible was 5 points, and no study could be included with fewer than 2 points.

Information extracted from studies included the number of men studied, the cause of erectile dysfunction, and country where the study was performed. Any type of outcome was initially extracted from the studies, in continuous or dichotomous form, and with any dispersion information available. Outcomes could be reported in tables, in graphs, or in text. The following outcomes were sought particularly:

Efficacy

- Improved erections ("Has the treatment you have been taking over the past four weeks improved your erections?")

- Erections per week

- Successful attempts at sexual intercourse

- More than 60% or 75% successful

- More than 40% successful

- Final score or change from baseline on question 3 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) ("Over the past four weeks, when you attempted sexual intercourse, how often were you able to penetrate your partner?")

- Final score or change from baseline on question 4 of the IIEF ("Over the past four weeks, during sexual intercourse, how often were you able to maintain your erection after you had penetrated your partner?")

- Final score or change from baseline on the IIEF erectile function domain score

- Normal erectile function at end of study (IIEF total score of 22 or more out of 30)

Withdrawal

- All cause

- Lack of efficacy

- Adverse event

### Hardness, function, emotional well-being, satisfaction and the overall sexual experience in men using 100-mg fixed-dose or flexible-dose sildenafil citrate [^116VsLPm]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2010). Low credibility.

The prescribing information for sildenafil citrate (VIAGRA, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) recommends flexible dosing (50 mg initially, adjusted to 100 or 25 mg based on effectiveness and tolerability) in most men with erectile dysfunction (ED). In many men, however, 100 mg may be the most appropriate initial dose because it would reduce the need for titration and could prevent discouragement and treatment abandonment should 50 mg be insufficient. Results of two previously published double-blind, placebo-controlled sildenafil trials of similar design except for a fixed-dose vs flexible-dose regimen were analyzed. Relative to the flexible-dose, approximately one-third more men were satisfied with an initial and fixed dose of 100 mg. In addition, tolerability was similar, and improvements from baseline in outcomes on validated, ED-specific, patient-reported questionnaires were either similar (erectile function and the percentage of completely hard and fully rigid erections) or greater (emotional well-being and the overall sexual experience). The similarity in outcomes is not surprising given that almost 90% of the men in the flexible-dose trial titrated to 100 mg after 2 weeks. These data suggest prescription of an initial dose of 100 mg for men with ED, except in those for whom it is inappropriate.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^1159pxQV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

The main purpose of the pivotal study and its open label extension was to investigate the overall efficacy and systemic safety of sildenafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension during short term and long term chronic daily exposure. The ocular safety and visual function evaluation was an additional component based on newly emerging ocular safety signals with the use of sildenafil on an as needed basis for the indication of erectile dysfunction. The data show that sildenafil, taken three times daily at doses up to four times the usual recommended dose for erectile dysfunction, is not associated with compromised visual function or ocular adverse events.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^115fwy1C]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results

In all, 278 participants were randomly assigned to receive sildenafil in doses of 20 mg (n = 69), 40 mg (n = 68), or 80 mg (n = 71) or to receive placebo (n = 70), and 277 participants took at least one dose of study drug. A total of 265 participants completed the 12 week randomised study, and 259 entered the extension. The median length of treatment during the extension was 1171 (range 1–1442) days, and 222 participants completed one year of treatment with sildenafil monotherapy. However, data reflecting the results of the visual function assessments after month 18 were limited given that most participants had data missing or the visual parameters were no longer collected by investigators. Subjective adverse event data (that is, reports by participants) were collected throughout the double masked and open label studies.

Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups (table 1). About three quarters of participants were female, and the overall mean age was approximately 49 years. Between 60% and 65% of participants in each group were diagnosed as having idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and 58% overall were classified as World Health Organization functional class III. Only six participants had pre-existing glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Across treatment groups, the mean baseline intraocular pressure was approximately 15 mm Hg, and 71% of participants had normal visual fields at baseline as assessed by clinical investigators.
