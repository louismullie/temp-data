## Question

What is the cause of CKD in systemic sclerosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of chronic kidney disease in systemic sclerosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis and how it predisposes to kidney disease. Then, I should distinguish acute scleroderma renal crisis from chronic CKD phenotypes. Next, I will examine the specific mechanisms that drive CKD in SSc, including ischemic nephropathy, thrombotic microangiopathy, fibrosis, and immune-mediated glomerular disease. After that, I should review key risk factors and triggers, including autoantibodies, medications, and comorbidities. Finally, I will integrate these elements into a coherent causal model and outline practical clinical implications for diagnosis and management, ensuring I verify each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis, because CKD in SSc cannot be understood without anchoring it to the disease's core biology. SSc is characterized by three interlocked processes: autoimmunity with distinct autoantibodies, a widespread vasculopathy with endothelial dysfunction and intimal proliferation, and fibrosis driven by activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts; these processes variably affect multiple organs, including the kidney, and explain both acute and chronic renal phenotypes [^117HC7cP] [^114P1K4h] [^115QaWqh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single renal entity. I need to distinguish acute scleroderma renal crisis from chronic CKD in SSc. SRC is an acute, life-threatening presentation with malignant hypertension, AKI, and often thrombotic microangiopathy, whereas CKD in SSc reflects a more indolent, progressive decline in eGFR with hypertension and albuminuria due to chronic ischemic nephropathy and fibrosis. Importantly, CKD can persist even after SRC has resolved, underscoring distinct but overlapping pathways to renal injury [^112yhFTh] [^111BPfqB] [^114X67hH].

> I will now examine ischemic nephropathy as a primary driver of CKD in SSc, because persistent hypoperfusion and small-vessel disease are central. Chronic renal vasculopathy with intimal hyperplasia, luminal narrowing, and reduced perfusion leads to cortical ischemia, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis; ultrasound and Doppler studies show increased intrarenal resistive indices and reduced parenchymal thickness in SSc, correlating with impaired hemodynamics and CKD progression, which aligns with the concept of a "renal Raynaud phenomenon" contributing to chronic ischemia [^117CT2nF] [^113WnW3E] [^114X67hH].

> Wait, let me verify the role of thrombotic microangiopathy beyond acute SRC, because TMA features can persist and contribute to chronic damage. TMA with endothelial injury, microthrombi, and schistocytes is a hallmark of SRC, but persistent or smoldering TMA physiology may lead to chronic glomerular ischemia, sclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis, thereby sustaining CKD even after blood pressure control; complement activation, including C5b-9 deposition, has been implicated in refractory cases, linking innate immune dysregulation to chronic renal injury [^112yhFTh] [^113RhYRQ].

> Next, I should review fibrosis as a convergent endpoint, because regardless of the initial insult, matrix accumulation determines progression. In SSc kidneys, myofibroblast activation and TGF-β–driven extracellular matrix deposition lead to irreversible scarring; this fibrotic remodeling follows the broader cross-organ fibrosis biology seen in SSc and other chronic diseases, and it explains why CKD in SSc often progresses despite removal of the acute trigger, with proteinuria further accelerating tubulointerstitial injury [^11364RCo] [^116YFms7].

> But wait, what if immune-mediated glomerular disease is the culprit in some patients? I need to check for overlapping autoimmune nephritides. SSc patients can develop ANCA-associated vasculitis, membranous nephropathy, or other primary glomerulopathies that present with proteinuria and declining eGFR; in such cases, renal biopsy is warranted to distinguish these entities from ischemic or fibrotic SSc nephropathy, as management and prognosis differ substantially [^112m2eiG] [^115CWEQa].

> I should confirm the risk factors that modulate CKD development in SSc, starting with autoantibodies. Anti-RNA polymerase III identifies a high-risk phenotype for SRC, while anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-70) associates with more severe systemic disease and later renal involvement; these serologies help stratify risk and anticipate timing and phenotype of renal disease, though they do not directly predict isolated CKD without SRC [^111BPfqB] [^111W3PGa].

> Hold on, I should verify medication-related risks because they are actionable. High-dose glucocorticoids, particularly prednisone above about 10–15 mg daily, markedly increase SRC risk and may indirectly worsen CKD by precipitating acute events; calcineurin inhibitors are vasoconstrictive and may exacerbate renal vasculopathy; conversely, prior low-dose ACE inhibitor "prophylaxis" may mask hypertension and delay recognition of SRC, paradoxically worsening outcomes, so steroid minimization and cautious immunosuppression are key principles [^111BPfqB] [^1175UV2t].

> I need to ensure I account for comorbid contributors that amplify CKD risk in SSc. Hypertension is highly prevalent in SSc and accelerates nephrosclerosis; diabetes and dyslipidemia, while less common than in the general population, still contribute to CKD burden; importantly, SSc patients have an approximately sevenfold higher risk of incident kidney failure than matched controls, with the relative risk highest in those without preexisting CKD or diabetes, suggesting disease-specific mechanisms predominate in many cases [^112gk2Et] [^116M4HkC].

> Let me consider the temporal dynamics, because timing of renal involvement informs mechanism. Early diffuse SSc within 3–5 years of onset carries the highest risk of SRC, whereas CKD may emerge later from cumulative microvascular ischemia and fibrosis. This bifurcation helps explain why some patients present with abrupt AKI and malignant hypertension, while others decline gradually with hypertension and albuminuria over years [^112yhFTh] [^111BPfqB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "renal Raynaud" might be a distinct, rare entity, but I should double-check. In fact, vasospastic phenomena are better viewed as part of the spectrum of renal vasculopathy that reduces perfusion and contributes to ischemic nephropathy rather than a separate disease, reinforcing the centrality of vascular dysfunction in CKD pathogenesis in SSc [^113WnW3E].

> I will now synthesize a causal model to ensure coherence. CKD in SSc arises from a triad of chronic renal vasculopathy with ischemia, superimposed immune and thrombotic endothelial injury, and progressive fibrosis. Genetic and autoimmune susceptibility sets the stage, autoantibodies and vascular mediators amplify injury, and medications or acute events trigger transitions from compensated vasculopathy to overt CKD or SRC, explaining the heterogeneity of renal phenotypes across patients and over time [^117HC7cP] [^115QaWqh] [^114X67hH].

> Next, I should review clinical implications to make this actionable. For diagnosis, maintain a high index of suspicion for CKD in any SSc patient with hypertension or albuminuria, use eGFR trends rather than single creatinine values, and consider Doppler ultrasound to assess intrarenal hemodynamics. When the presentation is atypical or proteinuria is substantial, pursue renal biopsy to exclude overlapping glomerulonephritides, and avoid reflexively attributing all CKD to SSc alone [^11581GHJ] [^117CT2nF] [^115CWEQa].

> For management, I need to ensure strict blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors as first-line therapy, titrating to maximal tolerated doses, while minimizing glucocorticoids and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs. In refractory hypertension or suspected vasculopathy, consider endothelin receptor antagonists or other vasodilators, and coordinate nephrology follow-up for CKD complications and transplant evaluation if kidney failure ensues. Importantly, do not use ACE inhibitors prophylactically at low doses, as this may mask SRC without proven benefit [^114N3Xa6] [^1155vvEn] [^1175UV2t].

> In summary, CKD in systemic sclerosis is primarily driven by chronic renal vasculopathy with ischemia, compounded by immune-mediated endothelial injury and progressive fibrosis. Autoantibodies, medications such as high-dose steroids, and comorbid hypertension modulate risk, and the clinical course spans from silent hemodynamic changes to overt CKD or acute SRC, necessitating vigilant screening, judicious immunosuppression, and aggressive cardio-renal risk modification to slow progression [^117HC7cP] [^114X67hH] [^111BPfqB].

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is driven by **renal vasculopathy and fibrosis** from endothelial injury, intimal proliferation, and thrombotic microangiopathy [^117HC7cP], with **scleroderma renal crisis (SRC)** as the most severe manifestation [^111BPfqB]. Persistent hypoperfusion and ischemia lead to tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, while **autoimmunity and complement activation** [^113RhYRQ] amplify injury [^114X67hH]. Risk factors include diffuse cutaneous disease, anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies, and high-dose corticosteroids [^111BPfqB]; ACE inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy [^114N3Xa6], but CKD may still progress despite treatment [^111s27HY].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Renal vasculopathy and microvascular dysfunction

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Early endothelial injury causes vasoconstriction, intimal proliferation, and luminal narrowing, reducing renal blood flow [^117HC7cP].

- **Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)**: Microthrombi in small vessels cause ischemia and acute kidney injury (AKI), a hallmark of SRC [^111BPfqB].

- **Renal Raynaud phenomenon**: Vasospasm further reduces perfusion, promoting ischemic injury [^113WnW3E].

---

### Fibrosis and structural remodeling

Interstitial fibrosis reflects **excessive extracellular matrix deposition** from activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, leading to irreversible nephron loss [^11364RCo]. Tubular atrophy results from chronic ischemia and fibrosis, causing **progressive CKD** [^112Rro3D].

---

### Immune-mediated injury

Autoimmunity with **autoantibodies (e.g. anti-RNA polymerase III)** and immune complexes contributes to vascular and parenchymal injury [^113RhYRQ]. Complement activation — particularly the **classical pathway** — amplifies endothelial injury and inflammation [^113RhYRQ].

---

## Clinical manifestations and progression

CKD in SSc presents with **hypertension, proteinuria, and progressive decline in GFR** [^112Rro3D]. SRC is an acute, life-threatening complication with malignant hypertension, AKI, and TMA [^112yhFTh]. CKD progression varies: some patients stabilize, while others progress to ESRD, especially after SRC or persistent hypoperfusion [^112K65PP].

---

## Risk factors and triggers

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Diffuse cutaneous SSc | Higher risk of renal involvement and SRC [^112yhFTh] |
| Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies | Strongly associated with SRC [^111BPfqB] |
| High-dose corticosteroids | Major trigger for SRC [^111BPfqB] |
| Hypertension | Accelerates renal damage [^11581GHJ] |
| Cardiac involvement | Reduced renal perfusion from heart disease [^113WnW3E] |

---

## Treatment and management strategies

- **ACE inhibitors**: First-line for SRC and CKD; reduce mortality and renal progression [^1178KsyH].

- **Blood pressure control**: Aggressive antihypertensive therapy is essential [^116FkdFh].

- **Immunosuppression**: Used cautiously; high-dose steroids increase SRC risk [^111BPfqB].

- **Dialysis and transplantation**: Considered for ESRD; transplantation outcomes have improved [^112K65PP].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

CKD in SSc carries significant morbidity and mortality, particularly after SRC [^112yhFTh]. Despite ACE inhibitors, **long-term outcomes remain poor**, with substantial risk of ESRD and cardiovascular complications [^111s27HY].

---

CKD in SSc reflects a **multifactorial process** dominated by vasculopathy, ischemia, and fibrosis, with immune and complement pathways amplifying injury. Management centers on ACE inhibitors and blood pressure control, yet progression to ESRD remains common, especially after SRC.

Introduction

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is clinically characterized in the one hand by fibrosis of skin and internal organs leading to altered organ structure and ultimately organ dysfunction and on the other hand by functional and structural vasculopathy resulting among others in Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulcers, pulmonary artery hypertension, and renal crisis. In SSc, fibrosis and vasculopathy are intimately associated and lead to highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations with a widely variable prognosis. Main causes of death are lung and heart involvement which may occur early or late in the disease course. Standardized mortality rates range from 2.82 to 3.64 in the most recent meta-analysis. In addition, SSc imposes high burden in terms of quality of life and social cost.

Inflammation is the physiological response to altered tissue and organ homeostasis and is the common denominator to SSc pathogenesis. We believe that inflammatory processes are keys to initiation and progression toward both fibrosis and structural vasculopathy in response to events perturbing homeostasis. However, deciphering the multiple components of inflammation, which simultaneously act in many different, often opposing, directions remains an important aim to understand SSc pathophysiology.

From the pathogenic point of view, the questions to be answered are many and should address the predisposing genetic background, the trigger(s) as well as the mechanisms involved in the initiation, and further development of both fibrosis and vasculopathy simultaneously taking into account clinical heterogeneity (Fig. 1). The term of "intermediate pathophenotypes" has been proposed by C. Feghali-Bostwick and J. Varga to accommodate the dynamic processes underlying heterogeneity in SSc and our understanding of the mechanisms involved in SSc pathogenesis at cellular and tissue levels.

Fig. 1
Overview of conditions and events leading to systemic sclerosis. Schematic diagram highlighting the complex interplay thought to play a role in susceptibility and initiation of SSc in which genetic predisposition and environmental cues under the pressure of a variety of triggers lead to perturbed homeostasis with ensuing autoimmunity. Autoimmunity is represented as the common denominator of the three fundamental aspects of SSc: inflammation, vasculopathy, and fibrosis. Heterogeneous clinical manifestations would then develop according to variable amplification mechanisms resulting in recognized clinical subsets and organ damage

Excellent reviews have been recently published addressing various aspects of SSc pathogenesis. Here, we will attempt to provide a synthetic view of the main aspects of SSc pathogenesis.

### Targeting inflammation for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease: a five-compartment mechanistic model [^116iokGT]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Risk factors, such as genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyle, overweight and unhealthy diet, have resulted in an unprecedented prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Consequently, kidney disease secondary to diabetes (diabetic kidney disease, DKD) has become the leading cause of kidney failure, with more than 400 000 deaths among adults worldwide in 2017. However, clinical presentation and end organ damage vary widely among patients with type 2 diabetes, with around one in three patients developing DKD with albuminuria > 300 mg/day and/or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

The identification of molecular pathways connecting systemic and local inflammation to the pathology of type 2 diabetes and DKD has sparked growing interest in targeting inflammation to prevent disease progression, as well as improving patient risk stratification by inflammatory biomarkers. Sub-clinical chronic inflammation with multi-organ crosstalk is increasingly recognized as a driver of linked cardiovascular, renal and metabolic disease states.

Overt immune cell infiltration was not historically considered as one of the classical histopathological signs of DKD: glomerular sclerosis and mesangial expansion, first noted in the 1930s, accompanied by thickening of glomerular and tubular basement membranes, podocyte injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, inflammatory biomarkers correlate with mortality and end-stage renal disease in patients with DKD. Kidney failure, furthermore, causes systemic inflammation that contribute to morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease. Only since the discovery of macrophage infiltration as a key histopathological feature in the 1990s has it become recognized that fibrosis and sclerosis in the diabetic kidney are part of a chronic inflammatory disease process that correlates with disease progression. Inflammation may therefore represent a key factor in development of DKD for a substantial subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes.

The complex and heterogeneous pathophysiology of DKD presents serious challenges to the development of effective treatments. Chronic kidney disease in a patient with type 2 diabetes may be a direct result of diabetes, exacerbated by diabetes or unrelated to diabetes. At present, these disease states can only be differentiated by histological analysis of kidney biopsies. Although classifications of DKD have been proposed, the lack of consistent use of biopsies as a diagnostic tool in diabetic patients with proteinuria calls into question the general translatability of observations in cohorts of patients who have undergone biopsy to the general diabetic population. Examples of the diverse histopathology of DKD are shown in Fig. 1.

### Scleroderma renal crisis and renal involvement in systemic sclerosis [^112yhFTh]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2016). Medium credibility.

Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication that affects 2–15% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc, also known as scleroderma). SRC typically presents in patients with early, rapidly progressive, diffuse cutaneous SSc within the first 3–5 years after the onset of a non-Raynaud sign or symptom. SRC is characterized by an acute, usually symptomatic increase in blood pressure, a rise in serum creatinine levels, oliguria and thrombotic microangiopathy in about 50% of patients. The prognosis of SRC substantially improved in the 1980s with the introduction of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors for rapid blood pressure control, with additional antihypertensive agents as required. However, the survival of patients with SRC can still be improved. Current patient survival is 70–82% at 1 year, but decreases to 50–60% at 5 years despite dialysis support. Patients with SRC who show no signs of renal functional recovery despite timely blood pressure control are candidates for transplantation. In this Review, we discuss progress made in the identification and proactive management of patients at risk of SRC and make recommendations aimed at optimizing management for those who progress to chronic kidney failure.

### Advanced kidney disease, gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: the perfect storm [^116CexKq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Studies of a rare systemic fibrosing condition-entitled nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) are linked to gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) agent exposure in patients with advanced kidney disease. However, many patients with kidney disease are exposed to GBC agents, yet they do not develop this devastating disorder.

Recent Findings

NSF appears more likely to develop when the combination of advanced kidney disease, linear GBC agent exposure, and the presence of unique patient features converge. Linear GBC agents are more likely to promote NSF, probably due to chelate-Gd binding instability ± underlying proinflammatory effects. Patients with advanced acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at highest risk, in contrast to those with lower stages of CKD (stages I-III). Finally, whereas exposure to GBC agents in patients with advanced kidney disease is required for NSF to develop, it does not appear sufficient. Additional patient-specific co-factors, such as metabolic disorders, vascular injury, and inflammation, may also be necessary for NSF to occur.

Summary

NSF develops when 'the perfect storm' of factors is present: unstable/pro-inflammatory GBC agent exposure, advanced kidney disease, and unique patient factors. Recognizing this combination of factors will hopefully allow this devastating condition to become of historical interest only.

Outcomes

Outcomes in SRC remain poor compared to other organ complications of SSc but have improved by 50% since the introduction of ACEi treatment in 1981. Results from the ISRCS showed 36% mortality and 25% remain on dialysis at 1 year. Permanent dialysis is required in 19–40% of SRC cases. Interestingly in the post-ACE era, there has been no evidence of further improvement in morbidity and mortality, highlighting the need for novel treatments in SRC.

Recovery of renal function to achieve dialysis independence can occur up to 2 years after the initial event so decisions about renal transplant are delayed accordingly. Three to 17% of SRC cases will require renal transplant. Considerations prior to transplant include co-existing comorbidities, severity of SSc, and choice of immunosuppression following transplant as calcineurin inhibitors are vasoconstrictors and so can theoretically contribute towards further SRC. Survival for SRC patients is superior in the transplant population (54–91%) compared to those on dialysis (31–56%) with graft survival now similar to that of other ESRF.

Recurrence of SRC following renal transplant has been reported from 2 to 9%. Recurrence can also occur in the setting of treated SRC not requiring transplant. SRC has been incorporated into an internationally validated tool for predicting 5-year outcome in diffuse disease due to its impact on overall survival.

### Comorbidity burden on mortality in patients with systemic sclerosis [^111fZbiw]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The SSc comorbidome

We formulated a comorbidome for SSc using the results obtained from our study. This representation takes the form of a bubble chart, with each comorbidity depicted as a circle. The circle's diameter represents the prevalence of the comorbidity, meaning a larger diameter corresponds to a higher prevalence. The chart's centre signifies the highest mortality rate (1/HR = 0), and each comorbidity is placed accordingly, at a distance proportional to the inverse of the HR (1/log(HR)). If comorbidity is situated closer to the centre, it signifies a higher risk of death. Among the comorbidities we studied, three displayed a statistically significant risk of death and were marked with a star for easy identification. Considering age, sex and SSc organ involvement, along with the comorbidities, enriched our model. The comorbidome effectively summarises these factors, enables a comparison between them and illuminates their reciprocal influences (figure 3).

Figure 3
Comorbidome of systemic sclerosis (SSc). The comorbidome is the graphic illustration of all the comorbidities studied in our cohort (one comorbidity = one circle), their prevalence (represented by the diameter of the circle) and their association with mortality in our patients with SSc (represented by the distance between the grey cross and the centre of the circle). All the comorbidities within the dotted circle are associated with a higher risk of death. All the comorbidities with a red star have a statistically significant association with an increased or decreased risk of death in our analysis. CKD, chronic kidney disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CV, cardiovascular.

### Renal disease and systemic sclerosis: an update on scleroderma renal crisis [^116DV1at]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

The two hallmark features of SRC are accelerated hypertension and AKI but patients can present with a variety of symptoms including headache, blurred vision, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue or dyspnoea. Severe SRC may be evidenced by seizures or symptomatic pericardial involvement at presentation.

It is important to point out that whilst an individual's blood pressure may fall into the 'normal' range, the reading may represent a significant increase in average BP for that individual, e.g. if they normally have an average systolic of 80, an increase to 120 is significant and can represent SRC. It is recognised that around 10% of cases are 'normotensive' renal crisis, without a rise in systemic BP.

Cardiac complications of SRC are common and may be complicated by underlying cardiac scleroderma. Most symptoms are a response to the sudden increase in blood pressure caused by activation of the RAA axis and often improve in response to tight blood pressure control with therapeutic agents.

Diagnosis

The United Kingdom Scleroderma Study Group (UKSSG) has produced diagnostic criteria for SRC (Table 3).

Results

Baseline characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the 2591 patients with SSc and their age-matched and sex-matched controls are shown in table 1. The mean age of the total study population was 55.9 ± 10.7 years, and 14.6% were men. Patients with SSc were less commonly alcohol drinkers (23.1% vs 27.0%, p < 0.001), less commonly exercised regularly (17.4% vs 19.4%, p = 0.018) and were less commonly obese (25.5% vs 33.9%, p < 0.001) than controls. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (10.2% vs 11.7%, p = 0.030) and dyslipidaemia (28.7% vs 31.1%, p = 0.015) was lower, whereas the prevalence of hypertension (58.0% vs 34.9%, p < 0.001) and CKD (6.5% vs 5.5%, p = 0.035) was higher, in patients with SSc than in controls.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the study population

Risk of kidney failure in patients with SSc and in controls

The study population was followed up for a mean of 5.2 ± 2.6 years. The incidence rates of kidney failure in patients with SSc and in controls were 2.88 and 0.35 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The cumulative incidence of kidney failure was significantly higher in patients with SSc (figure 2, p < 0.001). In the Cox proportional hazard model with no adjustments, patients with SSc had a higher risk of incident kidney failure than controls (model 1, unadjusted HR = 8.144, 95% CI = 4.872 to 13.614). This association was consistently observed in the multivariable models (model 2, adjusted HR (aHR) = 8.174, 95% CI = 4.885 to 13.678; model 3, aHR = 7.141, 95% CI = 4.195 to 12.156; and model 4, aHR = 7.244, 95% CI = 4.256 to 12.329) (table 2). Similar result was observed in the competing risk model accounting for the competing risk of death (aHR = 6.817, 95% CI = 4.052 to 11.467).

### Scleroderma renal crisis: a rare but severe complication of systemic sclerosis [^116FkdFh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a major complication in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). It is characterized by malignant hypertension and oligo/anuric acute renal failure. SRC occurs in 5% of patients with SSc, particularly in the first years of disease evolution and in the diffuse form. The occurrence of SRC is more common in patients treated with glucocorticoids, the risk increasing with increasing dose. Left ventricular insufficiency and hypertensive encephalopathy are typical clinical features. Thrombotic microangiopathy is detected in 43% of the cases. Anti-RNA-polymerase III antibodies are present in one third of patients who develop SRC. Renal biopsy is not necessary if SRC presents with classical features. However, it can help to define prognosis and guide treatment in atypical forms. The prognosis of SRC has dramatically improved with the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). However, 5 years survival in SSc patients who develop the full picture of SRC remains low (65%). SRC is often triggered by nephrotoxic drugs and/or intravascular volume depletion. The treatment of SRC relies on aggressive control of blood pressure with ACEi, if needed in combination with other types of antihypertensive drugs. Dialysis is frequently indicated, but can be stopped in approximately half of patients, mainly in those for whom a perfect control of blood pressure is obtained. Patients who need dialysis for more than 2 years qualify for renal transplantation.

### Renal parenchymal thickness in patients with systemic sclerosis is related to intrarenal hemodynamic variables and Raynaud renal phenomenon [^117CT2nF]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Renal involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc) ranges from urinary abnormalities, reduction of glomerular filtration rate, and high renal resistive index, to scleroderma renal crisis. Intrarenal resistance indices are considered markers of renal SSc-associated vasculopathy. The aim of this study is to evaluate renal morphological variables, such as renal length, parenchymal thickness, atrophy index, and renal sinus in patients with SSc and to correlate it with renal function and hemodynamic variables.

Methods

There were 92 patients with SSc and 40 healthy controls (HC) enrolled in this study. Doppler and renal ultrasound (US) including renal length, parenchymal thickness, atrophy index, renal sinus, and intrarenal resistive index were measured in patients with SSc and HC.

Results

Renal US showed significant differences between HC and patients with SSc. The renal length (mm; 106.7 ± 5.1 vs 102.3 ± 8.4) and renal sinus (70.7 ± 7.9 vs 65.3 ± 7.7 mm) were significantly (p = 0.001) higher in HC than patients with SSc. The parenchymal thickness was significantly (p = 0.004) higher in HC than patients with SSc (18 ± 3.1 vs 16.3 ± 2.5 mm). Pulsatility index, resistive index, and systolic/diastolic ratio were significantly (p < 0.0001) lower in HC than patients with SSc. The renal length was significantly (p = 0.004) higher in diffuse cutaneous SSc (105 ± 8.4) than in limited cutaneous SSc (99.5 ± 7.5).

Conclusion

In SSc, kidney involvement is subclinical and is related to vascular injury, Raynaud phenomenon, and chronic hypoxia that can modify renal morphology. Serum creatinine is a poor marker of renal damage, and renal US could be a useful tool - together with Doppler - to evaluate renal involvement in a systemic and chronic disease such as SSc.

### Systemic sclerosis: an update in 2016 [^115g1cht]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic immune disorder of unknown origin, dominated by excessive fibrosis responsible for cutaneous and pulmonary fibrosis, and by vascular endothelial dysfunction at the origin of skin ischemia, renal and pulmonary artery lesions. Renal and pulmonary complications are mainly responsible for the severity of the disease. Recent advances led to a better understanding of pathological mechanisms and a more accurate classification of patients according to clinical and biological (auto-antibodies) phenotype. Recent trials provided interesting data on different therapeutic strategies, depending on organ involvement. These data are of particular importance in such disease, still characterized by increased mortality and morbidity rates. In this review, we aim to synthetize recent advances in diagnosis and prognosis leading to better classification of SSc patients, and in therapeutic management.

### Risk of kidney failure in patients with systemic sclerosis: a nationwide population-based study [^112f4Wfx]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we assessed the risk of kidney failure in patients with SSc compared with the general population. The risk of kidney failure was higher in patients with SSc than in controls. The effect size was larger in patients who were more recently diagnosed with SSc than in those who were diagnosed with SSc earlier. The association between SSc and the risk of kidney failure was more robust in individuals without type 2 diabetes and in those without CKD compared with their respective counterparts. Our study is noteworthy in that it encompasses data up to the recent years (followed up up to 2019) and that the HRs according to the time of SSc diagnosis have been assessed.

In a study from Taiwan, in which the end of follow-up was 2013, the HR for kidney failure in patients with SSc was 2.12. In our study, the end of follow-up was 2019, and the risk of kidney failure was also higher in patients with SSc than in the general population. However, the absolute incidence rate of kidney failure in patients with SSc in our study (2.88 per 1000 person-years) was relatively lower than that in the previous study (3.55 per 1000 person-years). This is in line with a study that reported a declining incidence of kidney failure in patients with SSc. Nonetheless, the effect size of SSc on incident kidney failure in our study was markedly greater (model 4, aHR = 7.244) than that in the previous study. This is likely attributable to the considerably lower absolute incidence rate of kidney failure in the general population in our study (0.35 per 1000 person-years) than that in the previous study (1.63 per 1000 person-years). Although the absolute incidence of kidney failure in patients with SSc has been declining, these patients are still at significantly higher risk of developing kidney failure than the general population.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare chronic disease of unknown etiology characterized by vascular abnormalities and fibrosis involving the skin and internal organs, especially the gastrointestinal tract, lung, heart and kidneys. Although the disease was historically stratified according to the extent of skin involvement, more recent approaches place more emphasis on patterns and extent of internal organ involvement. Despite numerous clinical trials, disease-modifying treatment options are still limited resulting in persistent poor quality of life and high mortality. This review provides an overview of autoantibodies in SSc and novel approaches to stratify the disease into clinically actionable subsets.

Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a major complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc). We present a case of a patient who died of complications attributable to SRC in the context of recently diagnosed SSc. We review the typical clinical and laboratory features of SSc present in our patient and highlight those that identify greater risk of progression to SRC. Particular risk factors for SRC include cutaneous involvement, positive anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies and use of corticosteroids (CS). The authors emphasise the importance of risk evaluation when choosing to use CS in patients with SSc.

Systemic inflammatory and metabolic disorders that lead to cardiac inflammation, diastolic filling abnormalities and heart failure

Many chronic systemic inflammatory and metabolic disorders are accompanied by an increased risk of heart failure, particularly HFpEF (Table 3), and this risk is independent of the development of macrovascular coronary heart disease. As noted earlier, most of these systemic disorders are more prevalent in women.

Systemic inflammatory disorders leading to heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction

Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus can lead to myocardial inflammation, coronary microcirculatory abnormalities, diastolic dysfunction, LA enlargement, and heart failure, particularly HFpEF; these abnormalities parallel the degree of clinical inflammation and are not explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors or ischaemic heart disease. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Patients with psoriasis also exhibit coronary microvascular dysfunction, abnormal diastolic filling, and an increased risk of heart failure. 40, 41, 42 In systemic sclerosis, the myocardium is often affected by microcirculatory abnormalities and fibrosis, leading to diastolic dysfunction, abnormal LA mechanics, intolerance to volume loading, and heart failure. 43, 44, 45 Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, late‐onset asthma and multiple sclerosis are accompanied by diastolic filling and coronary microvascular abnormalities and an increased risk of heart failure. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 Regardless of the cause, biomarkers of systemic inflammation may precede the onset of HFpEF by years 52, 53 and distinguish such patients from those with HFrEF. 20 Furthermore, measures of inflammation are elevated in proportion to the number of comorbidities 54; are accompanied by abnormalities in LA structure and LV filling that are typical of HFpEF 55; and have an adverse prognosis. 56

### What we do and do not know about women and kidney diseases; questions unanswered and answers unquestioned: reflection on world kidney day and international woman's day [^112zpoXS]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects approximately 10% of the world's adult population: it is within the top 20 causes of death worldwide, and its impact on patients and their families can be devastating. World Kidney Day and International Women's Day in 2018 coincide, thus offering an opportunity to reflect on the importance of women' s health and specifically their kidney health, on the community, and the next generations; as well as to strive to be more curious about the unique aspects of kidney disease in women, so that we may apply those learnings more broadly.

Girls and women, who make up approximately 50% of the world's population, are important contributors to society and their families. Besides childbearing, women are essential in childrearing and contribute to sustaining family and community health. Women in the 21 st century continue to strive for equity in business, commerce, and professional endeavours, while recognizing that in many situations, equity does not exist. In various locations around the world, access to education and medical care is not equitable amongst men and women; women remain under-represented in many clinical research studies, thus limiting the evidence base on which to make recommendations to ensure best outcomes (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Sex differences throughout the continuum of CKD care. SLE = Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; RA = Rheumatoid Arthritis; SS = Systemic Scleroderma; AKI = acute kidney injury; CKD = chronic kidney disease; AI = autoimmune; AVF = arteriovenous fistula; HD = hemodialysis; KT = kidney transplant

In this editorial, we focus on what we do and do not know about women's kidney health and kidney disease, and what we might learn in the future to improve outcomes for all.

### Renal disease and systemic sclerosis: an update on scleroderma renal crisis [^112m2eiG]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Classifying Renal Disease in Scleroderma

Separate disease entities exist within the kidney in SSc. SRC classically presents with accelerated hypertension and acute kidney injury (AKI) defined as an increase in serum creatinine > 1.5 × baseline. Whilst SRC should certainly be included in the differential for such a presentation, other causes to consider include anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis, membranous nephritis, other primary causes of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Other non-immune-mediated causes such as renal artery stenosis may mimic the presentation of SRC. There are a proportion of SSc patients who have unexplained renal abnormalities such as proteinuria and the significance of this is not fully recognised.

In 2015, the Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium (SCTC) working group conducted a scoping review and a consensus study to produce classification criteria for SRC which could be widely used in research. The group have identified a core set of variables which define SRC, and these are currently being used on real-world patients as part of the International Scleroderma Renal Crisis Survey II (ISRCS II) to validate the set and provide data on specificity. The main parameters outlined are AKI, hypertension, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia, target organ dysfunction, and renal histopathology (Table 1).

### Cutaneous manifestations, clinical characteristics, and… [^113Gs7nL]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 4263 patients, 376 patients were classified as having ssSSc, and survival was higher in patients with ssSSc compared with lcSSc and dcSSc. The only independent factor for the onset of skin fibrosis in ssSSc was anti–Scl-70 antibody positivity; patients with ssSSc had a lower prevalence of previous or current digital ulcers than patients with lcSSc and dcSSc, and skin telangiectasias were associated with diastolic dysfunction in patients with ssSSc. Meaning Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma accounted for nearly 10% of patients with SSc; cutaneous findings in this subgroup may be associated with internal organ dysfunction, and in particular, skin telangiectasias in ssSSc were associated with diastolic heart dysfunction. Importance Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma is a subset of SSc defined by the absence of skin fibrosis. Little is known about the natural history and skin manifestations among patients with ssSSc.

Systemic sclerosis is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by the association of autoimmune features with vascular manifestations and, in the majority of patients, fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, predominantly heart, lungs, and kidneys. 1 There is a high heterogeneity among patients with SSc regarding the presence and severity. Pulmonary hypertension or conduction blocks were more frequent in patients with lcSSc and dcSSc in comparison with ssSSc. Prevalence of diastolic dysfunction was similar in all subsets. The prevalence of ILD was similar in ssSSc and lcSSc and significantly higher in dcSSc. This important finding supports that even patients with SSc without skin fibrosis should be investigated at baseline by HRCT.

39–42 Although ILD was less severe in patients with ssSSc than in other cutaneous subsets, the high prevalence of ILD in ssSSc also suggests that the pathogenesis driving skin fibrosis and lung fibrosis may differ. 43 Almost 3% of patients with ssSSc had scleroderma renal crisis, and this prevalence was not different in patients with dcSSc.

Renal complications

What is the best management for scleroderma renal crisis?

While the most serious renal complication of SSc is scleroderma renal crisis, it is important to consider the broader impact and management of renal disease in SSc. Renal crisis is appropriately described as thrombotic microangiopathy with AKI in the context of systemic sclerosis, generally associated with significant new onset hypertension. There are similarities with other forms of TMA. However, it is important to consider longer-term post-SRC management that included management of residual CKD after acute treatment as well as acute management of SRC. The cornerstone of acute management remains prompt initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). Timely diagnosis of SRC is critical and this is facilitated by appreciation of the risk phenotypes including ARA positivity, early diffuse, active disease with TFR and elevated ESR, prior high dose steroids, proteinuria and hypertension. In adults, there should be caution in using prednisolone at doses above 10 mg prednisolone equivalent and calcineurin antagonists. Education in high-risk cases in adults should be undertaken including self-monitoring of BP in early-stage disease.

Vasculopathy as exemplified by scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) and digital ulcers (DUs) is a cardinal feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is associated with significant morbidity, including in patients with early disease. Prompt recognition and management is required to alleviate potentially irreversible damage from SSc-associated vasculopathy. Both SRC and DUs share many etiopathogenic drivers which inform the therapeutic strategy. The aim of our review was to describe the diagnosis and management of SRC and DUs in SSc, and to discuss unmet needs for future research.

### Renal disease and systemic sclerosis: an update on scleroderma renal crisis [^1124TzV8]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SRC is a well-documented complication of SSc but is rare and can present with a variety of symptoms so establishing a core classification criterion is going to be invaluable to future research. Whilst pathological features of SRC are recognised, they are not specific to SRC and there is still much to be understood about why certain predisposed individuals progress to SRC. There could be a role for endothelin and overactivation of the complement pathways, both treatable targets awaiting ongoing trial evidence. The development of sensitive biomarkers for renal disease in SSc may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of SRC whilst also providing tools for early detection and possibly prognosis in SRC. Early, specialist treatment and collaboration between rheumatology and renal physicians will enhance patient outcome. Advances in dialysis delivery and post-transplant management now mean that for those who do go on to require these treatments, the prognosis has improved.

### Diagnosis, management and prevention of scleroderma renal disease [^111s27HY]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Renal complications are important in scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) and include scleroderma renal crisis. This is a medical emergency that requires careful management. Recent cohort studies have highlighted key aspects of management and outcome and these are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Two recent articles have reported the course of scleroderma renal crisis, and examined risk factors, clinical outcomes and prognostic markers in large contemporary scleroderma cohorts. Diffuse skin disease, early rapidly progressing skin disease, anti-RNA polymerase antibodies and genetic factors are all nonmodifiable risk factors. Use of corticosteroids is associated with scleroderma renal crisis. Over half of cases of scleroderma renal crisis require dialysis; just under half of these will be able to discontinue dialysis over the following 2 years. Despite clear improvement in 12-month survival, which is a testament to the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in renal crisis, long-term mortality remains significant, especially with ongoing dialysis.

Summary

Renal involvement remains a major complication of scleroderma. Long-term outcome after renal crisis remains poor despite the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. There is no evidence at present to support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prophylactically. The mechanisms and significance of chronic renal impairment in scleroderma need to be better defined.

Progressive systemic sclerosis is a complex disease that involves multiple organ systems. Patients with progressive systemic sclerosis can pose a significant challenge for the anesthesiologist. As the disease progresses, profound musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, renal, and cardiac system changes occur. The anesthesiologist should understand these complex pathophysiological processes so as to minimize potential risks, including aspiration and other pulmonary complications. In addition, the potential for reduced renal function and intraoperative hypothermia-induced vasospasm must be considered.

RA also preferentially affects women (4:1 ratio to men) with the peak incidence at age 45–55, coinciding with the perimenopausal years. This suggests a possible association between estrogen deficiency and disease onset. Female-to-male incidence ratio after age 60 years is approximately 1:1, potentially implicating changes in sex hormones in the development of RA, and a pattern of RA symptom improvement or even remission during pregnancy is well recognized. Renal involvement in RA is relatively common and multifactorial and is a predictor of mortality in RA patients. The risk of CKD is significantly higher in patients with RA than in the general population. The development of CKD may result from several ongoing processes, including specific renal involvement associated with RA (e.g. glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis), chronic inflammation, comorbidities, and nephrotoxic anti-rheumatic drugs. The strong association between RA activity and AA amyloidosis increases morbidity and is the main cause of ESRD with RA and nephropathy. Importantly, some of the life-long and combined RA pharmacotherapy can lead to various renal side effects.

SS predominantly affects women (female-to-male ratios ranging from 3:1 to 14:1), with the peak incidence in the fifth and sixth decades. Estrogen may play a role in scleroderma pathogenesis through its stimulatory effect on transforming growth factor-beta 1 receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Vasculopathy is an important disease-related manifestation in SS, and the low estrogenic state associated with menopause has been suggested to aggravate vascular manifestations in affected women. SS can also be complicated by a number of different forms of kidney disease, including scleroderma renal crisis, which represents a form of malignant hypertension with acute renal failure; or more commonly ischemic nephropathy leading to slowly progressive CKD, accompanied by hypertension and albuminuria. Normotensive acute renal failure in patients with SS may be caused by interstitial nephritis or ANCA vasculitis, a separate entity in scleroderma with poor outcome.

### Renal function recovery in chronic dialysis patients [^116XqF4H]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Renal function recovery (RFR) from acute kidney injury requiring dialysis occurs at a high frequency. RFR from chronic dialysis, on the other hand, is an uncommon but well-recognized phenomenon, occurring at a rate of 1.0–2.4% according to data from large observational studies. The underlying etiology of renal failure is the single most important predicting factor of RFR in chronic dialysis patients. The disease types with the highest RFR rates are atheroembolic renal disease, systemic autoimmune disease, renovascular diseases, and scleroderma. The disease types with the lowest RFR rates are diabetic nephropathy and cystic kidney disease. Initial dialysis modality does not appear to influence RFR. Careful observation and history taking are needed to recognize the often nonspecific clinical and laboratory signs of RFR. When RFR is suspected in a chronic dialysis patient, a 24-hour urine urea and creatinine clearance should be measured. Based on the renal clearance, along with other clinical factors, the dialysis prescription may be gradually reduced until a complete discontinuation of dialysis. After RFR from maintenance dialysis, patients require close follow-up in an office setting for chronic kidney disease management.

### Targeted therapy for systemic sclerosis [^114tkGzq]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disease whose therapy is focused at pathogenic pathways causing variable types of damage in the individual organs. There are 3 major pathways that cause organ damage in scleroderma. First, t-cells, cytokines and inflammation are prominent very early in the disease. Early alveolitis which occurs before interestial fibrosis in the lungs is the best example of inflammation. Second, endothelial cell damage causes severe thickening of vessels and two of the most deadly complications in scleroderma, pulmonary arterial hypertension and renal crisis. Scleroderma renal crisis is now very treatable with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. There are now treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension which should improve outcome in these patients as well. Third, fibroblasts lead to severe cutaneous fibrosis or skin thickening that is the hallmark of the disease. No treatment is available but we are hopeful that new antagonists to the cytokine, TGF beta, will prove helpful. B cells and autoantibodies are not involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, but there are scleroderma specific antibodies that help in defining patient subsets. All of these factors are influenced by unknown inciting agents and the permissive genetic background.

### Fibrosis: cross-organ biology and pathways to development of innovative drugs [^116YFms7]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Fibrosis is a pathophysiological mechanism involved in chronic and progressive diseases that results in excessive tissue scarring. Diseases associated with fibrosis include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), which are collectively responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Although a few drugs with direct antifibrotic activity are approved for pulmonary fibrosis and considerable progress has been made in the understanding of mechanisms of fibrosis, translation of this knowledge into effective therapies continues to be limited and challenging. With the aim of assisting developers of novel antifibrotic drugs, this Review integrates viewpoints of biologists and physician-scientists on core pathways involved in fibrosis across organs, as well as on specific characteristics and approaches to assess therapeutic interventions for fibrotic diseases of the lung, gut, kidney, skin and liver. This discussion is used as a basis to propose strategies to improve the translation of potential antifibrotic therapies.

Pathogenesis

SRC arises from reduced blood supply to the kidney which is proposed to occur in susceptible individuals for a variety of reasons. Susceptible individuals with SSc have the unifying abnormal intra-renal features of vasculopathy, fibrosis, and autoimmunity which allow injury to the vessel wall to initiate an amplification loop of local damage and activation of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin (RAA) axis and hence SRC, as demonstrated by Fig. 2. Autopsy specimens have shown that interstitial fibrosis, lymphocytosis, and chronic vasculopathy are often present in SSc without renal crisis but a yet-to-be-defined event, possibly vascular, triggers the endothelial activation and release of growth factors and cytokines which then leads to smooth muscle proliferative vasculopathy. Proliferative vasculopathy leads to glomerular ischaemia and sustained activation of the RAA axis with hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular axis. The improvement observed after inhibition of the RAA axis with ACEi suggests that hypereninaemia plays a clear role in the pathogenesis of SRC; however, a prospective study showed that increased renin levels are not predictive of subsequent SRC, suggesting that other factors are involved. Other factors believe to play a role in reduction of glomerular blood flow include decreased cardiac output due to cardiac scleroderma or heart failure, direct effects of angiotensin II, glucocorticoids, and renal vasospasm, i.e. 'renal Raynaud's'.

### Scleroderma… [^111UYWaD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Systemic scleroderma or progressive systemic sclerosis is a connective-tissue disease characterized by vascular alterations and severe fibrosis. The disease has a predilection for female patients and affects all races and ages, although it is more common during the third and fourth decades of life. The sites most frequently involved are the skin, esophagus, lung, and kidney. Patients with CREST syndrome seem to have a more benign clinical course than those with the diffuse form of the disease, which has a more serious prognosis owing to the high incidence of severe pulmonary fibrosis and kidney insufficiency. The pathophysiology of scleroderma remains poorly understood. Two schools of thought prevail: some believe that the primary event is vascular damage, and others propose a derangement in collagen metabolism as the initial event.

Organ Damage in SSc

Damage has been defined as "the permanent and irreversible loss of anatomical structure or physiological function, caused by SSc and not secondary to its treatment or comorbidities".

SCTC Damage Index

In 2019, the SCTC was the first to develop a damage index in SSc (SCTC-DI). It was developed through a consensus strategy plus a statistical analysis on patients' data. In fact, the first step consisted of a web-based survey proposed to 331 SCTC members in order to evaluate the appropriateness of each item for inclusion; the items that obtained > 60% of consensus were retained. Finally, 93 of 331 members (28.1%) fulfilled the survey and 58 out of 83 proposed items were retained.

The second step consisted of statistical analyses performed to evaluate the association of these items with endpoints of morbidity (specifically Physical Component Summary score of the Short Form 36) and mortality. The first was a univariable analysis on a prospectively acquired cohort, in which 22 out of 58 items resulted significantly associated and were entered in a multivariable model, together with one additional outcome ("SRC and persistent renal impairment"), that due to its rarity did not reach the statistical significancy but was considered very relevant by the working group. The 23 items were included in a multivariable regression analysis in order to obtain the coefficients to create a 23-item weighted score, divided into 6 organ domains, that was named SCTC damage index (SCTC-DI) (Table 3). The authors also distinguished 3 levels of damage: 0–4 low, 5–12 moderate, > 12 severe.

### Endothelin system in hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^1112Z8Rz]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

ET (endothelin) is a powerful vasoconstrictor 21-amino acid peptide present in many tissues, which exerts many physiological functions across the body and participates as a mediator in many pathological conditions. ETs exert their effects through ET A and ET B receptors, which can be blocked by selective receptor antagonists. ETs were shown to play important roles among others, in systemic hypertension, particularly when resistant or difficult to control, and in pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, chronic kidney disease, diabetic cardiovascular disease, scleroderma, some cancers, etc. To date, ET antagonists are only approved for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension and recently for IgA nephropathy and used in the treatment of digital ulcers in scleroderma. However, they may soon be approved for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension and different types of nephropathy. Here, the role of ETs is reviewed with a special emphasis on participation in and treatment of hypertension and chronic kidney disease.

### Scleroderma renal crisis [^115FiPSA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are important knowledge gaps concerning scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), in large part because its rarity has hampered research. Many studies to date share limitations, in particular small samples, prevalent cases, and retrospective study designs. This review features some of the most recent studies that attempt to shed new insights into SRC while trying to overcome those limitations.

Recent Findings

The most important recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SRC includes identification of novel genetic and serological biomarkers. Outcomes of SRC remain poor and there are also ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic strategies, in particular targeting the endothelin-1 pathway.

Summary

Meaningful improvement in outcomes of SRC will be predicated on greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease and identification of novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. Some efforts are ongoing but ultimately, international cooperation will be necessary to achieve this for a rare complication of a rare disease.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: CKD is defined as the presence of kidney damage persisting for > 3 months, which is manifested by decreased kidney function or albuminuria, measured by eGFR.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common causes of CKD include diabetes and hypertension. Other causes include infectious glomerulonephritis, renal vasculitis, ureteral obstruction, genetic alterations, and autoimmune diseases.
- **Disease course**: CKD may be asymptomatic or result in vague symptoms, such as excessive tiredness, itching, sleep disturbance, lack of concentration, bone/joint pain, loss of appetite, loss of muscle strength, dyspnea, muscle spasm, and restless legs. Disease progression may lead to ESRD with uremic symptoms, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality of patients ≤ 60 years and > 60 years with CKD requiring hospital admission is 13.9% and 41.0%, respectively.

### Evaluation of systemic sclerosis primary heart involvement and chronic heart failure in the European scleroderma trials and research cohort [^113SXWxk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic fibrosing autoimmune rheumatic disease. Among all systemic rheumatic diseases, SSc is associated with the highest disease‐related mortality, and heart involvement is one of the leading causes of mortality in patients with SSc. The reported prevalence of clinically manifest primary heart involvement (SSc‐pHI) ranges from 7% to 39%, with clinical findings of arrhythmogenic disturbances and heart failure (HF). Autopsy studies, however, have demonstrated myocardial fibrosis, myocardial inflammation, or contraction band necrosis in up to 80% of patients with SSc. Clinically manifest SSc‐pHI is associated with a 5‐year mortality of 75%.

SSc‐pHI comprises a broad range of clinical entities, whose pathophysiology and clinical course are incompletely understood. Only recently, a literature‐driven consensus‐based definition of SSc‐pHI was published by the World Scleroderma Foundation/Heart Failure Association (WSF/HFA), defining SSc‐pHI as cardiac abnormalities that are predominantly attributable to SSc rather than other causes (such as ischemic heart disease, arterial hypertension, drug toxicity, other cardiomyopathy, primary valvular disease) or SSc complications (such as SSc‐associated pulmonary arterial hypertension [SSc‐PAH], renal involvement, SSc‐associated interstitial lung disease [SSc‐ILD]). Treatment of SSc‐pHI is challenging due to the lack of evidence‐based treatment guidelines. Furthermore, the previous lack of a standardized definition of SSc‐pHI further complicates the interpretation, integration, and extrapolation of previously published data. Moreover, most of the previous studies did not strictly differentiate between primary and secondary heart involvement in SSc, and previous clinical, histopathological, and imaging studies reporting on SSc‐pHI also included in particular patients with SSc‐PAH, scleroderma renal crisis, arterial hypertension, or diabetes and as such confounded the results related to SSc‐pHI. Recently a consensus of the WSF/HFA on the assessment of SSc‐pHI has been published offering guidance on screening, diagnosis, and follow‐up assessment of SSc‐pHI. However, further studies on the heterogeneity of SSc‐pHI are needed and these will require a large sample size, which is achievable only by multicenter studies.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing or exacerbating underlying chronic kidney disease (gradual loss of kidney function over time).

CDC's Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors (including acute kidney injury) in the U.S. population and tracks progress in its prevention, management, and control.

Improving both patient and provider awareness that diabetes, hypertension, and advancing age are frequently associated with acute kidney injury is important for reversing these trends. Elderly persons have physiologically reduced kidney function and functional reserve with the appearance of global sclerosis, but also more comorbidity than do young adults, all of which heighten older persons' susceptibility to nephrotoxic medicines, dyes used for imaging, and even dehydration, all preventable risks for acute kidney injury. Better recognition of risk factors for acute kidney injury by health care providers might improve the effectiveness of treatment of underlying conditions and prevent or mitigate additional kidney insult to patients, particularly among those hospitalized or in long-term care.

### Evolving strategies in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex-associated angiomyolipomas (TSC-AML) [^113kh14p]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous benign tumors that occur in multiple organ systems throughout the lifetime of the affected individuals. Renal angiomyolipomas occur in up to 80% of TSC patients, and chronic kidney disease from increasing tumor burden is the primary cause of TSC-related mortality. Our review evaluates evidence for localized and systemic therapy in the management of TSC-angiomyolipomas. Urologists or nephrologists experienced in TSC disease should coordinate the care of TSC patients with renal involvement to improve care and reduce costs.

### Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: an emerging threat among renal patients [^113VdcaM]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), also known as nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, is a scleroderma-like disease of the skin observed in patients with renal insufficiency. Since its recognition in 1997, relatively little has been published in the nephrology literature, despite indications that the disorder is becoming increasingly recognized in the United States and abroad. As nephrology professionals may be the first to encounter newly developing cases of NSF, it becomes imperative that they be able to recognize the symptoms and comorbidities and initiate tests and treatment. To date, the cause of NSF has not been established. Recent observations indicate that specific cells normally involved in wound repair and tissue remodeling may be aberrantly recruited to the skin and soft tissues of NSF patients.

### Clonal T cells in the blood of patients with systemic sclerosis… [^116gL93C]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

In a prospective study, French et al1 found that clonal T cells are frequently detected in peripheral blood samples from patients with systemic sclerosis. In their series, expanded clonal T cells were found in 6 of 13 peripheral blood samples from patients with SSc, whereas no clonal T cells were found in the control group. 1 The authors suggested that clonal T cells may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SSc. There were 6 men and 32 women, with a median age of 54 years; the median duration of the disease, considered to have existed from the onset of the Raynaud phenomenon, was 55 months. Patients were classified according to the criteria of Leroy et al3: 10 patients had diffuse cutaneous SSc and 28 had limited cutaneous SSc. The median duration of SSc was significantly longer in patients with a T-cell clonality than in those without.

Moreover, we were able to demonstrate a marked relationship between SSc subtypes and the presence of a circulating clonal population of T cells: 12 of the 28 patients with lcSSc had a circulating clonal population of T cells, whereas only 1 of the 10 patients with dcSSc had evidence of T-cell clonality. The prevalence of the following systemic manifestations related to SSc was similar in patients with and without a circulating clonal population of T cells: pitting scars; esophageal involvement characterized by motor disturbances on esophageal manometry (91% vs 72. In our population, no patient underwent photophoresis. In the present study, the demonstration that clonally expanded T cells were more commonly detected in patients with lcSSc than in those with dcSSc is also in accordance with a possible role of clonal T cells in patients with lcSSc.

To date, however, the pathogenic properties of these clonal T cells have not been clearly shown in SSc. Finally, it is of interest to note that the presence of clonally expanded T cells in the peripheral blood samples in our study could not be considered as a predictive factor of organ involvement severity in patients with SSc.

### Immunotactoid glomerulopathy-an enigmatic case in the setting of nodal marginal zone lymphoma and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma [^111Vfhjk]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Glomerular diseases can rarely be associated with organised deposits that are broadly divided into Congo Red positive (amyloid) and Congo Red negative (non-amyloid). The Congo Red negative conditions are extremely rare and are mainly divided into fibrillary and Immunotactoid Glomerulopathy (ITG) based on fibril morphology including thickness of the fibrils.

ITG can cause several manifestations including proteinuria, haematuria, hypertension (HTN), acute kidney injury and may lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD). ITG has been linked most commonly with haematological malignancies particularly low grade B-cell lymphomas and myeloma. Thus, a North American study published in 2020 that looked at 73 cases of ITG found that the most common cause was an underlying haematological disorder most commonly a B-cell lymphoma or myeloma, however 10 patients (14%) had an underlying autoimmune condition. A French study of 27 cases of ITG with monoclonal gammopathy, had underlying low grade B-cell lymphomas and myelomas in 18 cases (67%). Nodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma (NMZL) represent 1% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and 10% of all Marginal Zone Lymphomas (MZL) and may be associated with monoclonal gammopathy. The association of MZL to autoimmune diseases is well-recognised, as is its rare occurrence in systemic sclerosis.

We report a patient who presented with acute on chronic kidney disease and nephrotic syndrome (NS) who was eventually diagnosed as ITG with concurrent NMZL and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma (SSSS).

The UK Scleroderma Study Group developed guidelines on the diagnosis and management of scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) based on best available evidence and clinical experience. SRC is characterised by the acute onset of severe hypertension and acute kidney injury. Current strategies to reduce the associated morbidity and mortality include identifying at risk patients to aid early diagnosis. ACE inhibitor therapy should be lifelong in all patients, regardless of whether they require renal replacement therapy. Patients with SRC may recover renal function up to 3 years after the crisis, most often within 12 to 18 months.

### Assessing and counteracting fibrosis is a cornerstone of the treatment of CKD secondary to systemic and renal limited autoimmune disorders [^11364RCo]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Besides the higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and aging worldwide, immune mediated disorders remain an important cause of kidney disease and are especially prevalent in young adults. Regardless of the initial insult, final pathway to CKD and kidney failure is always the loss of normal tissue and fibrosis development, in which the dynamic equilibrium between extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation is disturbed, leading to excessive production and accumulation. During fibrosis, a multitude of cell types intervene at different levels, but myofibroblasts and inflammatory cells are considered critical in the process. They exert their effects through different molecular pathways, of which transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) has demonstrated to be of particular importance. Additionally, CKD itself promotes fibrosis due to the accumulation of toxins and hormonal changes, and proteinuria is simultaneously a manifestation of CKD and a specific driver of renal fibrosis. Pathways involved in renal fibrosis and CKD are closely interrelated, and although important advances have been made in our knowledge of them, it is still necessary to translate them into clinical practice. Given the complexity of this process, it is highly likely that its treatment will require a multi-target strategy to control the origin of the damage but also the mechanisms that perpetuate it. Fortunately, rapid technology development over the last years and new available drugs in the nephrologist's armamentarium give reasons for optimism that more personalized assistance for CKD and renal fibrosis will appear in the future.

### Points to consider in renal involvement in systemic sclerosis [^116k63t7]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

This article discusses points to consider when undertaking a clinical trial to test therapy for renal involvement in SSc, not including scleroderma renal crisis. Double-blind, randomized controlled trials vs placebo or standard background therapy should be strongly considered. Inclusion criteria should consider a pre-specified range of renal functions or stratification of renal function. Gender and age limitations are probably not necessary. Concomitant medications including vasodilators, immunosuppressants and endothelin receptor antagonists and confounding illnesses such as diabetes, kidney stones, hypertension and heart failure need to be considered. A measure of renal function should be strongly considered, while time to dialysis, mortality, prevention of scleroderma renal crisis and progression of renal disease can also be considered, although they remain to be validated. Detailed, pre-planned analysis should be strongly considered and should include accounting for missing data.

### Systemic sclerosis [^117HC7cP]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on systemic sclerosis:

- **Definition**: SSc is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by diffuse fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and internal organs.
- **Pathophysiology**: SSc is caused by a complex interplay of environmental factors that trigger an abnormal immune response in genetically predisposed individuals.
- **Epidemiology**: The overall incidence and prevalence of SSc in the US are 5.6 cases per 100,000 person-years and 13.5–18.4 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The resultant vascular injury and endothelial dysfunction lead to vasoconstriction, excessive deposition of extracellular matrix and collagen, hypertrophy of intimal and medial layers of small blood vessels, and endothelial cell apoptosis, resulting in clinical manifestations of Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, pulmonary arterial hypertension, renal failure, obstructive vasculopathy, and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The estimated 5-year and 10-year cumulative survival from the time of diagnosis is 74.9% and 62.5%, respectively.

### Systemic sclerosis following COVID-19 infection with recurrent corticosteroid-induced scleroderma renal crisis [^111W3PGa]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

SRC represents the most striking and well-studied renal manifestation of SSc. Renal manifestations are common in SSc with up to 50% of patients having clinical markers of renal dysfunction such as proteinuria or elevated creatinine, and up to 80% of patients having occult renal pathology on autopsy.SRC is less common, occurring in approximately 10% of patients with diffuse SSc, and just 1%–2% of limited SSc. Rapidly progressive skin thickening and positive RNA-polymerase III antibodies are the strongest risk factors for development of renal crisis. Exposure to corticosteroids at > 15 mg per day in the preceding 6 months is a major recognised risk factor. Patients with antibodies to topoisomerase-1 without RNA-polymerase III tend to develop renal crisis later in the disease course. Approximately 40% of patients with SRC require renal replacement therapy. Prognosis remains poor despite the early introduction of ACE inhibitor therapy, with a 5-year survival rate of 65%. Renal transplantation remains difficult given the risk of corticosteroid and ciclosporin-induced renal failure.

### Systemic sclerosis medications and risk of scleroderma renal crisis [^115iQnXz]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective systemic sclerosis cohort study of medications and the risk of future SRC. The Military Health System (MHS) electronic medical record (EMR) was queried for systemic sclerosis between the years 2005–2016 using the ICD-9 code 710.1 which identified 749 potential cases. A comprehensive EMR review was performed for each potential case to confirm diagnosis and collect background data with a detailed process previously reported (5, Fig. 1). There were 353 cases with confirmed SSc. SSc was defined by meeting classification criteria of either the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2013 classification as determined by a rheumatologist. The MHS is a global medical network within the U.S Department of Defense consisting of approximately 9.6 million active/retired service members and their families. It is a closed health system consisting of approximately 65 hospitals and 412 clinics spanning the world which share a common EMR. The MHS provides longitudinal follow up of a diverse population. There were 31 cases of SRC identified in the SSc cohort. SRC was defined by at least one of the following criteria in the absence of another clinical explanation for AKI and/or hypertensive emergency: 1. AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) 2. A doubling of serum creatinine. 3. A 50% rise in serum creatinine with new onset hypertension (blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg). 4. Hypertensive urgency or emergency defined by an abrupt onset of BP ≥ 180/110 mmHg requiring hospitalization or evidence of end organ damage. Essential hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) present at SSc diagnosis was confirmed by comparison data up to 2 years before SSc diagnosis. In addition to the previously published data, for each SRC case, we recorded ACE inhibitor, ARB, CCB, ERB, MMF, fluticasone, and NSAID use and their doses between SSc and SRC diagnosis. For comparison, the same information was collected for each SSc without SRC disease control between SSc diagnosis and 5 years after diagnosis. For anti-hypertensive medications, in addition to medication use, doubling of medication dose and achievement of maximum dose during the defined follow up period were also primary outcomes. For the purposes of this study, maximum dose was defined as equal to, or greater than, the following daily doses: Ramipril 10 mg, Lisinopril 40 mg, benazopril 40 mg, fosinopril 40 mg, Telmisartan 80 mg, Irbesartan 300 mg, Losartan 100 mg, Valsartan 320 mg, Candesartan 32 mg, Adalat 90 mg, amlodipine 10 mg, felodipine 10 mg, Diltiazem 360 mg and Verapamil 360 mg daily. Doubling of anti-hypertension medication dose was based on change over time in relationship to the initial dose at or following SSc diagnosis.

### Renal manifestations of systemic sclerosis – clinical features and outcome assessment [^111Jt8Di]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Renal manifestations occur frequently in scleroderma (SSc). Commonest is a reduction in renal function due to chronic disease but most clinically important is the scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This life-threatening complication occurs in up to 15% of the cases of dcSSc. Mortality is reduced by use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Renal outcome can be assessed by quantifying renal function, measuring proteinuria, exploring the frequency of renal crisis episodes and through assessment of renal outcome following SRC-such as frequency and duration of dialysis, or recovery of renal function.

### Vitamin D for health and in chronic kidney disease [^111VHBdj]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is taken for granted and is not appreciated for its importance in overall health and well-being. Vitamin D, known as the sunshine vitamin, is appreciated as being important for the prevention of rickets in children. It is now recognized that vitamin D is important for not only the growing skeleton, but for the maintenance of a healthy musculoskeletal system throughout life. Vitamin D deficiency in adults precipitates and exacerbates osteoporosis and causes the painful bone disease osteomalacia. The revelation that vitamin D is biologically inactive and requires sequential hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D helps explain why patients with renal failure are often resistant to vitamin D and suffer from secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy. In addition to its role in maintaining calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, vitamin D is now being recognized as important for maintaining maximum muscle strength and for the prevention of many chronic diseases, including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, cardiovascular heart disease, and many common cancers. Vitamin D status is best determined by the measurement of circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Vigilance for maintaining a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 20 ng/ml and preferably 30–50 ng/ml has important benefits for both healthy children and adults, as well as children and adults suffering from chronic kidney disease.

### Kidney disease other than renal crisis in patients with diffuse scleroderma [^117GhV26]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency and severity of kidney abnormalities in patients with diffuse scleroderma.

Methods

All patients with diffuse scleroderma seen at the University of Pittsburgh between 1972 and 1993 were included in the study. Kidney function tests were routinely obtained as part of the Pittsburgh Scleroderma Outcome Study. Additional kidney tests were obtained as part of the 1992 biannual outcome assessment. Patients who had kidney abnormalities including a serum creatinine > 1.2 mg/dl or proteinuria prior to 1993 were identified. The clinical setting and longterm outcome of kidney disease were evaluated.

Results

Renal crisis occurred in 129/675 (19.5%) patients. Kidney function abnormalities or proteinuria were present in 173 (26%); 48% had no abnormalities. Most patients had other explanations for the abnormality. Only 12 (2%) of the 675 patients with diffuse scleroderma had no explanation for the elevated creatinine level. Most patients with proteinuria had toxicity from D-penicillamine. No explanations for proteinuria were found in 16 (2%) of this cohort. Thus, a total of only 28 (4%) of these 675 patients had an unknown cause for their kidney dysfunction or proteinuria. None of these patients, who were followed for a mean of 10 years after onset of scleroderma, have developed chronic renal insufficiency that progressed to dialysis.

Conclusion

Patients with diffuse scleroderma without renal crisis rarely have significant increases in serum creatinine or proteinuria that cannot be explained by other etiologies. These patients with scleroderma should be carefully evaluated for non-scleroderma causes of kidney disease.

### A qualitative metasynthesis of the experience of fatigue across five chronic conditions [^111dswdx]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

Context.

Fatigue is a symptom reported by patients with a variety of chronic conditions. However, it is unclear whether fatigue is similar across conditions. Better understanding its nature could provide important clues regarding the mechanisms underlying fatigue and aid in developing more effective therapeutic interventions to decrease fatigue and improve quality of life.

Objectives.

To better understand the nature of fatigue, we performed a qualitative metasynthesis exploring patients' experiences of fatigue across five chronic noninfectious conditions: heart failure, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Methods.

We identified 34 qualitative studies written in the last 10 years describing fatigue in patients with one of the aforementioned conditions using three databases (Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL). Studies with patient quotes describing fatigue were synthesized, integrated, and interpreted.

Results.

Across conditions, patients consistently described fatigue as persistent overwhelming tiredness, severe lack of energy, and physical weakness that worsened over time. Four common themes emerged: running out of batteries, a bad life, associated symptoms (e.g. sleep disturbance, impaired cognition, and depression), and feeling misunderstood by others, with a fear of not being believed or being perceived negatively.

Conclusion.

In adults with heart failure, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we found that fatigue was characterized by severe energy depletion, which had negative impacts on patients' lives and caused associated symptoms that exacerbated fatigue. Yet, fatigue is commonly misunderstood and inadequately acknowledged.

### Renal involvement in systemic sclerosis [^114X67hH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Systemic sclerosis is a rare autoimmune vasculopathy associated with dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity that leads to generalized systemic fibrosis. Renal involvement occurs in a significant proportion of systemic sclerosis patients, and is associated with worse outcome. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is the most studied and feared renal complication described in systemic sclerosis. However, with the emergence of ACE inhibitors and better management, the mortality rate of SRC has significantly decreased. Renal disease in systemic sclerosis offers a wide array of differential diagnoses that may be challenging for the clinician. The spectrum of renal manifestations in systemic sclerosis ranges from an isolated decrease in glomerular filtration rate, increased intrarenal arterial stiffness, and isolated proteinuria due to SRC to more rare manifestations such as association with antiphospholipid antibody nephropathy and ANCA-associated vasculitis. The changes observed in the kidneys in systemic sclerosis are thought to be due to a complex interplay of various factors, including renal vasculopathy, as well as the involvement of the complement system, vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1, autoimmunity, prothrombotic and profibrotic cytokines, among others. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the main renal manifestations in systemic sclerosis by discussing the most recent epidemiological and pathophysiological data available and the challenges for clinicians in making a diagnosis of renal disease in patients with systemic sclerosis.

### Current status of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [^113WPS73]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) occurs in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute renal failure, most commonly following exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). NSF can be debilitating and associated with increased mortality. The putative association of NSF with GBCAs prompted the development of guidelines to limit the use of these contrast agents in at-risk patients. Indeed, the incidence of NSF has decreased dramatically following application of these guidelines, which appears to be the only effective means of decreasing NSF incidence. Thus, increasing clinician awareness of these updated guidelines is important. The present review introduces and compares updated guidelines for GBCA use and discusses the latest advances in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and treatment of NSF.

### Complement activation in secondary thrombotic microangiopathies [^113RhYRQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

SCLERODERMA RENAL CRISIS

Scleroderma renal crisis is a life-threatening complication that occurs in ≈10% of patients with systemic sclerosis and is characterized by abrupt onset of hypertension, TMA and AKI. Although the prognosis has improved with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 40% of patients still require dialysis and 25% die within 1 year.

A few observational studies suggest that activation of the complement system might be involved in the pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis and scleroderma renal crisis: hypocomplementemia is present in ≈15% of patients with systemic sclerosis and associated with disease severity and vascular involvement; C5b-9 deposition was detected in capillaries of skin biopsies of systemic sclerosis patients but not in healthy subjects; C4d deposition was found in renal peritubular capillaries in a subset of systemic sclerosis patients with a poor renal outcome; and serum obtained during scleroderma renal crisis induces C5b-9 deposits on cultured microvascular endothelial cells ex vivo. The mechanisms driving complement activation in scleroderma renal crisis remain poorly understood. Current hypotheses suggest classical pathway activation may arise from autoantibodies, immune complexes or haemodynamic shear stress secondary to hypertension.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain the cornerstone of treatment for patients with scleroderma renal crisis. In patients with refractory scleroderma renal crisis despite optimal renin–angiotensin blockade, case reports and case series suggest beneficial effects of complement inhibition using eculizumab, with clinical improvement in > 80% of cases.

### Renal disease and systemic sclerosis: an update on scleroderma renal crisis [^117A2BW6]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a life-threatening complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) with a mortality of 20% at 6 months. Once the leading cause of mortality in scleroderma (SSc), it remains a serious complication, often necessitating level three care for patients affected. Whilst renal outcomes have significantly improved following the advent of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy, SRC remains a precarious challenge for clinicians, due to lack of preventative measures and the fact that patients can rapidly decline despite best medical management. Large cohort studies spanning decades have allowed clear identification of phenotypes particularly at risk of developing SRC thus allowing enhanced monitoring and early identification in those individuals. Novel urinary biomarkers for renal disease in SSc may offer a new window for early identification of SRC patients and response to treatment. Multiple studies have demonstrated increased activity of complement pathways in SRC with some anecdotal cases exhibiting serological response to treatment with eculizumab where ACEi and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) were not successful. Endothelin-1 blockade, a therapeutic strategy in other SSc vasculopathies, has shown potential as a target but clinical trials are yet to show a clear treatment benefit. Clear guidelines for the management of SRC are in place to standardise care and facilitate early collaboration between rheumatology and renal physicians. Outcomes following renal transplant have improved but the mortality of SRC remains high, indicating the need for continued exploration of the mechanisms precipitating and exacerbating SRC in order to develop novel therapies.

### Understanding the effects of chronic kidney disease on cardiovascular risk: are there lessons to be learnt from healthy kidney donors? [^111bAqmR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now a recognized global public health problem. It is highly prevalent and strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD); far more patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 60mlmin(-1) per 1.73m(2) will die from cardiovascular causes than progress to end-stage renal disease. A better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the development of CVD among CKD patients is required if we are to begin devising therapy to prevent or reverse this process. Observational studies of CVD in CKD are difficult to interpret because renal impairment is almost always accompanied by confounding factors. These include the underlying disease process itself (for example, diabetes mellitus and systemic vasculitis) and the complications of CKD, such as hypertension, anaemia and inflammation. Kidney donors provide an ideal opportunity to study healthy subjects without manifest vascular disease who experience an acute change from having normal to modestly impaired renal function at the time of uninephrectomy. Prospectively examining the cardiovascular consequences of uninephrectomy using donors as a model of CKD may provide useful insight into the pathophysiology of CVD in CKD and, therefore, into how the CVD risk associated with renal impairment might eventually be reduced.

### Comorbidity burden on mortality in patients with systemic sclerosis [^112xibRT]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Mortality

Survival curves with Kaplan-Meier

We first plotted each binary comorbidity independently with the Kaplan-Meier. We can see in figure 1, for each comorbidity, the survival probability plotted over time based on our data (follow-up, death event) for patients having the comorbidity versus not having the comorbidity. We can see, for instance, that cardiovascular-specific involvement cumulates a high probability of death over time (0.4 after 16 years). The comorbidities are grouped thematically to enhance readability.

Multivariate survival analysis with Cox proportional hazards model

We used a multivariate approach to study and measure the impact of comorbidities on mortality (figure 2). The observed associations indicate that neoplasia (HR = 2.572 (1.56–4.22), p = 0.0002), SSc-ILD (HR = 2.45 (1.50–4.00), p = 0.000), SSc cardiac involvement (HR = 2.02 (1.13–3.60)), polypharmacy (HR = 1.15 (1.07–1.24), p = 0.0002), cardiovascular comorbidities (HR = 2.02 (1.13–3.62), p = 0.018) and age (HR = 1.02 (1.00–1.05), p = 0.044) are all significantly linked to an elevated risk of death in patients with SSc. In contrast, diabetes was associated with a reduced mortality (HR = 0.05 (0.006–0.40), p = 0.004) in our study.

### Systemic sclerosis following COVID-19 infection with recurrent corticosteroid-induced scleroderma renal crisis [^114bzA5A]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Systemic sclerosis is a complex multisystem connective tissue disease resulting in fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Exposure to corticosteroids can trigger scleroderma renal crisis, a life-threatening complication of the disease. Autoimmune disease following infection with COVID-19 is being increasingly recognised. The mechanisms of post-COVID-19 autoimmunity are likely multifactorial, involving immune dysregulation, molecular mimicry and the development of cross-reactive antibodies. There are currently only two reported cases of systemic sclerosis occurring post-COVID-19 infection.

We present the case of a female patient who developed systemic sclerosis post-COVID-19 infection. Following exposure to corticosteroids, the patient developed scleroderma renal crisis complicated by thrombotic microangiopathy, seizures and acute renal failure. Despite an antibody profile not typically associated with renal crisis (anti-topoisomerase positive, anti-RNA-polymerase III negative), the patient developed recurrent renal crisis with repeated exposure to corticosteroid therapy, highlighting the risk of steroid use in all patients with systemic sclerosis.

Current Therapies

If evidence of neurological or cardiac compromise is present at onset of SRC, rapid reduction of blood pressure is necessitated. However, if such symptoms are not present, a more gradual reduction in blood pressure can be afforded (10% reduction in systolic BP per day) and confers a better chance of renal recovery. Recommendations for SRC management developed by expert consensus of the UKSSG are shown in Fig. 3.

ACEi should be started as soon as SRC is diagnosed. If the patient is already taking an ACEi, then the dose should be increased. A long-acting ACEi such as ramipril is most used but short-acting agents such as captopril may be suitable in cases of haemodynamic compromise. A long-acting agent is preferable in most cases as it can be easily up-titrated to maximum dose, normally by doubling the dose at 24-h intervals.

Adequate control of blood pressure often takes 3–5 days. It is important to note that renal function can continue to deteriorate despite initiation of ACEi and correction of blood pressure. This should not prompt discontinuation of this important therapy. Additional agents can be added to achieve blood pressure control, including calcium channel blockers, alpha antagonists, and clonidine. Intravenous therapies such as GTN or Iloprost can be used with the latter having the added benefit of discouraging platelet and vascular endothelial activation.

ACEi should be continued life-long, even if the patient is dialysis-dependant as an ACEi will improve the chance of the patient subsequently managing to become dialysis-independent.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can be used if ACEi is contraindicated or not tolerated; however, studies have suggested that ARBs are not clinically equivalent in treatment of SRC. Importantly, ARBs do not inhibit degradation of bradykinin, an agent which is needed in SRC due to its vasodilatory effects. Dual-agent therapy is associated with higher risk of adverse events; therefore, ACEi alone is preferable.

### Renal disease and systemic sclerosis: an update on scleroderma renal crisis [^1175sgiF]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Overview

The earliest description considered to represent SRC originated from Auspitz in 1863 who described the rapid death of a patient with thickened skin and uraemia. In the late 1930s, some of the histological hallmarks of SRC such as intimal hyperplasia of the renal vessels and fibrinoid degeneration in interlobular arteries were described. In one of these cases, the patient had been diagnosed with SSc and obliterative endarteritis of the kidney. The histological abnormalities observed in the kidneys were also described in SSc patients who did not suffer from SRC. The term 'renal-crisis' was coined by Moore and Sheehan in 1952. Treatment of SRC has historically consisted of aggressive anti-hypertensive therapy using methyldopa or propranolol with dialysis and in some cases bilateral nephrectomy. Mortality significantly reduced with the introduction of ACEi in the 1980s; however, European League Against Rheumatism Scleroderma Trials and Research (EUSTAR) data has shown no other significant impact on mortality in the post-ACE era. The frequency of SRC does seem to be reducing which may be due to the more widespread use of vasodilator therapy to treat complications of SSc such as Raynaud's phenomenon and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It may also be related to the more judicious use of glucocorticoids in patient with SSc due to the recognition that steroids may provoke SRC. Recent studies have also demonstrated that outcome of renal transplant in SRC have improved and are now comparable to other causes of end-stage renal failure (ESRF).

### Systemic sclerosis [^115UCa1o]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Systemic sclerosis, also called scleroderma, is an immune-mediated rheumatic disease that is characterised by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and vasculopathy. Although systemic sclerosis is uncommon, it has a high morbidity and mortality. Improved understanding of systemic sclerosis has allowed better management of the disease, including improved classification and more systematic assessment and follow-up. Additionally, treatments for specific complications have emerged and a growing evidence base supports the use of immune suppression for the treatment of skin and lung fibrosis. Some manifestations of the disease, such as scleroderma renal crisis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, digital ulceration, and gastro-oesophageal reflux, are now treatable. However, the burden of non-lethal complications associated with systemic sclerosis is substantial and is likely to become more of a challenge. Here, we review the clinical features of systemic sclerosis and describe the best practice approaches for its management. Furthermore, we identify future areas for development.

### Association of renal resistive indices with kidney disease progression and mortality [^117JAEKQ]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study confirms RRI as an independent factor associated with death in patients with CKD. According to our results, an increase of 0.01 in RRI increases the death by 7% after a mean follow-up of 73 months. This association is sustained after adjustment to cardiovascular risk factors, kidney function, ACR, therapeutic and lifestyle interventions. Our results concur with Toledo et al. who analyzed 1962 patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 and found that RRI > 0.7 was associated with higher mortality. Similarly, Romano et al. followed 131 patients with a mean age of 76 years, for a median of 7.5 years and found that patients with RRI ≥ 0.80 had a faster kidney function loss and higher mortality, and similar to our results, their AUROCs of RRI for predicting mortality and progression of renal disease were 0.67 and 0.66 respectively. Leodori et al. followed also 122 patients with systemic sclerosis and different levels of eGFR and demonstrated that RRI is an independent predictor of mortality.

Definition of kidney failure and covariates

Kidney failure was defined as a combination of ICD-10 codes (N18–19, Z49, Z94.0 and Z99.2) and an RID code assigned to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) that required haemodialysis (V001), peritoneal dialysis (V003) or kidney transplantation (V005). Covariates were defined as described in previous studies (online supplemental table S1).

### Scleroderma renal crisis as an initial presentation of systemic sclerosis: a case report and review of the literature [^112aQbZZ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a life-threatening complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) that is characterised by new-onset malignant hypertension and progressive acute renal failure, often with associated microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. SRC was at one time almost uniformly fatal, with death often occurring within a few weeks. With the development of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), survival has improved dramatically, but death rates still remain unacceptably high. About 20% of SRC cases occur prior to making a diagnosis of SSc and, in some cases, there is no evidence of skin sclerosis at the time that SRC develops. In this report, we present a case in which a patient developed SRC prior to being diagnosed with scleroderma. Additionally, we review the pathogenesis, presenting signs and symptoms, management and prognosis of SRC.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^114wY3vN]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to SRC, CKD appears to be a significant prognostic factor for long-term outcome in SSc and may reflect broader renal and vascular pathology than SRC. Management of renal disease in SSc should include consideration of renal comorbidity, drug toxicity and overlap rheumatic disease such as SLE or vasculitis that may occur in SSc. It should be noted that SRC is very rare in jSSc and alternative diagnoses should be considered. Because of the rarity of SRC in jSSc, we do not know if ARA are associated with an increased risk of SRC in children. Paediatric consensus and best practice do not suggest minimising glucocorticoid treatment in jSSc due to the extreme rarity of SRC in this group and the frequent overlap features in children with jSSc, which often requires glucocorticoid treatment.

Guideline recommendations for treatment of SRC:

ACEi should be initiated or continued in all cases of diagnosed SRC and up titrated to maximum therapeutic dose (GRADE 1A, 100%).
Other antihypertensive drugs are often required to control hypertension and can be added based on clinical need (1B, 99%).
In adults, glucocorticoid treatment should be minimized in SSc due to association with increased SRC (1A, 96%).
When required, renal replacement therapy should initially use the least haemodynamically demanding approach (e.g. haemofiltration or peritoneal dialysis) (1C, 99%).
Renal biopsy should be considered when diagnosis is uncertain (especially if substantial proteinuria, ANCA+, overlap serology SLE, etc) (1C, 99%).
Referral for renal transplantation may be considered after 12 months in cases without features suggesting significant renal recovery (1B, 99%).

### Detection and evaluation of chronic kidney disease [^11581GHJ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 19 million adult Americans, and its incidence is increasing rapidly. Diabetes and hypertension are the underlying causes in most cases of chronic kidney disease. Evidence suggests that progression to kidney failure can be delayed or prevented by controlling blood sugar levels and blood pressure and by treating proteinuria. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease often is overlooked in its earliest, most treatable stages. Guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommend estimating glomerular filtration rate and screening for albuminuria in patients with risk factors for chronic kidney disease, including diabetes, hypertension, systemic illnesses, age greater than 60 years, and family history of chronic kidney disease. The glomerular filtration rate, calculated by using a prediction equation, detects chronic kidney disease more accurately than does the serum creatinine level alone; the glomerular filtration rate also is used for disease staging. In most clinical situations, analysis of random urine samples to determine the albumin-creatinine or protein-creatinine ratio has replaced analysis of timed urine collections. When chronic kidney disease is detected, an attempt should be made to identify and treat the specific underlying condition(s). The KDOQI guidelines define major treatment goals for all patients with chronic kidney disease. These goals include slowing disease progression, detecting and treating complications, and managing cardiovascular risk factors. Primary care physicians have an important role in detecting chronic kidney disease early, in instituting measures to slow disease progression, and in providing timely referral to a nephrologist.

### Sodium glucose Co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with systemic sclerosis with or without heart failure [^117F4aqg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with systemic sclerosis are at heightened risk of developing heart failure. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown cardio-renal benefits in diverse populations with cardio-renal dysfunction, but their impact on outcomes in patients with systemic sclerosis has not been described.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used the Research Network of the TriNetX platform to compare outcomes between patients with systemic sclerosis prescribed with SGLT2 inhibitors versus those without SGLT2i prescription, using data from January 1, 2013, to May 6, 2025. Following propensity score matching, each cohort included 1,402 patients with balanced baseline characteristics (standardized mean differences < 0.2). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included first-time heart failure diagnosis, acute heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization, stroke, cardiac arrest, and chronic kidney disease.

Results

SGLT2i prescription was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44–0.66), stroke (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42–0.96), and hospitalization (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.86). Notably, patients without a history of heart failure (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45–0.87) and patients with a history of heart failure also had a lower risk of hospitalization (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57–1.00). No significant differences were observed in the risks of major adverse cardiovascular events, acute myocardial infarction, or chronic kidney disease.

Conclusion

In this real-world analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with reduced mortality, stroke, and hospitalization in patients with systemic sclerosis, supporting their potential therapeutic role in this population.

### Management of scleroderma renal crisis [^113TggVu]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a life-threatening manifestation in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is usually presented by an acute onset of severe hypertension together with an acute kidney injury. We can conceptualize SRC as a systemic syndrome with features that extend beyond the involvement of the kidney. The goal of this review is to inform clinicians about the risk factors for SRC in patients with SSc and to emphasize the importance of early identification and initiation of treatment.

Recent Findings

For the past 3 decades, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) to treat SRC, has been rightfully synonymized with a good outcome, and has changed the trajectory of mortality in SRC. Despite this, SRC still figures in one of the top four causes of mortality in patients with SSc. There is a need for additional therapeutic agents to treat SRC that is refractory to ACE-I. There has been a recent interest in combining ACE-I with endothelin receptor blockers and agents targeting the complement component 5. There is no role for using ACE-I prophylactically in high-risk patients.

Summary

Early diagnosis of SRC is the key, and early initiation of ACE-I is life-saving and associated with a better prognosis. We should consider renal transplantation in selected patients, especially those on long-term dialysis.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — distinguishing diabetic kidney disease (DKD) from other systemic diseases notes that systemic diseases most likely to be confused with DKD are those that cause mild to moderate proteinuria and a slow progressive decrease in eGFR, and differentiation requires clinical suspicion and appropriate diagnostic testing. It is the opinion of the Work Group that in the absence of another identifiable and treatable cause of kidney disease, patients with diabetes and CKD should be treated as if they have DKD.

### Current status of gadolinium toxicity in patients with kidney disease [^113wL23k]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) agents have recently been the subject of intense interest for physicians across numerous specialties. These agents are widely used as contrast for magnetic resonance imaging and have been generally considered safe. Early on, phase III trials and small studies in low-risk patients suggested a benign renal profile; however, more recent studies raised the possibility of nephrotoxicity, although it is not clear whether it approaches the incidence of nephropathy associated with iodinated radiocontrast. In 2006, reports of a rare systemic fibrosing condition called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) were recently linked to exposure of patients with advanced kidney disease to GBC agents. Analysis of the data suggests that certain GBC agents are more likely to be associated with NSF. Also, not all patients with kidney disease are at risk for developing NSF, only those with advanced acute or chronic kidney disease. Avoidance of GBC exposure is the best approach for high-risk patients. When GBC is required to obtain optimal images, use of low dosages of more stable macrocyclic agents is safer and preferred. This article reviews the current status of GBC agents as nephrotoxins and causes of NSF and provides opinions on how to use these agents in patients with underlying kidney disease.

### A qualitative metasynthesis of the experience of fatigue across five chronic conditions [^111oaKrw]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Fatigue is a symptom reported by patients with a variety of chronic conditions. However, it is unclear whether fatigue is similar across conditions. Better understanding its nature could provide important clues regarding the mechanisms underlying fatigue and aid in developing more effective therapeutic interventions to decrease fatigue and improve quality of life.

Objectives

To better understand the nature of fatigue, we performed a qualitative metasynthesis exploring patients' experiences of fatigue across five chronic noninfectious conditions: heart failure, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Methods

We identified 34 qualitative studies written in the last 10 years describing fatigue in patients with one of the aforementioned conditions using three databases (Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL). Studies with patient quotes describing fatigue were synthesized, integrated, and interpreted.

Results

Across conditions, patients consistently described fatigue as persistent overwhelming tiredness, severe lack of energy, and physical weakness that worsened over time. Four common themes emerged: running out of batteries, a bad life, associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired cognition, and depression), and feeling misunderstood by others, with a fear of not being believed or being perceived negatively.

Conclusion

In adults with heart failure, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we found that fatigue was characterized by severe energy depletion, which had negative impacts on patients' lives and caused associated symptoms that exacerbated fatigue. Yet, fatigue is commonly misunderstood and inadequately acknowledged.

The Role of ACEi

Interestingly, it has been found that whilst ACEi reduce mortality as treatment for SRC, prior use of ACEi, or prophylactic use, has been associated with worse long-term outcomes and higher frequency of long-term dialysis after SRC. The most widely accepted explanation for this is that small doses of ACEi are not sufficient to treat SRC but may mask the development of hypertension, an important clinical warning sign, leading to delay in treatment and a less reversible, more chronic process. Indeed, those with normotensive SRC have been shown to have worse long-term outcomes.

The ISRCS found a greater than twofold increased risk of mortality in SRC with prior exposure to ACEi; however, many of the patients on ACEi were for indications other than pure prophylaxis of SRC (two case where prophylaxis was used due to glucocorticoid exposure in a high risk patient) so there is a possibility that the results were confounded by clinical severity. Further studies have not shown conclusive evidence to support the use of ACEi prophylactically.

In practice, cases considered to be particularly high risk such as those undergoing autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) due to the high dose of glucocorticoids and IV fluid used are given ACEi therapy a few weeks prior to initiating the AHSTC; however, there is no conclusive evidence that ACEi prophylaxis in this context is beneficial.

Renal crisis occurs in patients who have systemic sclerosis with rapidly progressive diffuse cutaneous thickening early in their disease. SRC is characterized by malignant hypertension, hyperreninemia, azotemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and renal failure. SRC was almost uniformly fatal, but in most cases it can now be successfully treated with ACE inhibitors. This therapy has improved survival, reduced the requirement for dialysis, and often allowed for the discontinuation of dialysis 6 to 18 months later. Prompt diagnosis and early, aggressive initiation of therapy with ACE inhibitors will result in the most optimal outcome.

### Systemic sclerosis [^114P1K4h]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Systemic sclerosis is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by a chronic and frequently progressive course and by extensive patient-to-patient variability. Like other autoimmune diseases, systemic sclerosis occurs more frequently in women, with a peak of onset in the fifth decade of life. The exact cause of systemic sclerosis remains elusive but is likely to involve environmental factors in a genetically primed individual. Pathogenesis is dominated by vascular changes; evidence of autoimmunity with distinct autoantibodies and activation of both innate and adaptive immunity; and fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs that results in irreversible scarring and organ failure. Intractable progression of vascular and fibrotic organ damage accounts for the chronic morbidity and high mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis and classification might improve patient outcomes. Screening strategies facilitate timely recognition of life-threatening complications and initiation of targeted therapies to halt their progression. Effective treatments of organ-based complications are now within reach. Discovery of biomarkers - including autoantibodies that identify patient subsets at high risk for particular disease complications or rapid progression - is a research priority. Understanding the key pathogenetic pathways, cell types and mediators underlying disease manifestations opens the door for the development of targeted therapies with true disease-modifying potential.

### Systemic sclerosis / scleroderma: a treatable multisystem disease [^1125n3B1]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (systemic scleroderma) is a chronic connective tissue disease of unknown etiology that causes widespread microvascular damage and excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and internal organs. Raynaud phenomenon and scleroderma (hardening of the skin) are hallmarks of the disease. The typical patient is a young or middle-age woman with a history of Raynaud phenomenon who presents with skin induration and internal organ dysfunction. Clinical evaluation and laboratory testing, along with pulmonary function testing, Doppler echocardiography, and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, establish the diagnosis and detect visceral involvement. Patients with systemic sclerosis can be classified into two distinct clinical subsets with different patterns of skin and internal organ involvement, autoantibody production, and survival. Prognosis is determined by the degree of internal organ involvement. Although no disease-modifying therapy has been proven effective, complications of systemic sclerosis are treatable, and interventions for organ-specific manifestations have improved substantially. Medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-II receptor blockers for Raynaud phenomenon, appropriate treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease) and lifestyle modifications can help prevent complications, such as digital ulcers and Barrett esophagus. Endothelin-1 receptor blockers and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors improve pulmonary arterial hypertension. The risk of renal damage from scleroderma renal crisis can be lessened by early detection, prompt initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, and avoidance of high-dose corticosteroids. Optimal patient care includes an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to promptly and effectively recognize, evaluate, and manage complications and limit end-organ dysfunction.
