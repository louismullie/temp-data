## Question

can naltrexone help to stimulate mu receptor to still help with mood

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether naltrexone can stimulate the mu-opioid receptor to help with mood. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about naltrexone's pharmacology at standard doses versus low-dose naltrexone. Then, I should verify whether any paradoxical or indirect mechanisms could enhance opioid tone without direct mu agonism. Next, I will examine clinical data for mood effects and weigh negative versus positive evidence. After that, I need to check guideline positions and standard indications. Finally, I should review safety considerations and synthesize a clinically sound conclusion with appropriate cautions [^115R7M1d] [^115fGgwB].

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology, because if naltrexone were an agonist at mu receptors, that would fundamentally change the answer. Naltrexone is characterized in FDA labeling as a pure opioid antagonist with highest affinity at the mu-opioid receptor and little to no intrinsic agonist activity, producing competitive blockade of opioid receptors rather than stimulation, so at therapeutic doses it cannot "stimulate" mu receptors to improve mood [^115R7M1d] [^11387xWQ]. I should double-check whether this blockade reduces hedonic or reward responses in humans; indeed, naltrexone attenuates pleasantness and relief ratings and is known to blunt opioid-mediated reward signaling, which mechanistically argues against mood enhancement via mu stimulation [^114sNH5T] [^116ijqH6].

> Wait, let me verify something nuanced about low-dose naltrexone. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN, typically around 1–4.5 mg) transiently blocks opioid receptors and may induce compensatory upregulation of endogenous opioids and receptor expression; however, this is an indirect rebound phenomenon rather than direct receptor stimulation, and importantly, reviews suggest this adaptive effect favors kappa over mu signaling and includes anti-inflammatory actions via TLR4 antagonism on microglia, which could secondarily influence mood in inflammatory states rather than by mu agonism per se [^111Mgspr] [^114AuqZP]. Hold on, I initially thought LDN might preferentially enhance mu signaling, but the dermatology review emphasizes a tilt toward kappa effects and TLR4 modulation, so I should correct that assumption and keep the mechanism framed as indirect and not mu-selective [^111Mgspr].

> Next, I should review direct evidence for mood benefits, being careful not to over-interpret preliminary findings. A small randomized, proof-of-concept augmentation trial in MDD using LDN showed signal on some depression scales but was underpowered and conducted in patients already on dopaminergic regimens, with the authors hypothesizing dopaminergic rather than opioidergic mediation; this suggests possible benefit but does not support mu receptor stimulation as the mechanism of action, and replication is needed [^112MP3rS]. Let me also consider opioid system modulation more broadly: ALKS 5461 combined buprenorphine (partial mu agonist) with samidorphan (mu antagonist) and demonstrated antidepressant activity, but this reflects a specific mixed-agonist/antagonist strategy rather than naltrexone alone acting as a mu stimulant, so extrapolation to naltrexone monotherapy for mood would be inappropriate [^115p5ckg].

> I will now examine evidence that cuts the other way, because I need to ensure I am not cherry-picking positive signals. In healthy participants and laboratory models, naltrexone reduces hedonic responses, and it mitigates stimulant-induced euphoria, which is consistent with mu blockade rather than mu stimulation and raises concern that it may dampen positive affect in certain contexts rather than enhance it [^114sNH5T] [^116qYygz]. I should confirm labeling regarding mood: FDA materials caution about depression and suicidal ideation with naltrexone, reminding me to avoid concluding that naltrexone improves mood as a class effect, particularly at standard doses where opioid reward is blocked rather than enhanced [^116WjGnU] [^113Mc1vX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before we check practice guidelines, because these signal the quality and consistency of evidence. Major guidelines restrict naltrexone's use to alcohol and opioid use disorders and do not endorse it for primary mood disorders, underscoring that any mood application would be off-label and evidence-limited; APA recommends naltrexone for moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorder, and ASAM supports extended-release naltrexone for relapse prevention in OUD when appropriate, but neither positions naltrexone as a mood treatment [^116vLf6i] [^116NfGsS]. I should also verify that oral naltrexone is generally not recommended for OUD outside limited situations due to adherence issues, which further highlights that standard indications are substance use disorders rather than mood conditions [^1163D3nr] [^112H9JZw].

> I need to ensure the safety context is clear, because any off-label mood rationale must be weighed against predictable risks. Naltrexone can precipitate severe withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, block endogenous and exogenous opioid-mediated reward, complicate acute analgesia, and increase vulnerability to overdose as blockade wanes due to lost tolerance, all of which can adversely affect mood or safety if not carefully managed [^11387xWQ] [^115R7M1d] [^116h6R6o] [^116Tkmub]. But wait, what if anti-inflammatory effects of LDN indirectly improve mood in inflammatory or centralized pain states? That possibility exists via TLR4/microglial modulation and is being explored, yet the evidence base remains small and heterogeneous, so clinical enthusiasm should be tempered and individualized [^114AuqZP] [^117T55zg].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Direct mu receptor stimulation by naltrexone does not occur; at usual therapeutic doses naltrexone competitively antagonizes mu receptors and reduces hedonic/reward responses, whereas at low doses it may indirectly upregulate endogenous opioids and modulate neuroinflammation, with any mood benefit being plausible but unproven and not due to direct mu agonism; hence, naltrexone should not be considered a mu-receptor stimulant for mood enhancement, and any off-label LDN trial should be cautious, mechanistically framed as anti-inflammatory or rebound-endogenous-opioid modulation, and accompanied by close monitoring for mood worsening and safety risks [^115R7M1d] [^111Mgspr] [^112MP3rS] [^114sNH5T].

No, naltrexone does not stimulate mu-opioid receptors; it is a **pure antagonist** [^11387xWQ] that blocks these receptors [^115R7M1d] and can reduce hedonic tone, potentially worsening mood in some patients [^114sNH5T]. At low doses, naltrexone may transiently increase endogenous opioids via brief blockade, but this is not reliable or clinically established for mood improvement [^111Mgspr] [^114AuqZP]. For mood enhancement via mu-opioid pathways, **partial agonists like buprenorphine** are more appropriate [^11114TCj] [^115p5ckg].

---

## Pharmacological properties of naltrexone

Naltrexone is a **pure opioid antagonist** with high mu-opioid receptor affinity; it competitively blocks endogenous and exogenous opioids without intrinsic agonist activity [^115fGgwB] [^11387xWQ]. It is indicated for opioid and alcohol dependence, **not for mood enhancement** [^116vLf6i] [^116C8NJV].

---

## Naltrexone's interaction with mu-opioid receptors

Naltrexone binds mu-opioid receptors and **prevents their activation** by endogenous opioids [^11387xWQ], which can reduce hedonic tone and may worsen mood in some patients [^114sNH5T] [^116ijqH6]. It **does not stimulate mu-opioid receptors** or enhance mood through this pathway.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding mood effects of naltrexone

Clinical evidence shows naltrexone **does not improve mood** via mu-opioid receptor stimulation and may reduce hedonic tone, worsening mood in some patients [^114sNH5T] [^112UbAs1]. It is not indicated for mood enhancement and may precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals, further worsening mood [^11387xWQ] [^115R7M1d].

---

## Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) and mood

LDN (1–5 mg/day) is hypothesized to transiently increase endogenous opioids via brief receptor blockade, but evidence for mood improvement is **limited and inconsistent** [^111Mgspr] [^112MP3rS]. LDN is **not a reliable** or clinically established method for mood enhancement [^114AuqZP].

---

## Alternative medications for mood enhancement via mu-opioid receptors

Partial agonists like buprenorphine can enhance mood by partially activating mu-opioid receptors, providing antidepressant effects without full-agonist risks [^11114TCj]. Buprenorphine is being studied for treatment-resistant depression and may be **more appropriate** for mood enhancement via mu-opioid pathways [^115p5ckg].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Clinicians should recognize that naltrexone **does not stimulate** mu-opioid receptors or enhance mood [^11387xWQ] and may reduce hedonic tone, worsening mood in some patients [^114sNH5T]. For mood enhancement via mu-opioid pathways, **partial agonists like buprenorphine** may be more appropriate [^11114TCj] [^115p5ckg]. Naltrexone is a **pure antagonist** that blocks mu-opioid receptors and is not indicated for mood enhancement [^115R7M1d].

### Endogenous opioids contribute to the feeling of pain relief in humans [^114sNH5T]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Naltrexone intake resulted in reduced relief (mean ± SD at "170": 54.6 ± 21.6, "195": 55.8 ± 23.7) and pleasantness ratings ("170": 58.7 ± 21.2, "195": 53.8 ± 26.3) compared with placebo (relief "170": 61.8 ± 21.4, "195": 64.9 ± 24.6; pleasantness "170": 63.1 ± 25.0, "195": 63.5 ± 24.8) at both target pain intensities (F[1177.5] = 9.29, P = 0.0027; Fig. 2A). The target pain intensity had no effect on relief or pleasantness ratings (F[1178.4] = 0.0046, P = 0.95), and relief and pleasantness ratings did not differ from each other (F[1177.2] = 0.034, P = 0.85). Neither interaction effects nor the effect of sex was significant and therefore removed from the model. In the final model, 14 potential influential observations (of 207) were identified. Removal of the respective datapoints did not change the statistical inference of the model.

Naltrexone reduces relief/pleasantness ratings. Naltrexone effect on relief/pleasantness ratings at target pain intensities "170" and "195" is displayed as raw values in the naltrexone and placebo session (A) and as the difference in relief/pleasantness ratings between the naltrexone and the placebo session (negative value denoting a reduction of the ratings by naltrexone) (B). The raincloud plots display the raw data (colored dots), mean values and 95% confidence intervals (black dots/diamonds and bars), and probability distributions (vertical "clouds"). In (A), each dot represents the maximum relief/pleasantness rating averaged over 2 trials at the respective target pain.

### Vivitrol [^115R7M1d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist with the highest affinity for the mu opioid receptor. Naltrexone has little or no opioid agonist activity.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Naltrexone has few, if any, intrinsic actions besides its opioid blocking properties. However, it does produce some pupillary constriction by an unknown mechanism. The administration of Vivitrol is not associated with the development of tolerance or dependence. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, Vivitrol will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology. Occupation of opioid receptors by naltrexone may block the effects of endogenous opioid peptides. It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of exogenous opioids. The neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the reduction in alcohol consumption observed in alcohol-dependent patients treated with naltrexone are not entirely understood. However, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids by competitive binding at opioid receptors. This makes the blockade produced potentially surmountable, but overcoming full naltrexone blockade by administration of opioids may result in non-opioid receptor-mediated symptoms such as histamine release. Vivitrol is not aversive therapy and does not cause a disulfiram-like reaction either as a result of opioid use or ethanol ingestion.

- **Absorption**: Vivitrol is an extended-release, microsphere formulation of naltrexone designed to be administered by intramuscular (IM) gluteal injection every

### Opioid modulation with buprenorphine/samidorphan as adjunctive treatment for inadequate response to antidepressants: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115p5ckg]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder has been associated with dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system. The authors sought to determine whether opioid modulation achieved through administration of ALKS 5461, a combination of a μ- and κ-opioid partial agonist, buprenorphine, and a μ-opioid antagonist, samidorphan, would exhibit antidepressant activity in patients with major depression.

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage sequential parallel comparison design study was conducted in adults with major depression who had an inadequate response to one or two courses of antidepressant treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive treatment with 2 mg/2 mg of buprenorphine/samidorphan (the 2/2 dosage group), 8 mg/8 mg of buprenorphine/samidorphan (the 8/8 dosage group), or placebo. The antidepressant effect was measured based on change from baseline to the end of 4 weeks of treatment on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Clinical Global Impressions severity scale (CGI-S).

Compared with the placebo group, there were significantly greater improvements in the 2/2 dosage group across the three depression outcome measures (HAM-D: -2.8, 95% CI = -5.1, -0.6; MADRS: -4.9, 95% CI = -8.2, -1.6; CGI-S: -0.5, 95% CI = -0.9, -0.1). There was also evidence of improvement in the 8/8 dosage group, although it did not achieve statistical significance. Overall, the buprenorphine/samidorphan combinations were well tolerated, and there was no evidence.

### Low-dose naltrexone for treatment of dermatologic conditions: A clinical review [^111Mgspr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid receptor antagonist that may be compounded at lower doses (1–5 mg) to treat inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) transiently blocks the opioid receptor, resulting in increased ligand and receptor expression, favoring κ over μ receptors and decreasing inflammatory mediators and itch.

In addition, LDN antagonizes non-opioid receptors, including the pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). Altogether, the anti-inflammatory properties of LDN have supported its use in dermatologic conditions, including Hailey-Hailey disease, Darier disease, pruritus, lichen planus, psoriasis, dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and body-focused repetitive behaviors. LDN has demonstrated efficacy in treating these dermatologic conditions with improvement in disease severity, body surface area involvement, and associated symptoms. However, clinical response may vary based on initial disease presentation. There is also evidence supporting LDN in combination with other anti-inflammatory agents.

Fewer side effects have been reported with LDN compared to standard naltrexone doses, though larger studies are required to optimize dosage and management. LDN is frequently compounded by a pharmacy, which may pose barriers to access. In this clinical review, we describe updated and practical uses of LDN in inflammatory dermatologic conditions, associated side effects, cost barriers, and comparisons to standard naltrexone doses.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1175mSjp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, and more specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not using oral naltrexone for the treatment of OUD, except under very limited circumstances, due to poor medication adherence. It should be reserved for patients able to comply with special techniques to enhance their adherence, such as observed dosing. The guidelines recognize that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, issues with medication adherence.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^115fGgwB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naltrexone hydrochloride is a pure opioid antagonist. It does not lead to physical or psychological dependence. Tolerance to the opioid antagonist effect is not known to occur.

### Opioid dependence: Rationale for and efficacy of existing and new treatments [^115Ei4hL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Opioid dependence is a chronic and relapsing medical disorder with a well-established neurobiological basis. Opioid agonist treatments, such as methadone and the recently approved buprenorphine, stabilize opioid receptors and the intracellular processes that lead to opioid withdrawal and craving. Both methadone and buprenorphine have been proven effective for the treatment of opioid dependence and can contribute to a decreased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In addition, a buprenorphine/naloxone combination appears to have a decreased potential for abuse or diversion compared with that associated with methadone. Largely because of these properties, recent legislation now affords an unprecedented opportunity for general physicians to offer opioid agonist treatment through their offices. This review focuses on the neurobiological basis of opioid dependence, the rationale for methadone and buprenorphine treatments, and issues in prescribing these medications to patients with HIV infection.

### Antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor in the cancer patient: Fact or fiction [^111qpkCH]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Opioids are a cornerstone in the management of perioperative pain, but their use is also linked to potentially worse oncological outcomes. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is overexpressed in many cancer types compared to normal tissue, and its activation appears to facilitate VEGF-induced angiogenesis, increase vascular permeability, and blunt the immune response. However, the role of opioids and MOR in tumor progression is still debated due to the flawed design of numerous preclinical studies. It is believed that antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor may play a role in cancer progression since MOR activation is linked to tumor progression, and MOR antagonism has been postulated as a potential target strategy for cancer treatment.

There are two types of mu-opioid receptor antagonists: those with a central effect, such as naltrexone (NTX), and those that act only peripherally, such as peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). PAMORAs are specifically designed to avoid blood–brain barrier penetration and counteract the mu-opioid-related side effects outside the central nervous system (CNS). They have been studied in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative ileus (POI). Their main therapeutic indication is opioid-induced constipation (OIC) related to MOR activation in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. These agents are considered safe, effective, and well-tolerated.

Nonetheless, mu-opioid receptor antagonists can influence cancer progression through alternative pathways, such as interactions with opioid growth factor-opioid pathways.

### Naltrexone may block euphoria-like placebo effect [^116Ehtke]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a first-line treatment for alcohol use disorders in North America and Europe. It was prescribed to a 63-year-old patient to help control the amount of alcohol consumed per drinking occasion. The patient experienced a paradoxical but consistent side effect of feeling inebriated each time he took naltrexone.

To investigate this phenomenon, we administered naltrexone and a placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion. The patient exhibited a 'high-like' response to all placebo capsules and a decrease in subjectively perceived euphoria shortly after ingestion of naltrexone. Given that this placebo effect could be mediated via opioid receptors, we suggest that this case illustrates the ability of naltrexone to eliminate the placebo effect. This feature of naltrexone, upon further investigation, might be used in randomized clinical trials in addition to or as an alternative to a placebo.

### Opposite effects of opioid blockade on the blood pressure-pain relationship in depressed and non-depressed participants [^112UbAs1]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

The effect of the opioid antagonist naltrexone on the relationship between blood pressure and pain was examined in 24 participants with major depressive disorder and 31 non-depressed controls, before and after 25 minutes of stressful mental arithmetic. Pain was induced by immersing the non-dominant foot in 2 degrees Celsius ice-water for as long as possible or until 4 minutes had elapsed (the cold pressor test). Blood pressure was measured before each cold pressor test and at 2-minute intervals during mental arithmetic.

- **Effects of depression and naltrexone**: In the group as a whole, neither depression nor naltrexone influenced blood pressure at any stage of the experiment. However, naltrexone disrupted an association between elevated resting blood pressure and low levels of pain in non-depressed controls, suggesting that endogenous opioid peptides are involved in blood pressure-mediated analgesia. Effects were similar when expressed in relation to blood pressure during psychological stress.

- **Pain response in depressed participants**: In contrast to controls, blood pressure was unrelated to pain in depressed participants in the placebo condition. However, naltrexone unmasked an association between blood pressure and pain — those with the highest blood pressure reported least cold-induced pain. Thus, endogenous opioids apparently masked an analgesic mechanism linking elevated blood pressure with reduced sensitivity to pain in participants with major depressive disorder.

Noradrenergic mechanisms involved in active coping, stress-induced analgesia, and baroreflexes might account for these findings.

### Naltrexone: Not just for opioids anymore [^114PSZGQ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a semi-synthetic opioid with competitive antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence, but adherence to daily dosing has been recognized as a factor limiting long-term effectiveness. Recently, a long-acting injectable formulation of naltrexone has received FDA approval for treating alcohol and opioid dependence. This article reviews the pharmacology of naltrexone, the evidence supporting the use of extended-release naltrexone, and the clinical challenges in the induction of patients to this medication.

### The burden of obesity in the current world and the new treatments available: Focus on liraglutide 3.0 mg [^116rqiKZ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Naltrexone/bupropion sustained-release (SR) utilizes a combination of naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, and bupropion, which affects adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors in the hypothalamus, to reduce food intake. Although naltrexone alone has minimal effect on weight loss, its combination with bupropion results in a synergistic effect.

Bupropion stimulates the cleavage of POMC and increases the agonism of the melanocortin-4 receptor by releasing α-MSH. Simultaneously, ß-endorphin, another cleavage product of POMC, induces a negative feedback loop in the POMC neuron by binding to the μ opioid receptor, thus reducing neuronal activity. Naltrexone blocks this ß-endorphin opioid-mediated effect, thereby amplifying the effectiveness of α-MSH in reducing food intake.

### μ-opioid receptor system mediates reward processing in humans [^116ijqH6]. Nature Communications (2018). High credibility.

The human reward system promotes motivated behavior toward signals providing safety and opportunities for homeostasis. The endogenous opioid system is intimately involved in both hedonic functions and incentive motivation, as well as in generating pleasurable sensations when consuming palatable foods. Injection of µ-opioids into the mesolimbic reward system is rewarding in its own right, and µ-opioid receptor (MOR) stimulation in the shell of the nucleus accumbens increases pleasure obtained from foods and may also promote feeding.

Opioid agonists increase and opioid antagonists decrease food intake and hedonic responses to palatable foods, respectively. In contrast, inverse MOR agonists diminish the hedonic impact of feeding. These findings are supported by human imaging studies showing that feeding triggers endogenous opioid release in the brain's reward circuit, possibly contributing to the pathophysiology of obesity. Repeated overstimulation of the MOR system following food consumption may lead to lasting downregulation of MOR, providing a candidate neurobiological mechanism that reinforces overeating in obese individuals. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have established that MOR levels are downregulated in patients with morbid obesity and binge-eating disorder.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: A scoping review [^117T55zg]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

At low doses, naltrexone (LDN) has been shown to modulate inflammation through the interruption of microglial cell activation within the central nervous system. One of the most likely contributors to centralized pain is changes in microglial cell processing. Therefore, it has been postulated that LDN can be used to manage patients with pain resulting from central sensitization due to this relationship. This scoping review aims to synthesize the relevant study data for LDN as a novel treatment strategy for various centralized pain conditions.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, guided by the Scale for Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) criteria.

- **Results**: Forty-seven studies related to centralized pain conditions were identified. Many of the studies were case reports/series and narrative reviews, but a few randomized control trials have been conducted. Overall, the body of evidence revealed improvement in patient-reported pain severity and in outcomes related to hyperalgesia, physical function, quality of life, and sleep. Variability in dosing paradigms and the time to patient response was present in the reviewed studies.

- **Conclusions**: Evidence synthesized for this scoping review supports the ongoing use of LDN for the treatment of refractory pain in various centralized chronic pain conditions. Upon review of the currently available published studies, it is apparent that further high-quality, well-powered randomized control trials need to be conducted to establish efficacy, standard dosing paradigms, and long-term effects.

### Buprenorphine [^11114TCj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Buprenorphine sublingual tablets contain buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Subjective effects**: Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.

	- **Opioid agonist ceiling-effects**: These effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent. Both active drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response. However, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8–32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111DUty3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, specifically in relation to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the patient's psychosocial needs and offering or referring them to psychosocial treatment based on their individual requirements, alongside extended-release naltrexone. Do not preclude or delay treatment with naltrexone, along with appropriate medication management, if a patient decides to decline psychosocial treatment or if psychosocial treatment is unavailable. It is advised to consider using motivational interviewing or enhancement techniques to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services that address their individual needs.

### Dose escalation of naltrexone to reduce stress responses associated with opioid antagonist induction: A double-blind randomized trial [^114LsKVT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

To describe the role of opioid antagonist induction in reducing stress response and withdrawal symptoms, the complexity of naltrexone induction is limiting broader applicability of opioid antagonist-assisted abstinence. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the stress response to two low-dose naltrexone induction protocols under minimal oral sedation.

- **Design**: Double-blind randomized controlled trial.
- **Setting**: Open setting in-patient unit.
- **Participants**: Adults with opioid use disorder and at least a year-long history of opioid use.
- **Intervention protocol**: Patients received either a single 12.5mg naltrexone oral dose (SI group) or an escalating dosage regimen starting from 50μg up to a cumulative dose of 12.5mg (ED group).
- **Main outcome measure**: Differences in cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations 1 hour after the start of naltrexone induction.

In all, 124 patients were enrolled, and 68 remained in the trial at the point of randomization — 33 in the SI group and 35 in the ED group. Eight patients were excluded from the final analysis. Plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations were significantly higher in the SI group, with a mean difference between groups of 313nmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 182–444, P < 0.001) and 36.9pg/mL (95% CI 12.3–61.4, P = 0.004), respectively.

- **Secondary outcomes**: SI patients experienced significant increases in plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations and withdrawal scores. In the ED group, these measures remained at or below baseline throughout the 24-hour period from the start of naltrexone induction.

Conclusions highlighted the observed differences between the two protocols, underscoring the potential benefits of an escalating dosage regimen to mitigate stress responses during opioid antagonist induction.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^114eeUuq]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Outcome and follow-up: Case 1**: Now aged 63, 30 years after the initial meningitis, she currently has a normal quality of life with no signs of ill health, although energy levels can reduce slightly during infections, prolonged overexertion, or excessive mental effort. Such reductions can be delayed up to 48 hours after the initial overstimulation, suggestive of continuing mild postexertional malaise. Symptoms such as poor sleep and excessive pain are absent.

Up until starting low-dose naltrexone (LDN), she was receiving the UK Government's Disability Living Allowance at the higher rate for mobility, requiring the person to have severe walking difficulties, and the middle rate for care, requiring frequent help during the day. Three years after starting LDN, these payments were reduced and then finally stopped when it was clear she was stable and well and could walk and, more recently, cycle without problems. Prior to starting LDN, her intellectual and cognitive functioning was very limited. These abilities have returned, apart from continuing cognitive impairments due to the meningitis.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^114dKyWa]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is used as an off-label treatment in low doses for several chronic immune-modulated disorders in many countries. Although only small-scale clinical trials have been performed, these suggest efficacy in several diseases, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War Illness. Despite numerous internet reports of response to low-dose naltrexone (LDN), no clinical trials exist in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. This condition is characterized by chronic profound fatigue, post-exertional malaise, pain, and autonomic and neurocognitive disturbances.

This series of three case reports, compiled by people with long-term ill-health due to chronic fatigue syndrome, shows the range of responses they observed when taking LDN, from life-changing to a reduction in some symptoms only. Treatment doses ranged from 4 to 12 mg. Clinical trials may be warranted to explore the potential use of naltrexone in people with these debilitating illnesses, which currently have no licensed treatments available.

### A combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone blocks compulsive cocaine intake in rodents without producing dependence [^114rkTuu]. Science Translational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine, a synthetic opioid that acts at both μ and κ opioid receptors, can decrease cocaine use in individuals with opioid addiction. However, the potent agonist action of buprenorphine at μ opioid receptors raises its potential for creating opioid dependence in non-opioid-dependent cocaine abusers. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone (a potent μ opioid antagonist with weaker δ and κ antagonist properties) could block compulsive cocaine self-administration without producing opioid dependence.

The effects of buprenorphine and various doses of naltrexone on cocaine self-administration were assessed in rats that self-administered cocaine under conditions of either short access (noncompulsive cocaine seeking) or extended access (compulsive cocaine seeking). Buprenorphine alone reproducibly decreased cocaine self-administration. Although this buprenorphine-alone effect was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by naltrexone in both the short-access and the extended-access groups, the combination of the lowest dose of naltrexone with buprenorphine blocked cocaine self-administration in the extended-access group but not in the short-access group.

Rats given this low dose of naltrexone with buprenorphine did not exhibit the physical opioid withdrawal syndrome seen in rats treated with buprenorphine alone, and naltrexone at this dose did not block κ agonist-induced analgesia. The results suggest that the combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone at an appropriate dosage decreases compulsive cocaine self-administration with minimal side effects.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive management plan that includes measures to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following the naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours.

The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

- **Intravenous**: Inject 0.2 mg naloxone and observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal. If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone and observe for an additional 20 minutes.

### Molecular biology of opioid analgesia [^111KoUrd]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Opioids provide excellent pain relief in most patients; however, individual responses to specific opioids can vary significantly, even among the mu opioids. Understanding this variability could greatly enhance our ability to treat patients effectively. Classical pharmacological studies have implied the existence of multiple subtypes of mu opioid receptors. Recently, several variants of the cloned mu opioid receptor have been described. While these variants all exhibit the same selectivity for mu opioids, confirming their classification as mu opioid receptors, they differ in their functional activation by opioids and in their localization within cells and brain regions. These multiple mu opioid receptors may help explain the range of clinical responses observed among patients for various opioid drugs.

### Understanding how opioids contribute to reward and analgesia [^116wVdEF]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Opioids acting at the mu opioid (MOP) receptor produce powerful analgesia. They also produce an intensely rewarding effect that can lead to addiction. The analgesic effect of MOP receptor agonists derives from a direct inhibitory effect on pain transmission at the spinal cord level and through activation of a descending pain-modulatory pathway. The rewarding effect of MOP agonists results from their actions in the mesostriatal dopamine pathway, classically associated with both natural and drug rewards.

Both the analgesic and rewarding effect of MOP agonists are best understood in the context of decision-making under conditions of conflict. Pain is one of many competing motivational states, and endogenous opioids suppress responses to noxious stimuli in the presence of conflicting motivations, such as hunger or a threatening predator. When a food reward is available, MOP agonists microinjected into the mesostriatal circuit promote its consumption while concomitantly suppressing responses to noxious stimulation. The mesostriatal "reward" circuit, thus, appears to perform a function critical to decision-making and can either amplify or suppress responses to noxious stimuli.

Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) is a novel therapeutic treatment option for patients with centralized chronic pain. Numerous small case reports and a few higher-quality trials support the use of LDN in chronic pain. Despite this, LDN is still used off-label for many chronic pain conditions. It is imperative that higher-quality, well-designed, and controlled studies be conducted to expand and potentiate the application of LDN and its utility profile, as well as help with standardization of treatment regimens. Even though such studies are much needed, LDN still offers promising results in the clinical management of refractory symptoms in patients with these chronic centralized pain conditions.

### Naltrexone and buprenorphine combination in the treatment of opioid dependence [^111eYtpL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Naltrexone treatment has demonstrated some advantages for special populations of heroin-addicted individuals, but patients' compliance seems to be very poor, with low adherence and a low retention rate. The kappa-opioid system overdrive seems to contribute to opioid protracted abstinence syndrome, presenting with dysphoria and psychosomatic symptoms during naltrexone treatment. The objective of this observational study was to determine the effectiveness of a functional kappa antagonist in improving the outcome of naltrexone treatment.

A partial mu agonist/kappa antagonist (buprenorphine) and a mu antagonist (naltrexone) were combined during a 12-week protocol, theoretically leaving kappa antagonism as the major medication effect. Sixty patients underwent outpatient rapid detoxification utilizing buprenorphine and opioid antagonists. Starting on the fifth day, 30 patients (Group A) received naltrexone alone. Alternatively, 30 patients (Group B) received naltrexone (50 mg oral dose) plus buprenorphine (4 mg sublingual) for the 12 weeks of the observational study.

The endpoints of the study were retention in treatment, negative urinalyses, and changes in psychological symptoms (Symptom Checklist-90 Revised: SCL-90) and craving scores (visual analysis scale: VAS). Thirty-four subjects (56.67%) completed the 12-week study. Twenty-one patients (35.0%) had all urine samples negative for opiates and cocaine. Nine subjects (15.0%) had urine samples negative for cocaine and opiates for the last four weeks of the study. Five subjects (8.3%) continued to use cocaine during the 12 weeks of the study.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116iiG7k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is recommended that the prescribing physician relay the following information to patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride:

You have been prescribed naltrexone hydrochloride as part of the comprehensive treatment for your alcoholism or drug dependence. You should carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are taking naltrexone hydrochloride. A naltrexone hydrochloride medication card may be obtained from your physician and can be used for this purpose. Carrying the identification card should help to ensure that you can obtain adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, be sure to inform the treating physician that you are receiving naltrexone hydrochloride therapy. You should take naltrexone hydrochloride as directed by your physician.

Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to lower doses of opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued or temporarily interrupted. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to them of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose.

Further, advise patients that because naltrexone hydrochloride can block the effects of opioids, they will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opioid drug in small doses while on naltrexone hydrochloride. Emphasize that administration of large doses of heroin or any other opioid to try to bypass the blockade could be dangerous.

### Randomized, proof-of-concept trial of low dose naltrexone for patients with breakthrough symptoms of major depressive disorder on antidepressants [^112MP3rS]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Given the proposed dopaminergic mechanism of low-dose naltrexone (LDN), we examined its efficacy as augmentation for depressive breakthrough on pro-dopaminergic antidepressant regimens.

- **Methods**: Twelve adults (67% female, mean age = 45 ± 12) with major depressive disorder (MDD) using dopaminergic antidepressant regimens (stimulants, dopamine agonists, bupropion [≥ 300 mg/day], aripiprazole [≤ 2.5 mg/day], or sertraline [≥ 150 mg/day]) were randomized to naltrexone 1 mg b.i.d. (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6) augmentation for three weeks.

- **Results**: All subjects completed the trial. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) scores (primary outcome measure) decreased from 21.2 ± 2.0 to 11.7 ± 7.7 for LDN and from 23.7 ± 2.3 to 17.8 ± 5.9 for placebo (Cohen's d = 0.62; p = 0.3 between treatment groups). HAM-D-28 scores decreased from 26.2 ± 4.0 to 12.0 ± 9.8 for LDN and from 26.3 ± 2.6 to 19.8 ± 6.6 for placebo (d = 1.15; p = 0.097). Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-10 item) scores decreased from 30.4 ± 4.9 to 12.2 ± 8.4 for LDN, and from 30.7 ± 4.3 to 22.8 ± 8.5 for placebo (d = 1.45; p = 0.035). MADRS-15 item scores decreased from 36.6 ± 6.2 to 13.2 ± 8.8 for LDN and from 36.7 ± 4.2 to 26.0 ± 10.0 for placebo (d = 1.49; p = 0.035). Clinical Global Improvement Scale-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased from 4.3 ± 0.5 to 3.0 ± 1.1 for LDN and from 4.3 ± 0.5 to 4.0 ± 0.6 for placebo (d = 1.22; p = 0.064).

- **Limitations**: The study was small with restrictions on allowed antidepressants.

- **Conclusion**: LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed.

### Low dose naltrexone in dermatology [^112Li2kh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been successfully studied as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory therapy in a wide range of conditions, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, cancer, chronic regional pain syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and multiple sclerosis. Recently, off-label use of LDN has been shown to improve dermatologic conditions such as systemic sclerosis, Hailey-Hailey disease, lichen planopilaris, and guttate psoriasis. In this article, we examine the existing evidence for the use of LDN in skin disease and discuss its potential application in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117LwsHF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, especially with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend planning and monitoring the transition from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine. Recognize that transitioning from an antagonist, such as naltrexone, to a full agonist like methadone or a partial agonist such as buprenorphine, is generally less complicated than transitioning from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist. This is because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal.

Start methadone or buprenorphine with initial low doses, as patients transitioning from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have a physical dependence on opioids. Do not initiate the transition until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the patient's system, which is about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor in the cancer patient: Fact or fiction [^116oeotN]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The role of antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor in cancer progression remains to be elucidated. The objective of this review was to summarize the available evidence on the effects of these antagonists on tumor progression and prognosis in different types of cancer, as well as to evaluate the available findings on their mechanism of action.

- **Recent findings**: We have identified studies related to methylnaltrexone (MNTX) and naltrexone (NTX) usage in cancer outcomes. There is consistent preclinical evidence of a potential action of MNTX and NTX on cancer growth and spread, primarily mediated by their effect on the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis, which results in depressed cell replication. However, clinical results are scarce and limited to poor-quality evidence.

- **Summary**: Further high-quality studies are warranted to explore the role of mu-opioid receptor antagonists as a therapeutic option in different types of cancer, especially for patients where classical treatments cause unacceptable side effects.

### Stress-evoked opioid release inhibits pain in major depressive disorder [^1154ZhTC]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

To determine whether stress-evoked release of endogenous opioids might account for hypoalgesia in major depressive disorder (MDD), the mu-opioid antagonist naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo was administered double-blind to 24 participants with MDD and to 31 non-depressed controls. Eighty minutes later, participants completed a painful foot cold pressor test and, following a 5-minute interval, began a 25-minute arithmetic task interspersed with painful electric shocks. Ten minutes later, participants completed a second cold pressor test.

Negative affect was greater in participants with MDD than in non-depressed controls throughout the experiment and increased significantly in both groups during mental arithmetic. Before the math task, naltrexone unmasked direct linear relationships between the severity of depression, negative affect while resting quietly, and cold-induced pain in participants with MDD. In contrast, facilitatory effects of naltrexone on cold- and shock-induced pain were greatest in controls with the lowest depression scores.

Naltrexone strengthened the relationship between negative affect and shock-induced pain during the math task, particularly in the depressed group, and heightened anxiety in both groups toward the end of the task. Thus, mu-opioid activity apparently masked a positive association between negative affect and pain in the most distressed participants. These findings suggest that psychological distress inhibits pain via stress-evoked release of opioid peptides in severe cases of MDD. In addition, tonic endogenous opioid neurotransmission could inhibit depressive symptoms.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^117H91b4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Outcome and follow-up: case 3

He noticed an improved sleep pattern and now has fewer colds, which are no longer associated with an energy dip or subsequent depression. Retrospective scoring of depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale suggests his average mood improved from 13 (11–21 signifies depression) to 7 (0–7 signifies no abnormality), with his anxiety scores being normal throughout. His functional level improved from being mild–moderately limited on a daily basis (60%–70% on a functional activity scale) to mild limitations (80%–90% on a functional activity scale). The improvements are sufficiently marked that he intends to continue low-dose naltrexone long term.

For the past 4 years, he has followed a gluten and wheat-free diet and has been vegan for the past 18 months, partly due to cheese causing increased nasal symptoms. He has not tried altering his diet after starting naltrexone.

### Potential drug interaction with opioid agonist in the setting of chronic low-dose opioid antagonist use [^112J9S5W]. The American journal of emergency medicine (2017). High credibility.

Low dose naltrexone (LDN) has been evaluated in several small studies for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. It is thought to work through modulation of inflammatory mediators and upregulation of endogenous opioid receptors, which may hypersensitize patients to exogenous opioids. Drug-drug interaction screening tools within electronic health records and other services identify this interaction as a risk of opioid withdrawal rather than hypersensitivity.

We present a case of a drug-drug interaction in a patient receiving LDN for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The patient received a single dose of oxycodone 5 mg resulting in obtundation unresponsive to painful stimuli, necessitating the administration of naloxone boluses and infusion, along with admission to the intensive care unit for one night. The patient responded well to naloxone therapy and was discharged in satisfactory condition.

### Butrans [^113Q9Er1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptors, an agonist at delta-opioid receptors, and a partial agonist at ORL-1 (nociceptin) receptors. The contributions of these actions to its analgesic profile are unclear.

- **Mechanism of action**: Buprenorphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Buprenorphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g. pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with worsening hypoxia in overdose situations.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Buprenorphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers, involving a reduction in the responsiveness of these centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.
	- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Buprenorphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed, and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.
	- **Effects on the cardiovascular system**: Buprenorphine produces vasodilation, which may cause hypotension, particularly in hypovolemic patients or individuals receiving other CNS depressants.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^1164w2xv]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is used as an off-label treatment in low doses for several chronic immune-modulated disorders in many countries. Although only small-scale clinical trials have been performed, these suggest efficacy in several diseases, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War Illness.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^111YDpkj]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Given the widespread use of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) in many countries and numerous internet reports, it is somewhat surprising that this is the first medical series of case reports on its use in people with chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis. The mechanism of action for naltrexone at a low dose in this disease group is unknown. It is possibly due to the rebound of endorphins following short-term suppression or direct action suppressing inflammation induced by microglia. There have been no formal dosing studies of naltrexone at low dose in any disorder. Therefore, although the dose of 3–4.5 mg is established in clinical practice, some practitioners use 9 mg (Klimas, personal communication, 2017) or higher in chronic fatigue syndrome cases. Causality and dosing need further study.

All case reports are limited by their lack of controlling for confounding factors and possible placebo responses, which can only be adequately controlled for within a randomized double-blind clinical trial. In the recent placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter trial of rituximab in chronic fatigue syndrome, the placebo response rate was 35%. Alternative explanations for improvements in these cases could also be due to fluctuations in the underlying disease, which can appear as temporary improvements, and occasionally the disease improves spontaneously. However, all three subjects had tried alternative treatments without the long-term effects that LDN has produced, which in cases 2 and 3 were specific to particular symptoms.

### The mixed opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone mitigates stimulant-induced euphoria: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone [^116qYygz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The study's objective was to determine whether naltrexone, a mixed μ-opioid antagonist, could reduce the euphoric effects of stimulants, thus potentially minimizing their abuse in subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Supratherapeutic doses of methylphenidate activate μ-opioid receptors, which are linked to euphoria.

Methods included a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of naltrexone in adults with DSM-IV ADHD receiving open treatment with a long-acting formulation of methylphenidate from January 2013 to June 2015. The Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System methylphenidate (SODAS-MPH) was administered twice daily and titrated to approximately 1 mg/kg/day over 3 weeks, continuing for 3 additional weeks based on response and adverse effects. Participants were adults with ADHD selected for prior experience of euphoria with a 60 mg oral test dose of immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH). The primary outcome measure was Question 2 (Liking a Drug Effect) on the Drug Rating Questionnaire, Subject version, which was assessed after 60 mg oral test doses of IR-MPH were administered following week 3 and week 6 of SODAS-MPH treatment.

Results showed that 37 subjects experiencing stimulant-induced mild euphoria at baseline began an open trial of SODAS-MPH and were randomized to either naltrexone 50 mg/day or placebo. Thirty-one subjects completed the trial through week 3, and 25 subjects completed through week 6. Naltrexone significantly reduced the euphoric effect of IR-MPH during the heightened-risk titration phase.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1117nBQv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

During two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trials evaluating the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment for alcohol dependence, most patients tolerated the drug well. In these studies, a total of 93 patients received naltrexone hydrochloride at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Five of these patients discontinued the drug due to nausea. No serious adverse events were reported during these trials.

Extensive clinical studies evaluating naltrexone hydrochloride for detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals did not identify any single, serious untoward risk associated with its use. However, placebo-controlled studies employing up to five-fold higher doses than the recommended 50 mg per day, specifically up to 300 mg daily, have shown naltrexone hydrochloride can cause hepatocellular injury in a substantial proportion of patients exposed at these higher doses (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).

Aside from this finding, and the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal, available evidence does not suggest that naltrexone hydrochloride, when used at any dose, is a cause of any other serious adverse reaction for patients who are "opioid-free". It is crucial to recognize that naltrexone hydrochloride can precipitate or exacerbate abstinence signs and symptoms in individuals who are not completely free of exogenous opioids.

### Opioid antagonists for smoking cessation [^114jYoBa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The reinforcing properties of nicotine may be mediated through the release of various neurotransmitters both centrally and systemically. People who smoke report positive effects such as pleasure, arousal, and relaxation, as well as relief of negative affect, tension, and anxiety. Opioid (narcotic) antagonists are of particular interest to investigators as potential agents to attenuate the rewarding effects of cigarette smoking.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of opioid antagonists in promoting long-term smoking cessation. The drugs include naloxone and the longer-acting opioid antagonist naltrexone.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for trials of naloxone, naltrexone, and other opioid antagonists and conducted an additional search of MEDLINE using 'narcotic antagonists' and smoking terms in April 2013. We also contacted investigators, when possible, for information on unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized controlled trials comparing opioid antagonists to placebo or an alternative therapeutic control for smoking cessation. We included in the meta-analysis only those trials which reported data on abstinence for a minimum of six months. We also reviewed, for descriptive purposes, results from short-term laboratory-based studies of opioid antagonists designed to evaluate psycho-biological mediating variables associated with nicotine dependence.

Data collection and analysis involved extracting data in duplicate on the study population, the nature of the drug therapy, and the outcome measures.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116Tkmub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Vulnerability to opioid overdose**: After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification.

	- This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication, such as respiratory compromise or arrest and circulatory collapse, if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment.

	- Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is essential that patients inform family members and those closest to them of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose. (See precautions, Information for patients).

	- There is also the possibility that a patient treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is a potent antagonist, the blockade produced is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt, on…

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^116Gspui]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

In rodent models of depression, such as chronic social defeat stress and inflammation-induced depression, it was shown that naltrexone pre-treatment did not block the antidepressant effects of (R, S)-ketamine. However, in a subsequent preclinical study, it was demonstrated that opioid antagonists abolish the ability of (R, S)-ketamine to reduce depression-like behavior and lateral habenula cellular hyperactivity. The authors suggested the opioid system is "necessary but not sufficient" for the antidepressant actions of (R, S)-ketamine in rodents. Activation by morphine, a mu-opioid agonist, at a dose high enough to induce a hedonic response, did not mimic the rapid antidepressant-like effects of ketamine or reduce lateral habenula neuronal activity. The authors argued that in their studies of lateral habenula cellular activity, (R, S)-ketamine did not appear to act as a mu-opioid agonist, but some mu-opioid receptor activity was necessary for NMDA receptor antagonism. In brain regions including the habenula, NMDA receptors and opioid receptors display colocalization, and NMDA receptor activation can be modulated by actions of opioid receptors. Taken together, this suggests a potential interaction that may be explained by direct "crosstalk" between the glutamatergic and the opioid receptor systems, or by convergence at downstream signaling pathways.

There are several potential convergences between opioid signaling and other mechanisms implicated in the antidepressant action of ketamine. For example, the administration of endogenous opioids has been shown to upregulate BDNF expression.

Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that was first developed in 1963. It has historically been used at higher doses (50–100 mg) to treat opioid and alcohol dependence through its antagonistic action on the µ-opioid receptor. Full-dose naltrexone's binding to the µ-opioid receptor blocks the euphoric effect from opioids, thus helping to reduce overall opioid use. The µ-opioid receptor is in a family of G-protein–coupled receptors that, when activated, modulate presynaptic and postsynaptic calcium channels, attenuating the excitability of neurons.

Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) (4.5 mg), on the other hand, was first described in the 1980s as a treatment option to help with inflammation. Since that time, the use of LDN has expanded to treat a variety of medical conditions and syndromes, including chronic pain disorders, chronic fatigue, migraine headaches, and certain skin conditions. The beneficial properties seen at lower doses of naltrexone are due to a paradoxical effect that reduces its affinity for the µ-opioid receptor and instead makes it bind more readily to the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4 is located on the microglial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and this receptor family plays a large role in modulating the inflammatory and cytokine systems. Activation of TLR4 receptors increases activation of glial cells, which in turn leads to increased proinflammatory cytokine production. These modulation effects allow LDN to be used for various chronic pain states in which neuroinflammation has been implicated, including but not limited to complex regional pain syndrome.

### Duramorph [^114tDKoh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Morphine is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of morphine is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Effects on the central nervous system - Morphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Morphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g. pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

Both early and late respiratory depression (up to 24 hours post-dosing) have been reported following neuraxial administration. Circulation of the spinal fluid may also result in high concentrations of morphine reaching the central nervous system.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: A scoping review [^117TrCRy]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Throughout the investigated trials, there was significant variation in the timing of follow-up assessments, with study designs ranging from a day to a year. The average follow-up time was roughly 12 weeks. During these follow-ups, patients exhibited variable responses to LDN, with some showing improvement quickly and others only after more time had passed. Despite the inconsistent timing of improvements, there appears to be an increase in efficacy over time, with a large subset of patients seeing some benefit.

Dosing varied among the studies, ranging from 0.2 mg to 9 mg daily; however, 4.5 mg daily was the most used dosing regimen. It is well published that 4.5 mg daily is a feasible target dose for LDN, likely due to LDN's paradoxical effect, where doses up to 4.5 mg daily appear to enhance opioid signaling, while at higher doses, this effect disappears and opioid antagonism begins. Nonetheless, efficacy was observed with doses as low as 1 mg and as high as 9 mg. It should be noted that under the titration scheme used in many of these published reports, patients were usually started on a lower dose and titrated based on their pain and side effects, usually at the initial follow-up assessment. Therefore, it is unclear whether improvements at subsequent visits are time or dose dependent, which is a limitation of the prior research's rigor. Further studies could focus on when patients first notice symptom changes and trialing various doses without adjustments.

### Prospective investigation of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with hydromorphone or sufentanil: Impact on mood, opioid adverse effects, and recovery [^111Rsp4x]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients experience moderate to severe pain after colorectal surgery, making effective pain management a national and global challenge. Inadequately controlled postoperative pain adversely affects patients, resulting in unnecessary physical, psychological, and emotional manifestations. Safe and effective postoperative analgesia not only reduces postoperative complications but also facilitates rapid recovery and minimizes emotional suffering, including anxiety, fear, depression, disaffection, and frustration. Moreover, favorable postoperative pain management should provide adequate analgesia with a minimum of side effects.

The concept of multimodal analgesia was introduced in the early 1990s and is currently established in clinical practice worldwide. In a multimodal analgesia regimen, opioid analgesics are the primary medications for managing pain in hospitalized patients. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) has been demonstrated to be a delivery method that offers significant benefits to patients with postoperative pain after abdominal operations. Opioids administered via IV-PCA are commonly, almost routinely, provided in the immediate postoperative period after numerous types of surgeries. Over the past two to three decades, efforts to improve opioid analgesia have progressed along two paths: one is to enhance the opioid analgesia effect, and the other is to provide satisfactory pain relief with a minimal side-effect burden. Postoperative opioid analgesics have significant adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, excessive sedation, and respiratory depression.

### Redefining ketamine pharmacology for antidepressant action: Synergistic NMDA and opioid receptor interactions [^114H6nox]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Ketamine is a racemic compound and medication comprised of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine enantiomers and their metabolites. It has been used for decades as a dissociative anesthetic, analgesic, and recreational drug. More recently, ketamine, its enantiomers, and its metabolites have been used or are being investigated for the treatment of refractory depression, as well as for comorbid disorders such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and opioid use disorders. Despite its complex pharmacology, ketamine is referred to as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. In this review, the authors argue that ketamine's pharmacology should be redefined to include opioid receptors and the endogenous opioid system. They also highlight a potential mechanism of action of ketamine for depression that is attributed to bifunctional, synergistic interactions involving NMDA and opioid receptors.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116C8NJV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naltrexone hydrochloride has been shown to completely block the euphoric effects of opioids in both volunteer and addict populations when used for the treatment of opioid addiction. It requires administration methods that enforce compliance to achieve effective opioid blockade. However, it has not been shown to affect the use of cocaine or other non-opioid drugs of abuse.

There are no data demonstrating an unequivocally beneficial effect of naltrexone hydrochloride on recidivism rates among detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals who self-administer the drug. The failure in this context appears to be due to poor medication compliance.

The drug is reportedly most effective in good prognosis opioid addicts who use it as part of a comprehensive occupational rehabilitative program, behavioral contract, or other compliance-enhancing protocol. Unlike methadone or LAAM (levo-alpha-acetyl-methadol), naltrexone hydrochloride does not reinforce medication compliance and is expected to have a therapeutic effect only when administered under conditions that support continued medication use.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^11387xWQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naltrexone hydrochloride is a pure opioid antagonist that markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of intravenously administered opioids. When coadministered with morphine on a chronic basis, naltrexone hydrochloride blocks the physical dependence on morphine, heroin, and other opioids. It has few, if any, intrinsic actions besides its opioid-blocking properties. However, it does produce some pupillary constriction by an unknown mechanism.

The administration of naltrexone hydrochloride is not associated with the development of tolerance or dependence. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, naltrexone hydrochloride will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology. Clinical studies indicate that 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride will block the pharmacologic effects of 25 mg of intravenously administered heroin for periods as long as 24 hours. Other data suggest that doubling the dose of naltrexone hydrochloride provides blockade for 48 hours, and tripling the dose provides blockade for about 72 hours.

Naltrexone hydrochloride blocks the effects of opioids by competitive binding, analogous to competitive inhibition of enzymes, at opioid receptors. This makes the blockade produced potentially surmountable, but overcoming full naltrexone blockade by administration of very high doses of opiates has resulted in excessive symptoms of histamine release in experimental subjects.

The mechanism of action of naltrexone hydrochloride in alcoholism is not understood.

### Oxycontin [^111HtXcQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.

- **Pharmacodynamics: Effects on the central nervous system**: Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in CO₂ tension and electrical stimulation.

Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g. pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10)].

- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum.

### Depression - A major but neglected consequence contributing to the health toll from prescription opioids [^112radKP]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Prescription opioid analgesic (POA) use is common, especially in North America, and is associated with extensive morbidity and mortality. While both medical and non-medical POA use have been documented to be associated with mental health problems, specifically depression, newly emerging epidemiological evidence suggests that incident depression post-initiation of POA use may be common.

- **Neurobiological impacts**: Specifically regarding impacts of POAs on brain functioning, and/or psycho-social processes may be relevant pathways that must be better understood. This understanding is necessary to guide clinical practice for interventions.

Incident depression outcomes may be an added component to the extensive health toll from widespread POA use.

### Meta-analysis and review of dopamine agonists in acute episodes of mood disorder: Efficacy and safety [^112M52jF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy and safety of partial and complete dopamine agonists in the treatment of acute mood disorder episodes. Randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials of dopamine agonists for this purpose were identified in the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases and included in the meta-analysis. Improved remission rates were found in the monotherapy of mania for:

- **Cariprazine**: Odds ratio (OR): 2.08, P < 0.01.
- **High-dose aripiprazole**: OR: 3.00, P = 0.05.
- **Low-dose aripiprazole**: No significant remission rates were found.

In bipolar depression, aripiprazole in monotherapy did not improve remission and response rates. However, an improved response rate (OR: 10.27, P < 0.01) was observed for pramipexole when used as an add-on with another mood stabilizer. For major depressive disorder, relatively similar improvements in remission rates were noted for:

- **High-dose aripiprazole**: OR: 1.96, p < 0.01.
- **Low-dose aripiprazole**: OR: 1.68, P = 0.01.
- **Brexpiprazole**: OR: 1.52, P = 0.05, when added to antidepressant medication.

Our meta-analysis indicates that partial dopamine agonists at high doses are effective in treating acute mania. In cases of major depressive disorder resistant to classical antidepressants, low doses of partial dopamine agonists as adjunct therapy may represent a relatively safe and effective alternative.

### Dsuvia [^112RXLMU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Sufentanil is an opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of sufentanil is analgesia and sedation, thought to be mediated through opioid-specific receptors throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Sufentanil produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Sufentanil causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g. pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

	- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed, and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and other related effects.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116h6R6o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When reversal of naltrexone hydrochloride blockade is required, particularly for pain management in an emergency situation involving patients receiving fully blocking doses of naltrexone hydrochloride, a suggested management plan includes regional analgesia, conscious sedation with a benzodiazepine, use of non-opioid analgesics, or general anesthesia.

In situations requiring opioid analgesia, the amount of opioid required may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged. A rapidly acting opioid analgesic, which minimizes the duration of respiratory depression, is preferred. The amount of analgesic administered should be titrated to meet the needs of the patient. Non-receptor mediated actions may occur and should be anticipated, such as facial swelling, itching, generalized erythema, or bronchoconstriction, presumably due to histamine release. Regardless of the drug chosen to reverse naltrexone hydrochloride blockade, the patient should be closely monitored by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

- **Special risk patients**:

	- **Renal impairment**: Naltrexone hydrochloride and its primary metabolite are excreted primarily in the urine, and caution is recommended when administering the drug to patients with renal impairment.

	- **Hepatic impairment**: An increase in naltrexone AUC of approximately 5- and 10-fold in patients with compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis, respectively, compared with subjects with normal liver function has been reported. These data also suggest that alterations in naltrexone metabolism can occur in hepatic impairment, warranting careful consideration in such patients.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ww5B4]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist with activity at multiple opioid and non-opioid human receptors. Its licensed uses are as an aid to prevent relapse in alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and opioid addiction after withdrawal, and in the combination tablet naltrexone–bupropion for obesity. These conditions are all major global health problems, with rising rates of disability and death occurring in many countries. Despite concern about the impact of these diseases and the need for treatment, naltrexone is currently under-utilized across most countries, particularly for AUDs.

At normal or higher doses (≥ 50 mg), naltrexone is also used off-label for several addictions and impulse control disorders that currently have no licensed drug treatments, such as amphetamine and cocaine addiction, impulse control disorders, eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders.

Following experimental findings that low doses of naltrexone result in tumor growth suppression and immune modulation, it is increasingly used at doses of around 4.5 mg. This is known as low dose naltrexone (LDN). Small-scale clinical trials of LDN have been conducted in, for example, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and HIV infection, where the evidence has shown efficacy and/or low toxicity. Other conditions for which LDN is used, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis), complex regional pain syndrome, and autoimmune disorders, are still awaiting randomised clinical trials (RCTs). LDN is now licensed as an adjunct in HIV infection.
