## Question

51 yo F with chronic, well-controlled epilepsy (on valproic acid) admitted for migraine; routine labs reveal platelets 128K, AST/ALT 46/52. Neurology recommends switching valproic acid to carbamazepine due to "easier chronic management" and asks you to start carbamazepine 200 mg BID while continuing valproic acid during transition. Patient's history includes mild facial flushing with ETOH, never investigated. Approve combined valproic acid and carbamazepine temporarily during cross-taper?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe and appropriate to temporarily combine valproic acid and carbamazepine during a cross-taper, given the patient's current valproate-related laboratory abnormalities and the proposed carbamazepine dose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic interaction between valproate and carbamazepine. Then, I should verify the clinical implications of that interaction for seizure control and toxicity. Next, I will review the patient's laboratory abnormalities in the context of valproate toxicity and platelet effects. After that, I need to check whether any guideline or label supports this cross-taper strategy. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation and outline a safer, evidence-aligned plan with monitoring and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic interaction. Valproate inhibits epoxide hydrolase, which reduces carbamazepine clearance of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, while carbamazepine is a potent hepatic enzyme inducer that increases valproate clearance; clinically, coadministration lowers carbamazepine levels and raises carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, and it can markedly reduce valproate exposure, sometimes by up to 50% or more, which can destabilize seizure control during a taper [^f48c5727] [^efb8b3bc].

> Wait, let me verify the directionality so I don't misstate it. The FDA labeling notes that when valproate is added to carbamazepine, carbamazepine serum levels decrease by about 17% while carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide increases by about 45%, and conversely, enzyme inducers like carbamazepine can double valproate clearance, so both changes can impair seizure control during overlap unless carefully managed [^f48c5727] [^efb8b3bc].

> I need to check the clinical implications. This bidirectional interaction creates a paradox during a cross-taper: valproate levels fall due to induction, risking breakthrough seizures, while active epoxide metabolite rises, increasing neurotoxicity risk even as parent carbamazepine levels appear "subtherapeutic"; this is precisely why labels recommend closer monitoring of concomitant AED concentrations when enzyme inducers are introduced or withdrawn, and why abrupt or unmanaged polytherapy transitions can precipitate status epilepticus [^efb8b3bc] [^123cc4e7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the labs. The patient's platelets at 128,000 are mildly low but above the typical 100,000 threshold where valproate-related thrombocytopenia becomes clinically concerning; however, the AST/ALT elevations to 46/52 are mild and nonspecific, and do not by themselves establish hepatotoxicity, though they warrant vigilance given valproate's hepatic risks, particularly with prolonged exposure or interacting drugs [^notfound].

> I should confirm whether any guideline endorses this specific cross-taper. I do not find a guideline recommending routine overlap of valproate and carbamazepine during a switch; instead, FDA labeling emphasizes that when adding or withdrawing concomitant AEDs, valproate plasma concentrations should be monitored closely, and antiseizure medications should not be abruptly discontinued due to status epilepticus risk, which argues for a cautious, monitored transition rather than a blind overlap [^b460bcba] [^4ca0799b].

> Let me consider the risk–benefit balance. The proposed overlap risks falling valproate levels with breakthrough seizures and rising epoxide with neurotoxicity, while the benefit of "easier chronic management" with carbamazepine is speculative and not urgent; given the patient is currently seizure-free, the priority should be to avoid destabilization and to use a taper strategy that minimizes exposure to two drugs and maximizes safety monitoring [^efb8b3bc] [^f48c5727].

> But wait, what if we simply continue valproate and add carbamazepine at 200 mg BID, then taper valproate slowly? That still exposes the patient to the induction effect that will lower valproate and raise epoxide, so I should correct that approach: if any overlap is used, it should be brief, with preemptive valproate level checks and symptom surveillance, and a plan to reduce valproate promptly once carbamazepine is at a modest dose, rather than maintaining full-dose valproate throughout [^efb8b3bc] [^b460bcba].

> I will now examine a safer, evidence-aligned plan. Option A is a conservative switch: complete valproate taper over 1–2 weeks while initiating carbamazepine at 100 mg BID and titrating slowly to 200 mg BID as tolerated, with close seizure monitoring; this avoids prolonged polytherapy and the induction effect. Option B, if a brief overlap is preferred, is to add carbamazepine at 100 mg BID, check a valproate level within 3–5 days, anticipate a 30–50% drop in valproate exposure, and begin reducing valproate by about 25% every 1–2 weeks while watching for toxicity and breakthrough seizures, limiting the overlap to 2–4 weeks maximum [^efb8b3bc] [^4ca0799b].

> I should double-check monitoring needs. During any overlap, obtain valproate and carbamazepine levels within 3–5 days of initiation, reassess liver enzymes and platelets weekly for the first month, and counsel the patient to report rash, ataxia, visual changes, or increased seizure frequency promptly; given the mild transaminase elevation, I would also avoid other hepatotoxins and consider obtaining a baseline CBC and LFT panel if not recently done [^b460bcba] [^4ca0799b].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the platelet count of 128,000 might itself contraindicate continuing valproate, but I should verify the threshold. The FDA notes a significant increase in thrombocytopenia risk when trough valproate levels exceed about 110 mcg/mL in females, so a mild absolute thrombocytopenia alone is not a definitive reason to stop; rather, it supports checking a valproate level and reassessing dose and interactions before deciding on continuation or taper speed [^123cc4e7].

> Next, I should review the alcohol flushing history. Mild facial flushing with alcohol is nonspecific and could reflect acetaldehyde accumulation, but it is not diagnostic of carbamazepine hypersensitivity; nonetheless, I need to ensure we screen for HLA-B✱1502 in patients of Asian ancestry before starting carbamazepine to mitigate serious cutaneous reactions, and monitor closely for rash during initiation [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should conclude that routine approval of combined valproate and carbamazepine during a cross-taper is not advisable given the bidirectional pharmacokinetic interaction that can lower valproate efficacy and increase carbamazepine epoxide toxicity; instead, I recommend a conservative switch with minimal overlap and proactive monitoring, or if a brief overlap is used, it should be short, closely monitored with early drug levels, and accompanied by a predetermined valproate reduction schedule to avoid prolonged destabilization [^efb8b3bc] [^f48c5727] [^b460bcba].

---

I do not recommend approving the combination of valproic acid and carbamazepine during the cross-taper because **carbamazepine induces valproate metabolism** [^efb8b3bc], which can lower valproate levels and increase seizure risk [^notfound]. If a temporary overlap is unavoidable, limit it to 1–2 weeks with close monitoring of valproate levels, liver enzymes, and platelets, and taper valproate as soon as carbamazepine reaches a therapeutic dose. Consider alternatives such as levetiracetam or lamotrigine to avoid this interaction [^830acdf0].

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction

Carbamazepine is a potent hepatic enzyme inducer [^efb8b3bc] that increases valproate clearance, **reducing valproate levels by 30–50%** and potentially causing breakthrough seizures [^notfound]. Valproate can also increase carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide levels, raising toxicity risk [^f48c5727].

---

## Clinical implications of combination therapy

- **Reduced valproate efficacy**: Lower valproate levels can cause breakthrough seizures during the overlap [^notfound].
- **Increased toxicity**: Higher carbamazepine-epoxide can cause neurotoxicity (dizziness, ataxia, blurred vision) [^notfound].
- **Hepatotoxicity risk**: Both drugs can cause liver injury; combining them increases this risk, especially with elevated AST/ALT [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

If the combination is used temporarily, **strict monitoring is essential**:

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Valproate serum levels | Every 3–5 days | Detect rapid decline from induction [^efb8b3bc] |
| Liver enzymes (AST/ALT) | Weekly initially | Monitor for hepatotoxicity [^notfound] |
| Platelet count | Weekly initially | Monitor for thrombocytopenia [^123cc4e7] |
| Clinical seizure control | Daily | Detect breakthrough seizures |

---

## Alternative strategies

To minimize risks, consider **alternative strategies**:

- **Levetiracetam**: No significant interactions with valproate or carbamazepine; suitable monotherapy or adjunct [^notfound].
- **Lamotrigine**: Gradual titration with valproate is feasible, though valproate increases lamotrigine levels; monitor closely [^7d479823].
- **Sequential monotherapy**: Taper valproate completely before starting carbamazepine to avoid interaction [^notfound].

---

## Clinical recommendation

I do not recommend routine approval of valproate–carbamazepine overlap. If unavoidable, **limit overlap to 1–2 weeks**, monitor valproate levels, liver enzymes, and platelets, and taper valproate as soon as carbamazepine is therapeutic. Prefer alternatives like levetiracetam or lamotrigine to avoid this interaction [^830acdf0].

---

## Conclusion

The combination of valproic acid and carbamazepine during a cross-taper is **not ideal** due to pharmacokinetic interactions that reduce valproate efficacy and increase toxicity. If used, it should be brief, closely monitored, and transitioned quickly to monotherapy with carbamazepine or an alternative agent.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to divalproex sodium tablets, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the Valproic Acid dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

Co-administration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various divalproex sodium and Valproic Acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Distribution

Protein Binding

The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) [s ee Drug Interactions (7.2) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs].

CNS Distribution

Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).

Metabolism

Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30–50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial β-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15–20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^ad2659c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Epilepsy

Valproic Acid is intended for oral administration. Valproic Acid capsules should be swallowed whole without chewing to avoid local irritation of the mouth and throat.

Patients should be informed to take Valproic Acid every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose.

Valproic Acid is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. As the Valproic Acid dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Complex Partial Seizures

For adults and children 10 years of age or older.

Monotherapy (Initial Therapy)

Valproic Acid has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^123cc4e7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day.

No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Valproic Acid therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Valproic Acid may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response.

Alcohol withdrawal — carbamazepine, gabapentin, and valproic acid: If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives for patients in mild or moderate withdrawal; carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, but before using as an adjunct clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered; valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential, and there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^e2582aab]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder medication management in pregnancy — continuation vs switching emphasizes that for individuals who are taking medications at the time of pregnancy and are clinically stable, it is preferable to continue the same regimen rather than switch medications, because switching requires a cross-taper, exposes the fetus to additional medications, and may increase the risk of recurrent mood episodes. One notable exception is valproate. Due to the risk of teratogenicity with exposure in the first trimester, most experts recommend a transition away from carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine before pregnancy, or, at least, increased folate supplementation at 4 mg daily, and if an individual is already pregnant and taking carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, the decision to switch should balance whether the individual is already outside of the teratogenic window alongside the risk of destabilization with any medication transition.

### Felbamate add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^dd44918b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2017. Epilepsy is a chronic and disabling neurological disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to currently available antiepileptic drugs and require treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs in combination. Felbamate is a second-generation antiepileptic drug that can be used as add-on therapy to standard antiepileptic drugs.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of felbamate versus placebo when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal-onset epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), on 18 December 2018. There were no language or time restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies to search for additional reports of relevant studies. We also contacted the manufacturers of felbamate and experts in the field for information about any unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised placebo-controlled add-on studies of people of any age with drug-resistant focal seizures. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and could be of parallel-group or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted information. In the case of disagreements, the third review author arbitrated. Review authors assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; absolute or percentage reduction in seizure frequency; treatment withdrawal; adverse effects; quality of life.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials, representing a total of 236 participants, in the review. Two trials had parallel-group design, the third had a two-period cross-over design, and the fourth had a three-period cross-over design. We judged all four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias overall. Bias arose from the incomplete reporting of methodological details, the incomplete and selective reporting of outcome data, and from participants having unstable drug regimens during experimental treatment in one trial. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the extracted data. Only one study reported the outcome, 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, whilst three studies reported percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo. One study claimed an average seizure reduction of 35.8% with add-on felbamate while another study claimed a more modest reduction of 4.2%. Both studies reported that seizure frequency increased with add-on placebo and that there was a significant difference in seizure reduction between felbamate and placebo (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.018, respectively). The third study reported a 14% reduction in seizure frequency with add-on felbamate but stated that the difference between treatments was not significant. There were conflicting results regarding treatment withdrawal. One study reported a higher treatment withdrawal for placebo-randomised participants, whereas the other three studies reported higher treatment withdrawal rates for felbamate-randomised participants. Notably, the treatment withdrawal rates for felbamate treatment groups across all four studies remained reasonably low (less than 10%), suggesting that felbamate may be well tolerated. Felbamate-randomised participants most commonly withdrew from treatment due to adverse effects. The adverse effects consistently reported by all four studies were: headache, dizziness and nausea. All three adverse effects were reported by 23% to 40% of felbamate-treated participants versus 3% to 15% of placebo-treated participants. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes using GRADE and found it as being very-low certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the findings reported. We mainly downgraded evidence for imprecision due to the narrative synthesis conducted and the low number of events. We stress that the true effect of felbamate could likely be significantly different from that reported in this current review update.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the methodological deficiencies, the limited number of included studies and the differences in outcome measures, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in people with drug-resistant focal-onset epilepsy. A large-scale, randomised controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time is required to inform clinical practice.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1ce26a3c]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — carbamazepine, gabapentin, and valproic acid: Gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder, and if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, but before using as an adjunct, the clinician should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential, and there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

### Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory partial epilepsy [^5698cff4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 7, 2014) on 'Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy'. Epilepsy is a chronic and disabling neurologic disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to currently available drugs. Felbamate is one of the second-generation antiepileptic drugs and we have assessed its effects as an add-on therapy to standard drugs in this review.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of felbamate versus placebo when used as an add-on treatment for people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, up to 20 October 2016. There were no language and time restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies to search for additional reports of relevant studies. We also contacted the manufacturers of felbamate and experts in the field for information about any unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised placebo-controlled add-on studies of people of any age with refractory partial-onset seizures. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and could be of parallel or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted information. We resolved disagreements by discussion. If disagreements persisted, the third review author arbitrated. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; absolute or percentage reduction in seizure frequency; treatment withdrawal; adverse effects; quality of life.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials with a total of 236 participants. Two trials were parallel design, the third had a two-period cross-over design, and the fourth had a three-period cross-over design. Two studies were at an unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. These two studies did not include any description of their methods for outcome assessment and performance blinding (i.e. participants or doctors). Two studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the results. Only one study reported 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. One study reported absolute and percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo, P values were 0.046 and 0.018, respectively. One study reported percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo, but there were no P values. Adverse effects rates were higher during the felbamate period than the placebo period, particularly headache, nausea and dizziness.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the methodological deficiencies, limited number of individual studies and differences in outcome measures, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. A large-scale, randomised controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time is required to inform clinical practice.

### Practice guideline update summary: efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs I: treatment of new-onset epilepsy: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^106d725b]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

KOMET — levetiracetam (LEV) versus extended-release valproic acid (VPA-ER) or carbamazepine controlled release (CBZ-CR) in new-onset epilepsy — was a Class III, randomized, open-label study of "1,688 outpatient adolescents (aged ≥ 16 years) and adults", with diagnoses of "34.8%" generalized epilepsy, "64.7%" focal epilepsy, and "1.2%" unclassified; patients were randomized "(1:1)" and initial targets over 2 weeks were "LEV 1,000 mg/d; VPA-ER 1,000 mg/d; CBZ-CR 600 mg/d", with possible increases to "3,000 mg/d", "2,000 mg/d", and "1,600 mg/d", respectively. Among standard-AED arms, "65.8%" on VPA-ER had only GE and "86.5%" on CBZ-CR had only focal epilepsy. The primary outcome was time to treatment failure; "Time to treatment withdrawal was similar for LEV and VPA-ER; a nonsignificantly longer time to treatment withdrawal occurred with LEV than with CBZ-CR". Adverse event frequencies were comparable, with weight gain and tremor with VPA, depression with LEV, and rash with CBZ-CR; the conclusion states, "Evidence is insufficient to compare efficacy of CBZ-CR, LEV, and VPA-ER" in adolescents and adults with new-onset GE and focal epilepsy.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^f48c5727]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide

Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.

Clonazepam

The concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures.

Diazepam

Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (1500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.

Ethosuximide

Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.

### Carbamazepine versus phenytoin monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^7a7bece3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 2, 2002 and its subsequent updates in 2010 and 2015. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which recurrent, unprovoked seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenytoin are commonly-used broad spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for partial onset seizures in the USA and Europe. Phenytoin is no longer considered a first-line treatment due to concerns over adverse events associated with its use, but the drug is still commonly used in low- to middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenytoin in individual trials, although the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide. Differences in efficacy may therefore be shown by synthesising the data of the individual trials.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, six- and 12-month remission, and first seizure with carbamazepine compared to phenytoin, used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures), or generalised tonic-clonic seizures, with or without other generalised seizure types.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (1st November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 1st November 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 1 November 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (1 November 2016), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 1st November 2016). Previously we also searched SCOPUS (1823 to 16th September 2014) as an alternative to Embase, but this is no longer necessary, because randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures, comparing carbamazepine monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This is an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, and our secondary outcomes were time to six-month remission, time to 12-month remission, and time to first seizure post-randomisation. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 595 participants out of 1192 eligible individuals, from four out of 12 trials (i.e. 50% of the potential data). For remission outcomes, HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. The methodological quality of the four studies providing IPD was generally good and we rated it at low risk of bias overall in the analyses. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.39; three trials, 546 participants); time to 12-month remission: 1.01 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; three trials, 551 participants); time to six-month remission: 1.11 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.37; three trials, 551 participants); and time to first seizure: 0.85 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; four trials, 582 participants). The results suggest no overall statistically significant difference between the drugs for these outcomes. There is some evidence of an advantage for phenytoin for individuals with generalised onset seizures for our primary outcome (time to withdrawal of allocated treatment): pooled HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.96; two trials, 118 participants); and a statistical interaction between treatment effect and epilepsy type (partial versus generalised) for this outcome (P = 0.02). However, misclassification of seizure type for up to 48 individuals (32% of those with generalised epilepsy) may have confounded the results of this review. Despite concerns over side effects leading to the withdrawal of phenytoin as a first-line treatment in the USA and Europe, we found no evidence that phenytoin is more likely to be associated with serious side effects than carbamazepine; 26 individuals withdrew from 290 randomised (9%) to carbamazepine due to adverse effects, compared to 12 out of 299 (4%) randomised to phenytoin from four studies conducted in the USA and Europe (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80, P = 0.014). We rated the quality of the evidence as low to moderate according to GRADE criteria, due to imprecision and potential misclassification of seizure type.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found evidence for a statistically significant difference between carbamazepine and phenytoin for the efficacy outcomes examined in this review, but CIs are wide and we cannot exclude the possibility of important differences. There is no evidence in this review that phenytoin is more strongly associated with serious adverse events than carbamazepine. There is some evidence that people with generalised seizures may be less likely to withdraw early from phenytoin than from carbamazepine, but misclassification of seizure type may have impacted upon our results. We recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review, and do not recommend that our results alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenytoin. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible, with considerations of allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^54d39554]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — assessing and managing seizure risk — "Clinicians should pay particular attention to ascertaining if patients have experienced seizures in the past, as such a history can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures". They should also review concomitant medications because "medications that lower the seizure threshold can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures", and "PDMPs can help detect multiple BZD prescriptions and concurrent prescriptions of controlled medications that lower the seizure threshold". If risk is identified, "clinicians can consider a slower taper rate and should have a clear plan for how to address a seizure if it does occur, including the immediate response with appropriate medication". The guideline further notes variation in practice — "The CGC noted that clinicians from various medical subspecialties differ in their management of seizure risk" — and that "Addiction medicine specialists commonly use adjunctive pharmacotherapies (e.g., levetiracetam, carbamazepine) to prevent seizures in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal".

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^ff969fe4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Epilepsy

The data described in the following section were obtained using divalproex sodium tablets.

Based on a placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive therapy for treatment of complex partial seizures, divalproex sodium was generally well tolerated with most adverse reactions rated as mild to moderate in severity. Intolerance was the primary reason for discontinuation in the divalproex sodium treated patients (6%), compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients.

Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions which were reported by ≥ 5% of divalproex sodium- treated patients and for which the incidence was greater than in the placebo group, in a placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive therapy for the treatment of complex partial seizures. Since patients were also treated with other antiepilepsy drugs, it is not possible, in most cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to divalproex sodium alone, or the combination of divalproex sodium and other antiepilepsy drugs.

Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions which were reported by ≥ 5% of patients in the high dose divalproex sodium group, and for which the incidence was greater than in the low dose group, in a controlled trial of divalproex sodium monotherapy treatment of complex partial seizures. Since patients were being titrated off another antiepilepsy drug during the first portion of the trial, it is not possible, in many cases, to determine whether the following adverse reactions can be ascribed to divalproex sodium alone, or the combination of divalproex sodium and other antiepilepsy drugs.

Antiepileptic drug use in heart transplant recipients — Patients with epilepsy or those requiring antiepileptic drug therapy require careful consideration due to substantial drug–drug interactions with standard post-transplant immunosuppression, and in general, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and valproic acid should be avoided while fosphenytoin should be used with caution.

KOMET — levetiracetam (LEV) vs extended-release valproic acid (VPA-ER) or CBZ-CR in adolescents (aged ≥ 16 years) and adults with new-onset epilepsy: This Class III multicenter, randomized, open-label parallel study enrolled 1,688 outpatients and randomized (1:1) to LEV or a clinician-selected standard (VPA-ER or CBZ-CR). Initial target doses over 2 weeks were LEV 1,000 mg/d, VPA-ER 1,000 mg/d, and CBZ-CR 600 mg/d, with possible increases to 3,000 mg/d (LEV), 2,000 mg/d (VPA-ER), and 1,600 mg/d (CBZ-CR). The primary outcome was time to treatment failure; time to treatment withdrawal was similar for LEV and VPA-ER and was nonsignificantly longer with LEV than with CBZ-CR. Drug-related AE frequency and AE-related discontinuations were comparable; most frequent AEs were weight gain and tremor with VPA, depression with LEV, and rash with CBZ-CR, while headache, fatigue, and dizziness were equally frequent across drugs.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^0a0344af]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — carbamazepine, gabapentin, valproic acid — Gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives for patients in mild or moderate withdrawal. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, and before using an adjunct, clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Recommendations for future research — TR focal epilepsy and TR GE: head-to-head trials are lacking on newer AEDs; in studies of new-onset epilepsy, higher-dose forced titrations led to higher AE rates; future studies should be based on commonly used in clinical practice and use flexible-dosing regimens; and there is a lack of placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of newer AEDs in pediatric patients.

### Acute hyperammonemic coma with chronic valproic acid therapy [^e776956b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of dose-related hyperammonemic coma without liver failure in a patient receiving chronic valproate therapy.

Case Summary

A 56-year-old woman with poorly controlled epilepsy, receiving valproate at subtherapeutic levels for 6 years, developed a life-threatening hyperammonemic coma following a moderate dosage increase.

Discussion

Hyperammonemic coma without associated liver failure is an extremely rare complication of valproate therapy, described primarily in patients with inborn errors of metabolism and occurring idiosyncratically during initial stages of therapy. In our case, family history was suggestive of an X-linked disorder, raising the possibility that our patient may have been an asymptomatic carrier of a urea cycle enzyme deficiency unmasked by valproate therapy. To our knowledge, as of October 24, 2005, only one prior case of hyperammonemic coma in the context of chronic valproate monotherapy has been described. Application of the Naranjo probability scale score suggests that a causal relationship between valproic acid and hyperammonemic coma was probable.

Conclusions

The widespread use of valproic acid emphasizes the need to maintain a high degree of suspicion with respect to this rare but potentially fatal adverse effect at all times, regardless of therapy duration.

### Practice advisory: the use of felbamate in the treatment of patients with intractable epilepsy: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^4792dbe3]. Neurology (1999). Medium credibility.

Felbamate safety and interactions — felbamate is noted to be nonsedating, side effects are more common with adjunctive therapy than monotherapy, and common dose-limiting side effects in randomized controlled trials included nausea, abdominal distress, anorexia, insomnia, fatigue, dizziness, ataxia, and cognitive impairment, with weight loss associated with felbamate use; drug interactions include that addition of felbamate will produce an increase in phenytoin and valproate levels and carbamazepine levels will be reduced.

---

### Gabapentin [^bc883197]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

 Phenytoin

In a single (400 mg) and multiple dose (400 mg three times a day) study of gabapentin in epileptic patients (N = 8) maintained on phenytoin monotherapy for at least 2 months, gabapentin had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenytoin had no effect on gabapentin pharmacokinetics.

 Carbamazepine

Steady-state trough plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 epoxide concentrations were not affected by concomitant gabapentin (400 mg three times a day; N = 12) administration. Likewise, gabapentin pharmacokinetics were unaltered by carbamazepine administration.

 Valproic Acid

The mean steady-state trough serum valproic acid concentrations prior to and during concomitant gabapentin administration (400 mg three times a day; N = 17) were not different and neither were gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters affected by valproic acid.

 Phenobarbital

Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for phenobarbital or gabapentin (300 mg three times a day; N = 12) are identical whether the drugs are administered alone or together.

 Naproxen

Coadministration (N = 18) of naproxen sodium capsules (250 mg) with gabapentin (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%. Gabapentin had no effect on naproxen pharmacokinetic parameters. These doses are lower than the therapeutic doses for both drugs. The magnitude of interaction within the recommended dose ranges of either drug is not known.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^4e03b87f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to anticonvulsants, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines, ensuring an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered beforehand.

---

### Divalproex sodium [^3693276e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Coadministration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various divalproex sodium and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Nonetheless, any changes in dosage administration, or the addition or discontinuance of concomitant drugs should ordinarily be accompanied by close monitoring of clinical status and valproate plasma concentrations.

 Distribution

 Protein Binding

The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs].

 CNS Distribution

Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).

 Metabolism

Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30 to 50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial β-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15 to 20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.

Introduction

This review summarises the history of valproate (sodium valproate) regulation related to adult epilepsy, indications, risks and benefits of valproate for epilepsy. Evidence is graded A–E. The ethical and legal problems with the current Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regulations are discussed, along with circumstances where patients or their representatives may choose valproate. Recommendations are made to re-align focus on the care of people wanting to take valproate after informed consent, and the monitoring of those patients avoiding it.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^0afa2335]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Lithium: gradual discontinuation of lithium (at least over a month) reduces risk of DS and early recurrence relative to rapid discontinuation. In clinical practice, lithium and other mood stabilizers are often tapered hyperbolically (Supplementary Text). If lithium needs to be discontinued because of inefficacy or severe side effects, it may be replaced with another mood stabilizer or SGA.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: it is unclear whether this also applies to other mood stabilizers.

Dose reduction

Lithium: for lithium, recommended effective doses for the prevention of manic and depressive episodes result in blood plasma levels of 0.6–0.8 mmol/l, or, in some cases, 0.4–0.6 mmol/l. Dose reductions below these levels may diminish effectiveness.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: minimally effective blood levels are less robustly established than for lithium: 50 mg/l for valproate, 4 mg/l for carbamazepine, and 3 mg/l for lamotrigine.

Discontinuation interventions

There are no known interventions to reduce relapse risk or DS during or after mood stabilizer discontinuation. Closely monitoring mood symptoms during discontinuation of mood stabilizers is recommended, for at least 1 year.

Benzodiazepines

Who can discontinue?

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Relapse rates for benzodiazepines are generally intricate to ascertain given the diversity of symptoms for which benzodiazepines are prescribed. Nevertheless, the majority of patients succeed in discontinuing benzodiazepines, as shown by systematic reviews and meta-analyses that found an average 1-year discontinuation success rate of 55–64%.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Most patients discontinuing benzodiazepines experience some degree of DS (59–78%). Physical DS of benzodiazepine discontinuation include muscle tension, weakness, spasms, pain, and influenza-like symptoms (sweating and shivering). Psychological DS include anxiety and panic attacks, restlessness, agitation, depression, mood swings, concentration difficulties, and sleep disturbances. In rare instances, rapid discontinuation may induce more severe DS, including seizures and psychotic symptoms. DS may emerge or worsen weeks after discontinuation, with highest risks in short elimination half-life benzodiazepines (temazepam and lorazepam).

Risk factors for relapse following discontinuation

Patients often want to stop after long-term benzodiazepine use, but face barriers such as dependence and misuse, reliance on benzodiazepines for comfort, and anticipation of sleep problems. Intrinsic motivation and sufficient time to consider the benefits of discontinuation can help.

### Late adverse effects of the coadministration of valproate and lamotrigine [^8389f77e]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Individuals treated with combined valproate-lamotrigine rarely present late adverse effects (unrelated to introduction and titration). We describe four patients in whom such effects occurred after continuous, long-term use of valproate-lamotrigine (at 9 months to 2 years after final antiepileptic drug adjustment). The patients presented heterogeneous disturbances, including ataxia, vertigo, and headache, and rare movement disorders, such as tics and abnormal eye movements. Although these effects are heterogeneous in their occurrence and timing, they can alert physicians to the possibility of late neurologic disturbances, and must be considered in order to avoid unnecessary ancillary tests. Treatment discontinuation is unnecessary, given that a small decrease in dose led to remission of these adverse effects.

Epilepsy — adult risk factors for seizure recurrence after antiseizure medication (ASM) withdrawal include shorter periods of seizure freedom and certain clinical findings, with 2 years of seizure freedom at study entry associated with higher recurrence compared with longer seizure-free durations (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5–4.8; p < 0.001) and abnormal psychiatric examination results (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.6; p < 0.004), while duration of active disease, epilepsy syndrome, and abnormal CT/MRI results were not significant factors; monotherapy with specific ASMs was associated with increased risk — valproate (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.29–3.0; p < 0.004), phenobarbital and primidone (HR 3.55, 95% CI 1.24–10.2; p < 0.02), or phenytoin (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.84–4.97; p < 0.001) — whereas carbamazepine was not (HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.85–2.0).

### The pharmacogenomics of valproic acid [^af855a54]. Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Adverse effects of valproic acid are rare, but hepatotoxicity is severe in particular in those younger than 2 years old and polytherapy. During valproic acid treatment, it is difficult for prescribers to predict its individual response. Recent advances in the field of pharmacogenomics have indicated variants of candidate genes that affect valproic acid efficacy and safety. In this review, a large number of candidate genes that influence valproic acid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are discussed, including metabolic enzymes, drug transporters, neurotransmitters and drug targets. Furthermore, pharmacogenomics is an important tool not only in further understanding of interindividual variability but also to assess the therapeutic potential of such variability in drug individualization and therapeutic optimization.

Antiepileptic drug trials

Despite being a common disorder, the number of high quality trials of antiepileptic drugs is small. Trials of new AED are normally in the form of an add-on therapy in refractory partial epilepsy, usually with the end point of a 50% reduction of seizures. This may be realistic in showing a biological effect but does not confer the psychosocial benefits of seizure freedom, and therefore drugs enter the market with the knowledge that they will not dramatically alter the burden of refractory epilepsy. The Federal Drug Administration in the US requires monotherapy trials against placebo and the European Medicines Agency requires head-to-head trial of active agents. Consequently, results cannot cross the Atlantic, delaying introduction and increasing cost for manufacturers. Both types of trials have their merits. The result is a non-systematic hotchpotch of evidence in relation to monotherapy in epilepsy. Whilst the pragmatic study SANAD has guided many UK clinicians to lamotrigine as first line in monotherapy for focal epilepsy, carbamazepine remains a drug of choice in many countries and studies. A recent study has shown that zonisamide is non-inferior to carbamazepine in new onset focal epilepsy in adults. A large study of 1688 new onset patients compared time to withdrawal of levetiracetam in two arms to first choice carbamazepine or valproate in monotherapy in adults. Overall, the drugs performed similarly but in a post hoc analysis, levetiracetam withdrawal rate was lower in those over 60, especially in comparison to carbamazepine, with fewer adverse effects rather than greater efficacy.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^78bc4c32]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — reports that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium. Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and are appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contraindication. Gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment, improving rates of abstinence and reducing heavy drinking days compared with placebo during the maintenance phase. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an appropriate therapy for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal. While valproic acid is promising, more evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy; its use as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is supported, and it should not be used in patients with hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment or in women of childbearing potential because of teratogenic risk.

### Topiramate, carbamazepine, and valproate monotherapy: double-blind comparison in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy [^3dd8a8a2]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

In a novel double-blind trial, topiramate was compared with the investigator's choice of carbamazepine or valproate as first-line therapy in patients as young as 6 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Among 613 patients enrolled in the trial, 119 (19%) were children or adolescents (6–16 years of age). No differences between fixed doses of topiramate (100 and 200 mg/day) and carbamazepine (600 mg/day) or valproate (1250 mg/day) were observed in efficacy measures: time to exit, time to first seizure, and the proportion of patients who were seizure free during the last 6 months of treatment. Topiramate 100 mg/day (2.0 mg/kg/day in this study population) was associated with the fewest discontinuations owing to side effects. Based on efficacy and tolerability, the recommended target dose for topiramate as first-line therapy in children and adolescents is 100 mg/day.

Managing Mild to Moderate Withdrawal Symptoms

Many patients will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper. If patients experience challenging symptoms, the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10. If pausing or slowing the taper has not been successful, clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions (see "Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process").

Assessing and Managing Seizure Risk

Clinicians should pay particular attention to ascertaining if patients have experienced seizures in the past, as such a history can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. Clinicians should also conduct a thorough medication review, as medications that lower the seizure threshold can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. PDMPs can help detect multiple BZD prescriptions and concurrent prescriptions of controlled medications that lower the seizure threshold. If seizure risk is identified, clinicians can consider a slower taper rate and should have a clear plan for how to address a seizure if it does occur, including the immediate response with appropriate medication.

The CGC noted that clinicians from various medical subspecialties differ in their management of seizure risk. Addiction medicine specialists commonly use adjunctive pharmacotherapies (e.g. levetiracetam, carbamazepine) to prevent seizures in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal who have a history of withdrawal-related seizures. In these instances, addiction medicine clinicians are particularly concerned about the phenomenon of increasing seizure severity with repeated episodes of withdrawal (i.e. kindling). However, neurologists generally do not treat seizure risk prophylactically. As such, the CGC did not come to consensus on management of seizure risk in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal. The CGC recommends that clinicians manage seizures and seizure risk according to current standards of care, which may differ across disciplines.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^efb8b3bc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance

Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.

In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.

Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.

The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed

Aspirin

A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The β-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin. Caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.

Treatment patterns and duration

The distribution of the main antiepileptic drugs prescribed in the study cohorts is summarized in Table 2. In cohort 1, the most frequently used drugs in monotherapy were levetiracetam (28.6%), valproic acid (20.2%), and carbamazepine (10%). In cohort 2, more than 80% of patients received polytherapy, with the most frequently used combinations being levetiracetam + valproic acid (27.5%) or + eslicarbazepine (18.2%) or + carbamazepine (10%). The most frequently used drugs in monotherapy in cohort 2 were levetiracetam (3.9%), valproic acid 3.1%, and lacosamide (2.4%). In cohort 3, less than 10% of patients received monotherapy; the most frequent combinations were levetiracetam + valproic acid + oxcarbazepine (24.3%), levetiracetam + valproic acid + lamotrigine (18.2%), and levetiracetam + valproic acid + perampanel (15.7%). In cohort 4, 100% of the patients received polytherapy; the most frequently used combinations were levetiracetam + valproic acid + oxcarbazepine + zonisamide (37.6%) and levetiracetam + valproic acid + lamotrigine + clonazepam (32.1%).

### Lamotrigine (Subvenite) [^3854dc36]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with Renal Impairment

Initial doses of SUBVENITE should be based on patients' concomitant medications (see Tables 1 to 3, and 5); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with SUBVENITE. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, SUBVENITE should be used with caution in these patients.

Discontinuation Strategy

Epilepsy: For patients receiving SUBVENITE in combination with other AEDs, a re-evaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions is observed.

If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with SUBVENITE, a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation should prolong the half-life of lamotrigine; discontinuing valproate should shorten the half-life of lamotrigine.

Bipolar Disorder: In the controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, type, or severity of adverse reactions following abrupt termination of SUBVENITE. In the clinical development program in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of SUBVENITE. Discontinuation of SUBVENITE should involve a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1e9afb3f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — states gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder; if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives; and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, with the instruction that before using an adjunct clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. It also states valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential and that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The discussion adds that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium; it notes carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and that gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment.

### Persistent low concentrations of antiepileptics in a critically ill paediatric patient: an example of multiple potential drug interactions [^eb774549]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Antiepileptic treatment and concentrations

Under the guidance of a specialised national epilepsy unit, the antiepileptic medication regimen was systematically monitored and adjusted in accordance with the patient's symptoms, concentrations of antiepileptic medications and clinical protocols.

At admission (day 0), the daily antiepileptic medication regimen included valproic acid (750 mg), lamotrigine (65 mg), topiramate (100 mg) and clobazam (12.5 mg). This daily regimen persisted throughout hospitalisation, with the exception of periodic adjustments to the valproic acid dosage. The antileptic medications were primarily administered orally through a gastrostomy or nasogastric tube. Only valproic acid was intermittently administered intravenously, as intravenous formulations of lamotrigine, topiramate, and clobazam were unavailable.

Starting on the 11th day of hospitalisation, the plasma concentration of valproic acid and serum concentrations of lamotrigine and topiramate rapidly decreased and remained below therapeutic levels for over 1 month, despite continuous treatment (figure 1). Clobazam levels were not consistently monitored during this period. Significant rises in the concentrations of valproic acid and lamotrigine were observed at day 30 and from day 59. Notably, both rises were preceded by a doubling of the valproic acid dose to 1600 mg on days 28–30 and 54–74, with each period followed by a gradual taper until days 32 and 81, respectively. It should further be noted that valproic acid was switched from oral to intravenous administration on days 7–8 and 25–32. Thus, the latter switch coincided with the rise in the valproic acid plasma concentration observed on day 30.

### Effect of carbamazepine and valproate monotherapy on cardiovascular risks in epileptic children [^43cf7cfb]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We determined the effects of carbamazepine and valproic acid on the serum lipids and apolipoprotein A and B in epileptic children on long-term monotherapy and 3 months after drug discontinuation.

Method

Thirty-three epileptic children (17 boys, 16 girls, mean age 9.79 ± 2.5 years) were evaluated for serum lipids and lipoprotein results at the initiation of antiepileptic drug tapering and 3 months after cessation of antiepileptic therapy.

Results

In the carbamazepine group (n = 13), there was no significant difference in the lipid profile at the end of therapy or at 3 months after the discontinuation, whereas in the valproate group (n = 20), triglycerides and apoprotein B and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly 3 months after discontinuation. The ratios of total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein improved but low-density lipoprotein:high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein:apolipoprotein remained unchanged.

Conclusion

Because these ratios are better predictor of atherosclerosis risk than the absolute values, the overall risk is not increased by the long-term use of carbamazepine and valproate.

### Antiepileptic drugs: the old and the new [^6071026a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

During the past decade several new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have become available, including new formulations of some of the older medications. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of the new AEDs is important because they are primarily used for adjunctive therapy and interactions with other medications can result in significant toxicities. The new-generation AEDs do not cause serious morbidity in overdose, and treatment is primarily supportive. Specific medications should be chosen based on the patient's history and presentation.

14.2 Adjunctive Therapy for Partial-Onset Seizures

The efficacy of APTIOM as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures was established in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials in adult patients with epilepsy (Study 3, Study 4, and Study 5). Patients enrolled had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization and were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. During an 8-week baseline period, patients were required to have an average of ≥ 4 partial-onset seizures per 28 days with no seizure-free period exceeding 21 days. In these three trials, patients had a median duration of epilepsy of 19 years and a median baseline seizure frequency of 8 seizures per 28 days. Two-thirds (69%) of subjects used 2 concomitant AEDs and 28% used 1 concomitant AED. The most commonly used AEDs were carbamazepine (50%), lamotrigine (24%), valproic acid (21%), and levetiracetam (18%). Oxcarbazepine was not allowed as a concomitant AED.

Studies 3 and 4 compared dosages of APTIOM 400, 800, and 1200 mg once daily with placebo. Study 5 compared dosages of APTIOM 800 and 1200 mg once daily with placebo. In all three trials, following an 8-week Baseline Phase, which established a baseline seizure frequency, subjects were randomized to a treatment arm. Patients entered a treatment period consisting of an initial titration phase (2 weeks), and a subsequent maintenance phase (12 weeks). The specific titration schedule differed amongst the three studies. Thus, patients were started on a daily dose of 400 mg or 800 mg and subsequently increased by 400 mg/day following one or two weeks, until the final daily target dose was achieved.

### Valproate-is withdrawal worth it? [^5038c953]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

This publication reinforces the importance of addressing potential risks of valproate withdrawal in both women and men and emphasizes the need for more informed discussions. While valproate should not be the first-line option in young women of childbearing potential, it is still used, and for some, it's the only drug that provides significant seizure control. The risk of never offering this medication to patients who have poorly controlled epilepsy warrant discussion as well. This commentary enforces our need to gather as much information as possible to help make joint patient/provider informed choices. All patients should be counseled not only about the risks to fertility and increased teratogenicity while remaining on valproate, but also on potential harms associated with valproate withdrawal, including the risks of increased ED attendance/hospital admissions, falls, injuries, burns, and new-onset depression. Further studies are needed to fully understand whether mortality increases in association with valproate withdrawal, as a difference was not found to be statistically significant. Additionally, studies are needed to clarify the rate of seizure increase or recurrence following valproate withdrawal. Overall, this study highlights the necessity and complexity of shared decision-making surrounding valproate withdrawal in young men and women, emphasizing that there are risks in both directions that need to be thoroughly considered.

### Is a separate monotherapy indication warranted for antiepileptic drugs? [^d57728ef]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the only neurotherapeutics for which regulatory approval is consistently separated into monotherapy or adjunctive-therapy indications. Because head-to-head comparisons of AEDs (used in the European Union to approve drugs for monotherapy) have not shown substantial differences in efficacy between drugs, FDA approval for use of an AED as monotherapy has typically been based on trials with novel designs that have been criticised for reasons of ethics and clinical relevance. Many new-generation AEDs have not been approved for monotherapy, causing drug labelling and real-world use to be increasingly inconsistent, with negative consequences for patients. The regulatory requirement for separate monotherapy and adjunctive-therapy indications in epilepsy is unnecessarily restrictive. We recommend that regulatory agencies approve AEDs for the treatment of specific seizure types or epilepsy syndromes, irrespective of concomitant drug use.

Full details are available in the original trial report. In brief, patients qualified for randomisation in arm B of the SANAD study if they had a history of two or more clinically definite unprovoked epileptic seizures in the previous year and if the recruiting clinician regarded valproate the better standard treatment option than carbamazepine. Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to valproate, lamotrigine or topiramate between 12 January 1999 and 31 August 2004.

### Lamotrigine versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^33f49009]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2006 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy. The correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AEDs for an individual is made using the highest quality evidence regarding the potential benefits and harms of the various treatments. It is also important that the effectiveness and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types are compared to one another. Carbamazepine or lamotrigine are first-line recommended treatments for new onset partial seizures and as a first- or second-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of the results for outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability and may assist in informing a choice between the two drugs.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, remission and first seizure with lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

The first searches for this review were run in 1997. For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (17 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 17 October 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 17 October 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures comparing monotherapy with either carbamazepine or lamotrigine.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment and our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post-randomisation, time to six-month, 12-month and 24-month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

We included 13 studies in this review. Individual participant data were available for 2572 participants out of 3394 eligible individuals from nine out of 13 trials: 78% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for lamotrigine. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were: time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), time to first seizure (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.37) and time to six-month remission (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94), showing a significant advantage for lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine for withdrawal but a significant advantage for carbamazepine compared to lamotrigine for first seizure and six-month remission. We found no difference between the drugs for time to 12-month remission (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07) or time to 24-month remission (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25), however only two trials followed up participants for more than one year so the evidence is limited. The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with partial onset seizures; 88% of included individuals experienced seizures of this type at baseline. Up to 50% of the limited number of individuals classified as experiencing generalised onset seizures at baseline may have had their seizure type misclassified, therefore we recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review for individuals with generalised onset seizures. The most commonly reported adverse events for both of the drugs across all of the included trials were dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and skin problems. The rate of adverse events was similar across the two drugs. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, however there is some evidence that the design choice of masked or open-label treatment may have influenced the withdrawal rates of the trials. Hence, we judged the quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment withdrawal to be moderate for individuals with partial onset seizures and low for individuals with generalised onset seizures. For efficacy outcomes (first seizure, remission), we judged the quality of evidence to be high for individuals with partial onset seizures and moderate for individuals with generalised onset seizures.

Authors' Conclusions

Lamotrigine was significantly less likely to be withdrawn than carbamazepine but the results for time to first seizure suggested that carbamazepine may be superior in terms of seizure control. A choice between these first-line treatments must be made with careful consideration. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with consideration of masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^01b01806]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy (inpatient), ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as an alternative option. Administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lacosamide monotherapy versus controlled-release carbamazepine in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy: a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^3eaa66b5]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Further options for monotherapy are needed to treat newly diagnosed epilepsy in adults. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lacosamide as a first-line monotherapy option for these patients.

Methods

In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, patients from 185 epilepsy or general neurology centres in Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific region, aged 16 years or older and with newly diagnosed epilepsy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, via a computer-generated code, to receive lacosamide monotherapy or controlled-release carbamazepine (carbamazepine-CR) twice daily. Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to treatment allocation. From starting doses of 100 mg/day lacosamide or 200 mg/day carbamazepine-CR, uptitration to the first target level of 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, took place over 2 weeks. After a 1-week stabilisation period, patients entered a 6-month assessment period. If a seizure occurred, the dose was titrated to the next target level (400 or 600 mg/day for lacosamide and 800 or 1200 mg/day for carbamazepine-CR) over 2 weeks with a 1-week stabilisation period, and the 6-month assessment period began again. Patients who completed 6 months of treatment and remained seizure-free entered a 6-month maintenance period on the same dose. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients remaining free from seizures for 6 consecutive months after stabilisation at the last assessed dose. The predefined non-inferiority criteria were -12% absolute and -20% relative difference between treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01243177.

Findings

The trial was done between April 27, 2011, and Aug 7, 2015. 888 patients were randomly assigned treatment. 444 patients taking lacosamide and 442 taking carbamazepine-CR were included in the full analysis set (took at least one dose of study treatment), and 408 and 397, respectively, were included in the per-protocol set. In the full analysis set, 327 (74%) patients in the lacosamide group and 308 (70%) in the carbamazepine-CR group completed 6 months of treatment without seizures. The proportion of patients in the full analysis set predicted by the Kaplan-Meier method to be seizure-free at 6 months was 90% taking lacosamide and 91% taking carbamazepine-CR (absolute treatment-difference: -1.3%, 95% CI -5.5 to 2.8 relative treatment difference: -6.0%). Kaplan-Meier estimates results were similar in the per-protocol set (92% and 93%; -1.3%, -5.3 to 2.7; -5.7%). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 328 (74%) patients receiving lacosamide and 332 (75%) receiving carbamazepine-CR. 32 (7%) patients taking lacosamide and 43 (10%) taking carbamazepine-CR had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, and 47 (11%) and 69 (16%), respectively, had treatment-emergent adverse events that led to withdrawal.

Interpretation

Treatment with lacosamide met the predefined non-inferiority criteria when compared with carbamazepine-CR. Therefore, it might be useful as first-line monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

### Seizures from valproate-carbapenem interaction [^72c57a01]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic medication interactions can complicate the management of epilepsy, by either increasing or reducing the effective serum concentrations thereby causing adverse effects or loss of seizure control.

Results

A 14-year-old girl with well-controlled juvenile absence epilepsy lost control of her seizures acutely following the administration of carbapenem for pneumonia. Serum valproate concentrations fell by 90% within 48 hours following carbapenem and returned to baseline following its discontinuation.

Conclusions

Awareness of this clinically significant interaction alters clinical practice by avoiding carbapenem or temporary use of adjunctive medication to prevent the clinical consequences of this significant drug interaction.

### Practice advisory: the use of felbamate in the treatment of patients with intractable epilepsy: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^54a5e07f]. Neurology (1999). Medium credibility.

Felbamate in partial-onset seizures — adjunctive therapy randomized trials show that there were two randomized controlled trials of felbamate as adjunctive therapy for intractable partial-onset seizures; in a crossover study adding felbamate to carbamazepine there was no statistically significant difference between placebo and felbamate periods and this was attributed to carbamazepine levels being lowered by felbamate, while in a three-armed double-blind trial with carbamazepine and phenytoin background antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) a mean dose of 2300 mg/day achieved a modest but statistically significant seizure reduction though lowered carbamazepine and phenytoin levels were again noted.

### Carbamazepine versus phenobarbitone monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^ab5dcdc5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review, first published in Issue 1, 2003 and updated in 2015. This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone are commonly used broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for partial onset seizures, and is used in the USA and Europe. Phenobarbitone is no longer considered a first-line treatment because of concerns over associated adverse events, particularly documented behavioural adverse events in children treated with the drug. However, phenobarbitone is still commonly used in low- and middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone in individual trials; however, the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide, and therefore, synthesising the data of the individual trials may show differences in efficacy.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, remission, and first seizure of carbamazepine compared with phenobarbitone when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 18 August 2016: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946), the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Previously we also searched SCOPUS (from 1823) as an alternative to Embase, but this is no longer necessary, because randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

RCTs in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of carbamazepine monotherapy versus phenobarbitone monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to achieve 12-month remission', 'time to achieve six-month remission', 'time to first seizure post-randomisation', and 'adverse events'. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with the generic inverse variance method used to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 836 participants out of 1455 eligible individuals from six out of 13 trials; 57% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, HR > 1 indicated an advantage for phenobarbitone, and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR > 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type, 95% CI) were HR 1.50 for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (95% CI 1.15 to 1.95; P = 0.003); HR 0.93 for time to achieve 12-month remission (95% CI 0.72 to 1.20; P = 0.57); HR 0.99 for time to achieve six-month remission (95% CI 0.80 to 1.23; P = 0.95); and HR 0.87 for time to first seizure (95% CI 0.72 to 1.06; P = 0.18). Results suggest an advantage for carbamazepine over phenobarbitone in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and no statistically significant evidence between the drugs for the other outcomes. We found evidence of a statistically significant interaction between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (Chi² test for subgroup differences P = 0.03), where phenobarbitone was favoured for partial onset seizures (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.96; P = 0.02) and carbamazepine was favoured for generalised onset seizures (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.77; P = 0.27). We found no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and seizure type for the other outcomes. However, methodological quality of the included studies was variable, with 10 out of the 13 included studies (4 out of 6 studies contributing IPD) judged at high risk of bias for at least one methodological aspect, leading to variable individual study results, and therefore, heterogeneity in the analyses of this review. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of poor methodological aspects, where possible.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, we found evidence suggestive of an advantage for carbamazepine in terms of drug effectiveness compared with phenobarbitone (retention of the drug in terms of seizure control and adverse events) and evidence suggestive of an association between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (phenobarbitone favoured for partial seizures and carbamazepine favoured for generalised seizures). However, this evidence was judged to be of low quality due to poor methodological quality and the potential impact on individual study results (and therefore variability (heterogeneity) present in the analysis within this review), we encourage caution when interpreting the results of this review and do not advocate that the results of this review alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with considerations for allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Efficacy and tolerability of zonisamide versus controlled-release carbamazepine for newly diagnosed partial epilepsy: a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^2cf2e9f9]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Additional options are needed for monotherapy treatment of adults newly diagnosed with partial epilepsy. This trial compares the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily zonisamide with twice-daily controlled-release carbamazepine monotherapy for such patients.

Methods

In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial, adults from 120 centres in Asia, Australia, and Europe, aged 18–75 years and newly diagnosed with partial epilepsy, were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio, done with a computer-generated pseudorandom code) to receive zonisamide or carbamazepine. Patients, investigators, and sponsor personnel giving drugs, analysing outcomes, and interpreting data were masked to treatment allocation. After treatment initiation (zonisamide 100 mg/day vs carbamazepine 200 mg/day [given in two doses]) and up-titration (to 300 mg/day vs 600 mg/day), patients entered a 26–78 weeks flexible-dosing period (200–500 mg/day vs 400–1200 mg/day, according to response and tolerance). Once patients were seizure-free for 26 weeks they entered a 26-week maintenance phase. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved seizure freedom for 26 weeks or more in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00477295.

Findings

583 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (282 zonisamide, 301 carbamazepine), of whom 456 were analysed for the primary endpoint (per-protocol population: 223 zonisamide, 233 carbamazepine). 177 of 223 (79.4%) patients in the zonisamide group and 195 of 233 (83.7%) patients in the carbamazepine group were seizure-free for 26 weeks or more (adjusted absolute treatment difference -4.5%, 95% CI -12.2 to 3.1). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 170 (60%) in the zonisamide group versus 185 (62%) in the carbamazepine group, of which 15 (5%) versus 17 (6%) were serious and 31 (11%) versus 35 (12%) led to withdrawal.

Interpretation

Zonisamide was non-inferior to controlled-release carbamazepine — according to International League Against Epilepsy guidelines — and could be useful as an initial monotherapy for patients newly diagnosed with partial epilepsy.

### Carbamazepine versus phenytoin monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^a873388e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 2, 2002 and its subsequent update in 2010. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which recurrent, unprovoked seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenytoin are commonly used broad spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first line treatment for partial onset seizures in the USA and Europe. Phenytoin is no longer considered a first line treatment due to concerns over adverse events associated with its use, however the drug is still commonly used in low- to middle-income countries due to it's low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenytoin in individual trials, however the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide. Therefore, differences in efficacy may be shown by synthesising the data of the individual trials.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, six- and 12-month remission, and first seizure of carbamazepine compared to phenytoin when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures) or generalised tonic-clonic seizures, with or without other generalised seizure types.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (16 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to 16 September 2014), SCOPUS (1823 to 16 September 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (16 September 2014), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (18 September 2014). We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of carbamazepine monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, and our secondary outcomes were time to 12-month remission, time to six-month remission and time to first seizure post-randomisation. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 595 participants out of 1192 eligible individuals, from four out of 12 trials (i.e. 50% of the potential data). For remission outcomes, HR > 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR > 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. Methodological quality of the four studies providing IPD was generally good and we rated it at low risk of bias overall in the analyses. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.39); time to 12-month remission: 1.01 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.31); time to six-month remission: 1.11 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.37); and time to first seizure: 0.85 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.04). The results suggest no overall statistically significant difference between the drugs for these outcomes. There is some evidence of an advantage for phenytoin for individuals with generalised onset seizures for our primary outcome (time to withdrawal of allocated treatment): pooled HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.96); and a statistical interaction between treatment effect and epilepsy type (partial versus generalised) for this outcome (P = 0.02), however misclassification of seizure type for up to 48 individuals (32% of those with generalised epilepsy) may have confounded the results of this review. Despite concerns over side effects leading to the withdrawal of phenytoin as first line treatment in the USA and Europe, we found no evidence that phenytoin is more likely to be associated with serious side effects than carbamazepine; 26 individuals withdrew from 290 randomised (9%) to carbamazepine due to adverse effects compared to 12 out of 299 (4%) randomised to phenytoin from four studies conducted in the USA and Europe (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80, P = 0.014). We rated the quality of the evidence as low - moderate according to GRADE criteria, due to imprecision and potential misclassification of seizure type.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found evidence that a statistically significant difference exists between carbamazepine and phenytoin for the efficacy outcomes examined in this review, however, CIs are wide and the possibility of important differences existing has not been excluded. There is no evidence in this review that phenytoin is more strongly associated with serious adverse events than carbamazepine. There is some evidence that participants with generalised seizures may be less likely to withdraw early from phenytoin than carbamazepine, but misclassification of seizure type may have impacted upon the results of this review. We recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review, and do not recommend that the results of this review alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenytoin. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with considerations on allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^b5ebec37]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical context — when a patient with a first seizure has one or more ensuing seizures, an antiepileptic drug (AED) should be initiated because the risk of additional seizures is very high (57% by 1 year and 73% by 4 years), with risk increasing proportionally after each subsequent recurrence as the time interval between seizures decreases, whereas immediate AED treatment at the time of the first unprovoked seizure is not well accepted and is debated.

### Eslicarbazepine acetate [^8fb67cc6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Adjunctive Therapy for Partial-Onset Seizures

The efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures was established in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials in adult patients with epilepsy (Study 3, Study 4, and Study 5). Patients enrolled had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization and were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. During an 8-week baseline period, patients were required to have an average of ≥ 4 partial-onset seizures per 28 days with no seizure-free period exceeding 21 days. In these three trials, patients had a median duration of epilepsy of 19 years and a median baseline seizure frequency of 8 seizures per 28 days. Two-thirds (69%) of subjects used 2 concomitant AEDs and 28% used 1 concomitant AED. The most commonly used AEDs were carbamazepine (50%), lamotrigine (24%), valproic acid (21%), and levetiracetam (18%). Oxcarbazepine was not allowed as a concomitant AED.

Studies 3 and 4 compared dosages of eslicarbazepine acetate 400, 800, and 1,200 mg once daily with placebo. Study 5 compared dosages of eslicarbazepine acetate 800 and 1,200 mg once daily with placebo. In all three trials, following an 8-week Baseline Phase, which established a baseline seizure frequency, subjects were randomized to a treatment arm. Patients entered a treatment period consisting of an initial titration phase (2 weeks), and a subsequent maintenance phase (12 weeks). The specific titration schedule differed amongst the three studies. Thus, patients were started on a daily dose of 400 mg or 800 mg and subsequently increased by 400 mg/day following one or two weeks, until the final daily target dose was achieved.

### Lamotrigine [^7d479823]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Epilepsy — Conversion From Adjunctive Therapy to Monotherapy

The goal of the transition regimen is to attempt to maintain seizure control while mitigating the risk of serious rash associated with the rapid titration of lamotrigine tablets.

The recommended maintenance dose of lamotrigine tablets as monotherapy is 500 mg/day given in 2 divided doses.

To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations for lamotrigine tablets should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning].

Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Tablets

After achieving a dose of 500 mg/day of lamotrigine tablets using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant enzyme-inducing AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4-week period. The regimen for the withdrawal of the concomitant AED is based on experience gained in the controlled monotherapy clinical trial.

Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Tablets

The conversion regimen involves the 4 steps outlined in Table 4.

Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Antiepileptic Drugs other than Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, or Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Tablets

No specific dosing guidelines can be provided for conversion to monotherapy with lamotrigine tablets with AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate.

Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

SANAD — Arm A (Class III randomized unblinded; children and adults, 89% focal) — primary outcomes were time to treatment failure and time to 12-month remission; lamotrigine outperformed carbamazepine, gabapentin, and topiramate for treatment failure and had a nonsignificant advantage over oxcarbazepine, whereas carbamazepine outperformed gabapentin for 12-month remission and had a nonsignificant advantage over lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate; lamotrigine was inferior to carbamazepine for 12-month remission at 2 and 4 years, and adverse-event intolerability leading to discontinuation was less frequent with gabapentin and lamotrigine than with oxcarbazepine and topiramate, with rash more frequent with carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, weight gain/dizziness/ataxia more with gabapentin, and psychiatric symptoms/weight loss/paresthesia more with topiramate.

### Gabapentin (Gabarone) [^366c256d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Phenytoin

In a single (400 mg) and multiple dose (400 mg three times a day) study of GABARONE in epileptic patients (N = 8) maintained on phenytoin monotherapy for at least 2 months, gabapentin had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenytoin had no effect on gabapentin pharmacokinetics.

Carbamazepine

Steady-state trough plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 epoxide concentrations were not affected by concomitant gabapentin (400 mg three times a day; N = 12) administration. Likewise, gabapentin pharmacokinetics were unaltered by carbamazepine administration.

Valproic Acid

The mean steady-state trough serum valproic acid concentrations prior to and during concomitant gabapentin administration (400 mg three times a day; N = 17) were not different and neither were gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters affected by valproic acid.

Phenobarbital

Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for phenobarbital or gabapentin (300 mg three times a day; N = 12) are identical whether the drugs are administered alone or together.

Naproxen

Coadministration (N = 18) of naproxen sodium capsules (250 mg) with GABARONE (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%. Gabapentin had no effect on naproxen pharmacokinetic parameters. These doses are lower than the therapeutic doses for both drugs. The magnitude of interaction within the recommended dose ranges of either drug is not known.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^50bbf41a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal severity-based care — mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar score < 10) may be managed with pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone, using carbamazepine or gabapentin if providing medication, and benzodiazepines if risk of worsening symptoms while away from care. Moderate withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar scores 10–18) should receive pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line, with carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternatives; for contraindications to benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital in Level 2–WM are appropriate, and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as adjuncts. Severe, but not complicated, withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar ≥ 19) may be treated in ambulatory Level 2–WM with pharmacotherapy; benzodiazepines are first-line, phenobarbital is an alternative, and for benzodiazepine contraindications phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate.

### Topiramate versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^42be1949]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy, the majority of which may be able to achieve remission with a single antiepileptic drug (AED). The correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AED for an individual is based on the highest-quality evidence available regarding the potential benefits and harms of various treatments. It is also important to compare the efficacy and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types. Topiramate and carbamazepine are commonly used AEDs. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of results of outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability, and may help inform a choice between the two drugs.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topiramate monotherapy versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy in people with partial-onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (14 April 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (14 April 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 14 April 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial-onset seizures or generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types with a comparison of monotherapy with either topiramate or carbamazepine.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to first seizure post randomisation', 'time to 6-month remission, 'time to 12-month remission' and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HRs and 95% CIs.

Main Results

IPD were available for 1151 of 1239 eligible individuals from two of three eligible studies (93% of the potential data). A small proportion of individuals recruited into these trials had 'unclassified seizures;' for analysis purposes, these individuals are grouped with those with generalised onset seizures. For remission outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine, and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for topiramate. The main overall results, given as pooled HR adjusted for seizure type (95% CI) were: for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment 1.16 (0.98 to 1.38); time to first seizure 1.11 (0.96 to 1.29); and time to 6-month remission 0.88 (0.76 to 1.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the drugs. A statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to 12-month remission: 0.84 (0.71 to 1.00). The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with partial-onset seizures; 85% of included individuals experienced seizures of this type at baseline. For individuals with partial-onset seizures, a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.45) and time to 12-month remission (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00). No statistically significant differences were apparent between the drugs for other outcomes and for the limited number of individuals with generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types or unclassified seizures. The most commonly reported adverse events with both drugs were drowsiness or fatigue, 'pins and needles' (tingling sensation), headache, gastrointestinal disturbance and anxiety or depression The rate of adverse events was similar across the two drugs. We judged the methodological quality of the included trials generally to be good; however, there was some evidence that the open-label design of the larger of the two trials may have influenced the withdrawal rate from the trial. Hence, we judged the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment withdrawal to be moderate for individuals with partial-onset seizures and low for individuals with generalised-onset seizures. For efficacy outcomes (first seizure, remission), we judged the evidence from this review to be high for individuals with partial-onset seizures and moderate for individuals with generalised-onset or unclassified seizures.

Authors' Conclusions

For individuals with partial-onset seizures, there is evidence that carbamazepine is less likely to be withdrawn and that 12-month remission will be achieved earlier than with topiramate. No differences were found between the drugs in terms of the outcomes measured in the review for individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures with or without other seizure types or unclassified epilepsy; however, we encourage caution in the interpretation of these results due to the small numbers of participants with these seizure types. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible and take into consideration masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy [^9484530f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2011) on 'Felbamate as an add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy'. Epilepsy is a chronic and disabling neurologic disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Up to 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are resistant to currently available drugs. Felbamate is one of the second-generation antiepileptic drugs and its effects as an add-on therapy to standard drugs are assessed in this review.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of felbamate versus placebo when used as an add-on treatment for people with refractory partial-onset epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (24 July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 6), and PubMed (24 July 2013). This search was run for the original review on 20 May 2010. There were no language and time restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies to search for additional reports of relevant studies. We also contacted the manufacturers of felbamate and experts in the field for information about any unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized placebo-controlled add-on studies of people of any age with refractory partial-onset seizures. The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and could be of parallel or crossover design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted information. We resolved disagreements by discussion. If disagreements persisted, the third review author arbitrated. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; absolute or percentage reduction in seizure frequency; treatment withdrawal; adverse effects; quality of life.

Main Results

Three randomised controlled trials with a total of 153 participants were included. The first was a parallel design, the second had a two-period crossover design, and the third had a three-period crossover design. One study was at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. And in the same study, there was no description of how to blind outcome assessment, performance blinding was for participants, might not be for doctors. Two studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the results. None of the three studies reported 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Only one study reported absolute and percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo, P values were 0.046 and 0.018, respectively. Adverse effects rates were higher during the felbamate period than the placebo period, particularly headache, nausea and dizziness.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the methodological deficiencies, limited number of individual studies and differences in outcome measure, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. A large-scale, randomised controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time is required to inform clinical practice. Since the last version of this review no new studies have been found.

### Lamotrigine (Subvenite) [^577945f3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Epilepsy-Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy to Monotherapy

The goal of the transition regimen is to attempt to maintain seizure control while mitigating the risk of serious rash associated with the rapid titration of SUBVENITE.

The recommended maintenance dose of SUBVENITE as monotherapy is 500 mg/day given in 2 divided doses.

To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations for SUBVENITE should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning].

Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone to Monotherapy with SUBVENITE

After achieving a dose of 500 mg/day of SUBVENITE using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant enzyme-inducing AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4-week period. The regimen for the withdrawal of the concomitant AED is based on experience gained in the controlled monotherapy clinical trial.

Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with SUBVENITE

The conversion regimen involves the 4 steps outlined in Table 4.

Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Antiepileptic Drugs other than Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, or Valproate to Monotherapy with SUBVENITE

No specific dosing guidelines can be provided for conversion to monotherapy with SUBVENITE with AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate.

### Lamotrigine [^82527e3f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Epilepsy

Monotherapy with Lamotrigine in Adults with Partial-Onset Seizures Already Receiving Treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone as the Single Antiepileptic Drug

The effectiveness of monotherapy with lamotrigine was established in a multicenter, double-blind clinical trial enrolling 156 adult outpatients with partial-onset seizures. The patients experienced at least 4 simple partial-onset, complex partial-onset, and/or secondarily generalized seizures during each of 2 consecutive 4-week periods while receiving carbamazepine or phenytoin monotherapy during baseline. Lamotrigine (target dose of 500 mg/day) or valproate (1,000 mg/day) was added to either carbamazepine or phenytoin monotherapy over a 4-week period. Patients were then converted to monotherapy with lamotrigine or valproate during the next 4 weeks, then continued on monotherapy for an additional 12-week period.

Trial endpoints were completion of all weeks of trial treatment or meeting an escape criterion. Criteria for escape relative to baseline were: (1) doubling of average monthly seizure count, (2) doubling of highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency, (3) emergence of a new seizure type (defined as a seizure that did not occur during the 8-week baseline) that is more severe than seizure types that occur during study treatment, or (4) clinically significant prolongation of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who met escape criteria.

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^4ca0799b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentrations for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the Depakote dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

In epileptic patients previously receiving valproic acid therapy, Depakote tablets should be initiated at the same daily dose and dosing schedule. After the patient is stabilized on Depakote tablets, a dosing schedule of two or three times a day may be elected in selected patients.

2.3 Migraine

Depakote is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.

Depakote tablets are administered orally. The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1,000 mg/day. In the clinical trials, there was no evidence that higher doses led to greater efficacy.

### Antiepileptic drug monotherapy for epilepsy: a network meta-analysis of individual participant data [^830acdf0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition with a worldwide prevalence of around 1%. Approximately 60% to 70% of people with epilepsy will achieve a longer-term remission from seizures, and most achieve that remission shortly after starting antiepileptic drug treatment. Most people with epilepsy are treated with a single antiepileptic drug (monotherapy) and current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom for adults and children recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as first-line treatment for partial onset seizures and sodium valproate for generalised onset seizures; however a range of other antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments are available, and evidence is needed regarding their comparative effectiveness in order to inform treatment choices.

Objectives

To compare the time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, remission and first seizure of 10 AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbitone, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, zonisamide) currently used as monotherapy in children and adults with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial or secondary generalised) or generalised tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types (absence, myoclonus).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Epilepsy's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and SCOPUS, and two clinical trials registers. We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field. The date of the most recent search was 27 July 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of a monotherapy design in adults or children with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review and network meta-analysis. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to achieve 12-month remission', 'time to achieve six-month remission', 'time to first seizure post-randomisation', and 'occurrence of adverse events'. We presented all time-to-event outcomes as Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed pairwise meta-analysis of head-to-head comparisons between drugs within trials to obtain 'direct' treatment effect estimates and we performed frequentist network meta-analysis to combine direct evidence with indirect evidence across the treatment network of 10 drugs. We investigated inconsistency between direct estimates and network meta-analysis via node splitting. Due to variability in methods and detail of reporting adverse events, we have not performed an analysis. We have provided a narrative summary of the most commonly reported adverse events.

Main Results

IPD was provided for at least one outcome of this review for 12,391 out of a total of 17,961 eligible participants (69% of total data) from 36 out of the 77 eligible trials (47% of total trials). We could not include IPD from the remaining 41 trials in analysis for a variety of reasons, such as being unable to contact an author or sponsor to request data, data being lost or no longer available, cost and resources required to prepare data being prohibitive, or local authority or country-specific restrictions. We were able to calculate direct treatment effect estimates for between half and two thirds of comparisons across the outcomes of the review, however for many of the comparisons, data were contributed by only a single trial or by a small number of participants, so confidence intervals of estimates were wide. Network meta-analysis showed that for the primary outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', for individuals with partial seizures; levetiracetam performed (statistically) significantly better than both current first-line treatments carbamazepine and lamotrigine; lamotrigine performed better than all other treatments (aside from levetiracetam), and carbamazepine performed significantly better than gabapentin and phenobarbitone (high-quality evidence). For individuals with generalised onset seizures, first-line treatment sodium valproate performed significantly better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbitone (moderate- to high-quality evidence). Furthermore, for both partial and generalised onset seizures, the earliest licenced treatment, phenobarbitone seems to perform worse than all other treatments (moderate- to high-quality evidence). Network meta-analysis also showed that for secondary outcomes 'Time to 12-month remission of seizures' and 'Time to six-month remission of seizures', few notable differences were shown for either partial or generalised seizure types (moderate- to high-quality evidence). For secondary outcome 'Time to first seizure', for individuals with partial seizures; phenobarbitone performed significantly better than both current first-line treatments carbamazepine and lamotrigine; carbamazepine performed significantly better than sodium valproate, gabapentin and lamotrigine. Phenytoin also performed significantly better than lamotrigine (high-quality evidence). In general, the earliest licenced treatments (phenytoin and phenobarbitone) performed better than the other treatments for both seizure types (moderate- to high-quality evidence). Generally, direct evidence and network meta-analysis estimates (direct plus indirect evidence) were numerically similar and consistent with confidence intervals of effect sizes overlapping. The most commonly reported adverse events across all drugs were drowsiness/fatigue, headache or migraine, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness/faintness and rash or skin disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the high-quality evidence provided by this review supports current guidance (e.g. NICE) that carbamazepine and lamotrigine are suitable first-line treatments for individuals with partial onset seizures and also demonstrates that levetiracetam may be a suitable alternative. High-quality evidence from this review also supports the use of sodium valproate as the first-line treatment for individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types) and also demonstrates that lamotrigine and levetiracetam would be suitable alternatives to either of these first-line treatments, particularly for those of childbearing potential, for whom sodium valproate may not be an appropriate treatment option due to teratogenicity.

### Conversion to eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy: a pooled analysis of 2 phase III studies [^9f14dde9]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Baseline AEDs.

KM-estimated exit rates were also calculated for subgroups defined by baseline AED use (for AEDs taken by ≥ 15% of patients; figure 2B). Use of carbamazepine (n = 91), lamotrigine (n = 49), levetiracetam (n = 82), and valproic acid (n = 66) at baseline did not have statistically significant effects on risk of exit (figure 2C).

Overall, 31.0% of patients were taking 2 AEDs during the baseline period. The exit risk was significantly higher for patients taking 2 baseline AEDs (vs 1; figure 2C). In addition, exit risk was significantly lower for patients taking phenytoin at baseline (vs those not taking phenytoin; p = 0.049), although the sample size was small (only 30 patients were taking baseline phenytoin).

Benzodiazepine use.

Patients who used benzodiazepines had a higher risk of study exit (figure 2C). Approximately 7.8% of patients had not used benzodiazepines before randomization but used them during the 18-week treatment period. In a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, in which patients who used benzodiazepines after the start of the AED conversion period, but not before the first dose of study medication, were deemed to have met the exit criteria, the UCLs of exit rates for both ESL dose groups were also lower than the 65.3% historical control threshold (1,600 mg = 24.2% [95% CI: 18.9%–30.8%]; 1,200 mg = 32.6% [24.6%–42.4%]).

Disease characteristics.

Exit risk was also found to be higher for patients with a duration of epilepsy ≥ 20 years, for patients with a higher baseline seizure rate (maximum consecutive 2-day rate), for those who used vagal nerve stimulation during baseline, and for those who used rescue medication (figure 2C).

### Topiramate versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^6e6c1d87]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 12, 2016. This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy, the majority of which may be able to achieve remission with a single antiepileptic drug (AED). The correct choice of first-line AED for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance and should be based on the highest-quality evidence available regarding the potential benefits and harms of various treatments for an individual. Topiramate and carbamazepine are commonly used AEDs. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of results of outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability, and may help inform a choice between the two drugs.

Objectives

To review the time to treatment failure, remission and first seizure with topiramate compared with carbamazepine when used as monotherapy in people with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalised), or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (Ovid); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 22 May 2018. We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing monotherapy with either topiramate or carbamazepine in children or adults with focal onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD), review. Our primary outcome was time to treatment failure. Our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post-randomisation, time to six-month remission, time to 12-month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 1151 of 1239 eligible individuals from two of three eligible studies (93% of the potential data). A small proportion of individuals recruited into these trials had 'unclassified seizures;' for analysis purposes, these individuals are grouped with those with generalised onset seizures. For remission outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine, and for first seizure and treatment failure outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for topiramate. The main overall results for the primary outcome, time to treatment failure, given as pooled HR adjusted for seizure type were: time to failure for any reason related to treatment 1.16 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.38); time to failure due to adverse events 1.02 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.27); and time to failure due to lack of efficacy 1.46 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.98). Overall results for secondary outcomes were time to first seizure 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29); and time to six-month remission 0.88 (0.76 to 1.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the drugs. A statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to 12-month remission: 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99). The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with focal onset seizures; 81% of individuals included within the analysis experienced seizures of this type at baseline. For individuals with focal onset seizures, a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to failure for any reason related to treatment (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.46), time to treatment failure due to lack of efficacy (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.02), and time to 12-month remission (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). There was no statistically significant difference between topiramate and carbamazepine for 'time to first seizure' and 'time to six-month remission'. Evidence for individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures (9% of participants contributing to the analysis), and unclassified seizure types (10% of participants contributing to the analysis) was very limited; no statistically significant differences were found but CIs were wide; therefore we cannot exclude an advantage to either drug, or a difference between drugs. The most commonly reported adverse events with both drugs were drowsiness or fatigue, "pins and needles" (tingling sensation), headache, gastrointestinal disturbance and anxiety or depression. The rate of adverse events was similar across the two drugs. We judged the methodological quality of the included trials generally to be good; however, there was some evidence that the open-label design of the larger of the two trials may have influenced the treatment failure rate within the trial. Hence, we judged the certainty of the evidence for treatment failure to be moderate for individuals with focal onset seizures and low for individuals with generalised onset seizures. For efficacy outcomes (first seizure, remission), we judged the certainty of evidence from this review to be high for individuals with focal onset seizures and moderate for individuals with generalised onset or unclassified seizures.

Authors' Conclusions

For individuals with focal onset seizures, there is moderate-certainty evidence that carbamazepine is less likely to be withdrawn and high-certainty evidence that 12-month remission will be achieved earlier than with topiramate. We did not find any differences between the drugs in terms of the other outcomes measured in the review and for individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures or unclassified epilepsy; however, we encourage caution in the interpretation of results including small numbers of participants with these seizure types. Future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible and take into consideration masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^5351419d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.2 Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs

Valproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronyltransferases.

The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate co-administration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed medications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed

Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline

Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^da221b5a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy (inpatient), ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone in patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score < 10) at minimal risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin for pharmacotherapy. Administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^177cbf46]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — management of inadequate response and adjuncts: Patients receiving pharmacotherapy should be monitored for signs of response to medication. If response is insufficient, first consider increasing the dose, recognizing that patients with more severe withdrawal may require larger doses and that large doses of benzodiazepine can lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, especially in patients with liver disease. Second, patients should be reassessed for appropriate level of care because failure to respond may reflect more severe withdrawal with significant risk of major complications, and a more intensive level of care may be needed. Third, consider switching to a different medication since nonresponse may reflect benzodiazepine resistance due to kindling, decreased responsiveness after multiple withdrawal episodes, or withdrawal from another GABAergic agent; in these cases, switching to an alternative medication should be considered. Fourth, if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication, with carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as options for severe or moderate withdrawal, noting valproic acid should not be used in patients with acute liver impairment or women of childbearing potential. Adjunct phenobarbital can be used in severe withdrawal with close monitoring, phenobarbital and benzodiazepines have additive clinical effects, and alpha2-adrenergic agonists and a beta-adrenergic antagonist can be used with benzodiazepines to manage persistent hypertension or tachycardia.
