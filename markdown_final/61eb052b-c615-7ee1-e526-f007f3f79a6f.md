## Question

Patient with right lower quadrant pain and fever potential disgnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential diagnoses for a patient with right lower quadrant pain and fever. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why. Then, I should verify key mimics that commonly present similarly. Next, I will consider age- and sex-specific differentials, including pregnancy. After that, I need to check the role of clinical scoring systems and laboratory markers. Then, I will review imaging strategy and when to escalate to CT. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and outline immediate next steps, including red flags and disposition decisions.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Right lower quadrant pain with fever most strongly suggests acute appendicitis, which remains the most common surgical cause of RLQ pain in adults and children, and the combination of focal RLQ pain with systemic inflammatory features increases its likelihood substantially, with meta-analytic data showing a positive likelihood ratio around 7–8 for RLQ pain and supportive features such as rigidity and migration further increasing probability [^3e3e7bb7] [^2487d3e2] [^79181bf9].

> Wait, let me verify the key mimics that can confound this presentation. Right-sided diverticulitis, particularly cecal diverticulitis, can mimic appendicitis with RLQ pain and fever and is an important consideration, especially in younger patients or those of Asian descent, and CT is typically required to distinguish it from appendicitis and avoid unnecessary surgery [^c63ccbe7] [^869f5845]. Mesenteric adenitis, often viral or Yersinia-related, can present with RLQ pain and fever, particularly in school-aged children, and stool testing for Yersinia is reasonable when diarrhea or epidemiologic risk is present [^13841d2a] [^4c0bbc35]. Inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum, can cause RLQ pain with fever and systemic features and should be considered in the right clinical context [^c966fa70]. Gynecologic pathology in females, including ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, and ovarian cyst rupture, can present with RLQ pain and fever and must be actively excluded with pregnancy testing and pelvic ultrasound when appropriate [^7003cd7c] [^dc88c9f5].

> I need to ensure I account for age-specific nuances. In children, appendicitis is common and fever meaningfully increases the likelihood, with migration of pain and rebound tenderness adding diagnostic value; however, missed diagnoses occur more often when presentations are atypical or when classic features are absent, so a lower threshold for imaging is prudent in equivocal cases [^affc2d07] [^56247802]. In older adults, appendicitis may present atypically with less fever and more generalized peritonitis or ileus, and perforation rates are higher, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider early imaging even when the classic triad is incomplete [^1f797ffa]. In pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line and MRI without contrast is preferred if ultrasound is nondiagnostic, given radiation considerations and the altered anatomy in advancing gestation [^dc88c9f5] [^7003cd7c].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of clinical scoring systems. The Alvarado and AIR scores incorporate fever, RLQ pain, migration, rebound, and inflammatory markers and can stratify risk, but they should augment rather than replace clinical judgment; in particular, a high score supports surgical consultation, whereas a low score does not fully exclude appendicitis and may warrant observation or imaging if suspicion persists [^fe9e4ac7] [^23222e9f]. I should double-check that these tools are less reliable in special populations such as pregnancy, the elderly, and very young children, reinforcing the need for individualized decisions [^23222e9f].

> Next, I should review laboratory markers and their limitations. Leukocytosis and elevated CRP are common in appendicitis but are nonspecific; importantly, their absence does not rule out disease, and up to about 15% of patients with appendicitis may have isolated RLQ pain without fever or leukocytosis, so I must not anchor on normal labs when the clinical picture is concerning [^e591c49c] [^e94c4b01]. I need to check for urinary abnormalities that might suggest urologic pathology, and in women of childbearing age, a pregnancy test is mandatory to exclude ectopic pregnancy before any imaging that involves radiation [^1deae787].

> I will now examine the imaging strategy. For nonpregnant adults with RLQ pain and fever, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the most appropriate first-line test because of its high sensitivity and specificity and its ability to identify alternative diagnoses; this approach has markedly reduced negative appendectomy rates in contemporary practice [^341df34e] [^79181bf9]. In children, ultrasound is preferred initially to avoid radiation, with CT reserved for inconclusive studies or when complications are suspected; in pregnancy, ultrasound followed by MRI without contrast is the recommended sequence to balance diagnostic yield and safety [^1e5f076d] [^dc88c9f5]. But wait, what if resources or expertise limit CT access? In that scenario, serial clinical reassessment, observation, and selective imaging remain acceptable, albeit with a higher risk of delayed diagnosis if vigilance wanes [^d237c4a8].

> Let me consider the differential in tiers to guide pretest probabilities. Tier 1, most likely, is acute appendicitis. Tier 2, common mimics requiring exclusion, includes right-sided diverticulitis, mesenteric adenitis, IBD, and gynecologic pathology in females. Tier 3, less common but important, includes Meckel's diverticulitis, epiploic appendagitis, cecal ischemia or gangrene, and appendiceal neoplasm; these are typically identified on CT when the diagnosis remains uncertain after initial evaluation [^c966fa70] [^9d0fc55c] [^62c3d359]. I should confirm that persistent or atypical symptoms, especially in older adults or those with vascular risk, prompt consideration of ischemic or neoplastic etiologies and justify cross-sectional imaging even when appendicitis seems less likely [^c966fa70].

> I should double-check red flags that mandate urgent action. Generalized peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, intractable vomiting with suspected obstruction, or marked leukocytosis with systemic toxicity should trigger immediate surgical consultation, resuscitation, and expedited imaging as the patient's stability allows; delays in source control for complicated intra-abdominal infection increase morbidity and mortality [^519f42ab] [^2762e27a]. In pregnant patients, any RLQ pain with fever warrants prompt evaluation given the risks of perforation and preterm labor, reinforcing the need for timely ultrasound and MRI when indicated [^dc88c9f5].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps in a typical ED workflow. Obtain a focused history emphasizing pain migration, nausea, anorexia, bowel habit changes, dysuria, and menstrual history; perform a targeted exam for RLQ tenderness, rebound, guarding, Rovsing and psoas signs; order CBC, CRP or ESR, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age; apply a clinical score such as Alvarado or AIR to stratify risk; and select imaging based on age, sex, and pregnancy status, with CT with contrast for most nonpregnant adults, ultrasound-first for children and pregnant patients, and MRI when ultrasound is nondiagnostic in pregnancy [^1deae787] [^341df34e] [^dc88c9f5]. Hold on, I should verify disposition thresholds: high-risk patients should have surgical consultation and admission, intermediate-risk patients often benefit from observation and repeat exam or imaging, and low-risk patients may be discharged with strict return precautions if reliable follow-up is assured [^d237c4a8].

> In summary, I need to ensure that appendicitis remains the working diagnosis in RLQ pain with fever while systematically excluding mimics that can alter management. A structured approach using clinical scoring, judicious labs, and guideline-concordant imaging reduces missed diagnoses and unnecessary surgery, and it adapts to special populations where presentations are atypical and consequences of delay are greater [^3e3e7bb7] [^79181bf9] [^56247802].

Right lower quadrant pain with fever most often indicates **appendicitis** [^3e3e7bb7], but the differential is broad and includes **gastrointestinal, gynecologic, genitourinary, and infectious etiologies** [^c966fa70]. A structured approach — history, exam, labs, and imaging — is essential to prioritize the differential and guide management [^1deae787]. Contrast-enhanced CT is the **first-line imaging** for nonpregnant adults [^341df34e], while ultrasound is preferred in children and pregnant patients [^1e5f076d] [^dc88c9f5]. Early recognition and targeted imaging reduce morbidity and prevent delays in definitive care [^56247802].

## Gastrointestinal causes

- **Appendicitis**: Most common surgical cause of RLQ pain with fever; classically migrates from periumbilical to RLQ, with nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis [^3e3e7bb7] [^2487d3e2].

- **Right-sided diverticulitis**: Mimics appendicitis; more common in Asian populations; CT helps distinguish [^c63ccbe7] [^869f5845].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Crohn's disease can cause RLQ pain with fever, diarrhea, and weight loss [^c966fa70].

- **Meckel's diverticulitis**: Congenital anomaly presenting like appendicitis [^notfound].

- **Epiploic appendagitis**: Self-limited inflammation of epiploic appendages; often afebrile or low-grade fever [^3da65483].

---

## Gynecologic causes

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Life-threatening; consider in any fertile female with RLQ pain and fever [^notfound].

- **Ovarian torsion**: Acute RLQ pain with nausea; fever may be late or absent [^notfound].

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Bilateral lower abdominal pain, fever, cervical motion tenderness, and discharge [^notfound].

- **Ovarian cyst rupture or torsion**: Sudden RLQ pain, often with nausea; fever may indicate infection or inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Genitourinary causes

- **Pyelonephritis**: Flank pain, fever, dysuria, and leukocytosis; urinalysis shows pyuria and bacteriuria [^82afdc3f].

- **Nephrolithiasis**: Colicky flank pain radiating to groin; fever suggests obstruction with infection [^notfound].

- **Prostatitis**: Perineal or RLQ pain with fever and urinary symptoms in males [^notfound].

---

## Infectious causes

- **Yersinia enterocolitica**: Mimics appendicitis, especially in children; stool cultures are diagnostic [^13841d2a] [^4c0bbc35].

- **Salmonella or Campylobacter gastroenteritis**: Diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain; stool cultures confirm [^13841d2a].

- **Tuberculosis**: Chronic RLQ pain with fever, weight loss, and night sweats [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic modality** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| History and physical examination | Identify classic features, risk factors, and alternate diagnoses [^1deae787] | Initial triage |
| Laboratory tests | CBC, urinalysis, pregnancy test, CRP | Support diagnosis and exclude alternatives [^1deae787] |
| Imaging | - CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast (nonpregnant adults) [^341df34e] <br/> - Ultrasound (children, pregnant) [^1e5f076d] [^dc88c9f5] | Confirm diagnosis and guide management [^79181bf9] |

---

## Clinical scoring systems

Clinical scoring systems such as the **Alvarado** [^fe9e4ac7], **AIR** [^23222e9f], and **Pediatric Appendicitis Score** [^73ba2185] help stratify risk and guide imaging and surgical consultation [^d237c4a8].

---

## Potential complications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis can lead to **significant morbidity**, including:

- **Appendiceal perforation**: Increased risk of abscess, sepsis, and prolonged hospitalization [^0e4b0dc5].

- **Infertility**: Particularly with PID or untreated gynecologic infections [^notfound].

- **Chronic pain**: From adhesions or unresolved inflammation [^notfound].

---

Right lower quadrant pain with fever has a broad differential, but **appendicitis is most common** [^3e3e7bb7]. A structured approach with history, exam, labs, and imaging is essential to identify the cause and prevent complications [^1deae787].

Context

Evaluation of abdominal pain in children can be difficult. Rapid, accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in children reduces the morbidity of this common cause of pediatric abdominal pain. Clinical evaluation may help identify (1) which children with abdominal pain and a likely diagnosis of appendicitis should undergo immediate surgical consultation for potential appendectomy and (2) which children with equivocal presentations of appendicitis should undergo further diagnostic evaluation.

Objective

To systematically assess the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory test results for evaluating children with possible appendicitis.

Data Sources

We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE (January 1966-March 2007) and the Cochrane Database, as well as physical examination textbooks and bibliographies of retrieved articles, yielding 2521 potentially relevant articles.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they (1) provided primary data on children aged 18 years or younger in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis was considered; (2) presented medical history data, physical examination findings, or basic laboratory data; and (3) confirmed or excluded appendicitis by surgical pathologic findings, clinical observation, or follow-up. Of 256 full-text articles examined, 42 met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Twenty-five of 42 studies were assigned a quality level of 3 or better. Data from these studies were independently extracted by 2 reviewers.

Results

In children with abdominal pain, fever was the single most useful sign associated with appendicitis; a fever increases the likelihood of appendicitis (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–4.8) and conversely, its absence decreases the chance of appendicitis (LR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.64). In select groups of children, in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected and evaluation undertaken, rebound tenderness triples the odds of appendicitis (summary LR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.3–3.9), while its absence reduces the likelihood (summary LR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14–0.55). Midabdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant (LR range, 1.9–3.1) increases the risk of appendicitis more than right lower quadrant pain itself (summary LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5). A white blood cell count of less than 10,000/microL decreases the likelihood of appendicitis (summary LR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.17–0.30), as does an absolute neutrophil count of 6750/microL or lower (LR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03–0.16). Symptoms and signs are most useful in combination, particularly for identifying children who do not require further evaluation or intervention.

Conclusions

Although the clinical examination does not establish a diagnosis of appendicitis with certainty, it is useful in determining which children with abdominal pain warrant immediate surgical evaluation for consideration of appendectomy and which children may warrant further diagnostic evaluation. More child-specific, age-stratified data are needed to improve the utility of the clinical examination for diagnosing appendicitis in children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain: 2022 update [^79181bf9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This document focuses on imaging in the adult and pregnant populations with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, including patients with fever and leukocytosis. Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for RLQ abdominal pain in the United States. Other causes of RLQ pain include right colonic diverticulitis, ureteral stone, and infectious enterocolitis. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of the experts. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

What are the optimal methods in diagnosing IAI that balances benefits and risks?

Statement 2

Early clinical evaluation is essential for diagnosing IAIs. It helps to optimize diagnostic testing and can result in earlier implementation of a proper management plan (Recommendation 1C).

Statement 3

A step-up approach for diagnosis should be used and tailored to the clinical setting, resources, patient's age beginning with clinical and laboratory examination and progressing to imaging examinations (Recommendation 1C).

Diagnosis of complicated IAIs is mainly clinical. Early detection and treatment is essential to minimize complications of IAIs.

Patients with IAIs typically present with rapid-onset abdominal pain and signs of local and systemic inflammation (pain, tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and/or tachypnea). Hypotension and hypoperfusion signs such as oliguria, acute alteration of mental status, and lactic acidosis are indicative of ongoing organ failure.

Physical evaluation may limit the differential diagnosis to direct decisions regarding a proper management plan including the need for appropriate diagnostic testing, the need for initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and whether emergent intervention is required.

The value of physical findings in the diagnostic work-up for IAIs has been studied in relation to acute appendicitis where signs and symptoms are helpful in diagnosing or excluding appendicitis.

The presence of a positive psoas sign, fever, or migratory pain to the right lower quadrant suggests an increased likelihood of appendicitis. Conversely, the presence of vomiting before pain makes appendicitis unlikely.

Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) have been used over the last two decades to complete the clinical assessment of patients with IAIs. Although CT has higher sensitivity and specificity, concerns about radiation exposure have recently prompted reappraisal of the roles of sonography including performance by surgeons.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^8d990856]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guidelines — abdominal ultrasound can potentially diagnose acalculous cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, liver or kidney abscesses, perforated bowel, ascites, and/or appendicitis as potential sources of fever, and in surgical patients can identify surgical wound abscesses and determine if they are amenable to drainage. Acalculous cholecystitis, an important but often unrecognized cause of fever in critically ill patients, may be suspected with right upper quadrant pain, although this is commonly absent; in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of a febrile episode. However, a lack of data on false-positive and false-negative results in patients without abdominal signs or symptoms precludes a firm recommendation supporting routine diagnostic abdominal ultrasound.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^a374404b]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Cases were also reviewed for the secondary outcome of preventable delayed diagnosis, defined as a missed opportunity to improve diagnosis (MOID). To grade the likelihood of a MOID, we used the validated Modified Safer Dx checklist. The Safer Dx measures the likelihood of a MOID using 13 items relating to individual elements of an encounter that could lead to MOIDs. The first 12 items include the history, physical examination, data gathering, presence of "red flags", incomplete caregiver information, completeness of evaluation, diagnostic reasoning, test interpretation, follow-up of results, differential formation, disease evolution, and how closely the index presentation reflected typical features of the disease. The final item, the MOID score, graded the overall likelihood of a MOID. All items are measured on a scale of 1 to 7. We further classified a score of 1 to 2 as an unlikely MOID, 3 to 5 as a possible MOID, and 6 to 7 as a likely MOID.

Variables

Potential clinical features associated with delayed diagnosis were chosen a priori based on clinical features related to the ultimate diagnosis of appendicitis from previous literature. These features included age, sex, duration of abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, history of fever, pain with walking, maximal pain in the right lower quadrant, and abdominal guarding. If the symptom was not mentioned in the record, it was assessed as being absent, as is typical for this type of study. We also assessed the presence of a complex chronic condition based on same- and previous-encounter diagnosis codes.

We hypothesized that several care features would be associated (positively or negatively) with delayed diagnosis, including obtaining ultrasonographic imaging, obtaining a CT scan, use of a nonopioid analgesic (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, or naproxen), use of an opioid analgesic (fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, or oxycodone), or use of ondansetron. Finally, because we planned to evaluate disparities between timely and delayed diagnosis, we collected race, ethnicity, and insurance information as recorded in the source database.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^2487d3e2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

History and physical examination in suspected appendicitis — In a meta-analysis of approximately 4,000 patients, right lower quadrant abdominal pain was reported as the most useful clinical finding with positive likelihood ratio 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.31 to 8.46 and negative likelihood ratio 95% CI 0 to 0.28. In a separate meta-analysis, pain migration had positive likelihood ratio 2.06 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.60) and negative likelihood ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.69), while pain progression had positive likelihood ratio 1.39 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.50) and negative likelihood ratio 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Additional Class III data indicate right lower quadrant tenderness had positive likelihood ratios of 2.3 and 1.1 with negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.1; rigidity carried a positive likelihood ratio of 3.8, and anorexia, rectal tenderness, guarding, fever, and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant had positive likelihood ratios below 2.9.

### The SIFIPAC / WSES / SICG / SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^1f797ffa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 1.1. We suggest the use of scoring systems for excluding acute appendicitis in elderly patients with a low-probability score (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).

Statement 1.2. We suggest against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on scoring systems (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).
2 Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients? In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.

According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.

Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.

There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.

According to some authors the typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.

According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs reflect the severity of the abdominal disease, the delay of hospital admission and the high rate of perforations. Indeed, significantly more signs and symptoms of peritonitis (abdominal distension, generalised tenderness and guarding, rebound tenderness, palpable abdominal mass) are recorded among older patients. Probably, comorbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis.

### Enteric fever [^22d36dff]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

How do patients present?

Patients present with a gradual onset of fever which typically rises to a plateau of 39–40°C (102–104°F) towards the end of a week. This slow rise in fever contrasts with the intermittent high fever and rigors seen in malaria.

Abdominal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common as per a systematic review on clinical profile of enteric fever (see supplementary table 1 on bmj.com). Abdominal pain is diffuse and poorly localised but occasionally intense in the right iliac fossa, mimicking appendicitis. Patients may also have headache, cough, and malaise. Children under 5 years old frequently present with only fever, and the diagnosis may be missed unless they have complications.

Symptoms start 7–14 days after exposure (range 3–60 days). Paratyphoid fever has a shorter incubation period (4–5 days), but symptoms are indistinguishable from those of typhoid fever.

### Right-sided diverticulitis mimics appendicitis [^c63ccbe7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Right-sided diverticulitis is a rare source of right lower quadrant pain in Western society; however, it is quite common in Asian societies. Right-sided diverticulitis presents very similarly to appendicitis, with right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities, and is often seen in young patients.

Objectives

In this report, we present a case of right-sided diverticulitis. We review right-sided diverticulitis' diagnosis and management. It is important to diagnose right-sided diverticulitis because it is a good mimic of appendicitis and ideally should be diagnosed before a patient has unnecessary surgery.

Case Report

A 26-year-old Asian woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain and fever. She was initially thought to have appendicitis clinically, but had right-sided diverticulitis diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Her right-sided diverticulitis resolved in 3 days.

Conclusions

Severe right lower quadrant pain in young patients of Asian descent can be right-sided diverticulitis. Right-sided diverticulitis is a benign condition managed medically that mimics appendicitis. CT imaging seems to be the best way to avoid unnecessary surgery.

### Radiological reasoning: recurrent right lower quadrant inflammatory mass [^62c3d359]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We discuss the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented with right lower quadrant pain and fever. CT showed a right lower quadrant inflammatory mass presumed to be an appendiceal abscess. The patient underwent open drainage of the mass but failed to return for an interval appendectomy. She returned 23 months later with a recurrent right lower quadrant inflammatory mass treated initially with percutaneous drainage followed by interval appendectomy. The final pathologic diagnosis was mucinous cystadenoma with perforation.

Conclusion

Primary neoplasms of the appendix are uncommon but should be considered in the correct clinical and imaging scenario.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^ff1540a8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach (regular text) to sequentially presented clinical information (bold). Additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process (italics) is integrated throughout the discussion.

Clinical Information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^ed658d62]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

COMMENTARY

In this case, the clinician employed both pattern recognition (fever, jaundice and abdominal pain triggered the diagnosis of cholangitis) and analytical reasoning to explain the jaundice and LUQ pain. Pattern recognition is a method of reasoning associated with "expertise" whereby the experienced clinician makes the correct diagnosis after asking only a few questions and performing a few physical examination maneuvers. A more advanced model of expert diagnostic reasoning embraces this ability to recognize many patterns, but also emphasizes fluidity between pattern recognition and analytical reasoning. This requires recognizing elements that do not fit the readily available pattern and further exploring those features in a focused, efficient manner. Emerging research on reasoning suggests that an approach using pattern recognition combined with careful consideration of discordant case features may improve diagnostic accuracy.

In this complex case, multiple candidate illnesses remained plausible even after the accumulation of substantial data. Clinicians approach this problem by prioritizing the differential diagnosis in relationship to the refined problem representation. Sorting the possible diagnoses into categories of close, intermediate and limited match, and including diagnoses that pose great risk if missed, can tailor the diagnostic workup for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Table 1).

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^1223c201]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

The Alvarado Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. It was developed by Dr. Alfredo Alvarado in 1986. The score is calculated based on eight clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. These features include symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The Alvarado Score is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, helping clinicians decide whether a patient requires surgical consultation, further diagnostic imaging, or can be safely discharged. It is applicable to all age groups, but it should be used with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for atypical presentations of appendicitis in this population.

The score is not recommended for use in patients with known gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgeries, or other conditions that may mimic the symptoms of appendicitis, as these could potentially skew the results.

The Alvarado score is a diagnostic tool used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis based on a patient's clinical presentation. It considers eight specific signs and symptoms, with each receiving a designated point value. The sum of these values yields a total score that helps in evaluating the likelihood of appendicitis.

What this involves is a checklist of symptoms and signs:

- Right lower quadrant tenderness is worth 2 points.
- An elevated temperature (higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius) adds 1 point.
- Rebound tenderness contributes an additional 1 point.
- Migration of abdominal pain to the right lower quadrant counts for 1 point.
- Anorexia, or loss of appetite, is also scored as 1 point.
- Nausea or vomiting likewise adds 1 point to the total.
- Leukocytosis, defined as a white blood cell count exceeding 10,000, provides 2 points.
- A left shift in leukocyte count, a sign of increased immature white blood cells, contributes 1 point.

To calculate the Alvarado score, determine the presence of each symptom or sign. If present, assign the associated points and sum them to get a score between 0 and 10.

The resulting score is then interpreted as follows:

- A score of 7 or above indicates "Probable appendicitis". This suggests a high likelihood of appendicitis, often prompting further medical evaluation, such as imaging or surgical consultation.
- Scores ranging from 5 to 6 denote "Possible appendicitis", indicating that appendicitis could be present. Medical professionals would typically consider additional clinical judgment and possibly further testing.
- A score below 5 implies "Unlikely appendicitis", suggesting that appendicitis is less probable, although it's important that clinicians still consider the broader clinical context.

This scoring system provides a structured approach, aiding healthcare providers in the initial assessment and decision-making process regarding suspected appendicitis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute left upper quadrant pain [^bd762e3d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints encountered in the emergency department and outpatient setting. Across all sites, the left upper quadrant (LUQ) is the least common location for abdominal pain with reportedly the lowest physical examination interrater agreement. The limited sensitivity of physical examination, combined with an uncommon and nonspecific clinical presentation, make assessment of LUQ pain challenging. Acute LUQ pain may arise directly from the spleen or infections in the LUQ, or represent referred pain from other organs such as stomach, bowels, pancreas, or kidney. This document aims to address acute pain with suspected splenomegaly, with fever, and not otherwise specified. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is usually appropriate for detection of a broad range of pathologies. In patients with suspected splenomegaly, ultrasound abdomen is also usually an appropriate alternate for initial imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Pediatric appendicitis [^31eb09de]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical pathologies in children. It can present with right lower quadrant pain. Scoring systems in combination with selective imaging and surgical examination will diagnose most children with appendicitis. Clinical pathways should be used. Most surgical interventions for appendicitis are now almost exclusively laparoscopic, with trials demonstrating better outcomes for children who undergo index hospitalization appendectomies when perforated. Nonoperative management has a role in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. This article discusses the workup and management, modes of treatment, and continued areas of controversy in pediatric appendicitis.

### Surgical management of acute right lower-quadrant pain in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^7003cd7c]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of right lower-quadrant pain in pregnant patients is a challenge in diagnosis. We discuss the surgical issues among pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain and demonstrate the method to diagnosis.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study with enrollment during 2 years. Pregnant patients presenting with acute right lower-quadrant abdominal pain and requiring surgical consult were included. Demographics, gestational age, symptoms, workup, operative results, and pathology were recorded.

Results

One-hundred patients were enrolled, 38 had nonspecific abdominal pain, 15 of whom were admitted. There were no differences in temperature, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift among the admitted and nonadmitted patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and had a substantially higher gestational age, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift than those who did not. Ultrasound was performed considerably more often on first-trimester patients (81.6%) compared with second- (58.1%) and third-trimester (57.9%) patients, and CT scan was used considerably less in the first trimester compared with the second and third trimesters, and considerably less than ultrasound for the first trimester. Sensitivity of ultrasound for appendicitis was inversely correlated to fetal gestational age, and CT scan retained high sensitivity and specificity throughout pregnancy.

Conclusions

This is one of the first prospective studies assessing diagnoses and workup of pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain. We recommend abdominal ultrasound be the first imaging modality for patients for whom surgical consultation is necessary, thereby determining if the pathology is obstetric. If inconclusive, a CT scan is necessary to guide treatment.

THE EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN: HISTORY AND PHYSICAL AND INITIAL LABORATORIES

Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Fig. 1). Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis. The psoas sign is an irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, a classic finding of acute appendicitis, which can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient laying on their left side. The Rovsing's sign can also be seen in acute appendicitis and is observed when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Figure 1
Acute appendicitis management.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that white blood count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis. A urine analysis would assist in ruling out other diagnoses, such as urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or renal stones. A pregnancy test is mandatory for women of childbearing age.

General medical — abdominal pain assessment for suspected appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and pyelonephritis lists condition-specific findings. Appendicitis findings include focal right lower quadrant tenderness possibly with rebound and guarding, right lower quadrant tenderness noted during palpation of the left lower quadrant (positive Rovsing's sign), peri-umbilical or diffuse abdominal tenderness with palpation of the abdomen/pelvis, fever, nausea/vomiting, and lack of appetite. Acute cholecystitis findings include right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness, fever, nausea and vomiting, and history of gallstones. Pyelonephritis findings include fever, nausea/vomiting, urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, back/flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion.

### Pain as the only consistent sign of acute appendicitis: lack of inflammatory signs does not exclude the diagnosis [^e591c49c]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in adults remains tricky, but radiological examinations are very helpful to determine the diagnosis even when the adult patient presents atypically. This study was designed to quantify the proportion of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis that had isolated right lower quadrant pain without biological inflammatory signs and then to determine which imaging examination led to the determination of the diagnosis.

Methods

In this monocentric study based on retrospectively collected data, we analyzed a series of 326 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis and isolated those who were afebrile and had isolated right lower quadrant pain and normal white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels. We determined whether the systematic ultrasonography examination was informative enough or a complementary intravenous contrast media computed tomography scan was necessary to determine the diagnosis, and whether the final pathological diagnosis fit the preoperative one.

Results

A total of 15.6% of the patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis had isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant, i.e., they were afebrile and their white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels were normal. In 96.1% of the cases, the ultrasonography examination, sometimes complemented by an intravenous contrasted computed tomography scan if the ultrasonography result was equivocal, fit the histopathological diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis cannot be excluded when an adult patient presents with isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant even without fever and biological inflammatory signs. In our study, ultrasonography and computed tomography were very helpful when making the final diagnosis.

### Abdominal pain in a postpartum patient [^1abfddc9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is a very common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department (ED). Making the correct diagnosis may be very complicated and difficult. It is even more difficult and complicated in the postpartum period, because other less common but important diagnoses must be considered. One of these potentially life-threatening diagnoses for which patients should be evaluated is uterine rupture.

Objectives

To discuss uncommon, but important, causes of abdominal pain that may occur in the postpartum period. To learn the clinical presentation, risk factors, evaluation, and management of uterine rupture in the postpartum patient.

Case Report

We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the ED with 2 days of abdominal pain and fever. The patient had had a caesarian section (C-section) 2 weeks before this admission. This was her fourth C-section. On examination, she had right lower quadrant tenderness. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained and it revealed uterine perforation with an adjacent abscess. The patient received intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A laparotomy was performed that confirmed the diagnosis of uterine perforation. The patient subsequently did very well.

Conclusions

Uterine perforation should be considered in any postpartum patient that presents with acute abdominal pain, especially if there are risk factors, such as previous C-sections. Appropriate evaluation, consultations, and management should be done expeditiously to avoid increased morbidity and mortality.

### Urologic manifestations of hematologic disease sickle cell, leukemia, and thromboembolic disease [^3677bc8d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Advances in medicine are allowing patients with hematologic disease to live longer and healthier lives than ever before. As these patients age, however, manifestations of their disease processes may develop as complications in other organ systems. We discussed the major genitourinary complications of sickle cell anemia, leukemia, and thromboembolic disease. These range from the benign inability to concentrate urine that is seen in sickle cell disease to renal infarction that results from nephrotic syndrome. Our ability to treat and prevent these complications will improve as our understanding of these disease processes and their pathophysiology grows. Additionally, it is important for urologists to understand the underlying pathophysiology of hematologic disease to best serve the patients. For example, it may be the urologist who makes the diagnosis of ovarian vein thrombosis in a pregnant woman with right lower quadrant pain and fever. This diagnosis, with the proper treatment of antibiotics and anticoagulation, could prevent the potential development of septic thrombophlebitis. Urologists will increasingly be called upon to deal with the manifestations of these complex diseases as these patients are living longer. It is our duty to educate ourselves about these disease processes so that we can make the best clinical decisions for our patients.

### "Cecal gangrene": a rare cause of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis [^9d0fc55c]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report on a 58-year-old man with known diabetes, congestive heart failure, and need for chronic hemodialysis presenting with right lower abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Although initial clinical findings were highly suggestive of acute appendicitis, CT revealed marked circumferential wall thickening of the cecum, which was interpreted as cecal infarction by the radiologist. Intraoperatively, cecal necrosis was confirmed, but the ileocecal valve and, especially, the appendix showed no ischemia. No vascular occlusions were found. Histopathologic analysis of the resected cecum demonstrated isolated transmural cecal necrosis with marked infiltration of the cecal wall by numerous bacteria and neutrophils. We present the CT features and histopathologic findings of isolated cecal gangrene, review the pathogenesis of occlusive and nonocclusive cecal ischemia or infarction, and discuss the role of bacterial superinfection as a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of isolated cecal necrosis which should be included in the differential diagnosis of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria [^63303c0a]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

### Pediatric appendicitis: association of chief complaint with missed appendicitis [^4bcbd363]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the association between the emergency department (ED) triage chief complaint and rate of missed appendicitis in children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who presented to a pediatric ED and were diagnosed with appendicitis over 5 years (July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014). We reviewed the medical record for any additional ED visits in the 7 days preceding the diagnosis of appendicitis. Triage chief complaints were classified as "suggestive of appendicitis" (abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain, or rule out appendicitis) or "nonspecific" (fever, vomiting, dehydration, etc). We evaluated the association between triage chief complaint and missed diagnosis of appendicitis.

Results

We reviewed 1680 patients with appendicitis. In 67 (4%) cases, patients had at least 1 additional ED visit during the week preceding the diagnosis of appendicitis. When comparing those diagnosed with appendicitis at their initial ED visit to those diagnosed after multiple visits, we found no difference in age (9.9 vs 10.1 years, P = 0.665), sex (55.7% vs 49.3% male, P = 0.291), white blood cell count (14.4 vs 12.3 × 103/L, P = 0.115), or presence of fever (19.9% vs 19.4%, P = 0.920). Of patients with a triage chief complaint that was suggestive of appendicitis, 3.8% were missed on their initial ED visit versus 8.8% of those with a nonspecific triage chief complaint (odds ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–5.6).

Conclusions

A triage chief complaint less suggestive of appendicitis was associated with a higher rate of missed appendicitis in a pediatric ED. Our findings further confirm the potential impact of anchoring bias by a triage chief complaint when attempting to diagnose appendicitis.

### Fever of unknown origin: historical and physical clues to making the diagnosis [^4e99678d]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has fascinated and perplexed clinicians for over a century. No published guidelines exist on the approach to FUO, and studies have demonstrated that a diagnosis is never established in up to 30% of cases. A comprehensive history and physical examination are the keys to establishing a diagnosis in patient with FUO. This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of FUO by delineating the most important elements of a comprehensive history and physical examination.

### Evaluation of appendicitis risk prediction models in adults with suspected appendicitis [^d237c4a8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk prediction models, stratified by sex, may act as adjuncts to high‐quality serial clinical assessment of patients, rationalizing exposure to ionizing radiation to those patients most likely to benefit from CT. AAS and AIRS can be implemented easily, as they require only simple clinical information and routine blood tests, which were already performed for most patients in the present observational cohort.

The authors propose that all adults presenting with acute RIF pain or suspected appendicitis should be scored routinely using the appropriate risk prediction model. To support calculation and application of appropriate cut‐off scores at the patient's bedside, a mobile‐, tablet‐ and desktop‐compatible web application has been developed.

To mitigate against the high risk of normal appendicectomy in low‐risk patients, if a patient is stratified as low risk and suspicion of appendicitis remains, low radiation dose CT should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis before a decision to operate. Ultrasound imaging is preferable in women if the principal differential diagnosis is gynaecological pathology. A very small proportion of low‐risk women and men (Tables S3 and S4, supporting information) presenting with RIF pain have serious conditions such as colitis. Therefore, patients with unclear diagnosis or markers of significant illness (such as fever or significantly raised C‐reactive protein level) should be admitted for observation and potentially for inpatient radiological investigation. Patients who are clinically well with a low index of suspicion of pathology requiring inpatient treatment may choose to be managed at home with the safety net of prompt ambulatory reassessment. Ambulatory management reduces rates of inpatient admission and CT 56, and may in turn reduce unnecessary surgery and NARs. A clinical algorithm proposed by the authors is shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 4
Proposed clinical algorithm for patients presenting with suspected appendicitis or right iliac fossa pain, stratified as low risk

When diagnostic failure does occur in patients stratified to low‐risk groups, the risk of complex appendicitis is very low. Previous studies have suggested that a short delay to appendicectomy does not increase the risk of perforation 57. It is likely that many patients in these studies were administered antibiotics while they awaited surgery, and it is not known whether patients with appendicitis who initially receive a period of ambulatory management are at increased risk of perforation, so this should be investigated in future studies.

### When fever, leukocytosis, and right lower quadrant pain is not appendicitis [^0d4e29ac]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Mesenteric cystic lymphangioma (MCL) is an uncommon, benign, slow-growing abdominal tumor that is derived from the lymphatic vessels (World J Gastroenterol. 2012;18:6328–6332, Radiographics. 1994;14:729–737). It is most often diagnosed in the head and neck of affected children. Rarely, a lymphangioma can develop within the small bowel (Pan Afr Med J. 2012;12:7). The clinical presentation of patients with an abdominal MCL can range from asymptomatic to acute abdominal pain (J Korean Surg Soc. 2012;83:102–106). We report a case of small bowel volvulus caused by an MCL in a 3-year-old child who presented to the pediatric emergency department with right lower quadrant pain. The child was thought to have a perforated appendicitis and was taken to the operating room where an MCL was identified and resected. This case illustrates the need to consider MCL when a patient presents to the emergency department with right lower quadrant pain.

### Abdominal pain caused by a potentially fatal attraction [^d5548b6d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Chronic appendicitis "syndrome" manifested by an appendicolith and thickened appendix presenting as chronic right lower abdominal pain in adults [^36e078e0]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

In this short report, we describe a small series of adult patients with chronic appendicitis presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The clinical presentation was unusual and atypical for classic appendicitis because of the absence of fever, peritoneal tenderness on focused graded compression of the abdomen, and leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) findings included the presence of an appendicolith and appendiceal thickening, without mesenteric infiltration, abscess, or collection. In this series, the appendicolith appeared to represent a marker rather than an actual cause of appendicitis. Focused CT scans with additional lung and bone windows proved optimal in detecting appendicoliths, which were not visible on the scout localizer scans, despite windowing modifications. Our findings suggest that chronic appendicitis may be a phenomenon unique to adults and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic right lower quadrant pain in patients seen in the emergency room setting. Surgery is curative in such patients, although expectant management is an alternative when tolerated by the patient.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight lower quadrant pain-suspected appendicitis [^02a3e5a2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain presenting to emergency departments in the United States, where the incidence continues to increase. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of experts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Severe rift valley fever may present with a characteristic clinical syndrome [^31624152]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is an emerging pathogen that is transmitted in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Egypt, and the Arabian peninsula. Outbreaks of RVF, like other diseases caused by hemorrhagic fever viruses, typically present in locations with very limited health resources, where initial diagnosis must be based only on history and physical examination. Although general signs and symptoms of human RVF have been documented, a specific clinical syndrome has not been described. In 2007, a Kenyan outbreak of RVF provided opportunity to assess acutely ill RVF patients and better delineate its presentation and clinical course. Our data reveal an identifiable clinical syndrome suggestive of severe RVF, characterized by fever, large-joint arthralgia, and gastrointestinal complaints and later followed by jaundice, right upper-quadrant pain, and delirium, often coinciding with hemorrhagic manifestations. Further characterization of a distinct RVF clinical syndrome will aid earlier detection of RVF outbreaks and should allow more rapid implementation of control.

Clinical case presentation

An 81-year-old woman with arterial hypertension and a laparotomic appendectomy when she was 12 years old presents to the emergency department with intermittent acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The last defecation was 2 days ago, and the bowel is closed to gas. Current medications only include valsartan 80 mg daily. The body temperature is 37.5 °C, and all vital parameters are normal. The remainder of the examination demonstrates pain and localized peritonism in the lower right quadrant. Laboratory tests are normal except white blood cells at 14,000 per microliter.

Questions include the following: How should this patient be evaluated and treated? What is the working diagnosis? Options include stump appendicitis, right colon diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, right renal colic, right colon cancer, bowel ischemia, or inflammatory bowel disease (Fig. 1).

### Imaging of right lower quadrant pain in children and adolescents: expert panel narrative review [^1e5f076d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### The appendicitis inflammatory response score: a tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis that outperforms the Alvarado score [^23222e9f]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score (AIR score)" for acute appendicitis.

The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. It is specifically applicable to patients presenting with acute abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis. The AIR score uses clinical and laboratory parameters such as fever, nausea, migration of pain, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high risk of having appendicitis.

The clinical utility of the AIR score is to aid in the decision-making process for the management of suspected appendicitis. It can help to identify patients who may require immediate surgical intervention, those who may benefit from further diagnostic imaging, and those who can be safely discharged with close follow-up.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the AIR score. However, it may be less accurate in certain patient populations such as pregnant women, elderly patients, or those with atypical presentations of appendicitis. It should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and not as a standalone diagnostic tool.

The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score is a clinical tool used to evaluate the likelihood of appendicitis in patients by analyzing symptoms and lab results. Input variables include vomiting, right iliac fossa pain, rebound tenderness, fever, polymorphonuclear leukocytes percentage, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein levels. Each response assigns a numeric score per predefined criteria. These scores are cumulatively calculated to determine the risk of appendicitis, guiding subsequent medical actions.

Here's how the scoring works:

- **Vomiting**:
- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Right Iliac Fossa Pain**:
- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Rebound Tenderness**:
- **None**: 0
- **Light**: 1
- **Medium**: 2
- **Strong**: 3

- **Fever (≥ 38.5ºC; 101.3ºF)**:
- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes**:
- **Less than 70%**: 0
- **70% to 84%**: 1
- **85% or more**: 2

- **White Blood Cell Count (×10⁹/L)**:
- **Less than 10**: 0
- 10.0 to 14.9: 1
- **15 or more**: 2

- **C-Reactive Protein Level (mg/L)**:
- **Less than 10**: 0
- **10 to 49**: 1
- **50 or more**: 2

The aggregate of these scores can range from 0 to 12. Interpretation of the total score is essential for clinical decision-making:

- A score of 0 to 4 suggests a low risk of appendicitis. Patients in this category might be suited for outpatient follow-up if they are stable.
- A score ranging from 5 to 8 indicates an indeterminate risk. Such cases often require active in-hospital observation, which could involve rescoring, imaging, or even diagnostic laparoscopy based on clinic protocols.
- A score between 9 and 12 signals a high risk of appendicitis, where surgical exploration becomes a considerable option.

Summarizing, the AIR score aids clinicians by utilizing patient data to produce a coherent, actionable risk assessment for appendicitis, thereby informing optimal pathway selection based on the severity of risk.

Diagnostics — targeted testing under specified circumstances: Stool testing should be performed under clearly identified circumstances (Table 2) for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, C. difficile, and STEC in symptomatic hosts (strong, low). Specifically, test for Yersinia enterocolitica in people with persistent abdominal pain (especially school-aged children with right lower quadrant pain mimicking appendicitis who may have mesenteric adenitis), and in people with fever at epidemiologic risk for yersiniosis including infants with direct or indirect exposures to raw or undercooked pork products. In addition, test stool specimens for Vibrio species in people with large volume rice water stools or either exposure to salty or brackish waters, consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, or travel to cholera-endemic regions within 3 days prior to onset of diarrhea.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old female presented to urgent care with sharp, acute-on-chronic right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, which began the morning of presentation and persisted throughout the afternoon. Her mother described her as having difficulty ambulating due to the pain. They were unable to indicate whether the pain had migrated from the periumbilical region. She had abdominal pain that had been ongoing for the past 3 weeks with a waxing and waning presentation and had taken polyethylene glycol in the past for constipation. She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melenic stools. She denied cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She did not have any unexplained pruritus. She also had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.

She had no other chronic conditions for which she took any medication and had no history of abdominal or inguinal hernias or previous surgeries. Her family history was notable for multiple close family members with a history of appendectomy, including her mother.

She and her mother recently arrived in the United States from rural Peru 3 months prior. Her workup upon arrival was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, syphilis, and active tuberculosis. She had a recent normal lead level. Her mother expressed concern for general parasitosis in their home community in Peru; however, the patient had never had specific symptoms and had not had any testing done.

In clinic, her vital signs were notable for tachycardia and tachypnea. She was afebrile. Her weight was in the 73rd percentile. Her general exam was notable for an uncomfortable appearance, not moving on the exam table. Her abdominal exam demonstrated active bowel sounds. She voluntarily tensed her abdominal muscles throughout the exam. She exhibited acute tenderness to palpation with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point) with generalized tenderness in all other quadrants, including the suprapubic region. Pain could be reliably elicited in her right lower quadrant with palpation of her left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign). Supine internal and external flexed hip rotation (obturator sign) and straight leg left against resistance (psoas sign) elicited intense pain in her right lower quadrant. She was unable to participate in a jump test to further assess for peritonitis.

### Prospective observational study on acute appendicitis worldwide (POSAW) [^85e448ba]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

AA is one of the most commonly occurring clinical challenges for emergency surgeons, because of its diagnostic work-up. The clinical presentation of AA may vary widely from mild symptoms, like moderate abdominal pain or fever, to most severe scenarios, such as diffuse peritonitis and sepsis. The most frequent clinical symptom is right lower quadrant abdominal pain. If fever with chills is present, systemic involvement should be suspected. However, these symptoms are not specific for AA, since they can be present in other septic conditions, like infectious gastrointestinal disorders or genitourinary tract disorders in young female patients. The median age of 29 years demonstrates the prevalence of this disease in young population. Our data showed that right lower quadrant pain and tenderness were the most frequently reported symptoms (91.2 and 69.6%), followed by vomiting, fever, and diffuse tenderness (42, 24.7, and 11.7%, respectively). Laboratory findings showed a high prevalence of white blood count (WBC) > 10,000 cells/ml (80.2%) and C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L in 46.1% of cases. As reported in various studies, WBC and CRP are the most significant laboratory markers to be considered in case of AA. A WBC cut-off > 10,000/ml has a range of sensitivity between 65 and 85% and specificity between 32 and 82%, and CRP values > 10 mg/L have a range of sensitivity between 65 and 85% and specificity between 59 and 73%.

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^a338d4c8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### A rare cause of abdominal pain with fever [^5f396e60]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-month history of upper right quadrant pain, worsened in the last 3days and accompanied by fever and chills. On physical examination, he had scleral icterus and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings showed hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes and C reactive protein. The patient was admitted, suspecting of an acute cholangitis and started on antibiotics. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of a juxtapapillary diverticulum in the second portion of the duodenum, which was confirmed by a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, along with upstream biliary tract ectasia. The imaging findings allowed us to diagnose a Lemmel's syndrome. Due to potential surgical risk, we decided for a conservative approach. The patient had a favourable course and was discharged home.

### Appendicitis in the infant population: a case report and review of a four-month old with appendicitis [^6009952b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is uncommon in children < 6 months old, with few observational studies reporting cases of children younger than 5 years old with the diagnosis. The classic periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, followed by the onset of fever and vomiting, is present in approximately 40% of pediatric patients under 12 years of age with appendicitis.

Case Report

A 4-month-old girl presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset of grunting, pallor, fussiness, emesis, and diarrhea. The patient was initially afebrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic with a soft, nondistended, nontender abdomen and active bowel sounds. The patient became febrile, with a maximum temperature of 39.3°C (102.7°F), and remained tachycardic despite receiving fluids and antipyretics. Laboratory studies were notable for mild dehydration and sterile pyuria. Chest x-ray study was negative for infectious etiologies. Initial abdominal ultrasound found no clear etiology of the patient's symptoms. The patient was admitted to inpatient pediatrics for dehydration, fever, and presumed pyelonephritis. Twenty-four hours later the patient's abdomen became distended and diffusely tender to palpation, with obstipation and increasing episodes of emesis. Abdominal x-ray study demonstrated mild gaseous distension of multiple bowel loops with repeat abdominal ultrasound notable for a focal 8-mm, noncompressible hyperemic structure in the right lower quadrant. The patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Appendicitis is a potentially life-threatening condition. In the infant population it frequently presents without the features typically seen in older children.

### Chronic appendicitis diagnosed preoperatively as an ovarian dermoid [^203dd89b]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent right lower quadrant pain in young women can be a diagnostic dilemma. Chronic appendicitis is often mistakenly excluded from the differential diagnosis. In the present case, pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in a 19-year-old woman with bilateral lower abdominal pain (greater on the right than the left), fever, and elevated white blood cell count. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics until resolution of symptoms. The pain recurred 1 month later, and the patient presented to our emergency department. At that time, she was afebrile and all laboratory results were normal or negative, aside from an elevated white blood cell count. Computed tomography suggested a right ovarian dermoid. At laparoscopy, however, the right tube and ovary were normal, and chronic appendicitis was confirmed. Although computed tomography is often accurate for delineating the cause of pelvic abnormality, it also may be misleading.

### Computed tomography utilization for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children decreases with a diagnostic algorithm [^73ba2185]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) is a clinical calculator used in the pediatric population to assess the likelihood of appendicitis. It is specifically designed for children and adolescents, typically between the ages of 3 and 18 years. The PAS is used to stratify the risk of appendicitis, helping clinicians decide whether further diagnostic testing, observation, or surgical consultation is needed. It includes variables such as anorexia, nausea/vomiting, pain migration, tenderness over the right lower quadrant, rebound pain, elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. The PAS is not applicable to patients outside the pediatric age range or those with pre-existing abdominal conditions that could confound the diagnosis of appendicitis.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) provides a straightforward method to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in children by evaluating specific clinical signs and symptoms. This scoring system is based on user responses to a series of questions related to their symptoms. Each symptom, if present, contributes a specific number of points to the overall score.

The symptoms assessed and their corresponding scores are as follows:

- **Cough, percussion, or hopping tenderness in the right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Tenderness in right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Anorexia**: 1 point
- Fever of 38.0ºC (100.4ºF) or higher: 1 point
- **Nausea or vomiting**: 1 point
- **White blood cell count greater than 10,000/mm³**: 1 point
- **Neutrophilia with an absolute neutrophil count greater than 7,500**: 1 point
- **Migration of pain to the right lower quadrant**: 1 point

To calculate the PAS, each boolean input reflecting the presence of these symptoms is evaluated. The response indicating the presence of a symptom adds its assigned score to the total.

Interpreting the total score offers a clear understanding of the risk level for appendicitis:

- A total score of 3 or less suggests a low risk of appendicitis.
- A score ranging from 4 to 6 indicates an intermediate risk.
- A score of 7 or more signifies a high risk of appendicitis.

This scoring system allows for quick assessment and can aid in clinical decision-making regarding the need for further diagnostic evaluation or intervention.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^8755fe23]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

Appendicitis is one of the most common sources of abdominal pain in the emergency setting and is generally considered a straightforward diagnosis. However, atypical appearances, non-visualization, and inconclusive features can make these cases more complicated. The objectives of this article are to review the differential diagnoses for right lower quadrant pain, discuss the imaging characteristics of simple appendicitis on computed tomography (CT), and provide guidance for equivocal cases, complicated appendicitis, and appendicitis mimics. This review will also discuss the identification and management of neoplasms of the appendix.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: not always appendicitis [^cdbf45c2]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the commonest causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), there are numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis that can simulate the clinical presentation of AA for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluation of patients presenting with acute onset RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, US and MRI, given lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in the pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP which we have classified systematically ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, urinary and reproductive systems to give the reader a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

### Prevalence of inconsistencies in the recorded outcomes of clinical evaluations [^3df68616]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of variations in the recorded outcomes of clinical evaluations by 2 different physicians during a single patient visit and to comment on observations of physician practices regarding history taking and physical examination.

Methods

Structured interviews were conducted with both junior and supervising physicians after they had evaluated patients in a pediatric emergency department who presented with complaints of fever (temperature, > 100.4°F) in infants younger than 3 months, fever (temperature, > 102.2°F) in infants aged 3 to 12 months, headache in patients older than 5 years, abdominal pain in patients older than 5 years, and head injury in patients younger than 18 years. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics.

Results

Most of the data reported by both junior and supervising physicians showed response disagreement. The questions on fever (temperature, > 102.2°F) in infants aged 3 to 12 months showed 29% (10/34) disagreement on fever duration and 45% (5/11) on fever height. Questions on abdominal pain in children older than 5 years showed 24% (24/100) disagreement on reporting right lower quadrant pain and 10% (11/106) on right lower quadrant tenderness on examination; however, the discrepancy rates were 56% (56/100) when considering less than complete agreement on all painful sites and 53% (56/106) on all tender sites. Supervising physicians questioned and examined patients presenting with abdominal pain more often than those presenting with other complaints.

Conclusions

There are significant variations in the recorded outcome of clinical evaluations by 2 different physicians during a single patient visit. Supervising physicians are more cautious to question and examine patients presenting with abdominal pain compared with other chief complaints.

### Diagnosis of appendicitis in emergency departments… [^e6f17c0e]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. A previously healthy 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant of 18 hours' duration. She has no fever, and her examination is remarkable only for right lower quadrant tenderness without peritoneal signs. The authors first discuss the aspects of the history and physical examination that may be used to develop a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis. The sensitivity and specificity of various signs and symptoms relating to appendicitis are reviewed in the accompanying table. The three factors with the highest predictive value for acute appendicitis are right lower quadrant pain, abdominal rigidity, and migration of pain from the periumbilical region to the right lower quadrant.

A shorter duration of pain also supports the diagnosis of appendicitis, whereas other causes of abdominal pain may have a shorter course of pain. Laboratory studies in patients with abdominal pain share the limited sensitivity and specificity of the history and physical examination. Pregnancy must always be ruled out in women of reproductive age. An elevated leukocyte count is usually noted in cases of acute appendicitis, but it has poor specificity. While urinalysis will often show some pyuria, hematuria, or bacteriuria in patients with appendicitis, more than 20 leukocytes per high-power field or more than 30 red cells per high-power field is suggestive of a urinary tract disorder. Imaging is also commonly involved in cases with an unclear diagnosis. In the authors' opinion, plain abdominal radiographs and contrast barium-enema examinations have little clinical utility.

Abdominal ultrasonography may be useful in ruling out appendicitis; however, because the appendix is usually not well visualized, the physician is left uncertain of the diagnosis. Computed tomographic scanning has improved with the advent of rapid-scanning spiral CT machines, which decrease image artifact caused by movement. A retrospective review of 650 patients with suspected appendicitis showed a sensitivity of 97 percent and a specificity of 98 percent with spiral CT. In patients in which the clinical suspicion was uncertain, sensitivity was 92 percent and specificity was 85 percent. Two prospective studies comparing ultrasonography with spiral CT have favored the latter modality. Cost-effectiveness studies have also supported the utility of CT scans, especially in female patients, because of the decreased accuracy of the clinical examination in correctly predicting appendicitis.

### Appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma [^b3ff9d40]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is a frequently encountered surgical problem in the Emergency Department (ED). Appendicitis typically results from obstruction of the appendiceal lumen, although trauma has been reported as an infrequent cause of acute appendicitis. Intestinal injury and hollow viscus injury following blunt abdominal trauma are well reported in the literature but traumatic appendicitis is much less common. The pathophysiology is uncertain but likely results from several mechanisms, either in isolation or combination. These include direct compression/crush injury, shearing injury, or from indirect obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by an ileocecal hematoma or traumatic impaction of stool into the appendix. Presentation typically mirrors that of non-traumatic appendicitis with nausea, anorexia, fever, and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness and/or peritonitis. Evaluation for traumatic appendicitis requires a careful history and physical exam. Imaging with ultrasound or computed tomography is recommended if the history and physical do not reveal an acute surgical indication. Treatment includes intravenous antibiotics and surgical consultation for appendectomy. This case highlights a patient who developed acute appendicitis following blunt trauma to the abdomen sustained during a motor vehicle accident. Appendicitis must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in any patient who presents to the ED with abdominal pain, including those whose pain begins after sustaining blunt trauma to the abdomen. Because appendicitis following trauma is uncommon, timely diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.

### The great gut mimicker: a case report of MIS-C and appendicitis clinical presentation overlap in a teenage patient [^2cd98dc8]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with MIS-C can present with findings characteristic of acute appendicitis, including RLQ pain, fever, nausea, emesis, anorexia, and radiographic evidence of appendicitis. This presents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Although difficult to exclude appendicitis in the case of CT evidence, certain laboratory criteria, namely relative leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may be helpful in differentiating these patients. However, the use of immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of MIS-C may complicate the care of a patient with potential appendicitis, and appendectomy may still be preferable as the lowest risk option despite a low clinical suspicion for appendicitis.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease and acute appendicitis [^b0a3d35f]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old Japanese man developed fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, right lower quadrant abdominal pain and rebound tenderness. With the clinical suspicion of appendicitis, an abdominal CT scan was performed, which revealed mesenteric lymphadenitis. The patient was hospitalised and treated with antibiotics, but was ultimately found to have Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). This diagnosis was facilitated by the use of positron emission tomography scan that identified an accessible inguinal lymph node for biopsy and histopathological evaluation. Invasive abdominal surgery was thereby averted and the patient made a complete recovery on subsequent follow-up. Review of the published literature reveals that pseudoappendicitis due to KFD is a rare occurrence that has generally required abdominal surgery to establish the diagnosis, thus supporting the potential value of the approach taken here.

### Right lower-quadrant pain-more than one diagnosis [^7fc0e273]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

When a patient presents with right-lower-quadrant pain in the emergency room, the diagnosis of appendicitis must always be considered, but the differential diagnosis for this symptom includes many other etiologies. We describe a case of an 8-year-old girl with von Willebrand disease who presented with right-lower-quadrant pain and was found to have an appendiceal wall hematoma. During her evaluation, an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, and the results were initially interpreted as an intussusception. Although ultrasound is a highly reliable way to diagnose appendicitis and intussusception, the case illustrates that the thickened abdominal wall that occurs in a mural hematoma can appear like the "target sign" that is usually associated with intussusception, and in certain clinical scenarios, alternative forms of imaging may be of value.

### Diagnostic characteristics of S100A8 / A9 in a multicenter study of patients with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain [^cf95a085]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Over the past decade, clinicians have become increasingly reliant on computed tomography (CT) for the evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis. To limit the radiation risks and costs of CT, investigators have searched for biomarkers to aid in diagnostic decision-making. We evaluated one such biomarker, calprotectin or S100A8/A9, and determined the diagnostic performance characteristics of a developmental biomarker assay in a multicenter investigation of patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain.

Methods

This was a prospective, double-blinded, single-arm, multicenter investigation performed in 13 emergency departments (EDs) from August 2009 to April 2010 of patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Plasma samples were tested using the investigational S100A8/A9 assay. The primary outcome of acute appendicitis was determined by histopathology for patients undergoing appendectomy or 2-week telephone follow-up for patients discharged without surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of the biomarker assay were calculated using the prespecified cutoff value of 14 units. A post hoc stability study was performed to investigate the potential effect of time and courier transport on the measured value of the S100A8/A9 assay test results.

Results

Of 1,052 enrolled patients, 848 met criteria for analysis. The median age was 24.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 16–38 years), 57% were female, and 50% were white. There was a 27.5% prevalence of acute appendicitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the investigational S100A8/A9 assay in diagnosing acute appendicitis were estimated to be 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 93% to 98%) and 16% (95% CI = 13% to 19%), respectively. The LR- ratio was 0.24 (95% CI = 0.12 to 0.47), and the LR+ was 1.14 (95% CI = 1.10 to 1.19). The post hoc stability study demonstrated that in the samples that were shipped, the estimated time coefficient was 7.6 × 10(-3) ± 2.0 × 10(-3) log units/hour, representing an average increase of 43% in the measured value over 48 hours; in the samples that were not shipped, the estimated time coefficient was 2.5 × 10(-3) ± 0.4 × 10(-3) log units/hour, representing a 13% increase on average in the measured value over 48 hours, which was the maximum delay allowed by the study protocol. Thus, adjusting the cutoff value of 14 units by the magnitude of systematic inflation observed in the stability study at 48 hours would result in a new cutoff value of 20 units and a "corrected" sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 28%, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, we found the investigational enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for S100A8/A9 to perform with high sensitivity but very limited specificity. We found that shipping effect and delay in analysis resulted in a subsequent rise in test values, thereby increasing the sensitivity and decreasing the specificity of the test. Further investigation with hospital-based laboratory analyzers is the next critical step for determining the ultimate clinical utility of the ELISA test for S100A8/A9 in ED patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain.

### Pitfalls in appendicitis [^fb49f575]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of appendicitis is fraught with potential pitfalls, and despite its prevalence, appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. There is no single historical or physical finding or laboratory test that can definitively make the diagnosis. This article discusses the value of presenting signs, symptoms, laboratory testing, and the rational use of various imaging modalities, such as CT scanning and ultrasound. Challenges of special populations, such as children, the elderly, and pregnant patients, are also discussed. Although appendicitis continues to be a source of medical legal risk and misdiagnosis, a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of all tests in suspected appendicitis can improve the emergency physician's diagnostic accuracy in this high-risk disease.

Clinical diagnosis of appendicitis

Clinical signs and symptoms

According to, AA might be called simple AA in the absence of gangrene, perforation or abscess around the inflamed appendix, or complicated AA when perforation, gangrene or periappendicular abscess are present. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting complaint, followed by vomiting with migration of the pain to the right iliac fossa, described first by J Murphy in 1904. However, this classical presentation is quite often absent, either due to variation in the anatomic position of the appendix or the age of the patient, with atypical presentations seen often in infants and elderly patients.

Laboratory markers

A good review of laboratory markers for the diagnosis of AA is provided by DJ Shogilev et al. The degree of white blood cell elevation, the value of C-reactive protein, the proportion of polymorphonuclear cells, a history of fever and other factors have been studied extensively for the diagnosis of AA, but lack sufficient specificity either alone or in combination. On the contrary, the absence of all of these laboratory parameters can potentially rule out the diagnosis of AA.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^e47ae392]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Reasoning

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case. It triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses and directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features and diagnostic testing. In complex cases it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

She had no significant past medical history. Her only medication was acetaminophen. Her family history was unremarkable. She was unemployed and denied current or prior alcohol, tobacco or drug use. She was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States at age 23. She travels to Mexico regularly and had returned 3 weeks ago after a 2-month visit. Review of systems was notable for night sweats and a 20-pound intentional weight loss over the past several months.

Although the 20-pound weight loss is described as being intentional, the rarity of that achievement and associated night sweats suggest a systemic illness such as infection, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Her travel to Mexico places her at risk for tuberculosis (gastrointestinal and CNS manifestations) and amebiasis (colitis or liver abscess). Autoimmune syndromes with gastrointestinal manifestations include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polyarteritis nodosa and inflammatory bowel disease.

### Do C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count, and pain location guide the selection of patients for computed tomography imaging in non-traumatic acute abdomen? [^af627658]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The value of abdominal computed tomography in non-traumatic abdominal pain has been well established. On the other hand, to manage computed tomography, appropriateness has become more of an issue as a result of the concomitant increase in patient radiation exposure with increased computed tomography use. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and pain location may guide the selection of patients for computed tomography in non-traumatic acute abdomen. Patients presenting with acute abdomen to the emergency department over a 12-month period and who subsequently underwent computed tomography were retrospectively reviewed. Those with serum C-reactive protein and white blood cell count measured on admission or within 24 h of the computed tomography were selected. Computed tomography examinations were retrospectively reviewed, and final diagnoses were designated either positive or negative for pathology relating to presentation with acute abdomen. White blood cell counts, C-reactive protein levels, and pain locations were analyzed to determine whether they increased or decreased the likelihood of producing a diagnostic computed tomography. The likelihood ratio for computed tomography positivity with a C-reactive protein level above 5 mg/L was 1.71, while this increased to 7.71 in patients with combined elevated C-reactive protein level and white blood cell count and right lower quadrant pain. Combined elevated C-reactive protein level and white blood cell count in patients with right lower quadrant pain may represent a potential factor that could guide the decision to perform computed tomography in non-traumatic acute abdomen.

### Unusual presentation of a familiar pathology: chronic appendicitis [^8112e126]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a man who experienced night sweats, abdominal pain and fever for over 3months, with incomplete response to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Although CT imaging was insufficient to identify the cause for his chronic abdominal pain, the abnormality of a 'misty mesentery' was crucial in guiding further investigation. The final diagnosis of chronic appendicitis was made through laparoscopic and pathological examination. This case highlights the utility of a collaborative diagnostic effort between disciplines. Chronic appendicitis can cause lingering abdominal pain. Early recognition and appropriate referral can save patients months and even years of unnecessary suffering.

### Beyond appendicitis: common and uncommon gastrointestinal causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain at multidetector CT [^c966fa70]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Right lower quadrant abdominal pain is one of the most common causes of a patient visit to the emergency department. Although appendicitis is the most common condition requiring surgery in patients with abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain can be indicative of a vast list of differential diagnoses and is thus a challenge for clinicians. Other causes of right lower quadrant pain beyond appendicitis include inflammatory and infectious conditions involving the ileocecal region; diverticulitis; malignancies; conditions affecting the epiploic appendages, omentum, and mesentery; and miscellaneous conditions. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the modality of choice for evaluation of patients with several acute traumatic and nontraumatic conditions causing right lower quadrant pain. Multidetector CT is an extremely useful noninvasive method for diagnosis and management of not only the most common causes such as appendicitis but also less common conditions.

Model development

Derivation

A total of 16 out of 20 predictive variables were suggested from a univariate analysis that they might associate with appendicitis, see Table 1. These included eight symptoms (i.e. first location of pain, migration of pain, onset, progression of pain, right lower quadrant pain at presentation, nausea or vomiting, aggravation of pain by cough or movement, and fever), five signs (i.e. bowel sound, body temperature, tenderness at right lower quadrant of abdomen, rebound tenderness, and guarding), and two laboratory tests (i.e. WBC > 10,000 cell/mm 3 and neutrophil > 75%).

Description of patients' characteristics in appendicitis and non-appendicitis groups

These variables were simultaneously included in the logit model, in which only seven variables were remained in the final model. These were three symptoms (i.e. migration of pain, progression of pain, and aggravation of pain by cough or movement), two signs (i.e. body temperature ≥ 37.8 °C and rebound tenderness), two laboratory tests (i.e. WBC > 10,000 cell/mm 3 and neutrophil > 75%), and odd ratios (OR) and 95% CI were reported, see Table 2.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Caecal diverticulitis presenting as acute appendicitis: a case report [^869f5845]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The preoperative diagnosis of caecal diverticulitis is difficult and one report claims it is only made in 9% of the cases, and most of these patients have had previous appendicectomy. Acute appendicitis is by far the initial preoperative diagnosis on account of similar presentation of low grade fever, right iliac fossa pain and tenderness with guarding. However some studies have suggested certain subtle clinical features that may help in differentiating caecal diverticulitis from acute appendicitis including a relatively longer history of right iliac fossa pain with relative lack of systemic toxicity despite prolonged duration of the symptoms especially with a posteriorly located lesion. Nausea and vomiting are less frequent, abdominal pain typically starts and remains in the right iliac fossa rather than beginning in the central abdomen and shifting to the RIF and RIF tenderness is not usually as marked as in acute appendicitis.

As acute appendicitis is mainly a clinical diagnosis, many patients presenting with RIF pain and tenderness with a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis are usually not subjected to preoperative radiological investigations except where the diagnosis is in doubt especially in female patients or where a mass is palpable and a caecal carcinoma is suspected. Our patient did not have a preoperative radiological investigation because of a strong suspicion of an acute appendicitis. However, abdominal ultrasound scan (USS) and computerised tomography (CT) scan have been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy and may play a role in the preoperative diagnosis. In a review of 934 patients with caecal diverticulitis presenting with indeterminate right lower quadrant abdominal pain, Chou et al reported a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 99.5% with abdominal USS with an overall accuracy of 99.5% in the diagnosis of caecal diverticulitis. The preoperative accuracy of distinguishing acute appendicitis from caecal diverticulitis with CT scan has been shown in various studies with a sensitivity and specificity of 98%. The CT scan findings are similar to those of left sided diverticulitis, including caecal wall thickening, focal pericaecal inflammation with stranding of adjacent fascia, associated diverticulitis, abscess formation, extraluminal air signifying perforation and extraluminal mass effect. These features may however be present with caecal pole tumour especially in the presence of tumour perforation or associated peritumoural inflammatory reaction. Caecal diverticulitis may actually be indistinguishable from carcinoma on the CT scan in about 10% of cases.

### Factors associated with potentially missed diagnosis of appendicitis in the emergency department [^84ff1eaf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What factors are associated with a potentially missed diagnosis of appendicitis in the emergency department among adults and children?

Findings

In this cohort study of 123 711 patients diagnosed with appendicitis, insurance claims data indicated that appendicitis was potentially missed in 6.0% of adults and 4.4% of children during the initial emergency department visit. Factors associated with potentially missed appendicitis included female sex, the coexistence of abdominal pain and constipation, and the presence of comorbidities.

Meaning

Population-based estimates of the rates of potentially missed appendicitis reveal opportunities for improvement and identify factors that may alert clinicians and mitigate the risk of missed diagnosis.

Alarm signs include persistent right upper or right lower quadrant pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, persistent vomiting, gastrointestinal blood loss, involuntary weight loss, deceleration of linear growth, delayed puberty, unexplained fever, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or PUD. In the absence of alarm signs or symptoms, recent updated recommendations did not identify compelling evidence to support upper endoscopy as part of the diagnostic work up.

Case presentation

Patient 1

A pregnant adult patient at 35 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for morbid obesity status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypothyroidism presented with nausea and diffuse, progressive abdominal pain that started several hours after arrival, with no fever or vomiting reported. She reported good fetal movement without vaginal bleeding, loss of fluid, or contractions. Vital signs and laboratory analysis were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen was significant for rebound tenderness in left lower quadrant and right lower quadrant. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an inflamed, dilated appendix with periappendiceal stranding and edema without fecalith.

Patient 2

A pregnant adult patient at 33 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for inflammatory bowel syndrome, status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic repair of internal hernia, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus presented with 2 days of nausea, emesis, and right-sided epigastric pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant. The patient denied fever, chills, or cough, and reported regular fetal movement. The patient's presenting vital signs were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed focal tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory analysis showed a leukocytosis of 14.3×10 3 /μL. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated appendiceal wall thickening and periappendiceal stranding without fecalith.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to present the imaging appearance of common mimickers of appendicitis in children with right lower quadrant pain.

Conclusion

The majority of children who undergo imaging for suspected appendicitis will end up having an alternative diagnosis. These mimickers can be gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or pulmonary. Familiarity with these alternative diagnoses can aid in the challenging task of imaging right lower quadrant pain in the pediatric population.

### A curious cause of appendicitis [^ba09d1be]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 10-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with central abdominal pain, loose stool and vomiting. He was diagnosed with gastroenteritis, but was well enough to be discharged. The next day he reattended with ongoing diarrhoea and vomiting, with the pain now localised to the right iliac fossa (RIF). Acute appendicitis was suspected, and he was taken for laparoscopic appendicectomy. At surgery, a gangrenous appendix was found, with pus extending from the pelvis up to the liver. The appendix was excised and thorough peritoneal washout performed. Postoperatively, he received 48hours of intravenous antibiotics and was discharged home. Unfortunately the boy presented again 11days later with right lower quadrant pain and fever. Ultrasound revealed a collection in the RIF, and he returned to theatre for washout. His recovery was slow until the peritoneal pus sent for bacterial culture grew Salmonella enteritidis, identification of which facilitated appropriate antibiotic treatment.

### Acute appendicitis: efficient diagnosis and management [^0e4b0dc5]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain in adults and children, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% in males and 6.7% in females. It is the most common nonobstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. Findings from the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies aid in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Right lower quadrant pain, abdominal rigidity, and periumbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant are the best signs for ruling in acute appendicitis in adults. Absent or decreased bowel sounds, a positive psoas sign, a positive obturator sign, and a positive Rovsing sign are most reliable for ruling in acute appendicitis in children. The Alvarado score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score, and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score incorporate common clinical and laboratory findings to stratify patients as low, moderate, or high risk and can help in making a timely diagnosis. Recommended first-line imaging consists of point-of-care or formal ultrasonography. Appendectomy via open laparotomy or laparoscopy is the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. However, intravenous antibiotics may be considered first-line therapy in selected patients. Pain control with opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen should be a priority and does not result in delayed or unnecessary intervention. Perforation can lead to sepsis and occurs in 17% to 32% of patients with acute appendicitis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before surgical intervention raises the risk. In moderate- to high-risk patients, surgical consultation should be accomplished quickly to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from perforation.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific findings: For acute coronary syndrome (ACS), findings include diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and MR murmur; examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. For pulmonary embolism (PE), tachycardia and dyspnea with pain with inspiration may be present. Pericarditis presents with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may show fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumonia may include fever, localized or pleuritic chest pain, friction rub, regional dullness to percussion, and egophony. Costochondritis/Tietze syndrome shows tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster produces pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch with a characteristic unilateral, dermatomal rash. Esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gall bladder disease are suggested by epigastric tenderness, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a Murphy sign.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^2d79cf08]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Making the clinical diagnosis

When encountering a new patient in the emergency department (ED), the surgeon first makes the clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis based on history, physical exam and routine laboratory testing. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting symptom. It is typically located in the left lower quadrant; however, a redundant sigmoid colon can reach the right lower quadrant and mimic appendicitis. Localized peritoneal irritation can result in guarding and rebound tenderness. Free perforation often presents as frank peritonitis. Fever and leukocytosis are usually present and assist in making the clinical diagnosis. Nausea and vomiting are the most notable symptoms when a stricture results in an obstruction. The initial assessment should include a) an assessment of the severity of the signs of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and white blood cell count, b) peritonitis on physical exam and c) signs of organ dysfunctions. Patients with clinical diagnosis consistent with diverticulitis who have concerning signs of sepsis should be considered to be at high risk for complicated diverticulitis. They should have IV access obtained, be given a bolus of IV isotonic crystalloids (20 ml/kg), be administered IV antibiotics, and be admitted to the hospital.

These patients should undergo CT scanning with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis with the exception of pregnant women where ultrasound is recommended. CT scanning has a high sensitivity and specificity in confirming the diagnosis and identifying patients who are candidates for therapeutic PCD. CT scanning also excludes other causes of left lower quadrant abdominal pain (e.g. leaking abdominal aortic aneurism or an ovarian abscess), but is not reliable in differentiating acute diverticulitis from colon malignancy.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^5fe1df3e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm3 (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm 3, platelet count 88,000/mm 3, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

### The appendicitis inflammatory response score: a tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis that outperforms the Alvarado score [^424d8a6a]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is a subjective synthesis of information from variables with ill-defined diagnostic value. This process could be improved by using a scoring system that includes objective variables that reflect the inflammatory response. This study describes the construction and evaluation of a new clinical appendicitis score.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively from 545 patients admitted for suspected appendicitis at four hospitals. The score was constructed from eight variables with independent diagnostic value (right-lower-quadrant pain, rebound tenderness, muscular defense, WBC count, proportion neutrophils, CRP, body temperature, and vomiting) in 316 randomly selected patients and evaluated on the remaining 229 patients. Ordered logistic regression was used to obtain a high discriminating power with focus on advanced appendicitis. Diagnostic performance was compared with the Alvarado score.

Results

The ROC area of the new score was 0.97 for advanced appendicitis and 0.93 for all appendicitis compared with 0.92 (p = 0.0027) and 0.88 (p = 0.0007), respectively, for the Alvarado score. Sixty-three percent of the patients were classified into the low- or high-probability group with an accuracy of 97.2%, leaving 37% for further investigation. Seventy-three percent of the nonappendicitis patients, 67% of the advanced appendicitis, and 37% of all appendicitis patients were correctly classified into the low- and high-probability zone, respectively.

Conclusion

This simple clinical score can correctly classify the majority of patients with suspected appendicitis, leaving the need for diagnostic imaging or diagnostic laparoscopy to the smaller group of patients with an indeterminate scoring result.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^0035915f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

ADPKD — algorithm for evaluation and management of potential tolvaptan‑induced liver injury specifies that triggers include "Serum AST, ALT, bilirubin increased to ≥ 3 × ULN", or "Serum AST, ALT, bilirubin Increased to > 2 × ULN or > 2 × baseline (even if < 2 × ULN)", or "Multiple signs and symptoms highly suggestive of liver injury (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, jaundice, pruritus, abdominal distention/ascites)". The immediate action is to "Hold tolvaptan", "Repeat LFTs within 48–72 hours", and "Assess for other etiologies (other diseases, drugs, exposures)". If repeat tests are "Increased to ≥ 3 × ULN", then "Permanently discontinue tolvaptan unless other explanation for liver injury and injury resolved"; if "Stable or improved", then "Reinitiate tolvaptan with frequent monitoring". The pathway concludes that "All patients with evidence of possible drug‑induced liver injury should be followed until all abnormalities return to normal or to the baseline state".

### The value of pancreatic stone protein in predicting acute appendicitis in patients presenting at the emergency department with abdominal pain [^df58c4b5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is defined as an inflammation of the vermiform appendix and is a common condition and an urgent surgical illness. It is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain and remains a diagnostic challenge. It has variable manifestations and generous overlap with other clinical syndromes. In fact morbidity increases significantly with the diagnostic delay and left untreated, appendicitis has the potential for severe complications, including perforation or sepsis, and may even cause death. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advancement in medicine, appendicitis still remains a clinical emergency.

No single sign, symptom, or diagnostic test exists which accurately confirms an appendiceal inflammation. The classic history of anorexia and periumbilical pain followed by nausea, right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, and vomiting occurs in only 50% of cases.

Accepted etiologic factors of appendicitis are appendiceal lumen obstruction and infection. The main therapeutic option still remains the surgical removal of the vermiform appendix even though a few studies promote an antibiotic treatment. After admission to the emergency department (ED), patients presenting with abdominal pain caused by a variety of different etiologic factors have to be worked up with the goal of approaching 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis in a time-, cost-, and consultation-efficient manner.

It is reported that appendectomy carries a complication rate of up to 15%, as well as increased associated costs and the discomfort of hospitalisation and surgery. Delay in diagnosis and treatment account for much of the associated mortality and morbidity. Therefore, the goal of the surgeon is to diagnose appendicitis as early as possible.

The overall mortality rate of 0.2–0.8% is attributable to complications of the disease rather than to surgical interventions. The mortality rate in children ranges from 0.1% to 1%; in patients older than 70 years, the rate rises above 20%, primarily because of diagnostic and therapeutic delay.

Appendiceal perforation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with non-perforating appendicitis. The mortality risk of acute but not gangrenous appendicitis is less than 0.1%, but the risk rises to 0.6% in gangrenous appendicitis. The rate of perforation varies from 16% to 40%, with a higher frequency occurring in patients below 50 years (40–57%) and in patients older than 50 years (55–70%), in whom misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. Complications occur in 1–5% of patients with appendicitis. Postoperative wound infections account for almost one third of the associated morbidity.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^56247802]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this case-control study, children with delayed diagnosis at their index ED encounter were more likely to have a longer duration of abdominal pain, no pain with walking, abdominal pain outside the right lower quadrant, no abdominal guarding, and a complex chronic condition compared with children with a timely diagnosis of appendicitis. Based on PAS or pARC scores, children with delayed diagnoses were less clinically discernible. They were more likely to receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiemetic therapy and less likely to receive opioids or undergo imaging. In 76.8% of patients with a delayed diagnosis, there were possibly or probably opportunities to improve diagnosis. Children with delayed diagnosis had worse outcomes. When the diagnosis was made, hospitalizations were longer, appendectomy was less likely, and appendiceal perforation and multiple abdominal surgical procedures were more likely. Taken together, our findings suggest that delayed diagnosis was more likely in patients with less classic presentations, that such patients were less likely to undergo imaging or receive appendicitis-directed treatments, and that a substantial fraction of delayed diagnoses were preventable despite being less clinically apparent.

Among children with delayed diagnosis of appendicitis, progression of disease occurred between the index and delay ED encounters. Nearly every classic symptom or sign of appendicitis was more likely to be present during the later visit. The PAS and pARC scores, which measure the likelihood of appendicitis, were higher during the delay encounter than during the index encounter. Abdominal guarding and migration of pain to the right lower quadrant were especially likely to develop after the index encounter: each feature was more than 10 times as likely to be present later. The presence of more classic symptoms during a second ED visit makes the diagnosis more discernible to clinicians. Conversely, the absence of classic appendicitis symptoms puts a patient at risk of a delayed diagnosis.

Nevertheless, in this study, most delayed diagnoses were probably or possibly MOIDs, indicating that there were potential opportunities to prevent delay. The 3 elements of the diagnostic process most associated with a MOID were failures in diagnostic reasoning that indicated that the patient's history should have prompted a deeper evaluation. Most children with delayed diagnosis had neither a WBC count nor an imaging study performed at the index encounter. Children with a characteristic history or physical examination should undergo these tests in an effort to prevent delayed diagnosis. In this study, only 22.0% to 61.3% of children received indicated imaging based on a pARC score above the threshold at which imaging is cost-effective. This finding suggests an opportunity to improve detection.

In the patient with abdominal sepsis early detection and treatment is essential to minimize complications.

Complicated intra-abdominal infections diagnosis is mainly a clinical diagnosis.

Abdominal pain, which may be acute or insidious. Initially, the pain may be dull and poorly localized (visceral peritoneum) and often progresses to steady, severe, and more localized pain (parietal peritoneum).

Systemic manifestations are SIRS manifestations: Core body temperature > 38°C or < 36°C, heart rate > 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute (not ventilated) or PaCO2 < 32 mm Hg (ventilated), WBC > 12,000, < 4,000 or > 10% immature forms (bands).

Hypotension and hypoperfusion signs such as lactic acidosis, oliguria, and acute alteration of mental status are indicative of evolution to severe sepsis.

Abdominal rigidity suggests peritonitis and the need for urgent laparotomy.

The diagnostic approach to confirm abdominal infection source in septic patients depends on the hemo-dynamic stability of the patient.

Unstable Patients may not perform studies that require trips away from the ICU or emergency department. In these patients intra-abdominal septic source may be detected by ultrasound (US).

Abdominal ultrasound, that has the advantage of being portable, may be helpful in the evaluation of right upper quadrant (e.g. perihepatic abscess, cholecystitis, pancreatitis), right lower quadrant, and pelvic pathology (e.g. appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, Douglas abscess), but the examination is sometimes limited because of patient discomfort, abdominal distension, and bowel gas interference.

When patients are stable, computerized tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice for most intra-abdominal processes.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^a46cddf8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.
