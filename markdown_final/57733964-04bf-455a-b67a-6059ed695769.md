## Question

Myasthenia gravis labs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about myasthenia gravis laboratory testing, including which labs to order, how to interpret results, what to do when tests are negative, and how to monitor over time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic framework and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the optimal antibody assays and their performance characteristics. Next, I will review neurophysiological testing and bedside maneuvers. After that, I need to consider the seronegative workup and thymic imaging. Finally, I should appraise the role of serial antibody testing and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and special populations in mind.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation: MG is an antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction, so diagnosis rests on three pillars — clinical assessment of fluctuating fatigable weakness, serologic autoantibody testing, and neurophysiology — interpreted in the context of pretest probability and disease phenotype, which I need to keep front-of-mind to avoid overtesting or misclassification [^113pkdFU] [^114TtXpp].

> I will now examine the first-line serologic tests. Wait, let me verify the assay hierarchy: acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are the primary screen, with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies reserved for AChR-negative cases with supportive clinical features; LRP4 antibodies are less common but can be considered in double-seronegative presentations, and I should remember that clustered AChR cell-based assays outperform conventional radioimmunoassays for detecting low-affinity antibodies that RIPA misses [^1165XXDx] [^115B5Gn1] [^113PWWs2].

> Hold on, I should verify performance characteristics before I overstate anything. AChR antibodies are detected in roughly 85–90% of generalized MG and about 50–70% of ocular MG, with near-100% specificity; MuSK accounts for about 1–10% of MG and is more often bulbar-predominant; clustered AChR cell-based assays can convert 18–38% of RIPA-negative cases to seropositive, which materially reduces the seronegative pool, and I need to ensure I cite the best available data for these ranges [^1165XXDx] [^115B5Gn1] [^114AB7ps].

> Next, I should review neurophysiology because serology alone is insufficient. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) demonstrates a decrement of at least 10% in compound muscle action potential amplitude in MG, but sensitivity varies by muscle selection and MG subtype; facial muscles, especially nasalis, increase yield in oculobulbar disease, whereas hypothenar muscles are reasonable in generalized MG, and using lower decrement thresholds in facial muscles can improve sensitivity without sacrificing specificity, which I should double-check before recommending a protocol [^112CMuuy] [^112DexFP].

> Let me consider single-fiber EMG (SFEMG), since it is often the most sensitive test when performed expertly. SFEMG detects increased jitter and blocking in MG and can salvage seronegative cases, but it is technically demanding and less specific than RNS; still, in experienced hands, SFEMG sensitivity can approach 90–100% in generalized MG, which is why I should not underuse it when the diagnosis remains uncertain despite negative antibodies [^115HnPSH] [^112zHQeQ].

> But wait, what about bedside tests that can triage or support the diagnosis while labs are pending. The ice test has high sensitivity for ocular MG and a strong positive likelihood ratio, while the edrophonium (Tensilon) test, though historically useful, is no longer available in the U.S.; neostigmine testing remains an alternative with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, and I should remember to use these as supportive — not definitive — evidence and to interpret them in clinical context [^112SgANq] [^113dgqdH] [^1146sTAP].

> I need to ensure I address the seronegative pathway carefully. If AChR and MuSK are negative but suspicion remains high, I should reflex to clustered AChR cell-based assays and consider LRP4 testing; if all antibody testing is negative yet neurophysiology supports a neuromuscular junction defect, I should reconsider congenital myasthenic syndromes, especially in younger patients or those with a family history, and consider targeted genetic panels to evaluate for CMS variants, keeping in mind phenotypic overlap with autoimmune MG [^116tcbYp] [^113PWWs2].

> Next, I should review thymic imaging because it is mandatory in all suspected MG. Chest CT is the standard to evaluate for thymoma, which occurs in about 10–15% of MG and mandates surgical referral; I should confirm that current guidance indeed recommends CT for all patients at baseline, not just those with generalized disease, to avoid missing thymic pathology [^113iRPzm] [^114omPiw].

> Now, let me think about serial antibody testing and biomarker use, and I should double-check the evidence before recommending routine titers. Although some studies suggest that falling AChR titers correlate with clinical improvement, the relationship is inconsistent and not sufficiently reliable for routine monitoring; expert consensus and systematic reviews advise against using antibody levels to track disease activity, so I should avoid ordering serial titers unless there is a specific research or exceptional clinical rationale [^116sg5F5] [^112CVACN] [^114fxerv].

> I should confirm the role of additional autoantibodies. Striational antibodies (titin, RyR) associate with thymoma and more severe disease, and in the right clinical context can support thymoma suspicion, but they are not first-line diagnostics; reflex strategies that add modulating AChR antibodies to binding antibodies can modestly improve specificity without meaningful sensitivity loss, which may be useful in equivocal cases [^113Yu4bB].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I will keep checking for internal consistency. Start with a careful clinical assessment for fluctuating fatigable weakness; if suspicion is high, order AChR antibodies and plan chest CT; if AChR is negative but clinical suspicion persists, add MuSK and proceed to RNS/SFEMG; if all antibodies are negative and neurophysiology is positive, consider clustered AChR CBA and LRP4, and if still negative with strong physiologic support, evaluate for CMS with genetic testing; throughout, use bedside tests like ice or neostigmine as supportive evidence rather than standalone diagnostics [^116tcbYp] [^113iRPzm] [^112SgANq].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and pitfalls. In ocular MG, AChR sensitivity is lower, so SFEMG and targeted RNS in facial muscles are particularly helpful; in children, clustered AChR assays increase yield and should be considered earlier; in older adults, underdiagnosis is common, so a lower threshold for testing is justified; and I need to remember that MuSK MG often shows poor RNS sensitivity and may require reliance on serology and SFEMG, with plasma exchange favored over IVIG in crises [^114QdXvf] [^1165XXDx] [^111kDNjN] [^114AB7ps] [^1125yvPG] [^112DexFP] [^115HnPSH].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with evidence and guidelines. MG diagnosis is multimodal: combine clinical assessment, high-specificity antibody testing with modern assays, and high-sensitivity neurophysiology; do not rely on antibody titers for routine monitoring; and always image the thymus. This integrated approach maximizes diagnostic yield, minimizes missed seronegative cases, and guides appropriate therapy selection and prognostication [^114TtXpp] [^116sg5F5] [^113iRPzm].

---

Myasthenia gravis (MG) diagnosis relies on a **multimodal approach** [^114TtXpp] that combines clinical assessment with serologic and electrophysiologic testing [^113iRPzm]. The key labs are **AChR and MuSK antibodies** [^113PWWs2], with LRP4, agrin, and striational antibodies as adjuncts [^116Whhje] [^113177zx]; cell-based assays improve detection of low-affinity AChR antibodies and reduce seronegativity [^115B5Gn1] [^114HP1ku]. Electrodiagnostics (RNS, SFEMG) are essential when serology is negative or inconclusive [^113gHZPD] [^116tcbYp], and chest CT is mandatory to screen for thymoma [^113iRPzm]. Routine antibody titers are not recommended for monitoring [^116sg5F5]; instead, track clinical scores and respiratory function [^1139yVpz] [^114TtXpp].

## Indications for laboratory testing

Laboratory testing is indicated when MG is suspected based on **clinical features** — fluctuating, fatigable weakness of ocular, bulbar, or limb muscles [^113pkdFU] — and to distinguish MG from mimics such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), and other neuromuscular disorders [^116tcbYp] [^114TtXpp].

---

## Serological tests

### Primary autoantibodies

| **Antibody** | **Prevalence** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) | - 85–90% in generalized MG <br/> - 50–70% in ocular MG | - Highly specific for MG <br/> - Associated with thymoma in ~10% [^1165XXDx] [^117WPLY2] |
| Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) | - 1–10% of MG | - Predominantly bulbar and respiratory involvement <br/> - Poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors [^114AB7ps] |

---

### Secondary autoantibodies

- **LRP4**: 1–5% of MG; often milder disease, frequently ocular [^113PWWs2].
- **Agrin**: Rare; associated with ocular MG [^116rDrub].
- **Striational antibodies (titin, ryanodine receptor)**: Associated with thymoma and severe MG [^notfound].

---

### Assay methods

- **Radioimmunoassay (RIA)**: Traditional gold standard for AChR/MuSK [^112LyDZk].
- **Cell-based assays (CBA)**: Higher sensitivity for low-affinity AChR antibodies; reduce seronegativity by ~18–38% [^115B5Gn1] [^114HP1ku].
- **Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)**: Alternative for MuSK; less sensitive than RIA/CBA [^114AB7ps].

---

## Electrophysiological tests

Electrophysiology is essential when serology is negative or inconclusive [^116iNGzG]:

| **Test** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) | 40–85% | 95–100% | Detects decrement in generalized MG; less sensitive in ocular MG [^112DexFP] |
| Single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) | 85–100% | 60–90% | Most sensitive test; detects jitter in ocular/generalized MG [^115HnPSH] |

---

## Imaging studies

Chest CT is mandatory in all suspected MG to screen for **thymoma**, present in ~10–15% of MG [^113iRPzm] [^114omPiw].

---

## Laboratory tests for monitoring disease activity

Routine antibody titers are not recommended for monitoring [^116sg5F5]; instead, use **clinical scores** (QMG, MG-ADL, MG Composite) and **respiratory function tests** (FVC, MIP/MEP) to track disease activity and treatment response [^1148ikmM] [^11481KYP].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Seronegativity**: 10–20% remain antibody-negative despite MG; use SFEMG/RNS and clinical correlation [^1165XXDx].
- **Inter-assay variability**: Standardization is needed; CBAs improve consistency [^115BEVKG].
- **False positives**: Rare; interpret results in clinical context [^116gQ4dq].

---

## Emerging biomarkers

Emerging biomarkers under investigation include **circulating B-cell subsets**, **complement activation markers**, and **miRNAs**; none are routine clinical practice yet [^112zHQeQ].

---

MG diagnosis and monitoring require a **multimodal approach** integrating serology, electrophysiology, and imaging, with modern assays reducing seronegativity and clinical scores guiding follow-up [^114TtXpp].

Discussion

This is an updated formal international consensus guidance of MG experts, based on new evidence that has become available since the initial guidance was published in 2016. As before, these statements are intended as a guide for clinicians worldwide and are not absolute recommendations for management. They are also not intended for establishing payment policies or drug tiering by payers. This continues to be a living document, which will require periodic review and updates to reflect new information relevant to the management of MG.

### Role of autoantibody levels as biomarkers in the management of patients with myasthenia gravis: a systematic review and expert appraisal [^116sg5F5]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although myasthenia gravis (MG) is recognized as an immunoglobulin G autoantibody-mediated disease, the relationship between autoantibody levels and disease activity in MG is unclear. We sought to evaluate this landscape through systematically assessing the evidence, testing the impact of predefined variables on any relationship, and augmenting with expert opinion.

Methods

In October 2020, a forum of leading clinicians and researchers in neurology from across Europe (Expert Forum for Rare Autoantibodies in Neurology in Myasthenia Gravis) participated in a series of virtual meetings that took place alongside the conduct of a systematic literature review (SLR).

Results

Forty-two studies were identified meeting inclusion criteria. Of these, 10 reported some correlation between a patient's autoantibody level and disease severity. Generally, decreased autoantibody levels (acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase, and titin) were positively and significantly correlated with improvements in disease severity (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score, Myasthenia Gravis Composite score, Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living score, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America classification). Given the limited evidence, testing the impact of predefined variables was not feasible.

Conclusions

This first SLR to assess whether a correlation exists between autoantibody levels and disease activity in patients with MG has indicated a potential positive correlation, which could have clinical implications in guiding treatment decisions. However, in light of the limited and variable evidence, we cannot currently recommend routine clinical use of autoantibody level testing in this context. For now, patient's characteristics, clinical disease course, and laboratory data (e.g., autoantibody status, thymus histology) should inform management, alongside patient-reported outcomes. We highlight the need for future studies to reach more definitive conclusions on this relationship.

### Does this patient have myasthenia gravis? [^112SgANq]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinicians must be able to diagnose myasthenia gravis, since delays in establishing the diagnosis may put patients at risk for complications from this treatable disease.

Objective

To determine if items in the history and examination or results of simple tests change the likelihood of myasthenia gravis as a diagnosis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles (January 1966-January 2005) using the terms myasthenia gravis, diagnosis, and test, and a search of bibliographies of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

Studies evaluating a particular symptom or sign in patients both with and without myasthenia gravis. Of 640 articles retrieved, 33 were eligible for review. Of these, 15 met inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstracted data using a standardized instrument, and classified study quality using previously published criteria.

Data Synthesis

A history of "speech becoming unintelligible during prolonged speaking" and the presence of the peek sign increase the likelihood of myasthenia gravis (likelihood ratio [LR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–17.0 and LR, 30.0; 95% CI, 3.2–278.0, respectively). Their absence does not significantly reduce the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. The identified studies only assessed 1 other historical feature and sign each ("food remaining in the mouth after swallowing" and quiver eye movements, respectively), and neither of these significantly changes the likelihood of myasthenia. The ice test is useful when the response is abnormal (summary positive LR, 24.0; 95% CI, 8.5–67.0) and diminishes the likelihood of myasthenia gravis when the response is normal (summary negative LR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09–0.27). A positive response to an anticholinesterase medication (mainly edrophonium test) increases the probability of a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (summary positive LR, 15.0; 95% CI, 7.5–31.0), and a negative response reduces the diagnostic probability of myasthenia (summary negative LR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.21). An abnormal sleep test result is useful in confirming the diagnosis (LR, 53.0; 95% CI, 3.4–832.0). The rest and sleep tests make the probability of myasthenia unlikely when results are normal (LR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.95 and LR, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00–0.16, respectively).

Conclusions

Items in the history and physical examination along with results of certain simple tests performed in the office (ice test, sleep test, and edrophonium test) are useful in predicting the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. These results must be interpreted with caution, however, given the high prevalence of disease in the populations reported in clinical studies. This review is limited by the small number of signs and symptoms scientifically studied and reported in the literature. Future studies evaluating the value of common historical features and easy maneuvers commonly known and practiced by experts in the clinical diagnosis of myasthenia are needed.

### Myasthenia gravis in 2025: five new things and four hopes for the future [^113kzcRz]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The last 10 years has brought transformative developments in the effective treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). Beginning with the randomized trial of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis that demonstrated efficacy of thymectomy in nonthymomatous MG, several new treatment approaches have completed successful clinical trials and regulatory launch. These modalities, including B cell depletion, complement inhibition, and blockade of the neonatal Fc receptor, are now in use, offering prospects of sustained remission and neuromuscular protection in what is a long-term disease. In this review, we update our clinico-immunological review of 2016 with these important advances, examine their role in treatment algorithms, and focus attention on key issues of biomarkers for prognostication and the growing cohort of older patients, both those with long-term disease, and late-onset MG ('LOMG'). We close by expressing our four hopes for the next 5–10 years: improvements in laboratory medicine to facilitate rapid diagnosis, effective strategies for neuromuscular protection, more research into and better understanding of pathophysiology and treatment response in older individuals, and the potentially transformative role of therapies aimed at delivering a durable response such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Our postscript summarizes some emerging themes in the field of serological and online biomarkers, which may develop greater stature in the next epoch.

Why do we need MG guidance treatment statements?

Although there is widespread agreement on the use of many treatments for MG, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Because MG is heterogeneous, no one treatment approach is best for all patients. Few physicians treat enough patients with MG to be comfortable with all available treatments. Given its heterogeneity, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MG have limited generalizability, while uncontrolled trials are limited by potential bias. Hence, an effort to develop consensus among international experts was undertaken to guide clinicians worldwide on the multifaceted approach to managing MG. This summary condenses the extensive background information in the full guidance statements, available on the Neurology ® Web site at.

Blood tests for existing therapies — individualize monitoring based on local risk. Risks and benefits of routine blood monitoring should be weighed, and because some MG therapies require frequent blood work, decisions about ongoing testing should be individualized and based on regional COVID‑19 incidence.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to respiratory evaluation, ACCP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider measuring FVC, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure, overnight oximetry, or assessing for evidence of sleep-disordered breathing or hypoventilation on polysomnography to predict the timing of noninvasive ventilation initiation in patients with neuromuscular disease.

### Myasthenia gravis: a clinical-immunological update [^115PSQRq]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the archetypic disorder of both the neuromuscular junction and autoantibody-mediated disease. In most patients, IgG1-dominant antibodies to acetylcholine receptors cause fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles. In the rest, a variable proportion possesses antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase while the remainder of seronegative MG is being explained through cell-based assays using a receptor-clustering technique and, to a lesser extent, proposed new antigenic targets. The incidence and prevalence of MG are increasing, particularly in the elderly. New treatments are being developed, and results from the randomised controlled trial of thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG, due for release in early 2016, will be of particular clinical value. To help navigate an evidence base of varying quality, practising clinicians may consult new MG guidelines in the fields of pregnancy, ocular and generalised MG (GMG). This review focuses on updates in epidemiology, immunology, therapeutic and clinical aspects of GMG in adults.

### Epidemiology, diagnostics, and biomarkers of autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders [^114TtXpp]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders are rare. However, myasthenia gravis is being increasingly recognised in people older than 50 years. In the past 5–10 years, epidemiological studies worldwide suggest an incidence of acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive myasthenia gravis of up to 29 cases per 1 million people per year. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody-positive myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are about 20 times less common. Several diagnostic methods are available for autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders, including serological antibody, electrophysiological, imaging, and pharmacological tests. The course of disease can be followed up with internationally accepted clinical scores or patient-reported outcome measures. For prognostic purposes, determining whether the disease is paraneoplastic is of great importance, as myasthenia gravis can be associated with thymoma and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with small-cell lung cancer. However, despite well defined diagnostic parameters to classify patients into subgroups, objective biomarkers for use in the clinic or in clinical trials to predict the course of myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are needed.

### Bedside and laboratory diagnostic testing in myasthenia [^112zHQeQ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) and congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of disorders with a well characterised autoimmune or genetic and neurophysiological basis. We reviewed the literature from the last 20 years assessing the utility of various neurophysiological, immunological, provocative and genetic tests in MG and CMS. Diagnostic sensitivity of repetitive nerve stimulation test ranges between 14 and 94% and specificity between 73 and 100%; sensitivity of single-fibre EMG (SFEMG) test ranges between 64 and 100% and specificity between 22 and 100%; anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody sensitivity ranges from 13 to 97% and specificity ranges from 95 to 100%. Overall, SFEMG has the highest sensitivity while positive anti-AChR antibodies have the highest specificity. Newer testing strategies that have been investigated over the last couple of decades include ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, otoacoustic emissions and disease-specific circulating miRNAs in serum for autoimmune myasthenia, as well as next-generation sequencing for genetic testing of CMS. While there has been significant progress in developing newer testing strategies for diagnosing MG and CMS over the last couple of decades, more research is needed to assess the utility of these newer tools regarding their sensitivity and specificity.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115vXcS7]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, resulting from binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000, and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years. The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

### Myasthenia gravis: from autoantibodies to therapy [^116wpYdK]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current article reviews the recent advances in the field of myasthenia gravis, which span from autoantibody profiling and pathogenic mechanisms to therapy innovation. The overview is highlighting specifically the data and the needs of targeted treatments in the light of precision medicine in myasthenia gravis.

Recent Findings

Novel data published recently further increased our knowledge on myasthenia gravis. The use of cell-based assays has greatly improved autoantibody detection in myasthenia gravis patients, and the mechanisms of action of these antibodies have been described. The role of Toll-like receptor activation in the generation of thymic alterations and anti-acetylcholine receptor autosensitization has been further investigated implementing our understanding on the relationships between innate immunity and autoimmunity. Additional studies have been focused on the alterations of T-cell/B-cell regulatory mechanisms in thymus and peripheral blood of myasthenia gravis patients. microRNAs and genetic factors are also emerging as key biomarkers in myasthenia gravis pathogenesis and prediction of drug efficacy in individual patients.

Summary

The recent immunological and pathological findings in myasthenia gravis promise to improve myasthenia gravis treatment, via the development of more precise and personalized therapies.

### Expert consensus recommendations for improving and standardising the assessment of patients with generalised myasthenia gravis [^11481KYP]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic, immunoglobulin G (IgG)‐mediated, neuromuscular autoimmune disease, which causes debilitating and potentially life‐threatening muscle weakness. Most patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) first present with ocular symptoms only; however, approximately 80% will have gMG within 2 years of initial disease onset. gMG is classified by degree of muscle weakness, which, along with other symptoms of the disease, may vary greatly among individuals and fluctuate over time. This variation in symptoms, combined with infrequent and isolated evaluations, means accurate tracking of symptom state and full comprehension of disease burden is difficult. The impact of gMG on patient's lives can therefore be underappreciated.

In addition, the impact of gMG on key areas of patient health and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) is profound, increasing substantially with increased disease severity. Many patients also continue to experience substantial disease burden while on treatment, and poor HRQoL may persist even if gMG is considered to be well managed. Nonetheless, current measures of impairment have the potential to provide a good score‐based measure of the impact of symptoms and treatment on HRQoL in patients, if used consistently.

Key messages

Myasthenia gravis is an antibody mediated autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction function that leads to muscle weakness and functional disability
Treatments targeting the underlying pathophysiological pathway are rapidly evolving and have improved management of myasthenia gravis
The most appropriate selection of treatments considers the mechanisms, indications, risks and benefits, and costs of each treatment along with patients' preference
Targeting different pathomechanisms of the disease simultaneously will likely lead to improved outcomes, particularly in the severe cases

New immunomodulatory therapeutics hold promise for the future treatment of myasthenia gravis, say DeHart-McCoyle and colleagues

### MGBase: a global, observational registry for collaborative research in myasthenia gravis [^113oivwo]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

All other commonly used MG outcome measures are also available for use in MGBase: quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG), the patient‐reported components of the MG impairment index (MGII), MG quality of life 15 revised (MGQOL15r). MGBase includes fields for all standard diagnostic investigations and laboratory results that are likely to be performed in MG patients, plus fields for thymectomy outcomes. In addition, there are data fields for all treatments typically used in the management of MG (including variable dosing for treatments such as corticosteroids); fields are available for exacerbations, hospitalisations, pregnancies, associated diseases, and adverse events. The recording of associated diseases and adverse events is linked and harmonized to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) which enables accurate coding and retrieval.

Members of the MG‐specific interest group have subsequently formed the MGBase scientific leadership group (SLG), which is responsible for determining the overall scientific direction and scope of the MGBase registry. The SLG is currently composed of contributors from Australia, North America, and Africa.

### Recommendations for myasthenia gravis clinical trials [^111wamAZ]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

The recommendations for clinical research standards published in 2000 by a task force of the Medical Scientific Advisory Board (MSAB) of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) were largely successful in introducing greater uniformity in the recording and reporting of MG clinical trials. Recognizing that changes in clinical trial design and implementation may increase the likelihood that new therapies are developed for MG, the MGFA MSAB Task Force here presents updated recommendations for the design and implementation of clinical trials in MG, including (a) the use of a quantitative measure, such as the MG-Composite, that is weighted for clinical significance and incorporates patient reported outcomes; (b) consideration of nontrial strategies; and (c) development of biomarkers that support mechanistic studies of pharmacotherapies. The hope is that these updated task force recommendations will expedite the development and acceptance of more effective and less noxious therapies for MG.

### Does change in acetylcholine receptor antibody level correlate with clinical change in myasthenia gravis? [^112CVACN]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study is to determine if change in acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-ab) levels reflects change in clinical severity in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods

We reviewed results from a prospective trial in MG and from all 85 patients in an MG Clinic who had AChR-ab determinations performed at least twice by the same commercial laboratory.

Results

Change in AChR-ab levels correlated only weakly with change in clinical severity. AChR-ab levels fell in 92% of patients who improved and in 63% who did not. A fall in AChR-ab level had a positive predictive value for clinical improvement of 83% and a negative predictive value of only 59%.

Conclusions

AChR-ab levels fell in almost all patients who improved, but also in most patients who did not. Thus, we do not recommend commercially available AChR-ab levels as a biomarker of improvement in MG. However, antibody levels might be useful as a marker for inadequate immunotherapy.

### A reappraisal of diagnostic tests for myasthenia gravis in a large Asian cohort [^112oL79n]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by weakness of bodily skeletal muscles. Office-based diagnostic tests such as repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), single fiber electromyography (SFEMG), and the ice test, are used to refine the differential clinical diagnosis of this disease. Evaluating the clinical sensitivity and specificity of these tests, however, may be confounded by lack of a gold standard, non-blinding, incorporation bias, use of non-representative populations and retrospective data.

Objective

In this study comprising a large Asian cohort of 127 patients recruited from a Neuro-ophthalmology clinic, we minimized aforementioned confounders and tested the diagnostic value of 3 office-based tests against 2 reference standards of MG by virtue of clinical features, antibody assay and response to treatment.

Results

Regardless of the reference standard used, the ice and SFEMG tests displayed a higher sensitivity (86.0 to 97.3%) compared to the RNS test (21.3 to 30.6%). Conversely, the specificity of the ice (31.3%) and SFEMG (21.7% and 17.2%) tests were reduced compared to the RNS test (82.6% and 84.4%). The combined use of the ice test and SFEMG, improved the specificity of MG diagnosis to 63.6% and 64.3%, without affecting the sensitivity of those tests.

Conclusion

Our findings indicate, in an Asian population, high sensitivity of the SFEMG test and suggest the ice test as a valid, affordable and less technically demanding approach to diagnose MG with ocular involvement. Both ice test and SFEMG alone, however, yielded poor specificity. We suggest that the combination of SFEMG and ice test provides a more reliable diagnosis of MG.

### Myasthenia gravis [^116iNGzG]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) or other AChR-related proteins in the postsynaptic muscle membrane. Localized or general muscle weakness is the predominant symptom and is induced by the antibodies. Patients are grouped according to the presence of antibodies, symptoms, age at onset and thymus pathology. Diagnosis is straightforward in most patients with typical symptoms and a positive antibody test, although a detailed clinical and neurophysiological examination is important in antibody-negative patients. MG therapy should be ambitious and aim for clinical remission or only mild symptoms with near-normal function and quality of life. Treatment should be based on MG subgroup and includes symptomatic treatment using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, thymectomy and immunotherapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are fast-acting treatments used for disease exacerbations, and intensive care is necessary during exacerbations with respiratory failure. Comorbidity is frequent, particularly in elderly patients. Active physical training should be encouraged.

### Unravelling the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis [^113E1YdA]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2002). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is a relatively rare neurological disease that is associated with loss of the acetylcholine receptors that initiate muscle contraction. This results in muscle weakness, which can be life-threatening. The story of how both the physiological basis of the disease and the role of acetylcholine-receptor-specific antibodies were determined is a classic example of the application of basic science to clinical medicine, and it has provided a model for defining other antibody-mediated disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems.

### Complement inhibitors for myasthenia gravis in adults [^113iRPzm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis

The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis involves assessment of the clinical phenotype, serological (blood) testing for autoantibodies, and neurophysiology testing (nerve tests). All people with suspected myasthenia gravis will also require a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest to look for a thymoma. Clinical assessment will involve obtaining a typical history of fatigable weakness and demonstrating this on examination, such as progressive ptosis while the affected person is looking upwards, or proximal muscle weakness following repetitive exercises. Serological testing includes AChR and MuSK autoantibodies, while neurophysiology can demonstrate a progressive reduction in muscle response following repetitive nerve stimulation and jitter on single fibre electromyography. In people who have negative serology and neurophysiology tests, further investigations may be required to rule out other causes of muscle weakness; for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head to rule out a brain disorder.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^111sbtjP]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update the 2016 formal consensus-based guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) based on the latest evidence in the literature.

Methods

In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment guidance for MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to develop consensus recommendations pertaining to 7 treatment topics. In February 2019, the international panel was reconvened with the addition of one member to represent South America. All previous recommendations were reviewed for currency, and new consensus recommendations were developed on topics that required inclusion or updates based on the recent literature. Up to 3 rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to reach consensus, with modifications to recommendations between rounds based on the panel input. A simple majority vote (80% of panel members voting "yes") was used to approve minor changes in grammar and syntax to improve clarity.

Results

The previous recommendations for thymectomy were updated. New recommendations were developed for the use of rituximab, eculizumab, and methotrexate as well as for the following topics: early immunosuppression in ocular MG and MG associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

Conclusion

This updated formal consensus guidance of international MG experts, based on new evidence, provides recommendations to clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.

### Bedside testing for myasthenia gravis: the ice-test [^1146sTAP]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented to the acute medical take with a history of droopy eyelids and difficulty swallowing. A diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was suspected from the clinical history. The patient's symptoms were progressive, raising concerns of aspiration pneumonia or respiratory compromise if untreated. Definitive diagnosis of myasthenia gravis relies upon a combination of serological and electrophysiological investigations, the results of which are not immediately available in an acute situation. Bedside tests are therefore of practical clinical importance to enable prompt and effective initiation of treatment, particularly where critical symptoms are present. The ice-test is a straightforward and non-invasive investigation with a high sensitivity for myasthenia gravis and is a useful alternative to edrophonium testing. It is especially helpful in patients with cardiac and respiratory co-morbidities for whom acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated. We describe a case where this simple bedside test successfully expedited the correct treatment and improved patient care.

### Myasthenia gravis: Association of British Neurologists' management guidelines [^114mCGy4]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction for which many therapies were developed before the era of evidence based medicine. The basic principles of treatment are well known, however, patients continue to receive suboptimal treatment as a result of which a myasthenia gravis guidelines group was established under the aegis of The Association of British Neurologists. These guidelines attempt to steer a path between evidence-based practice where available, and established best practice where evidence is unavailable. Where there is insufficient evidence or a choice of options, the guidelines invite the clinician to seek the opinion of a myasthenia expert. The guidelines support clinicians not just in using the right treatments in the right order, but in optimising the use of well-known therapeutic agents. Clinical practice can be audited against these guidelines.

### Evidence of underdiagnosis of myasthenia gravis in older people [^111kDNjN]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis is a potentially serious but treatable muscle disease caused by autoantibodies directed at the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. There is anecdotal evidence that the diagnosis is sometimes missed in older patients.

Objective

To examine the incidence and age distribution of positive AChR antibodies in samples referred to diagnostic laboratories in the UK, and the prevalence of positive AChR antibodies in samples from a cohort of older individuals.

Methods

Positive AChR antibody tests were identified from all UK centres registered for the assay with the European quality assurance scheme (EQAS) during 1997–99, and the age and sex specific incidence was calculated, based on the UK population. The prevalence of AChR antibodies in sera from a sample of 2000 individuals aged ≥ 60 years was determined.

Results

3183 individuals had positive AChR antibody tests on routine screening during the years 1997 to 1999 in the UK, giving an annual incidence of 1.8/100 000. In both sexes, the age specific incidence rose steeply between the ages of 45 and 74, reaching 9.9/100 000 in men, and then fell, with a sharp decline above the age of 80. In the prevalence study, whereas only one serum from individuals aged 60–74 years was positive for AChR antibodies (0.12%), sera from eight individuals aged ≥ 75 years were positive (0.7%). Only one had a previous clinical diagnosis of myasthenia gravis but four others had histories of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks.

Conclusions

The sharp fall in the incidence of clinically recognised myasthenia gravis in people over 80 years of age in our national AChR antibody incidence study, and the high prevalence of previously unrecognised positive AChR antibodies in those ≥ 75 years old, suggest that myasthenia gravis may be substantially underdiagnosed in older people.

### Clinical and laboratory-reconfirmed myasthenia gravis: a population-based study [^117KvNJK]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinically based prevalence of myasthenia gravis (MG) with the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed cases. All patients with a diagnosis of MG living in Estonia as on 1 January 1997 were asked to participate in re-examination. The criteria for laboratory-supported MG were weakness and rapid fatigue and a positive outcome of at least one of three laboratory tests: (i) blinded acetylcholinesterase inhibitor test; (ii) determination of antibodies to acetylcholine receptor and (iii) neurophysiological examination using repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fibre EMG. Eighty-nine patients were re-examined and 70 patients (79%) fulfilled the criteria of laboratory-supported MG. The corrected prevalence ratio was 78 per million. In the non-confirmed MG group, there was more women (92%) than men (43%) whose diagnosis was established within 1 year from onset of symptoms (P = 0.016). In all women with non-confirmed MG the diagnosis was established within 1 year from referral to the physician, whereas 68% of women with confirmed MG was diagnosed within 1 year (P < 0.0001). Thus, we conclude that, in Estonia the prevalence of MG based on medical records seems overestimated by 21% and women are at higher risk of obtaining an uncertain diagnosis of MG.

Combinations of antibody tests for different epitopes

To overcome the shortcomings of using only anti-AChR antibody tests, which can miss a substantial proportion of cases, some have argued that testing for acetylcholine receptor, acetylcholinesterase, titin and ryanodine receptor antibodies together can offer a better diagnostic method for MG than each antibody test alone but this is not accepted as a standard in routine clinical practice. In a study designed to test for multiple antibodies in 89 MG patients, AChR, acetylcholinesterase, titin and RyR antibodies were detected in 54%, 20%, 64% and 55% of MG patients, respectively. These levels were higher compared to a matched group of patients with other neurological disease (n = 66) and a group of controls (n = 66). The combination of the four antibodies assays provided 94% sensitivity and 84% specificity for the diagnosis of MG.

### Ocular myasthenia gravis: updates on an elusive target [^116rDrub]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) is a complex condition with heterogenous phenotypes and ill-defined diagnostic criteria. Understanding concomitant risk factors and autoimmune serology can help inform prognosis for generalization and guide treatment.

Recent Findings

Although antibodies to acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase likely increase risk of generalization, they are less frequent in OMG. Patients without either antibody tend to have a milder disease process and often have variable antibodies to other end-plate proteins such as LRP4, agrin, or cortactin. The treatment of OMG begins with pyridostigmine and is supplemented by oral prednisone if treatment-resistant or high risk for generalization. Variable oral prednisone regimens have been used with success and further immunosuppression may be best achieved with mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine. Checkpoint inhibitor-induced myasthenia gravis is increasingly recognized and likely has high rates of mortality associated with myocarditis.

Summary

Our understanding of OMG and its variable phenotypes continues to evolve. Autoantibody testing increasingly provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Despite these improvements, a lack of quality treatment trials creates significant challenges for evidence-based management guidelines.

Antibody tests

Anti-AChR antibodies

The first and still the most common antibody test used is the anti-AChR antibody assay. Traditionally these AChR antibodies have been detected using radio-immuno-precipitation assays (RIPA). Some of the patients (10–15% of generalised MG and 50% of ocular MG cases) classified as 'seronegative' using RIPA, have low-affinity antibodies to AChR that cannot be detected in standard solution RIPA. However, about two-thirds of sera from patients previously found to be negative for binding AChR in solution, have been found to be positive for anti-AChR antibody using a cell-based assay method in which antibodies to rapsyn-clustered AChR are detected. Clinically they resemble patients with AChR antibodies detected by standard RIPA apart from the fact that patients with antibodies only to clustered AChR have been found to be younger, have milder disease and generally have a good prognosis. Furthermore, cell-based assays can also be useful in the diagnosis of RIPA-negative MG in children. This method is the primary technique for detecting other antibodies such as anti-LRP4 and it may also be used for anti-MuSK antibodies.

Patients with positive anti-AChR antibodies generally do not express a single monoclonal antibody population. The heterogeneous nature of the anti-AChR antibody response has led to the categorisation of AChR antibodies into 3 types: binding, blocking, and modulating antibodies. Both binding and blocking antibodies correlate with disease severity in MG. The most sensitive assay in a study analysing serum samples from 41,180 patients (12% of these had AChR antibodies from any one of the above three categories) was the AChR binding antibody assay, which was positive in 4178 (88%) of the 4740 AChR antibody-positive serum samples. Modulating antibodies were detected in 70% (n = 3297) of the samples, and blocking antibodies were least prevalent, detected in only 65% (n = 3074) of AChR antibody-positive sera. Combining binding and blocking AChR antibody testing identified 97% of the patient population with detectable AChR antibodies.

The sensitivity of AChR antibody in adults is 85–90% in cases with generalised MG and 50–70% in cases of ocular MG. It is only 50% sensitive in cases of childhood-onset MG but nearly 100% in cases of thymoma-associated MG. Specificity of anti-AChR for myasthenia is 95–100%.

Proposed scheme for testing for myasthenia in adults

Finally, we propose a diagnostic algorithm for testing for myasthenia in adults (Fig. 2) but we accept local protocols may vary. This diagnostic algorithm is based on the fact that combining an antibody test with high specificity and an electro-diagnostic test with high sensitivity is likely to have the highest diagnostic yield. Most clinicians will test anti-AChR antibodies in all suspected cases at initial presentation but the frequency of usage of axonal SFEMG and RNS will depend upon expertise available in the neuromuscular clinic. Where one or both of the neurophysiological tests are positive but the anti-AChR receptor antibody test is negative, most clinicians will test anti-MuSK antibodies because while the neurophysiological tests are very sensitive but they are not specific for myasthenia. If the standard RIPA assays are negative, nowadays clinicians have the ability to test for clustered antibodies against AChR and MuSK using cell-based assays or antibodies to LRP4 or striated muscle. Finally, if the neurophysiological tests are positive for a neuromuscular junction defect but all the antibody tests are negative, one has to consider the possibility that it could be a delayed diagnosis of a milder phenotype of congenital myasthenia that has gone unrecognised up to adult life. Due to the fact that there are more than two dozen genes that can cause congenital myasthenia, with considerable phenotypic overlap, the specific molecular diagnosis is achieved with genetic testing and nowadays for convenience this can be done using panel testing.

This is a proposed scheme for testing for myasthenia in adults (RNS Repetitive nerve stimulation study, SFEMG single-fibre electromyography study, CMS congenital myasthenic syndrome, AChR acetylcholine receptor, MuSK muscle-specific kinase, LRP4 LDL receptor-related protein 4, Ab antibody, + ve positive)

### Myasthenia gravis [^113pkdFU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on myasthenia gravis:

- **Definition**: MG is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable muscle weakness which results from antibodies targeting the postsynaptic neuromuscular membrane.
- **Pathophysiology**: MG is caused by autoantibodies directed mainly against AChRs, muscle-specific kinase, and lipoprotein receptor-related peptide.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence and prevalence rate of MG is estimated at 0.53 cases per 100,000 person-years and 7.8 persons per 100,000 population, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Antibodies belonging to IgG1 and IgG3 subclass direct antibodies mainly against AChRs, which disrupt neuromuscular transmission causing ocular, oropharyngeal, limb, axial, and respiratory muscle weakness. Thymoma and myasthenia crisis may even cause death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality associated with MG is about 5–14%.

### Clinical utility of acetylcholine receptor antibody testing in ocular myasthenia gravis [^114QdXvf]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The sensitivity of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody testing is thought to be lower in ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) compared with generalized disease, although estimates in small-scale studies vary. There is little information in the literature about the implications of AChR antibody levels and progression from OMG to generalized myasthenia gravis.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that serum AChR antibody testing is more sensitive in OMG than previously reported and to examine the association between AChR antibody levels and progression from OMG to generalized myasthenia gravis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted of 223 patients (mean [SD] age, 59.2 [16.4] years; 139 [62.3%] male) diagnosed with OMG between July 1, 1986, and May 31, 2013, at 2 large, academic medical centers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Baseline characteristics, OMG symptoms, results of AChR antibody testing, and progression time to generalized myasthenia gravis (if this occurred) were recorded for each patient. Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the association between all clinical variables and antibody result. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to examine time to generalization.

Results

Among the 223 participants, AChR antibody testing results were positive in 158 participants (70.9%). In an adjusted model, increased age at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04; p = 0.007) and progression to generalized myasthenia gravis (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18–7.26; p = 0.02) were significantly associated with positive antibody test results. Women were less likely to have a positive antibody test result (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19–0.68; p = 0.002). Patients who developed symptoms of generalized myasthenia gravis had a significantly higher mean (SD) antibody level than those who did not develop symptoms of generalized myasthenia gravis (12.7 [16.5] nmol/L vs 4.2 [7.9] nmol/L; p = 0.002).

Conclusions and Relevance

We demonstrate a higher sensitivity of AChR antibody testing than previously reported in the largest cohort of patients with OMG available to date. Older age, male sex, and progression to generalized myasthenia gravis were significantly associated with a positive antibody test result. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between high AChR antibody levels and progression from OMG to generalized disease.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^114AB7ps]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction, caused in most patients by antibodies (Ab) to the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) Ab are detected in about 1–10% of all MG patients, with varying regional prevalence. Anti-MuSK IgG4 Ab block interaction with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), which interferes with MuSK activation and AChR clustering. Although there have been significant advancements in understanding clinical and pathophysiological features of MuSK MG, a diagnosis of this MG subtype may be challenging due to its often atypical clinical manifestations. The unusual clinical features include predominantly regional involvement of bulbar and respiratory muscles, facial and tongue muscle atrophy, and poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or even cholinergic hypersensitivity, and lower diagnostic yield of electrophysiological tests such as repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS). Accumulating knowledge on the clinical characteristics has contributed significantly to the improvement of diagnosis of MuSK MG. However, a clinical diagnosis of this MG subtype is still often challenging particularly without serological confirmation of anti-MuSK Ab, which may lead to delayed diagnosis and poor treatment outcome.

For detection of anti-MuSK Ab, there are three different laboratory techniques currently available which include the live cell-based assay (CBA), radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RIPA is the most commonly used test with almost 100% specificity, and CBA was demonstrated to provide a higher sensitivity. Although CBA and RIPA are considered as the gold standard for anti-MuSK Ab detection, they involve either radioactivity or genetically engineered cells which may not be easily available for clinical practice in many regions of the world. As an alternative, there are commercially available ELISA kits for detecting anti-MuSK Ab. However, the diagnostic accuracy of MUSK-ELISA has not been formally tested in a large cohort, and its current use is still limited for the research purpose.

### Inter-laboratory comparison of routine autoantibody detection methods for autoimmune neuropathies and myasthenia gravis [^115BEVKG]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Serological tests are important to detect autoantibodies (autoAbs) in patients with autoimmune neuropathies (AN) and myasthenia gravis (MG) as they are biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification, treatment selection, and monitoring. However, tests to detect autoAbs frequently lack proper standardization and results differ across diagnostic laboratories. We compared results for tests routinely performed in Spanish diagnostic laboratories to detect AN and MG autoAbs. In the Spanish Society of Immunology Autoimmunity Group national workshop, serum samples from 13 patients with AN or MG were tested for anti-ganglioside, anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), anti-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), and anti-muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) autoAbs using reference methods and were distributed for analysis to 27 participating laboratories using their routine methods. Overserved were inter-laboratory variability and worryingly low sensitivity, especially for anti-ganglioside immunoglobulin G and anti-MAG autoAb detection. This pilot study reflects autoAbs detection state of the art in AN and MG testing in leading diagnostic laboratories in Spain, highlighting the need for standardization prior to clinical use.

### Clinical evaluation and management of myasthenia gravis [^115tAk4x]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a syndrome of fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with use and improves with rest. Eye, facial, oropharyngeal, axial, and limb muscles may be involved in varying combinations and degrees of severity. Its etiology is heterogeneous, divided initially between those rare congenital myasthenic syndromes, which are genetic, and the bulk of MG, which is acquired and autoimmune. The autoimmune conditions are divided in turn between those that possess measurable serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and a smaller group that does not. The latter group includes those MG patients who have serum antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Therapeutic considerations differ for early-onset MG, late-onset MG, and MG associated with the presence of a thymoma. Most MG patients can be treated effectively, but there is still a need for more specific immunological approaches.

Hope 1: Progress in laboratory testing for rapid and more sensitive serological testing

AChR: from radioimmuno- to cell-based assays

The neurotoxin α-bungarotoxin isolated from a venomous elapid snake, the Taiwanese many banded krait (Bungarus multicinctus), was central to the development of AChR autoantibody assays. It binds the adult and fetal isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with high affinity (nM to pM) and, when labelled with 125 I, creates a specific, stable, quantifiable target for radioimmunoprecipitation assays. This assay has been used for decades in routine immunology diagnostic laboratories.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests for AChR antibody detection generated over the intervening 40 years have not improved on the radioimmunoassay (RIA) test accuracy. However, a proportion of people with generalized MG with identical clinical and electromyographic features to AChR seropositive patients remained AChR antibody-seronegative. The resolution of this discordance was an improved test substrate. Transient transfection of HEK293T cells with AChR subunits in addition to the AChR clustering molecule rapsyn provided a test substrate most reflective of the antibody target in vivo. This clustered AChR cell-based assay uniquely identified a proportion of 'seronegative MG patients' as seropositive. Here the human AChRs (adult or fetal) are overexpressed in living cells in the presence of fluorescent-labelled rapsyn that clusters the AChR into punctae. Patient sera are incubated with the cells at room temperature for an hour and AChR-bound antibody is identified using a fluorescent secondary antibody. In three head-to-head studies, this live cell-based assay (CBA) identified 50 new seropositive cases, 18–38% of the patients in these cohorts, who were defined as antibody seronegative by RIA. This is now considered the gold standard for the detection of AChR autoantibodies (Fig. 6).

### Clinical utility of autoantibodies in the diagnosis and management of myasthenia gravis [^113PWWs2]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterised by fatigable muscle weakness. The disease is caused by autoantibodies targeting components of the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, which are identifiable in 90% of cases. The most well-known and best-characterised of these is acetylcholine-receptor (AChR) antibody, which is present in approximately 50% of ocular and 85% of generalised MG patients. Other recognised pathogenic autoantibodies in MG target muscle specific kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein-receptor related protein 4 (LRP4), present in approximately 5–10% and 1–5% of MG cases respectively. Some autoantibodies are not directly pathogenic but inform disease severity and thymic status. Many other autoantibodies are described in MG, although their pathogenic role and clinical significance is yet to be determined. These include autoantibodies targeting COLQ, cortactin, rapsyn, AChE, and Kv1.4. In this review, we discuss the clinical utility of all autoantibodies implicated in MG to date, including their role in the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of the disease.

New best practice guidelines have been released in the past 2 years which address ocular and generalised MG as well as pregnancy in MG. Key points are summarised in Box 2. An important message for expectant mothers is that birth plans should aim for a hospital delivery as babies are at risk of transient neonatal MG irrespective of the mother's disease status. Therefore, home births and midwife-led units are not advised.

Literature search and development of evidence‐based statements

Search terms and strings were created to interrogate the questions developed using the PICO framework (Appendix, Table A2) and systematic literature searches, based on Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, were conducted under the supervision of the Sub‐committee (Figure 1). Trained medical writers performed the literature search: two writers independently performed the systematic review using the search strings, and a third writer independently adjudicated any discrepancies. The writers assessed the level of evidence for each question using the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐based Medicine (OCEM) criteria, and presented these to the Sub‐committee in a report which summarised the literature review results and highlighted key findings for each question, study limitations and knowledge gaps. The Sub‐committee were provided with full access to all the results and a review meeting was held during which they discussed the evidence alongside their own expert opinions and clinical experience to direct development of draft consensus statements. These were refined by the authors in a follow‐up review meeting, prior to being sent for voting.

### Reply to letter in response to rethinking the diagnosis of double-seronegative myasthenia gravis [^113gHZPD]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

We wish to thank Drs. Seok, Kim, Eun, and Lee for their valuable comments about our recently published original article "Clinical Characteristics and Treatment Outcomes in Patients with Double‐Seronegative Myasthenia Gravis". We are very glad to see that our paper is stimulating further discussion on the topic of patients without detectable antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and muscle‐specific kinase. The authors correctly point out that we found a significant clinical improvement in double‐seronegative myasthenia gravis (dSNMG) patients in the last clinical evaluation, based on the Myasthenia Gravis Impairment Index and Single Simple Question scores strongly suggesting an immune‐based mechanism and the benefit of immunotherapy in this group of patients.

dSNMG represents a heterogeneous group, and the diagnosis is challenging and commonly based on the clinical presentation and progression. It is fundamental to exclude differential diagnoses such as congenital myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophies, or other disorders of neuromuscular transmission. The authors think that the electrophysiological findings based on single fiber electromyography and repetitive nerve stimulation are essential in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). There are additional complementary diagnosis tests for MG, for example, the edrophonium and neostigmine tests, which can be reliable, but are rarely used in clinical practice. Therefore, we did not use these tests as an inclusion criterion in our study. We agree fully with Seok et al. that patients who have refractory seronegative MG should be extensively reviewed for the possibility of alternate diagnoses, although we understand that refractoriness alone does not exclude a diagnosis, as seropositive MG patients can be refractory to treatment.

### Autoimmune myasthenia gravis: emerging clinical and biological heterogeneity [^115wFo9Z]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction in which patients experience fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that often affects selected muscle groups preferentially. The target of the autoimmune attack in most cases is the skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR), but in others, non-AChR components of the neuromuscular junction, such as the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, are targeted. The pathophysiological result is muscle endplate dysfunction and consequent fatigable muscle weakness. Clinical presentations vary substantially, both for anti-AChR positive and negative MG, and accurate diagnosis and selection of effective treatment depends on recognition of less typical as well as classic disease phenotypes. Accumulating evidence suggests that clinical MG subgroups might respond differently to treatment. In this Review, we provide current information about the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of MG, including emerging therapeutic strategies.

### Complement inhibitors for myasthenia gravis in adults [^112jJ9Yf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease classification

Myasthenia gravis can be classified by disease onset (early versus late), although there is considerable clinical overlap between the two categories. Early‐onset disease (people under 45 years of age) is more common in women. It is thought to result from an overactive immune system, and these people typically have thymic hyperplasia (enlargement of the thymus). Late‐onset disease (people over 45 years of age) is more common in men. The mechanism of autoantibody development is thought to differ from early‐onset disease, with loss of immune tolerance, resulting in a loss of the ability of the immune system to recognise molecules of the body as self.

Myasthenia gravis can also be classified by clinical phenotype; these are the observable characteristics of a disease, such as the symptoms experienced by the affected people, or the clinical signs observed by the clinician when they examine the patient, or both. Myasthenia gravis presents as either an ocular or generalised disease. In ocular myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness is limited to the eyelids and the extraocular muscles (muscles around the eyes). In generalised myasthenia gravis, the weakness involves a variety of different muscle groups, including ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and limb muscles. While most people with ocular myasthenia gravis eventually develop generalised myasthenia gravis, some people have a milder disease form that remains restricted to the ocular muscles. Although the disease process is similar between ocular and generalised myasthenia gravis, the two phenotypes (sets of observable characteristics or traits of an organism) can vary in their sensitivity to diagnostic tests and response to treatment.

Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS)

Decremental conduction in myasthenia gravis

RNS (previously called Jolly test, after German neurologist Friedrich Jolly who first described this test) is more sensitive than anti-AChR antibody tests. RNS is typically performed by stimulating a nerve at 2–5 Hz and recording the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from the corresponding muscle at rest and after stimulation, to look for any decrement, and after 10–15 s of exercise to look for any facilitation. A 10% reduction in the CMAP amplitude comparing the first with the fourth or fifth CMAP in a train has traditionally been accepted as indicative of myasthenia. The two issues that are relevant to the interpretation of the sensitivity of the RNS are the cut-off for determining a positive test and the choice of the nerve-muscle pair analysed. The other issues are patient discomfort and technical difficulty, and we will discuss this further.

### The association between anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody level and clinical improvement in myasthenia gravis [^114fxerv]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In myasthenia gravis (MG), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is one of the targets for autoantibodies. MG is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease featuring fluctuating muscle weakness and exhaustion worsening upon exertion. In MG, one of the pathological mechanisms in anti‐AChR‐positive patients is the loss of postsynaptic AChR due to anti‐AChR antibodies (ab). The decrease of functional AChR at the endplate leads to less binding of acetylcholine, which results in muscle weakness. Depending on the affected muscle groups, MG is more defined in ocular MG (diplopia and ptosis), bulbar MG (dysarthria and dysphagia), or generalized MG (muscle weakness to the limbs and neck). MG has high morbidity when treated inadequately. Serum anti‐AChR‐ab are present in 90% of patients with generalized MG and in 50% of patients with ocular MG. One in 10 patients with MG develops a thymoma, and vice versa, one in four patients with a thymoma have MG. The presence of anti‐AChR‐ab is found in most patients with thymomatous MG.

In clinical practice, the majority of anti‐AChR‐ab analyses are used to confirm the diagnosis of MG. Although MG is considered a life‐long autoimmune disease, there is no consensus on the use of anti‐AChR‐ab during the years of follow‐up. Previously, multiple studies have been performed on this topic. Some of these studies reported a significant association between change in anti‐AChR‐ab serum levels and clinical severity, especially after thymectomy or when patients used immunosuppressants. Other studies did not report a significant association, but these studies did not have consistent follow‐up durations, there was differential use of serial dilutions in the assay kit, or they included a relatively small number of patients.

Anti‐AChR‐ab are measured with a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIA). The sensitivity and specificity are high at 87% and 100%, respectively. For follow‐up of MG patients, quantitative values of the anti‐AChR‐ab level are essential and this often requires serial dilutions due to the restricted measuring range of both enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and RIA.

The primary aim of this retrospective study was to analyse the longitudinal association between reduction in serum anti‐AChR‐ab levels and clinical symptoms, using a clinically relevant follow‐up duration and the most accurate assay kit available, with inclusion of a substantial number of patients.

### Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in tear for the diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis [^1159sDsd]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) significantly affects patients' quality of life. However, conventional serum assays often fail to detect anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies in more than half of OMG cases, complicating accurate diagnosis. Given the immunological role of tears in the ocular environment, they may serve as a viable alternative for antibody detection. This study investigates the utility of tear-based anti-AChR antibody detection as a diagnostic tool for OMG and compares its performance with that of serum-based cell-based assays (CBAs).

Design

Prospective diagnostic testing validity evaluation.

Methods

A total of 65 participants were enrolled, including 52 patients diagnosed with OMG and 13 healthy controls. Anti-AChR antibodies were assessed in both serum and tear samples using CBAs. Diagnostic performance metrics were compared between the 2 sample types, and correlations between antibody levels and clinical severity were analyzed.

Results

Tear-based CBA demonstrated significantly superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.926, P < .0001) compared to serum-based CBA (AUC = 0.656, P = 0.0836). The sensitivity of tear CBA was 80.8% (95% CI: 68.1%-89.2%), markedly higher than that of serum CBA at 42.3% (95% CI: 29.9%-55.8%). Among the 42 seronegative OMG patients, 83.3% tested positive using tear CBA, whereas only 40.5% were positive via serum CBA (P < .0001). Notably, tear anti-AChR antibody levels did not show a consistent correlation with symptom severity.

Conclusions

Tear-based detection of anti-AChR antibodies offers a non-invasive, highly sensitive diagnostic approach for OMG, particularly beneficial in cases where serum tests are negative. This method holds promise for improving early diagnosis and clinical decision-making in OMG management.

### Myasthenia gravis: subgroup classification and therapeutic strategies [^116Whhje]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that is characterised by muscle weakness and fatigue, is B-cell mediated, and is associated with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with myasthenia gravis should be classified into subgroups to help with therapeutic decisions and prognosis. Subgroups based on serum antibodies and clinical features include early-onset, late-onset, thymoma, MUSK, LRP4, antibody-negative, and ocular forms of myasthenia gravis. Agrin-associated myasthenia gravis might emerge as a new entity. The prognosis is good with optimum symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment. Pyridostigmine is the preferred symptomatic treatment, and for patients who do not adequately respond to symptomatic therapy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and thymectomy are first-line immunosuppressive treatments. Additional immunomodulatory drugs are emerging, but therapeutic decisions are hampered by the scarcity of controlled studies. Long-term drug treatment is essential for most patients and must be tailored to the particular form of myasthenia gravis.

### Myasthenia gravis: a clinical-immunological update [^1136yrMg]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This paper has reviewed a number of evolving areas in GMG. In particular, patient diagnosis and management will improve as the pool of 'seronegative' MG decreases. However, care should be taken to establish the pathogenicity of newly identified antibodies. It is likely the field of IgG4-mediated disease will continue to gain scientific momentum.

More work is required to understand the phenomenon of increasing incidence of LOMG, with elderly patients posing a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Within the next 12 months, the results of the MGTX trial may answer one of the longest-standing questions in MG, namely, the role of thymectomy in non-thymomatous disease.

### Clinical features and diagnostic usefulness of antibodies to clustered acetylcholine receptors in the diagnosis of seronegative myasthenia gravis [^114HP1ku]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cell-based assays (CBAs) were shown to improve detection of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Herein, we asked whether these assays were able to help determine the diagnosis in patients studied in routine clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic usefulness of CBAs in the diagnosis of MG and to compare the clinical features of patients with antibodies only to clustered AChRs with those of patients with seronegative MG (SNMG).

Design, Setting, and Participants

All patients with clinical suspicion of MG who were seen within the Division of Clinical Neurology at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, between November 1, 2009, and November 30, 2013. Their serum antibodies and clinical features were studied.

Exposures

Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) and CBA were used to test for standard AChR antibodies and antibodies to clustered AChRs in 138 patients. All available samples from patients with SNMG were retrospectively tested for lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) antibodies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Demographic, clinical, neurophysiological, and laboratory data.

Results

In total, 138 patients were tested for antibodies to clustered AChRs, and 42 had a final diagnosis of MG. The clustered AChR CBA detected antibodies in 38.1% (16 of 42) of RIPA-negative patients with MG with 100% specificity. All patients with SNMG who were tested for LRP4 antibodies (21 of 26) were negative by CBA. Compared with patients with SNMG, patients with antibodies only to clustered AChRs had frequent prepubertal onset (62.5% [median age, 6 years; age range, 1–52 years] vs 11.5% [median age, 38 years; age range, 2–72 years], P ≤ .05), high prevalence of ocular MG (62.5% vs 42.3%), milder disease severity with less bulbar involvement (25.0% vs 46.2%), and absence of respiratory symptoms (0% vs 23.1%). Response to treatment and prognosis was good, with a reduced need for thymectomy (6.3% vs 19.2%) and a high proportion of patients going into remission (50.0% vs 8.3%, P ≤ .05). These observations also apply to the classic AChR MG phenotype seen in large series.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cell-based assay is a useful procedure in the routine diagnosis of RIPA-negative MG, particularly in children. Patients with antibodies only to clustered AChRs appear to be younger and have milder disease than other patients with MG. These observations will have implications in planning treatment.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^111YD3uZ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission. The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. MG may either occur as an autoimmune disease with distinct immunogenetic characteristics or as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with tumors of the thymus. Impairment of central thymic and peripheral self-tolerance mechanisms in both cases is thought to favor an autoimmune CD4(+) T cell-mediated B cell activation and synthesis of pathogenic high-affinity autoantibodies of either the IgG1 and 3 or IgG4 subclass. These autoantibodies bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) itself, or muscle-specific tyrosine-kinase (MuSK), lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) and agrin involved in clustering of AchRs within the postsynaptic membrane and structural maintenance of the neuromuscular synapse. This results in disturbance of neuromuscular transmission and thus clinical manifestation of the disease. Emphasizing evidence from clinical trials, we provide an updated overview on immunopathogenesis, and derived current and future treatment strategies for MG divided into: (a) symptomatic treatments facilitating neuromuscular transmission, (b) antibody-depleting treatments, and

### Improving accuracy of myasthenia gravis autoantibody testing by reflex algorithm [^113Yu4bB]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To improve myasthenia gravis (MG) autoantibody testing.

Methods

MG serologic tests with confirmatory or refuting clinical-electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing and cancer evaluations were reviewed over 4 years (2012–2015). All patients had acetylcholine receptor-binding (AChR-Bi), modulating (AChR-Mo), and striational (STR) autoantibody testing, and negatives reflexed to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). Thymoma and cancer occurrences were correlated with STR and reflexed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (α3), collapsin response mediating protein-5, and voltage-gated potassium channel complex autoantibodies.

Results

Of 433 samples tested, 133 (31%) met clinical-EDX criteria for MG. Best sensitivity (90%) occurred at AChR-Bi > 0.02 nmol/L, leaving 14 negative (6 ocular MG, 7 generalized MG, 1 MuSK MG) with specificity 90% (31 false-positives). Using AChR-Mo antibodies (> 20% loss), specificity was better (92%, 24 false-positives), but sensitivity dropped (85%). Specificity improved (95%) by testing AChR-Mo when AChR-Bi are positive, resulting in 45% reduction of false-positives (31–17), maintaining AChR-Bi 90% sensitivity. Cutoff values recommended by area under the curve analysis did not outperform this approach. AChR-Bi and AChR-Mo values were significantly higher in true-positives. CT evaluations in 121 MG samples revealed 16 thymomas. Historical or subsequent cancers occurred in 22. STR and reflexed autoantibodies were not more common in MG with thymoma or other cancers. Full-body CT (n = 34) was performed in those with STR and reflex autoantibody positivity, but without additional cancers found.

Conclusion

Accuracy of MG serologic testing is improved by reflexing AChR-Bi-positive cases to AChR-Mo. STR and other reflexed cancer evaluation autoantibodies did not provide value beyond standard CT chest imaging at the time of MG diagnosis. Diagnostic certainty is informed by AChR-Bi and AChR-Mo with higher values increasing specificity.

### Bedside and laboratory diagnostic testing in myasthenia [^113dgqdH]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Provocative tests

Provocative tests with quinine or curare are of historical importance only and are not used in clinical practice. The neostigmine test (NT) and edrophonium (tensilon) test are rarely performed in the United Kingdom but are still used in other countries. Although there are several variations of the edrophonium test, the first published protocol was 2 mg initial dose intravenously followed, if no adverse reaction (usually cholinergic side effects) occurred in 45 s, by the administration of an additional 8 mg. One cohort study of the tensilon test reported a sensitivity of 92% for ocular myasthenia and 88% for generalised myasthenia. Specificity was 97% for both types of myasthenia. No statistically significant differences have been found in the edrophonium test results between MuSK antibody-positive and MuSK antibody-negative patients. However, like RNS studies and SFEMG, edrophonium responsiveness is not necessarily diagnostic of MG.

NT is claimed to have a better safety profile when testing patients with MG compared to edrophonium, as the latter can cause serious bradyarrhythmias and syncope as well as respiratory failure, although the incidence of these complications is very low. One study involving 47 patients showed the sensitivity of NT to be 83% and specificity to be 97%. An improvement in clinical symptoms in response to NT (0.5 mg neostigmine administered intramuscularly), could be used as supporting evidence for the diagnosis of MG. However, this improvement can be better detected using SFEMG compared to clinical examinations only. A study involving 23 patients revealed SFEMG could better detect subclinical improvement in ocular MG than clinical MG-composite scale. The MCD and potential pairs with increased jitter significantly improved after NT compared to basal conditions.

While the NT is claimed to have higher positivity than anti-AChR antibodies and RNS studies, neither intra-arterial nor intra-venous NT are commonly used in clinical practice. Edrophonium which is a reversible anti-acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with a short half-life (distribution half-life is 7 to 12 min) had replaced neostigmine (mean half-life of 52 min) for diagnostic testing. However, since 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has discontinued edrophonium ® as a test for myasthenia, due to its high rate of false-positives and as a result it is no longer commercially marketed in the United States for this purpose.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^113WBMBw]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

This is a retrospective multi-center cohort study. Clinical data and serum samples of adult patients with a high index of suspicion for anti-AChR Ab-negative generalized MG were collected from 26 general hospitals in South Korea between January 2014 and January 2019. Data were entered into a standard case report form designed to record the clinical and laboratory features of the patients. Seronegative generalized MG was diagnosed based on 1) the clinical diagnosis of generalized MG, i.e. the presence of exertional weakness which may affect ocular, limb, axial, bulbar or respiratory muscles but not confined to ocular muscles, and 2) negative result for anti-AChR Ab by RIPA. The results of ancillary diagnostic tests such as low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and pharmacological test (e.g. neostigmine) may support the diagnosis of MG, but the absence of abnormalities does not rule out the diagnosis considering their low sensitivity in MuSK MG.

Collected data were reviewed and assessed for inclusion by two authors (YN Kwon, YH Hong). If there is diagnostic uncertainty, additional data on the disease course and treatment response during clinical follow-up of at least 6 months were requested, and the final diagnosis was reassessed. Disease severity was evaluated by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification and the Myasthenia Gravis composite scale (MGCS). The ocular form at onset was defined as purely ocular manifestations within one month after the symptom onset. Patients with a final diagnosis other than MG in the initial cohort and those with AChR Ab-positive MG were used as disease control to evaluate the specificity of MuSK-ELISA test.

Serum samples were stored at − 80 °C at the central laboratory of the Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Medical Center. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of Seoul National University, Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Medical Center (IRB 16–2014–29). All patients provided written informed consents.

### Concordance between radioimmunoassay and fixed cell-based assay in subjects without myasthenia gravis: optimizing the diagnostic approach [^116gQ4dq]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, a multicenter, prospective, double‐blind study compared the accuracy of diagnostic assays in myasthenia gravis. F‐CBA showed 11.3% increased sensitivity with 97.8% specificity in AChR‐Ab detection compared with RIA (cutoff for positivity = 0.5 nmol/L). Mirian et al. found 4% increased sensitivity with 99% specificity for F‐CBA versus RIA. Our study underlines the importance of testing for AChR‐Abs only when clinical features suggestive of MG are detected. However, in real‐world clinical practice, diagnostic tests are not always requested by MG experts. Our findings suggest that F‐CBA may be performed as an additional tool to increase diagnostic accuracy when clinical presentation and electrodiagnostic studies are deemed atypical for MG. Of late, improved recognition of MG has facilitated earlier diagnosis and contributed to an apparent increase in disease prevalence. However, this also entails the risk of MG overdiagnosis.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that AChR detection by F‐CBA may offer greater specificity for identifying pathogenic AChR‐Abs compared to RIA. Future research should investigate whether these likely nonpathogenic Abs bind to intracellular epitopes of the AChR or to other antigens complexed with the receptor.

### Therapeutic strategies targeting complement in myasthenia gravis patients [^115ZGi8q]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by impaired neuromuscular junction transmission, leading to fluctuating muscle weakness. With the progressive identification of MG-related antibodies, such as acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies, coupled with advancements in antibody detection technology, the use of these diagnostic markers has become widely accessible in clinical practice. This has facilitated the detection of key biomarkers and enabled the study of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing the underlying production of MG pathogenic antibodies and their various stages of pathogenicity. Among the emerging therapeutic strategies, complement-targeting drugs have garnered significant attention from medical researchers because of their ability to reduce complement activation and inhibit autoimmune-mediated tissue damage. Inhibition of the terminal complement cascade has demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease severity and improving clinical outcomes, particularly in refractory cases of MG. This review summarizes the underlying mechanisms of complement activation in MG, evaluates the current therapeutic landscape, including both approved and investigational complement inhibitors and discusses the safety considerations of their application.

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^111F7Q62]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A good proportion of patients with MG will present to the eye clinic with ptosis and double vision. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis and the bedside tests as well as neurophysiological and immunological tests which will aid the diagnosis. A stepwise approach to diagnosis and treatment with clinical clues to looks out for impending myasthenic crisis is shown in Fig. 4. Traditional treatments with cholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids and steroid sparing immunosuppressants are still the mainstay in the management of vast majority of patients with MG. However, ophthalmologists would need to be aware of the vast array of newer treatments which are being used in MG and where possible, work in collaboration with specialist neuroimmunology clinics.

Anti-nicotinic AChR antibodies (Anti-nAChR antibodies), Repetitive Nerve Stimulation (RNS) and Neostigmine test are used for diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). We compared their diagnostic agreement in a cohort of 486 MG patients over a period of ten years. Anti-nAChR antibodies, RNS and Neostigmine test showed positivity of 57.36%, 51.78%, and 93.4% respectively in ocular myasthenia and 93.77%, 82.35%, and 97.92% respectively in generalized myasthenia group. Neostigmine test showed higher positivity than anti-nAChR antibodies and RNS test in both groups. A marginal to fair agreement was observed between these tests highlighting their significance in the diagnosis of the disease.

### Advances in the diagnosis of neuromuscular junction disorders [^117GLyBw]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of the neuromuscular junction have a wide range of clinical presentations, which frequently poses a diagnostic challenge to evaluating clinicians. This article describes the tests used in the diagnosis of diseases of the neuromuscular junction, reviews the evidence supporting the use of each test, and proposes guidelines for their efficient utilization. A focused review of the literature was employed. Reports from four main categories of diagnostic tests (pharmacologic, electrodiagnostic, immunologic, and miscellaneous tests) were reviewed, and the sensitivity and specificity of each test in the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular junction diseases were examined. The clinical presentation determines which diagnostic tests should be utilized in individual cases of suspected neuromuscular junction disease. However, knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of each test can help to focus the diagnostic evaluation and maximize the diagnostic yield of each test.

### Testing for acetylcholine receptor and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies by fixed cell-based assay in clinical practice: positive predictive value for myasthenia gravis [^112LyDZk]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder that is most often mediated by antibodies against the muscle‐type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle‐specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Testing for anti‐AChR and anti‐MuSK is a cornerstone of the diagnostic evaluation for MG. Although highly sensitive and specific live cell‐based assays (CBAs) can be used to detect these antibodies, their costly and time‐consuming nature restricts their use to specialized centres. Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) is the historical gold standard for the detection of these autoantibodies in clinical practice; however, fixed CBAs have recently become available that appear to have overall higher sensitivity than RIPA, while maintaining excellent specificity that is reported to be between 98% and > 99% across studies. Preliminary data suggest that fixed CBA testing can even help reconcile rare false positive anti‐AChR RIPA results in patients without symptoms of MG, further supporting its high specificity. These findings have spurred the development of diagnostic algorithms for autoantibody detection in suspected MG that list fixed CBA as a first‐line testing option, which is likely to generate broader interest in the use of this assay due to its relative ease of implementation compared to live CBA. Yet, it bears emphasizing that CBAs with high but imperfect specificity for autoimmune neurologic disease can have lower‐than‐anticipated positive predictive value (PPV) in clinical practice, where testing may be ordered in low‐probability scenarios. This is exemplified by CBAs for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody detection; while initial work found their specificity to be ≥ 98%, studies examining their diagnostic performance in clinical practice have reported their PPV to be as low as 72%. Investigations into newly introduced CBAs that focus on PPV, which is a practically useful measure that reflects the probability that a patient with a positive result truly has the disease of interest, can therefore be immensely informative to test interpretation in clinical practice. For this reason, we examined the PPV of anti‐AChR/MuSK fixed CBA testing for MG at our centre, which implemented fixed CBA as first‐line testing for anti‐AChR/MuSK in November 2021.

### Myasthenia gravis in conjunction with Graves' disease: a diagnostic challenge [^1174gNWy]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an association between Graves' disease and myasthenia gravis and discuss the clinical features and laboratory tests that may help distinguish these two diseases.

Methods

The clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiologic findings in a patient with Graves' disease and myasthenia gravis are presented.

Results

A 28-year-old African American man was admitted to the University of Louisville Hospital with generalized muscle weakness, exophthalmos, diplopia, weight loss, and mild dysphagia. The diagnosis of Graves' disease with ophthalmologic involvement was suspected clinically and confirmed by an undetectable thyrotropin level (< 0.03 mIU/mL), high total thyroxine (20.5 mg/dL), and increased homogeneous 123I thyroid uptake. Because of the generalized muscle weakness and mild dysphagia, assessment was done by a neurology team, and severe thyrotoxic myopathy was diagnosed. He was treated with 131I and b-adrenergic blocking agents and scheduled for follow-up as an outpatient. Two weeks later, the patient presented in acute respiratory failure. The neurology team was reconsulted because of suspected myasthenic crisis. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were undetectable in the serum, and computed tomography of the chest showed no thymic enlargement. Repetitive nerve stimulation testing, however, showed findings consistent with an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction. The patient responded dramatically to an anticholinesterase agent and corticosteroids.

Conclusion

The overlapping clinical features may cause diagnostic confusion when myasthenia gravis and Graves' disease coexist, and numerous tests may be needed to distinguish these two conditions, which have differing treatments and prognoses.

### Myasthenia gravis and crisis: evaluation and management in the emergency department [^117HWx3u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an uncommon autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction and manifesting as muscle weakness. A multitude of stressors can exacerbate MG. When symptoms are exacerbated, muscle weakness can be severe enough to result in respiratory failure, a condition known as myasthenic crisis (MC).

Objective

This review discusses risk factors, diagnosis, management, and iatrogenic avoidance of MC.

Discussion

MC can affect any age, ethnicity, or sex and can be precipitated with any stressor, infection being the most common. MC is a clinical diagnosis defined by respiratory failure caused by exacerbation of MG. Muscle weakness can involve any voluntary muscle. MC can be differentiated from other neuromuscular junction diseases by the presence of normal reflexes, normal sensation, lack of autonomic symptoms, lack of fasciculations, and worsening weakness with repetitive motion. Treatment should target the inciting event and airway support. All acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be avoided in crisis, including edrophonium testing and corticosteroids initially. Respiratory support can begin with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, as this has been successful even in patients with bulbar weakness. If intubation is necessary, consider avoiding paralytics or use a reduced dose of nondepolarizing agents.

Conclusions

MC should be in the differential of any patient with muscular weakness and respiratory compromise. Emergency department management of MC should focus on ruling out infection and respiratory support. Strong consideration should be given to beginning with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for ventilatory support. Corticosteroids, depolarizing paralytics, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be avoided in patients with MC in the emergency department.

### Prognosis of ocular myasthenia gravis: retrospective multicenter analysis [^112NLigC]. Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To calculate the rate and timing of conversion from ocular myasthenia gravis to generalized myasthenia gravis.

Design

Retrospective multicenter analysis.

Subjects

Patients included in the study were diagnosed with ocular myasthenia gravis without the presence of generalized disease at onset.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis. We reviewed charts of 158 patients who met diagnostic criteria for ocular myasthenia gravis. Patients were divided into 2 subgroups: an immunosuppressant treatment group and a nonimmunosuppressant treatment group. Timing of conversion to generalized disease and duration of follow-up also was evaluated. Additional data such as clinical symptoms at presentation, laboratory test results, and chest imaging results also were recorded.

Main Outcome Measures

Conversion rates to generalized myasthenia at 2 years, effect of immunosuppression on conversion, and timing of conversion.

Results

The 158-patient cohort included 76 patients who received immunosuppressant therapy; the remaining 82 patients did not. The overall conversion rate to generalized disease was 20.9%. At 2 years, generalized myasthenia developed in 8 of 76 patients in the treated group and in 15 of 82 patients in the nonimmunotherapy group (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–1.32). Median time for conversion to generalized disease was 20 months in the nonimmunosuppressant group and 24 months in the immunosuppressant group. Conversion occurred after 2 years of symptom onset in 30% of patients.

Conclusions

Conversion rates from ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis may be lower than previously reported both in immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed patients. A subset of patients may continue to convert to generalized disease beyond 2 years from onset of symptoms, and close monitoring should be continued.

### The clinical need for clustered AChR cell-based assay testing of seronegative MG [^113kmuPA]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Trial eligibility in myasthenia gravis (MG) remains largely dependent on a positive autoantibody serostatus. This significantly hinders seronegative MG (SNMG) patients from receiving potentially beneficial new treatments. In a subset of SNMG patients, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies are detectable by a clustered AChR cell-based assay (CBA). Of 99 SNMG patients from two academic U.S. centers, 18 (18.2%) tested positive by this assay. Autoantibody positivity was further validated in 17/18 patients. In a complementary experiment, circulating AChR-specific B cells were identified in a CBA-positive SNMG patient. These findings corroborate the clinical need for clustered AChR CBA testing when evaluating SNMG patients.

### Myasthenia gravis, respiratory function, and respiratory tract disease [^117WPLY2]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease where antibodies against the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction lead to muscle weakness. This muscle weakness is generalized in 80% of the patients, being localized to the ocular muscles in only 20%. Respiratory muscles can be involved, and also muscles important for laryngeal and pharyngeal function. Typical for MG muscle weakness is fluctuation over time and during the day. Repeated muscle use increases the weakness.

The MG autoantibodies are directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in 80% of the patients. Antibody binding activates complement and crosslinks the receptors, both mechanisms leading to AChR destruction and morphological changes with reduced folding in the postsynaptic membrane. 1–10% of the patients have instead antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), and a few have antibodies against lipoprotein-related peptide (LRP4). MuSK and LRP4 are associated with AChR in the neuromuscular junction, and these antibodies induce a reduced AChR function in the muscle membrane. At least half of the 15% of patients without muscle antibodies by routine testing have AChR, MuSK, or LRP4 antibodies with more sensitive tests.

MG has a prevalence around 250 per million in most countries and an annual incidence of 20 per million. MG subgroups are defined from autoantibody specificity and generalized versus symptoms. Age of onset and thymus pathology are additional criteria for the MG subgroups. A thymoma induces AChR antibodies and muscle weakness in 10% of the MG patients. Early-onset MG with debut before age 50 years and AChR antibodies typically have thymic hyperplasia, and surgical removal of thymus improves the muscle weakness. Juvenile MG with debut before age 16 years is rare in Europe and North America. In China and other Far East countries, there is a subgroup of patients with debut before age 5 years. This MG is usually mild, often ocular, respond well to treatment, and very rarely has any respiratory implications.

MG therapy includes symptomatic treatment with acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, thymectomy, immunosuppressive drug treatment, physical training, supportive therapy, treatment of comorbidities, and ventilatory support for severe cases. The majority respond well to treatment and have mild disease or are in pharmacological remission. However, 15–20% of MG patients are difficult to treat and continue to have moderate or even severe muscle weakness.

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^111sLHPH]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is one of the most well characterised autoimmune disorders affecting the neuromuscular junction with autoantibodies targeting the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) complex. The vast majority of patients present with ocular symptoms including double vision and ptosis, but may progress on to develop generalised fatiguable muscle weakness. Severe involvement of the bulbar muscles can lead to dysphagia, dysarthria and breathing difficulties which can progress to myasthenic crisis needing ventilatory support. Given the predominant ocular onset of the disease, it is important that ophthalmologists are aware of the differential diagnosis, investigations and management including evolving therapies. When the disease remains localised to the extraocular muscles (ocular MG) IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies against the AChR (including clustered AChR) are present in nearly 50% of patients. In generalised MG this is seen in nearly 90% patients. Other antibodies include those against muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and lipoprotein receptor related protein 4 (LRP4). Even though decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation is the most well recognised neurophysiological abnormality, single fibre electromyogram (SFEMG) in experienced hands is the most sensitive test which helps in the diagnosis. Initial treatment should be using cholinesterase inhibitors and then proceeding to immunosuppression using corticosteroids and steroid sparing drugs. Patients requiring bulbar muscle support may need rescue therapies including plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Newer therapeutic targets include those against the B lymphocytes, complement system, neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) and various other elements of the immune system.

### Bedside and laboratory diagnostic testing in myasthenia [^112DexFP]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

RNS showing ≥ 10% decrement has traditionally been used as the cut-off value for diagnosing MG, but this has never been validated, is subject to a sensitivity versus specificity trade-off, and is not specific to MG. Abraham et al. showed that using a decrement cut-off value of 7% for frontalis and 8% for nasalis increased the sensitivities by 6–11% while preserving specificity (95–96%).

Besides the cut-off value used, the results obtained from RNS studies may partly depend on which nerve and muscle pair is stimulated. While any superficial nerve can be tested in studying decremental conduction in MG, the choice of the nerve–muscle pair may depend on the type of MG. The abnormal response in RNS due to fatigability as expected is more widespread in generalised MG, whereas facial muscles are relatively more affected in ocular MG. Niks et al. reported that RNS of the nasalis muscle was more sensitive in oculobulbar MG (100% sensitivity) when compared to hypothenar muscles (20% sensitivity). On the other hand, in patients with generalised MG, using hypothenar muscles for RNS studies, had a similar yield compared to the nasalis muscle. In a retrospective study of 122 patients with MG and 182 controls, RNS sensitivities for generalised and ocular MG using the traditional ≥ 10% cut-off value were 46% and 15%, respectively, for frontalis muscle recordings, and 35% and 19%, respectively, for nasalis muscle recordings. To increase the diagnostic sensitivity of RNS in MG, bilateral exploration of at least 3 muscles, a facial muscle, trapezius, and anconeus, has been suggested. In one study of 22 patients with MG, by exploring 12 muscles bilaterally, the global sensitivity of RNS was increased to 82%, while specificity was 100%. The sensitivity in the MG subgroups is highest in generalised MG (89%) followed by oculobulbar MG (86%) and least sensitive in ocular MG (67%).

### Heterogeneity of acetylcholine receptor autoantibody-mediated complement activity in patients with myasthenia gravis [^117ECivL]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is anticipated that measuring AChR autoantibody–mediated pathogenesis will have clinical utility. The past decade has seen a considerable number of new and existing therapeutics become available for the treatment of MG. Included are biologics that directly target the autoantibody effector function (eculizumab and others). Clinical trials of these treatments have provided outcomes demonstrating benefits in some patients but unexpected failures in others, thus intensifying challenges to the field, including the need to target the correct therapy to patients from the growing number of options and the need to inform treatment decisions through understanding the immunopathology. Therapeutic complement inhibition provides one such example of our limited understanding of AChR MG immunomechanisms: it is unclear why eculizumab (approved for the treatment of generalized AChR MG) does not yield clinical benefit in some AChR autoantibody–positive patients, even with longer-term treatment. The AChR autoantibody titers of patients who responded to eculizumab treatment neither predicted treatment efficacy nor correlated with its progression. In addition to emphasizing the limitations of AChR autoantibody titer as a biomarker, these studies also underscore the need to further understand AChR autoantibody mechanisms so that response to treatments can be better predicted. Future experiments, which include testing samples from complement inhibitor trials, could be performed to investigate whether the complement CBA is valuable in forecasting response. To this end, we suggest a suite of clinical assays that measure the composition of AChR autoantibodies with variable pathogenic mechanisms will be valuable. These assays would ideally measure binding-only, classical complement activation as shown here, and modulating and blocking functions, which have been demonstrated with similar CBA platforms. These collective measurements may be useful for assessing disease progression and serve as an improved MG biomarker when compared with autoantibody binding. Thus, patients would be provided with the opportunity for a more individualized treatment plan that targets their unique autoantibody-mediated pathogenic pathways.

Management when MG/LEMS patients have already contracted COVID‑19 — continue usual care in mild disease; adjust for severe illness. Most patients have mild disease and should continue the current best practice standard of care for MG/LEMS. Corticosteroid doses might need to be increased per standard infection/stress protocols. If symptoms are severe with hospitalization, it may be necessary to consider pausing current immunosuppression temporarily, especially with concurrent infections or sepsis, and immune depleting agents should not be given under such conditions.

### Bedside and laboratory diagnostic testing in myasthenia [^115HnPSH]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity and specificity of different neurophysiological tests

While RNS, SFEMG and antibody tests all have their advantages and disadvantages, SFEMG is considered to have the highest sensitivity of all the tests when ordered for diagnostic purposes in both ocular and generalised MG, whereas RNS has the highest specificity amongst neurophysiological tests (Fig. 1). The sensitivity of CEMG (93%) is much higher when compared to RNS (77%) in diagnosing MG. Katzberg et al. found 19% of the patients in their study with MG had abnormal RNS, whereas 95% had abnormal SFEMG (n = 121).

Fig. 1
Sensitivities and specificities of various diagnostic tests for myasthenia

Prognostic value of neurophysiological tests

Both RNS and jitter analysis, in addition to their diagnostic utility, may also have a prognostic value as high jitter (> 100 μs) and decrement values (> 10%) are associated with more severe disease, manifested by more frequent symptomatic bulbar and limb muscle weakness and severe disease exacerbations. In contrast, serum concentrations of AChR antibodies do not relate with the clinical severity of MG.

### FcRn inhibitors for myasthenia gravis [^114omPiw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In some people with MG the development of the disease is due to abnormalities of the thymus, a gland that is involved in the development and monitoring of the immune system. A tumour of the thymus (known as a thymoma) is found in 15% of people with MG. Unlike thymic carcinoma (an aggressive cancer of the thymus gland), thymomas are usually slow growing and do not tend to spread from the thymus gland to other parts of the body. Treatment of people with MG and thymoma involves surgery to remove the thymoma, which can result in improvement in MG symptoms.

The clinical presentations of MG are grouped according to which areas of the body are affected. MG is typically classified as either ocular (eye involvement only) or generalised disease, where several areas of the body are affected (e.g. ocular, bulbar, respiratory and/or limb involvement). Some people with ocular MG will continue to have eye involvement only; however, most will progress to generalised MG during the course of the disease.

The approach to diagnosis in MG is multimodal and warrants evaluation by a specialist neurologist. Patients will require a clinical assessment, including a full history and examination to detect signs of fatigable weakness. Investigations will include serological (blood) testing for autoantibodies (namely AChR and MuSK), while neurophysiology (nerve tests) can be used to demonstrate a waning/decrement in the response of the muscles to repetitive stimulation. In all cases of suspected MG, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest should be done to check for a thymoma. Additional investigations (e.g. brain or spine imaging) may be warranted for patients with negative serology and neurophysiology testing, to rule out brain or spinal causes of muscle weakness.

An MG crisis is defined as a sudden worsening of MG symptoms that is life‐threatening and involves the respiratory muscles, which can result in the affected person requiring intubation and ventilation in an intensive care unit. People in MG crisis may be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, which comprises donated antibodies that can help dampen down the immune response) or plasma exchange (a process whereby the blood plasma, the part of the blood that contains antibodies, is removed and replaced). These therapies work within days to reduce the effects of autoantibodies, but are only effective for four to six weeks. Due to the potential risks, high cost, and low availability of these therapies, they are not suitable for long‐term therapy.

Biomarkers: toward precision treatment in MG

While a number of exploratory biomarkers are under investigation (Table 2), most remain distant from clinical use. For example, despite significant research activity and some emerging profiles (Table 2), circulating miRNAs would still require multicenter laboratory standardization and studies to gain credence. The biomarkers most studied and proximal to clinical utility are the circulating immune cell repertoire and the humoral response itself. Indeed, B cell subsets are routinely measured in clinical practice in conjunction with Rituximab use, and IgG levels and immune cell characterization are incorporated in recent and in-progress trial designs. Genetic polymorphisms may predict response to some therapies, for example, fragment c gamma receptor 3A (FCGR3A) polymorphisms are established as impacting on-Rituximab relapses and a re-dosing requirement in Korean patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Similarly, a mis-sense mutation in C5 (c.2654G > A, conferring a p. Arg885His polymorphism), was found to abolish Eculizumab binding and underlie poor response to Eculizumab in Japanese and Chinese patients.

A retrospective analysis of ICI-related myasthenia gravis reported serological positivity rates by anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and anti-MuSK antibodies of 66.7% (30/45) and 5.3% (1/19), respectively. Patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 ICIs are at greater risk of developing myasthenia gravis than those treated with anti-CTLA-4 ICIs. The standard of care for myasthenia gravis includes IVIG and plasma exchange (PLEX), and in autoimmune myasthenia gravis also includes high-dose pulse corticosteroids.

Ophthalmologic signs are the most often presenting symptoms of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), most common being ptosis. However, ptosis may be caused by a variety of non-myasthenic disorders; hence, the distinction between them and myasthenic ptosis is critical. A battery of diagnostic tests are available to establish the diagnosis of MG, all having their pros and cons, some being life threatening. The authors present a case of 40-year-old male who presented to them with progressive weakness and double vision in which they were successful in narrowing the differentials to myasthenia by performing a simple bed side test.

Arch Neurol. 1986; 43: 842–843. doi: 10.1001/archneur.1986.00520080080028 The Tensilon test is a frequently used and frequently useful office test for myasthenia gravis. The main controversies concerning the test are the reasons for administering it and the style in which it is administered. Tensilon testing is useful as a diagnostic test for ocular MG but not as a means of adjusting medical treatment for this condition. Myasthenic extraocular muscles, especially the eyelids, usually respond dramatically in the untreated patient. Similarly, ocular movement, although often not restored completely to normal, is generally improved with the administration of Tensilon. In contrast, Tensilon administration as a means of judging drug dosage is far less useful.

The real question with therapy in ocular MG is not whether the eyes will wiggle a little bit more with an intravenous cholinesterase inhibitor but whether a satisfactory response to oral cholinesterase inhibitors can be achieved.

### Classification of myasthenia gravis based on autoantibody status… [^1123nKDV]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Severity of myasthenia gravis, stratified according to the presence of MG-related autoantibodies. Disease severity was graded from 0 to 5 according to the system proposed by the Task Force of the Medical Advisory Board of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America. Differences between 2 groups were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. © 2025 Objectives To investigate the autoantibody status of patients with myasthenia gravis and to evaluate its usefulness for disease classification. Design Retrospective cohort study of patients with MG, who have autoantibodies to receptors and ion channels expressed at neuromuscular junctions and in muscles that impair neuromuscular transmission. One of the autoantibodies studied was a recently identified, novel, MG-specific autoantibody to a voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.
4. Setting Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, and Iwate Medical University Hospital, Morioka. Patients Two hundred nine patients with MG.

Main Outcome Measures Anti-Kv1. 4 antibody was measured by an immunoprecipitation assay with sulfur 35–labeled extract from rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Antititin antibody was detected with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Anti–acetylcholine receptor, anti-Kv1. 4, and antititin antibodies were detected in 150, 26, and 50 of the 209 patients with MG, respectively. All of the patients who were positive for anti-Kv1. 4 or antititin antibody were seropositive for the anti–acetylcholine receptor antibody. In addition, patients with MG in the anti-Kv1. 4 group had more severe manifestations of disease than those in the other 3 groups. Conclusion Classification of patients with MG based on autoantibody status may be useful in defining clinical subsets. All blood samples and clinical information were obtained after the patients had given their informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review boards of each hospital.

Statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software program. Categorical variables were compared by the χ2 test. Continuous variables were compared by analysis of variance. Disease severity was compared by the Mann-Whitney test. P <. 05 was considered significant.
