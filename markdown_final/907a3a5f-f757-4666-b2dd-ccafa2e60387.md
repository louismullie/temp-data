## Question

What is the recommended age range for the use of antihistamines in pediatric patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended age range for antihistamine use in pediatric patients, distinguishing second-generation from first-generation agents and integrating regulatory, guideline, and safety data. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic classes and their safety profiles. Then, I should verify FDA-labeled pediatric ages for specific second-generation agents. Next, I will review guideline statements on age ranges for allergic rhinitis and urticaria. After that, I need to examine safety signals for first-generation agents, especially seizure risk in infants. I will then consider special populations and formulations, including intranasal and IV cetirizine. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, age-stratified recommendation and highlight key caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic distinction because it frames the age recommendations. Second-generation H1-antihistamines (e.g., cetirizine, levocetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine, bilastine, rupatadine) have minimal CNS penetration and a better safety profile than first-generation agents, which cross the blood–brain barrier and carry higher risks of sedation, anticholinergic effects, and neurotoxicity, particularly in young children; guidelines consistently prefer second-generation agents for pediatric allergic disease management [^114WbNnf] [^112cBa3E].

> I need to check the FDA-labeled pediatric ages for second-generation agents to anchor the lower bound. Cetirizine oral solution is labeled down to 6 months for perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, with safety data in infants 6–11 months and extrapolation of efficacy from older populations; the label notes safety and effectiveness under 6 months have not been established, so I should not assume use below 6 months is appropriate without specialist input [^115jBQv2] [^117GrANP]. Levocetirizine is labeled from 6 months for perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, supported by pediatric PK and safety studies down to 6 months, with dose adjustments to avoid excessive exposure in younger children [^117B5oM7] [^112soyzv]. Fexofenadine is labeled from 6 months for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, again with pediatric PK and safety data informing dosing down to 6 months [^116FxoGR]. Loratadine and desloratadine are generally labeled from 2 years in many jurisdictions, aligning with common practice parameters and dosing tables, though I should confirm local labeling when prescribing [^1133vbLT] [^1122aHpj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all agents; I should verify intranasal and IV formulations separately. Intranasal antihistamines such as azelastine and olopatadine are approved from 6 years for allergic rhinitis, reflecting both efficacy and tolerability considerations in school-aged children, so they are not appropriate for infants and toddlers [^113MpH9P]. For acute urticaria in supervised settings, IV cetirizine (Quzyttir) is indicated from 6 months, with explicit caution to avoid use in children under 6 years with renal or hepatic impairment, which I need to screen for before ordering [^111gpi7Z] [^112U6AaT] [^111zqYYV].

> Next, I should review guideline consensus to ensure my interpretation aligns with best practice. The Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter notes that most pharmacologic treatments for allergic rhinitis are approved for children down to age 5 years, and many down to age 2 years or even younger, while emphasizing dose adjustment and attention to adverse effects; this supports the FDA positions for cetirizine, levocetirizine, and fexofenadine at 6 months and loratadine/desloratadine from 2 years in many regions [^1177BnkU]. For urticaria, contemporary dermatology-oriented guidance similarly supports second-generation agents as first-line in children, with specific products listed as usable from 6 months (cetirizine, ketotifen in some markets) or 2 years (levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, ebastine), reinforcing the same age stratification [^1122aHpj].

> I will now examine safety signals for first-generation antihistamines because these drive strong age-related cautions. Multiple high-credibility cohort analyses show a 22% higher seizure risk associated with first-generation antihistamine prescriptions, with the strongest signal in children aged 6–24 months; mechanistic hypotheses include immature BBB, underdeveloped metabolic pathways, and incomplete myelination, all of which heighten vulnerability in infancy [^112eUpJH] [^1113K7RY] [^113dzVus]. Regulatory actions also reflect this risk: promethazine is contraindicated under 2 years, and carbinoxamine carries a boxed warning with contraindication under 2 years due to reported fatalities; diphenhydramine labeling warns of convulsions and excitation in pediatric overdose and advises considerable caution in young children, which practically aligns with avoidance in infants and toddlers when possible [^111YVHcC] [^114DCaMa] [^1146QEms] [^114AjPJr]. FDA consumer guidance likewise advises against cough and cold products containing antihistamines in children under 2 years due to serious adverse events, reinforcing a conservative stance for first-generation agents in this age band [^1145koLb].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is about anaphylaxis rather than allergic rhinitis or urticaria; I should double-check that nuance. Antihistamines are not first-line for anaphylaxis; epinephrine is the only life-saving therapy, and antihistamines are adjunctive at best for cutaneous symptoms, with no role in delaying epinephrine, so age considerations for antihistamines in anaphylaxis are secondary to prompt intramuscular epinephrine and emergency care pathways [^113sw2WG] [^1167RcDR].

> Let me consider special populations and formulation issues to ensure completeness. In infants and young children, liquid formulations and weight-based dosing are essential; cetirizine and levocetirizine have pediatric PK-derived dosing schemas that achieve adult-comparable exposures at lower milligram doses, which supports safe use from 6 months when indicated, while also reminding me to avoid overdose and to adjust for renal function where relevant, particularly for IV cetirizine in children under 6 years with hepatic or renal impairment [^117GrANP] [^117B5oM7] [^112U6AaT]. I should also confirm that some agents like bilastine and rupatadine, while effective, may not be licensed below 6 years in many countries, so local labeling and availability matter for real-world prescribing [^1122aHpj].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the practical age-based recommendation. For second-generation oral antihistamines, cetirizine, levocetirizine, and fexofenadine can be used from 6 months for allergic rhinitis and urticaria with appropriate weight-based dosing and caregiver counseling; loratadine and desloratadine are generally appropriate from 2 years in many jurisdictions, consistent with labeling and guideline practice, while intranasal antihistamines are reserved for children 6 years and older, and IV cetirizine is indicated from 6 months for acute urticaria in supervised care with renal/hepatic cautions in younger children [^115jBQv2] [^117B5oM7] [^116FxoGR] [^1133vbLT] [^113MpH9P] [^111gpi7Z]. For first-generation antihistamines, I should avoid use under 2 years given contraindications for promethazine and carbinoxamine and the observed seizure risk signal; if a compelling indication exists in older children, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring for CNS effects, recognizing that many cough and cold guidelines also advise against routine antihistamine use for pediatric cough due to limited benefit and potential harm [^111YVHcC] [^114DCaMa] [^1146QEms] [^112HKPwG] [^114XL4BL].

> Finally, I need to ensure the recommendation is framed with safety checks and shared decision-making. Always verify the product-specific label, use weight-based dosing, screen for renal or hepatic impairment when relevant, avoid polypharmacy with duplicate antihistamines, and counsel families on expected benefits and adverse effects; in infants and toddlers, favor nonpharmacologic measures first and reserve antihistamines for clear indications, documenting rationale if used off-label in very young children [^116SpnUo] [^1177BnkU].

---

Antihistamines are appropriate for pediatric use across all ages, but **second-generation agents are preferred** due to fewer CNS and anticholinergic effects [^114WbNnf]. For infants and young children, **use caution** and follow weight-based dosing; cetirizine and levocetirizine are approved from 6 months, while loratadine and desloratadine are approved from 2 years. First-generation antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, promethazine) are **not recommended for children under 2 years** because of sedation, respiratory depression, and seizure risk [^112eUpJH] [^111YVHcC]. Always consult product labeling for age-specific dosing and safety information [^116SpnUo].

## Safety considerations and precautions

- **Second-generation antihistamines**: Generally safe and well-tolerated in pediatric patients, with minimal sedation and anticholinergic effects. Long-term safety data are available for cetirizine and levocetirizine in children as young as 6 months [^notfound].

- **First-generation antihistamines**: Associated with significant adverse effects, including sedation, respiratory depression, and seizures, particularly in children under 2 years [^112eUpJH]. Promethazine is contraindicated in children under 2 years due to risk of respiratory depression and death [^111YVHcC].

- **Dosing considerations**: Weight-based dosing is essential for infants and young children to avoid overdose and adverse effects. Always follow product labeling and consult healthcare providers for appropriate dosing [^116SpnUo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the use of **second-generation antihistamines** as first-line therapy for pediatric allergic conditions due to their favorable safety profile [^1122aHpj]. They also recommend avoiding **first-generation antihistamines** in children under 2 years and using caution in older children because of potential adverse effects [^1145koLb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Infants and toddlers (6 months to 2 years)**: Second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine, levocetirizine) may be used with weight-based dosing and careful monitoring [^115jBQv2] [^117B5oM7].

- **Children 2 years and older**: Second-generation antihistamines (loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine) are preferred for long-term management of allergic symptoms [^112FVUn4].

- **Adolescents**: Adult dosing may be appropriate for some second-generation antihistamines, but always consult product labeling and healthcare providers [^1133vbLT].

### Are antihistamines effective in children? A review of the evidence [^114eR5Bk]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

During the last decades, much attention has been paid to off-label and unlicensed prescriptions in paediatrics. However, on-label prescribing can also cause health issues. In this paper, the case of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines is investigated, notably the range of indications for which products are licensed in different European countries and the evidence base (or lack thereof) for each indication, as well as reported adverse drug reactions.

Methods

Review of the Summary of Product Characteristics of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines with a focus on paediatric use. This is plotted against the evidence available in the literature.

Results

This investigation shows a large variability in labelled indications and licensing ages when compared in five different European countries. Moreover, most of the indications are not based on clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of these drugs in children.

Conclusions

Many of the licensed indications of first-generation antihistamines do not appear to be evidence based.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^1177BnkU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric allergic rhinitis — treatment approach and approval ages: For children, management parallels adults and "includes allergen avoidance, AIT in appropriate cases (see Recommendations 34 and 35) for AR, and pharmacotherapy", with approvals noting that "Most pharmacologic treatments for AR are approved for children down to age 5 years, and many down to age 2 years or even younger", and that "Special care must be given to dosage adjustment, adverse effects, and long-term safety". The guideline approach has evolved: "Historically there has been a shift in guidelines from recommending that oral antihistamines generally should be the first-line agents for treatment of AR in children to a broader approach that positions other agents including INCS as first-line considerations in shared decision making with patients and families".

### Antihistamine use in children [^114WbNnf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the use of antihistamines in children. We discuss types of histamine receptors and their mechanism of action, absorption, onset and duration of action of first-generation and second-generation H(1)-antihistamines, as well as elimination of H(1)-antihistamines which has important implications for dosing in children. The rationale for the use of H(1)-antihistamines is explored for the relief of histamine-mediated symptoms in a variety of allergic conditions including: non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, atopic eczema (AE), allergic rhinitis (AR) and conjunctivitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and whether they have a role in the management of intermittent and chronic cough, anaphylaxis, food protein-induced gastrointestinal allergy and asthma prevention. Second-generation H(1)-antihistamines are preferable to first-generation H(1)-antihistamines in the management of non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, AR, AE and CSU due to: their better safety profile, including minimal cognitive and antimuscarinic side effects and a longer duration of action. We offer some guidance as to the choices of H(1)-antihistamines available currently and their use in specific clinical settings. H(1)-antihistamine class, availability, licensing, age and dosing administration, recommended indications in allergic conditions and modalities of delivery for the 12 more commonly used H(1)-antihistamines in children are also tabulated.

### New oral H1 antihistamines in children: facts and unmeet needs [^112FJJ9p]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antihistamines differ from first-generation ones because of their elevated specificity and affinity for peripheral H1-receptors and because of their lower penetration to the central nervous system, having fewer sedative effects as a result. Over the last few years, new compounds with different pharmacokinetic properties have been synthesized. More recent improvements of the molecules, generally in the form of active metabolites, led to the synthesis of new-generation antihistamines.

Methods

Recommendations on the minimum criteria that would have to be met for compounds to be classified as new-generation antihistamines have been recently established by a consensus statement. In the past, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of H1 antihistamines have not been optimally investigated in the pediatric population, especially in infants and young children.

Results

The pharmacology of second-generation H1 antihistamines has been investigated relatively deeper than old antihistamines in children. In the pediatric population, clinical studies with new-generation antihistamines are still limited in number and, with rare exceptions, of brief duration. Comparative trials on the efficacy and safety between different compounds are also lacking.

Conclusions

Properly designed, long-term trials with new-generation H1 antihistamines need to be performed in single age groups, in order to better define the effects of these drugs in all pediatric population.

How should CSU be managed in children?

Several studies have assessed the efficacy of treatment in paediatric patients with chronic urticaria, and recommendations for adults have been extrapolated to children. The treatment of choice is standard dosage of second-generation H 1 -antihistamines, according to the products' technical specifications. Currently, ketotifen and cetirizine can be used in infants from the age of 6 months; levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine can be used from 2 years of age; and rupatadine can be used from 6 years of age. Recent guidelines include specific recommendations to avoid first-generation H 1 -antihistamines due to the probable impact on school performance. There are reports of successful use of cyclosporine in children similar to the response found in adults. There is little evidence of the efficacy of other therapeutic alternatives, such as systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, omalizumab, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis; these options should be evaluated on an individual basis in cases of severe refractory chronic urticaria. None of the currently licensed antihistamines is contraindicated in children aged 12 or older, according to the British Association of Dermatologists Therapy Guidelines and Audit Subcommittee. As dosing and age restrictions for individual products vary in younger children, it is recommended that the relevant datasheets be consulted before prescribing antihistamines in children.

Key point: CSU in children should be managed in the same way as for adults.

A suggested treatment approach is included in Figure 1. It should be noted that as omalizumab is just approved as an add-on therapy, long-term data are needed to assess that omalizumab is safer and better cost-saving alternative than the remaining therapies available.

### Pediatric allergic rhinitis: factors affecting treatment choice [^116gXLtd]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis is the mostprevalent chronic allergic disease in children. Although it is not life-threatening, it can have a significantly detrimental effect on a childs quality of life, and it may exacerbate a number of common comorbidities, including asthma and sinusitis. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guidelines, an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, advocate the use of antihistamines for the treatment of the broad spectrum of the disease. However, first-generation antihistamines are associated with a number of adverse events, including central nervous system impairment and anticholinergic and cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these agents have not been rigorously tested in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, first-generation antihistamines remain the most frequently prescribed agents in this class of drugs. This is despite the fact that the second-generation antihistamines are largely free of the undesirable side effects associated with their predecessors and the fact that they have been shown to be effective in relieving allergic rhinitis symptoms in children in a number of large-scale clinical trials. Therefore, when selecting an antihistamine for a child, it would be prudent to consider the full range of antihistamines and to base the selection of a particular drug on its efficacy, onset and duration of action, and safety profile.

### First-generation antihistamines and seizures in young children [^112eUpJH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of prescriptions of first-generation antihistamines with seizure events in young children?

Findings

In this cohort study of 3178 children in Korea, prescriptions of a first-generation antihistamine were associated with a 22.0% higher seizure risk in children, especially in those aged 6 to 24 months.

Meaning

These findings reinforce the importance of cautious first-generation antihistamine prescription in young children and underline the need for further research to fully understand associations between antihistamine use and seizure risk.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base. The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the working group and is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and managing AR. The recommendations outlined in the guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life. The development group also made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. Findings of AR consistent with an allergic cause include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. (2) Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. (3) Clinicians should assess patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR for, and document in the medical record, the presence of associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media. (4) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls. The panel recommended against (1) clinicians routinely performing sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR and (2) clinicians offering oral leukotriene receptor antagonists as primary therapy for patients with AR. The panel group made the following options: (1) Clinicians may advise avoidance of known allergens or may advise environmental controls (ie, removal of pets; the use of air filtration systems, bed covers, and acaricides [chemical agents formulated to kill dust mites]) in patients with AR who have identified allergens that correlate with clinical symptoms. (2) Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR. (3) Clinicians may offer combination pharmacologic therapy in patients with AR who have inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. (4) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction in patients with AR with nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management. (5) Clinicians may offer acupuncture, or refer to a clinician who can offer acupuncture, for patients with AR who are interested in nonpharmacologic therapy. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the use of herbal therapy for patients with AR.

### Fexofenadine hydrochloride [^116FxoGR]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The recommended doses of fexofenadine hydrochloride in pediatric patients 6 months to 11 years of age are based on cross-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine in adults and pediatric subjects and on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in both adult and pediatric subjects at doses equal to or higher than the recommended doses. The safety and effectiveness of fexofenadine hydrochloride in pediatric patients under 6 months of age have not been established.

The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride is based on the administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at a dose of 30 mg twice daily demonstrated in 438 pediatric subjects 6 years to 11 years of age in 2 placebo-controlled 2 week seasonal allergic rhinitis trials. The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 mg and 30 mg given once and twice a day has been demonstrated in 969 pediatric subjects (6 months to 5 years of age) with allergic rhinitis in 3 pharmacokinetic studies and 3 safety studies. The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in subjects 6 months to 11 years of age is based on cross-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adult and pediatric subjects and on the safety profile of fexofenadine in both adult and pediatric subjects at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^114zFtau]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There is an alarming absence of RCTs evaluating the treatments for anaphylaxis in children. High quality studies are needed and are possible to design despite the severe and acute nature of this condition. Future trials should ensure appropriate comparator therapy that satisfies the ethical constraints inherent in resuscitation research and studies involving children, and the selection of appropriate outcome measures.

Research designs other than RCTs are still useful and can enhance the evidence for anaphylaxis treatment. Practice surveys in different settings, observational studies, and qualitative patient/family-centered studies are feasible and easy to design. Based on the results of this systematic review, it is impossible to make conclusive recommendations regarding optimal dosing, timing, or mode of administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. Furthermore, there is no evidence from RCTs supporting or refuting the use of common adjunctive treatments, such as corticosteroids and antihistamines, in the acute treatment of anaphylaxis, in preventing biphasic reactions, or after discharge from the ER. Until high-quality studies are designed and executed, current practices and guidelines on the management of anaphylaxis will continue to be based on lower quality evidence and on the consensus opinions of experts.

The careful selection and validation of outcome measures for future studies on pediatric anaphylaxis will support meaningful research and better treatment of children with this condition. Consistent universal reporting of these outcomes will protect against outcome reporting bias.

### Guidelines for evaluation and management of urticaria in adults and children [^112iuE4E]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Appropriate management of urticaria depends on the correct evaluation of clinical patterns and causes where these can be identified. Guidance for treatment is presented, based on the strength of evidence available at the time of preparation. As many of the recommendations relate to the off-licence use of drugs, it is particularly important that clinicians should be familiar with dosing and side-effects of treatment in the context of managing urticaria.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride [^115jBQv2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use: The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride has been demonstrated in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years. The safety of cetirizine has been demonstrated in 168 patients aged 2 to 5 years in placebo controlled trials of up to 4 weeks duration. On a mg/kg basis, most of the 168 patients received between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of cetirizine HCl.

The safety of cetirizine in 399 patients aged 12 to 24 months has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled 18-month trial, in which the average dose was 0.25 mg/kg bid, corresponding to a range of 4 to 11 mg/day. The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated in 42 patients aged 6 to 11 months in a placebo-controlled 7-day trial. The prescribed dose was 0.25 mg/kg bid, which corresponded to a mean of 4.5 mg/day, with a range of 3.4 to 6.2 mg/day.

The effectiveness of cetirizine hydrochloride for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of cetirizine hydrochloride in adults with these conditions and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar between these two populations. Efficacy is extrapolated down to 6 months of age for perennial allergic rhinitis because this disease is thought to occur down to these ages in children. The recommended doses for the pediatric population are based on cross-study comparisons of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cetirizine in adult and pediatric subjects and on the safety profile of cetirizine in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended doses. The cetirizine AUC and C max in pediatric subjects aged 6 to 23 months who received a mean of 2.3 mg in a single dose and in subjects aged 2 to 5 years who received a single dose of 5 mg of cetirizine oral solution, was estimated to be intermediate between that observed in adults who received a single dose of 10 mg of cetirizine tablets and those who received a single dose of 20 mg of cetirizine tablets.

The safety and effectiveness of cetirizine in pediatric patients under the age of 6 months have not been established.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^1146U27a]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendation

Overall, our systematic review provided moderate quality of the evidence regarding the use of POIT to induce desensitisation. For instance, the relative risk (RR) for POIT was 11.94 (95% CI 1.76–80.84) compared to avoidance or placebo. However, considering only the low‐risk‐of‐bias studies, the RR for desensitisation with POIT was 49.98 (95% CI 7.04–355.2) compared to avoidance and 27.36 (95% CI 6.97–107.38) compared to placebo. In the sub‐analyses by age group, the RR was 35 (95% CI 5.07–247.57) in children younger than 4 years and 8.23 (95% CI 3.59–18.86) in children aged 4–17 years compared to placebo. For the youngest age group, key studies were published after completion of the systematic review and meta‐analyses and are summarised in Table 3, together with the seminal study by Vickery et al. from 2017. The high certainty of evidence of desensitisation achieved with POIT in children and adolescents supported a strong recommendation. There was limited evidence of efficacy of POIT in adults; thus, no recommendation could be made for this age group.

Practical implications

Following confirmation of peanut allergy diagnosis (see EAACI guidelines on diagnosis of IgE‐mediated food allergy), children and adolescents (i.e. patients aged less than 18 years) should be offered POIT to increase their threshold of reactivity while on treatment. After completion of treatment, transition from AIT to real‐world peanut is allowed to enable regular peanut consumption and maintenance of therapeutic effect. Treated patients should be required to carry the AAI and other rescue medications, such as oral antihistamine and/or salbutamol inhaler, as appropriate. Patients and families should be carefully instructed and trained on how to recognise and treat allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Recommendations to stop or reduce dosing during infections should be tailored to individual patients and advice on restricting co‐factors, such as exercise, hot showers, NSAIDs, before and after POIT dosing is advised and should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^116Cmejr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — recommendation and evidence profile: Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR, with a policy level of Option based on randomized controlled trials with minor limitations and observational studies and an overall equilibrium of benefit and harm. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade A and the level of confidence in evidence is high, but most trials were of short duration. Benefits include rapid onset and increased effectiveness over oral antihistamines for nasal congestion, while risks/harms/costs include increased cost relative to oral antihistamines, poor taste, sedation, more frequent dosing, epistaxis, and local side effects. The Guideline Development Group judged this class generally second-line after failure of nasal steroids or oral antihistamines due to poor acceptance, taste, and cost, though specific patients may be appropriate for first-line therapy; intentional vagueness is none and the role of patient preferences is large with shared decision making emphasized. Exclusions include that these agents are not approved for children younger than 5 years, and differences of opinion were minor.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, we found an association between antihistamines and an increased odds of seizure events, especially in children aged 6 to 24 months and vulnerable groups. The benefits and risks of antihistamine use should always be carefully considered, especially when prescribing H1 antihistamines to vulnerable infants. Further research is needed to elucidate associations between antihistamine prescriptions and seizure risk.

### First-generation antihistamines and seizures in young children [^113dzVus]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Interestingly, children exposed to antihistamines between the ages of 6 and 24 months showed an increased risk of seizures compared with other young children. This period is critical for brain development and is characterized by a primitive brain structure and rapid developmental processes, making it a susceptible phase for future brain development, including cognition and fine motor functions. The vulnerability of the infant brain to antihistamines is partly due to the developing BBB, which continues to evolve in this age group. In infants, incomplete formation of the BBB leads to increased permeability and a higher risk of drug penetration into the brain tissue. Therefore, antihistamines, which are relatively harmless to adults and older children, might markedly affect infants in a negative manner. Additionally, underdeveloped metabolic pathways in infants influence drug metabolism and excretion. Moreover, incomplete neural myelination of the brain in young children, which develops rapidly during early childhood, contributes to seizure susceptibility. These factors contribute to an increased risk of seizures due to antihistamine use during infancy. Therefore, our finding that antihistamines are linked to seizure risk in children 24 months and younger suggests a potential developmental impact. Our results may suggest the need for careful consideration when prescribing antihistamines to infants or patients prone to seizures. In other words, these findings reinforce the importance of prudent and reasonable administration of first-generation antihistamines to vulnerable infants.

The variation in the risk of seizures associated with antihistamines among different age groups of children is likely related to brain development. We found that the older the children, the less pronounced the risk of seizures with the use of antihistamines. This is probably due to improved metabolism and a more mature brain, which are less affected by first-generation antihistamines. However, antihistamines are available over the counter for children older than 24 months but require a prescription for those 24 months and younger. Since our database does not include over-the-counter purchases, we cannot rule out the possibility that this factor influenced the observed interaction effect among age groups, antihistamine prescriptions, and seizures.

### Off-label, but on-evidence? A review of the level of evidence for pediatric pharmacotherapy [^116vPnVD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Our data identify information gaps and can aid to determine research priorities in addition to other important criteria related to medical need and risks of the off‐label use. These criteria include, but are not limited to, epidemiological data on frequency and severity of disease, drug characteristics and the availability of appropriate therapeutic alternatives. Most importantly, age should be considered as an important criterion. As PK parameters are subject to maturation and growth, and these changes are the most pronounced during the first 2 years of life, incorrect dosing based on changed PKs leading to toxicity or lack of efficacy is most likely to occur in this age group and less likely in older children or adolescents. Furthermore, criteria for research priorities may differ across different pediatric subspecialties (e.g. pediatric gastro‐enterology vs. infectious diseases) and also between healthcare systems as elucidated by our comparison with the WHO essential medicines list. We therefore have provided our dataset in a public repository, enabling healthcare professionals, research groups, regulatory agencies, and other relevant authorities worldwide to include the already available quality of evidence as a criterion for defining research priorities. The EMA has drafted the "Need for pediatric medicines lists", indicating research priorities. Comparison with this list, however, is less appropriate as these listings, organized by drug class, are primarily based on pediatric authorization in member states and not on available evidence. Furthermore, these lists, drafted in the early 2000s, seem to be outdated for many drugs. For example, morphine and enalapril have been studied in the listed age categories. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted more a pragmatic approach to prioritize research in pediatric oncology based on molecular targets for which there is evidence and/or a biologic rationale.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111GyBva]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^113sw2WG]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Myth 5: 'Antihistamines can be used to treat anaphylaxis initially; epinephrine is only needed if symptoms worsen'

Histamine is only one of many inflammatory mediators released during anaphylaxis. Oral antihistamines take around 30 min for onset of effect; intravenous chlorphenamine has a faster onset, but can cause hypotension. Antihistamines are not effective against anaphylaxis: their prophylactic use during controlled immunotherapy does not prevent anaphylaxis, and any apparent response during acute management of reactions is most likely due to the patient's own endogenous epinephrine. Antihistamines have now been relegated to third-line therapy in international guidelines; their use is limited to the relief of cutaneous symptoms and should never delay the administration of epinephrine or fluid resuscitation during patient stabilisation.

Myth 6: 'Corticosteroids prevent delayed or biphasic reactions in anaphylaxis'

Historically, corticosteroids have been used to prevent protracted and biphasic reactions (the latter defined as a recurrence of symptoms within 72 hours of initial anaphylaxis, without re-exposure to the trigger). However, this has never been tested in a randomised clinical trial; more recent evidence has cast doubt over their efficacy. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis included 27 studies with 4114 anaphylaxis cases, of whom 192 (4.7%) had biphasic reactions. Steroid administration did not affect the likelihood of a late phase reaction (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.43). In fact, there was a non-significant trend towards increased risk, although this is probably because steroid use was more common with severe reactions. Biphasic reactions were more common where hypotension was present at initial reaction (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.15), but this is unusual in food-induced anaphylaxis. The median time to onset of biphasic symptoms was 11 (range 0.2–72) hours, that is, 50% of reactions occurred > 11 hours after initial reaction. This is relevant because current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends patients over 16 years are observed for 6–12 hours after anaphylaxis (children under 16 should be admitted). In reality, it is generally accepted that prolonged observation may not be required following a straightforward reaction in someone who already has a comprehensive management plan and rescue medication (including epinephrine autoinjectors) in place.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^112cBa3E]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis

The EAACI/ARIA guidelines outline the clinical properties of the ideal oral H 1 -antihistimines, and most modern H 1 -antihistimines meet these requirements. A comparison of the clinical profiles of various second-generation antihistamines indicates that bilastine in particular has the highest number of ARIA-recommended antihistamine properties.

Their pharmacologic profiles support the preference for second-generation H 1 -antihistimines in managing pediatric allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. They address the immediate allergic symptoms and align well with the therapeutic goals for children, which include maintaining normal activity levels and minimizing adverse effects.

Treatment of acute and CU

As with AR, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines are efficacious in both acute urticaria and CU and are recommended as first-line therapy. For CU, the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline recommends antihistamines be taken daily until no longer needed. The dosing regimen is essential to patient adherence, as patients often hesitate to continue treatment if they do not experience immediate relief. Thus, a nonsedating antihistamine that restores a patient's QoL is essential to enhance the treatment experience.

For all types of urticaria, standard-dosed modern, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines like bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine are supported by clinical evidence. However, there is no clear recommendation on which to choose as a result of the lack of well-designed clinical trials comparing their efficacy and safety.

In children, antihistamines with proven efficacy and safety include bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine. Prescriber selection should consider age restrictions and availability, as some are not licensed for children under 6 months in many countries, and not all are formulated for pediatric use.

### First-generation antihistamines and seizures in young children [^114LxyzE]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

First-generation H1 antihistamines, developed in the 1940s and 1950s, initially served as tranquilizers and antipsychotics by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and suppressing histamine neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite reduced therapeutic use owing to their poor selectivity and interactions with other receptors, these drugs are still widely used for managing rhinorrhea in the common cold, or to control an itching sensation, in children. Because first-generation antihistamines can cross the BBB, their effects may extend beyond somnolence and drowsinessto markedly influence brain wave activity. Thus, caution is advised when prescribing these antihistamines to children younger than 2 years, an age group for whom drug safety data are lacking and first-generation antihistamines are generally not recommended.

Numerous studies, have indicated that first-generation antihistamines can affect brain waves. In particular, they can induce symptomatic seizures, affect electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and seizure thresholds in adults with inherent seizure susceptibility, and alter resting EEG activity. Animal studies have indicated that H1 antihistamines increase seizure susceptibility in rodents, and studies using genetically modified animal models have suggested a link with epileptic seizures. Clinically, antihistamines have been identified as a common trigger of acute symptomatic seizures, and there have been some instances of seizure induction by second-generation antihistamines. Altered seizure patterns were noted in children with febrile seizures who were exposed to antihistamines. However, the impact of first-generation antihistamines on brain waves and the heightened sensitivity to them among vulnerable age groups remains less explored in clinical practice.

We hypothesized that acute prescription of first-generation antihistamines increases the risk of seizures, especially in young children. Therefore, this study investigated the association between prescription of first-generation antihistamines and seizures in young children by using a nationwide population-based claims dataset. In this study, children served as their own controls, eliminating time-invariant confounding factors and focusing on the age groups vulnerable to seizures owing to the transient nature of CNS development in children.

WARNINGS

Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction.

Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine.

Use in Pediatric Patients

In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death.

As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation.

Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older)

Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^111nsWEh]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3.1 Recommendation 5

In patients with IgE‐mediated food allergy, an individualised management plan is recommended.

Reason for recommendation

IgE‐mediated food allergic reactions can range from mild to severe (i.e. anaphylaxis). Patients should be empowered to identify allergic reactions and commence appropriate treatment and emergency care. Patient‐specific medical treatment plans facilitate recognising and treating allergic reactions and communication with emergency services.

Strength of recommendation

The evidence is low, since controlled trials comparing the issuing of an individualised treatment plan versus a generic plan have not been performed. The strength of recommendation is strong, as there is evidence that the early recognition and treatment of allergic symptoms may improve outcomes and that a plan may facilitate this process.

Practical implications

Healthcare practitioners should provide individualised treatment plans as part of the standard care package for food allergic patients. Patients should be educated to recognise allergic symptoms and what they mean and understand which medications should be administered in response. The plan must detail the contact information for local medical services to expedite acute medical care. Treatment plans should be age‐appropriate, have clear stepwise instructions and be written in a language understood by the patient and responders in the specific geographic and cultural setting. Treatment plans should be patient‐specific, matching the patient's particular list of food allergens to be avoided and medications to be taken, which can include oral non‐sedative anti‐histamine, inhaled salbutamol and adrenaline auto‐injector (AAI), depending on the patients' risk profile. The treatment plan should detail how to administer medications that are included in the plan. If antihistamines are included, these should be recommended in a form that the patient can swallow (younger children may not be able to swallow tablets), and families should know how to correctly administer inhaler medications through a spacer and mask. If an AAI is included in the plan, then training in the correct administration will also be required. The treatment plan should be available in a format that best suits the patient, such as a printed copy saved and saved on electronic platforms.

### Levocetirizine dihydrochloride (xyzal) [^117B5oM7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The recommended dose of XYZAL for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients 6 months to 17 years of age is based on extrapolation of efficacy from adults 18 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The recommended dose of XYZAL in patients 6 months to 2 years of age for the treatment of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis and 6 months to 11 years of age with chronic idiopathic urticaria is based on cross-study comparisons of the systemic exposure of XYZAL in adults and pediatric patients and on the safety profile of XYZAL in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose for patients 6 months to 11 years of age.

The safety of XYZAL 5 mg once daily was evaluated in 243 pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age in two placebo-controlled clinical trials lasting 4 and 6 weeks. The safety of XYZAL 1.25 mg twice daily was evaluated in one 2-week clinical trial in 114 pediatric patients 1 to 5 years of age and the safety of XYZAL 1.25 mg once daily was evaluated in one 2-week clinical trial in 45 pediatric patients 6 to 11 months of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The effectiveness of XYZAL 1.25 mg once daily (6 months to 5 years of age) and 2.5 mg once daily (6 to 11 years of age) for the treatment of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria is supported by the extrapolation of demonstrated efficacy of XYZAL 5 mg once daily in patients 12 years of age and older based on the pharmacokinetic comparison between adults and children.

Cross-study comparisons indicate that administration of a 5 mg dose of XYZAL to 6 to 12 year old pediatric patients resulted in about 2-fold the systemic exposure (AUC) observed when 5 mg of XYZAL was administered to healthy adults. Therefore, in children 6 to 11 years of age the recommended dose of 2.5 mg once daily should not be exceeded. In a population pharmacokinetics study the administration of 1.25 mg once daily in children 6 months to 5 years of age resulted in systemic exposure comparable to 5 mg once daily in adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Antihistamines used in addition to topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children [^112moKJG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis is a very common chronic illness affecting 10% to 40% of children worldwide and its prevalence among children has significantly increased over the last two decades. Prevalence and severity are related to age, with children of school age most commonly affected.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and adverse event profile of antihistamines (oral or topical) used as an adjunct to topical nasal steroids for intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 21 September 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children under the age of 18 with a history of allergic rhinitis, with or without allergic conjunctivitis or asthma, comparing topical nasal steroids with antihistamines to topical nasal steroids only.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

One study including 24 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. This study compared the administration of topical nasal steroids with oral antihistamines to topical nasal steroids only in children, but it did not provide sufficient data to address the clinical question of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the lack of evidence for the benefit or lack of benefit of antihistamine add-on therapy with topical nasal steroids for children with intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the adverse effects of antihistamines and the additional costs that may be incurred.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride (Quzyttir) [^111zqYYV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of QUZYTTIR have been established in patients 6 months to 17 years of age. The efficacy of QUZYTTIR for the treatment of acute urticaria down to 6 months of age is based on extrapolation of the efficacy of QUZYTTIR in adults with acute urticaria [see Clinical Studies (14)] and supported by pharmacokinetic data with oral cetirizine hydrochloride (the active ingredient in QUZYTTIR) in patients 6 months to 17 years of age. Based upon the known PK profile of oral cetirizine hydrochloride, the exposure of IV cetirizine hydrochloride in pediatric patients (6 months to 17 years of age) is expected to be similar to the exposure of IV cetirizine hydrochloride in adults at the labeled doses. Extrapolation of efficacy is based on the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are similar between these two populations.

The safety of QUZYTTIR in children 6 months to 17 years of age is supported by safety information from placebo-controlled clinical trials with oral cetirizine hydrochloride in patients 6 months of age and older [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. QUZYTTIR demonstrates a higher Cmaxcompared to oral cetirizine hydrochloride in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. As QUZYTTIR is indicated for an acute condition administered in a medically supervised setting, the safety for higher Cmaxin children 6 months to less than 18 years of age is supported by the safety data from the clinical trial with IV cetirizine hydrochloride in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)] and available safety information from pediatric overdose cases.

Because of the absence of pharmacokinetic and safety information for cetirizine hydrochloride in children below 6 years of age with impaired renal or hepatic function, the use of QUZYTTIR in this impaired patient population is not recommended [see Dosage And Administration (2)].

The safety and efficacy of QUZYTTIR in patients less than 6 months of age has not been established.

### Current concepts and therapeutic strategies for allergic rhinitis in school-age children [^117QEB1d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common debilitating disorder that can adversely affect the quality of life and the academic performance of school-age children. Symptoms during the day can hamper concentration and lead to learning problems. Nocturnal symptoms can cause sleep loss and secondary daytime fatigue, further undermining a child's ability to function well during the school day Oral antihistamines are the foundation of pharmacologic therapy, but there are important differences between the agents.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the diagnostic and treatment challenges posed by AR in school-age children. The paper discusses and compares the available treatment modalities for this age group, with a focus on their beneficial and adverse effects.

Methods

Pertinent articles were identified in the literature through a MEDLINE search (1990–2003). Keywords used were antihistamines cetirizine fexofenadine loratadine desloratadine intranasal corticosteroids and CNS effects. Results of numerous clinical trials of first-generation early second-generation and the newer antihistamines were identified.

Results

This review established that the socioeconomic costs of AR are considerable. In children aged ≥ 12 years, direct US expenditures (eg, physician visits, medications) in 1996 amounted to $2.3 billion. Indirect costs measured by variables such as missed school days and poor performance also have an impact Major concerns include underdiagnosis and inadequate treatment, increasing the risk of serious comorbid conditions such as asthma. Advantages and drawbacks of antihistamines show that first-generation agents (eg, hydroxyzine) are effective and readily available over the counter, but are associated with sedation and the potential for suboptimal dosing. Newer agents, such as cetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine are effective and safer than the older drugs tie, no cardiotoxicity and less sedation). Of these, fexofenadine has been shown to be beneficial and nonsedating, even at higher-than-recommended doses. Other therapies reviewed include intranasal corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers.

Conclusions

AR has a considerable negative impact on children in terms of their physical, social, and psychological well-being and academic performance. An appropriate treatment must be effective and tolerable. Of particular importance for enhancing treatment adherence in the school-age population are pleasant taste and ease of use of medication. A drug that has minimal or no sedative or anticholinergic effects is optimal.

Practice parameter recommendations — Anaphylaxis in infants and toddlers: We suggest clinicians use current National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network or World Allergy Organization's anaphylaxis criteria to assist in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in infants/toddlers because there are no criteria specific to this age group. We suggest clinicians be aware that in infants and toddlers, patient age is not correlated with reaction severity and that anaphylaxis is unlikely to be the initial reaction to a food or medication on first exposure in infants. We suggest clinicians be aware that parents of infants and toddlers may report age-specific symptoms that are less often reported by older children and adults.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^115kAjqT]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources

The search strategy was developed in conjunction with a clinical librarian. The following electronic bibliographic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL.

The search strategy included all terms relating to the condition (anaphylaxis). The terms were combined with the Cochrane MEDLINE filter for controlled trials of interventions, and pediatrics (children/infants/adolescents). The search strategy for MEDLINE is available in the Appendix. The search terms were adapted for use with other bibliographic databases in combination with database-specific filters, where these were available. The search was limited to English-language studies, and studies published between January 2001 and December 31, 2012, in order to assess for improved quality of outcome reporting in studies published post-CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines.

The following websites were searched for ongoing/registered clinical trials on the topic:;.

Study selection

Two reviewers (TR, JC) independently screened titles and abstracts of identified references. Both reviewers also independently searched the websites for ongoing trials. Studies were included if they were a. RCTs; b. involved pediatric patients (0–18 years of age inclusive); c. investigated anaphylactic reactions from any triggering cause (including food, insect venom, medication, biologic, diagnostic agent, vaccinations, latex, exercise, or idiopathic cause) and; d. compared any acute treatment of anaphylaxis (pharmacologic, supportive measures) with any control treatment (including, but not limited to placebo). Any modality studied for the acute treatment of anaphylaxis was considered, including: epinephrine of any dose, timing and mode of administration; glucocorticoids of any dose, timing and mode of administration; inhaled beta-2 agonists; antihistamines (H1 and/or H2 antihistamines); novel treatments; and observation/ supportive care by skilled professionals in a healthcare setting. Studies focusing on the prevention of anaphylaxis (e.g. by immunotherapy) were excluded. Any and all outcome measures used in current research of pediatric anaphylaxis were included.

### Chronic urticaria in children under 15 years of age: clinical experience beyond the clinical trials [^111sgZBB]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

The aim of the study was to describe the clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of a series of children with chronic urticaria (CU).

Methods

We retrospectively studied children aged < 15 years diagnosed with CU in a tertiary teaching hospital in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, between January 2014 and March 2019. CU was defined as persistence of symptoms of wheals, with or without angioedema, for > 6 weeks.

Results

Twenty-nine patients (17 girls, mean age 8 years) were included. Family history of atopy was found in 31% of the cases. In 41.3% of patients, episodes of CU were associated with angioedema. Physical triggers were found in 34.5% of the cases. Most episodes of CU were successfully managed with the recommended (60.7%) or double the recommended dose (17.2%) of H1-antihistamines. Quadruple the recommended dose of H1 antihistamines was used in six patients, five of whom were finally treated with off-label omalizumab. Treatment with anti-leukotrienes was needed in one patient. Associated thyroiditis was diagnosed in one patient, which was controlled with levothyroxine.

Conclusions

Pediatric CU showed features similar to CU in adulthood, including a greater predominance in females and frequent association with personal or family history of atopy. Adult guidelines for the treatment of CU are currently extrapolated to the pediatric population. Specific tools for the assessment of disease activity and impairment of quality of life in pediatric CU are needed for use in prospective studies aimed to define treatment strategies for children with CU.

### Anti-histamines for prolonged non-specific cough in children [^114XL4BL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including anti-histamines. Also, anti-histamines are advocated as an empirical treatment in adults with chronic cough.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of anti-histamines in treating children with prolonged non-specific cough.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in November 2005.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing anti-histamines with a placebo or placebo-like medication with cough as an outcome, where cough is not primarily related to an underlying respiratory disorder such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, or suppurative lung disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. Two independent reviewers selected, extracted and assessed data for inclusion. Three eligible trials were identified.

Main Results

The three included studies varied in age of subjects, sample size, inclusion criteria, type of anti-histamine and length of intervention. These 3 studies included 182 randomised subjects with 162 completing the trials although in one study, children with recurrent wheeze were also included. Clinical heterogeneity was evident and limited data prevented combining data for meta-analysis. The two larger studies described significant improvement in both the intervention and the placebo/placebo-like arms with no significant difference between the two groups. In the study with the smallest sample size, cetirizine (a second generation anti-histamine) was significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing chronic cough in children associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and the effect was seen within 2 weeks of therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has significant limitations. However, our finding of uncertain efficacy of anti-histamines for chronic cough are similar to that for acute cough in children. In contrast to recommendations in adults with chronic cough, anti-histamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough. If anti-histamines were to be trialled in these children, current data suggest a clinical response (time to response) occurs within 2 weeks of therapy. However the use of anti-histamines in children with non-specific cough has to be balanced against the well known risk of adverse events especially in very young children.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^111jtVcp]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Cyproheptadine — children with functional abdominal pain (FAP) within abdominal pain disorders (AP-DGBIs): Cyproheptadine may be suggested as a treatment option for AP-DGBIs, with a Conditional recommendation, Overall Low certainty evidence, effect size Small (Table — 11). One study compared 2 weeks of cyproheptadine treatment to placebo in patients with FAP (n = 36; age range 4–12 years), and treatment success, defined as a complete resolution of pain, was achieved by significantly more patients treated with cyproheptadine than with placebo (86.7% vs. 35.7%; RR 2.43 [95% CI 1.17; 5.04]). Cyproheptadine has several assumed mechanisms of action, including antihistaminic, anti-serotonergic, and anti-muscarinic, and therefore patients with FD or patients with nausea are likely to benefit from it; for patients with AM, antihistaminic function may also alleviate abdominal pain.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^111TZ3cc]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Studies have found that, despite epinephrine being the only anaphylaxis treatment with demonstrated efficacy in preventing mortality, it is not used consistently, and second-line or adjunctive medications are more often administered, sometimes before epinephrine. For example, a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients seen in a pediatric emergency department over a 5-year period with a final diagnosis of anaphylaxis showed a rate of epinephrine administration of only 54%. This was less than the rate of corticosteroids (78%) and H1 and/or H2 receptor antagonists (92%).

The administration of adjunctive medications can potentially delay the use of other, perhaps more effective treatment modalities and therefore might contribute to morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, both antihistamines and steroids have adverse effects and costs, and may theoretically mask important markers of ongoing anaphylaxis risk. Recurrent dosing of both epinephrine and steroids in the emergency department also carries risks of systemic side effects. These factors need to be weighed against the potential benefit of these treatments.

Limitations

A limitation of the current systematic review is that it was limited to studies done in the last twelve years. This time frame was considered acceptable as there are recent systematic reviews investigating anaphylaxis treatments that found no RCTs in databases extending up to thirty years into the past. Further limitations include the exclusion of non-English and non-registered trials.

Research implications

There are a number of possibilities to explain the current gap in research. Firstly, there are clearly ethical issues involved in obtaining informed consent (or deferring consent) in emergency situations. Secondly, current anaphylaxis treatments are usually life saving, generally safe, and well established, contributing to the perceived lack of relevance of specific questions regarding pharmacotherapy. Thirdly, due to the clinical nature of anaphylaxis diagnosis, lack of accepted standards for determining degree of severity and lack of objective point of care testing, study design can be challenging. Fourthly, a large number of patients is required for an adequately powered study assessing an uncommon condition such as pediatric anaphylaxis, and would require considerable resources over a long period of time. Additionally, prospectively collected data is essential and more valid in establishing accurate rates of adverse effects of pharmacotherapy and other interventions, but is also costly. Finally, pediatric research is associated with additional challenges, including a vulnerable and smaller population, the challenge of obtaining informed consent/assent from children, and the need to address family-centered outcomes in both treatment and investigation.

### Levocetirizine dihydrochloride [^112soyzv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg once daily (6 months to 5 years of age) and 2.5 mg once daily (6 to 11 years of age) for the treatment of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria is supported by the extrapolation of demonstrated efficacy of levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily in patients 12 years of age and older based on the pharmacokinetic comparison between adults and children.

Cross-study comparisons indicate that administration of a 5 mg dose of levocetirizine dihydrochloride to 6 to 12 year old pediatric patients resulted in about 2-fold the systemic exposure (AUC) observed when 5 mg of levocetirizine dihydrochloride was administered to healthy adults. Therefore, in children 6 to 11 years of age the recommended dose of 2.5 mg once daily should not be exceeded. In a population pharmacokinetics study the administration of 1.25 mg once daily in children 6 months to 5 years of age resulted in systemic exposure comparable to 5 mg once daily in adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of levocetirizine dihydrochloride for each approved indication did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Levocetirizine dihydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

As levocetirizine is mainly excreted unchanged by the kidneys, it is unlikely that the clearance of levocetirizine is significantly decreased in patients with solely hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112HKPwG]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications and pediatric acute/chronic cough: Manufacturers re-labeled these OTC products "do not use in children under 4 years of age", and in 2018 FDA labeling for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines was changed to limit their use to adults ≥ 18 years. OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Pharmacology of sleep disorders in children and adolescents [^114f58Lc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

There is a high prevalence of sleep disorders in children and an apparent increasing need for pharmacologic management. However, because of the paucity of data available with regards to dosing, efficacy, tolerability, and safety profiles of medications as well as a lack of adequate well-designed clinical trials, medications are currently not approved for the pediatric population by the US Food and Drug Administration. There are no pharmacologic guidelines for the specific sleep disorders or the different pediatric age ranges. Additional research is needed for evidence-based pediatric sleep pharmacotherapy. This article reviews pediatric sleep disorders and the pharmacologic therapeutic options.

### Fexofenadine hydrochloride [^1125rsfJ]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1.

In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily.

The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race.

The frequency and magnitude of laboratory abnormalities were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects.

Pediatrics: Table 2 lists adverse reactions in subjects aged 6 years to 11 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at a dose of 30 mg twice daily in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in the United States and Canada.

### Off-label, but on-evidence? A review of the level of evidence for pediatric pharmacotherapy [^114dVdwr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

To reduce the risk for therapy failure and toxicity related to off‐label use, the Benefit and Risk Assessment for Off‐label (BRAvO) use decision tool was recently developed to assess and balance benefits and risks of off‐label drug use in children. This may help physicians and guideline committees to address information gaps in daily practice. Our data also call for a re‐appreciation of consensus and clinical expertise, although traditionally considered as low level of evidence. Many drugs lacking solid scientific support have been used off‐label for many years in clinical practice. Physician experience and consensus among healthcare professionals should therefore be appreciated to complement limited scientific data and to identify and balance benefits and risks.

Our study has several limitations. First, our study was not intended to establish efficacy and safety of individual drugs in the pediatric population. This requires a meta‐analysis approach, including an in‐depth evaluation on study design, age‐appropriate dose leading to adult equivalent exposures, age‐appropriate outcomes, and adverse events. The traditional evidence‐based medicine interpretation of efficacy and safety usually does not address these clinical pharmacological principles either. In addition, many pediatric drug trials have serious flawsAs a meta‐analyses approach was not feasible, we used the well‐documented summaries of available evidence of the editorial process of the DPF. Despite this methodological limitation our data do provide important insight into the low level of evidence for pediatric pharmacotherapy. After all, off‐label drug use that has been studied by means of an RCT is still more likely to reflect the true effect of pharmacotherapy than a case series describing the drug. Second, we did not investigate the supporting evidence for the authorized records (licensed use). Especially for old drugs, authorization is not always based on high‐quality clinical studies either. But even for recent authorizations, pediatric dosing may fall short. For example, Völler et al.has demonstrated that recently authorized midazolam doses for preterm neonates do not lead to adequate exposure. Therefore, our data may be even more significant, as the number of records supported by a low level of evidence may be underestimated. Third, the number of drugs evaluated for evidence was much lower for neonates than for the older age groups, as only the most frequently used drugs for neonatal care are included in the DPF. Fourth, the level of evidence of three therapeutic areas was not evaluated (i.e. oncology, HIV, and metabolic diseases) representing 15% of all records. As referenced dosing guidelines were already available, the DPF did not perform structured literature searches for these drugs, preventing duplicate efforts. Finally, the selection of drugs represents prescribing patterns in the four European countries where the DPF dosing guidelines are available. This may differ across other parts of the world, but because the number of drugs is so large and will overlap considerably, we do not expect a significant different overall trend for other countries.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^113MpH9P]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis — azelastine and olopatadine are both second-generation H1-receptor antagonists with equal efficacy in head-to-head, placebo-controlled comparison studies, and for nasal congestion they are more efficacious than oral preparations. Intranasal antihistamines have a rapid onset of action in the range of 15 to 30 minutes, which is much faster than the oral route (average onset 150 minutes). Olopatadine is FDA approved for seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and in children 6 years and older, azelastine 0.1% is approved for age 6 years and older, and an azelastine 0.15% solution plus sorbitol and sucralose is approved for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and in children 6 years and older. Common adverse events include bitter taste, epistaxis, headache, somnolence, and nasal burning; bitter taste occurs in 2% to 18% with intranasal antihistamines compared with 0% to 0.2% with INS, and somnolence was around 11% in early studies but more recently 0.4% to 3% and equal or only slightly greater than in placebo groups.

### Variation in the guidelines for the acute management of anaphylaxis in pediatric patients: an international narrative review [^116zWJpT]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Evidence-based guidelines have been created and disseminated by multiple organizations to standardize the care of pediatric patients with anaphylaxis. Differences across these guidelines can cause confusion and potentially errors in clinical practice leading to patient harm. The aim of this study was to describe and identify patterns of variation in the current guidelines.

Methods

A narrative review with 3 major components was designed. First, a narrative review of current, peer-reviewed, guidelines published by national and international allergy and immunology, pediatric, and emergency medicine organizations was performed. That was followed by a gray literature review of guidelines by resuscitation councils and national health organizations. The third component focused on the translation of these guidelines at local and institutional levels by reviewing clinical pathways published by academic institutions.

Results

With regard to the fixed epinephrine autoinjector dosing, 50% (6 of 12) of the reviewed guidelines offered weight-based and 41.7% (5 of 12) age-based dosing recommendations. Furthermore, different weight cutoffs for the 0.15- and 0.3-mg autoinjectors were identified among guidelines. Variation was identified in the description of intramuscular epinephrine concentration ("1:1000", "1 mg/mL", or both), the recommended concentration for intravenous administration ("1:10,000" or "1:1000"), or the rate of infusion or titration. Eight of the 12 guidelines (66.7%) recommend a dose in milligrams, and 33.3% (4 of 12) in micrograms. Five of 12 (41.7%) used both milliliters and milligrams or micrograms.

Conclusions

Notable variation in the current guidelines for the acute management of anaphylaxis in the pediatric population was identified. Flagging this variability could help inform a consensus-based approach toward harmonization of guidelines, which in turn could streamline the management of anaphylaxis in pediatric patients across the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, and hopefully prevent errors and mitigate patient harm.

### Dangers of under-treatment and over-treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma [^112aKPga]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The above discussion illustrates the high complexity of asthma management on national and international levels, with multiple ICS, multiple formulations of those ICS, multiple regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA), multiple LABA combined with ICS, prescription to OTC transitions, patent expirations and removal of ICS from the market, multiple insurance companies, and multiple asthma guidelines with different ranges for low, medium, and high doses (Table 6). Moreover, ICS and formulations can be available in some countries, but not others.

Asthma in school‐age children must be diagnosed carefully using spirometry. Likewise, persistent pediatric asthma should be carefully treated using ICS, the gold standard, considering both disease severity and ICS benefits and risks. ICS can be prescribed safely in children by following recommendations in asthma guidelines and FDA‐approved package labels. However, our responsibilities extend beyond the prescription to include proactive monitoring and accurate and timely recognition of systemic side effects when they develop. More education about guidelines, package labels, and side effects is needed for prescribers. The benefits and risks of INCS for concurrent allergic rhinitis symptoms must also be carefully weighed. It is vital to discuss ICS/INCS benefits and risks with patients and their guardians and stress the importance of using a symptom diary to monitor treatment response and detect side effects. Children are different from adults because they are growing and developing rapidly.

Moreover, children are more vulnerable than adults because they rely completely on adult caregivers to detect their side effects. The need to follow guidelines for treating acute asthma exacerbations should be stressed more in outpatient settings, such as urgent care and primary care clinics, in addition to acute care facilities. There are dangers of both under‐treating and over‐treating pediatric asthma. Any child with asthma is at risk for these dangers, but the risk will be mitigated by using the lessons learned from these two cases.

In summary, Case 1 supports more use of ICS monotherapy and less use of non‐ICS monotherapies. Case 2 merely supports the more careful use of ICS. These case presentations and reviews also advocate for the adoption of a single set of asthma guidelines that will be used globally, updated regularly to reflect recent advances, and sensitive to the many nuances of asthma management in different countries.

### Off-label, but on-evidence? A review of the level of evidence for pediatric pharmacotherapy [^114Nzv5e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Many advocate that off‐label drug use is only justified when supported by a high level of evidence, even in pediatrics. Our data show that including this prerequisite in treatment guidelines or reimbursement schemes will seriously jeopardize drug treatment of children, as denying off‐label drug use may be more deleterious than the potentially increased risk of ADRs and lack of efficacy. It is reassuring though that drugs listed on the WHO essential medicines list are more often licensed for children and the percentage of off‐label drugs supported by low‐quality evidence only seems lower compared with all drugs in the DPF, thus better satisfying the priority healthcare needs of the global pediatric population. Yet, drugs on the WHO list are selected with due regard to evidence of efficacy and safety, leading to overall better available evidence.

At the same time, our data clearly call for action to close the identified information gaps to improve pediatric pharmacotherapy. In this evaluation, we have focused on the traditional evidence‐based medicine approach, with systematic reviews or meta‐analyses of RCTs as the highest level of evidence, to evaluate the scientific strength pertaining off‐label prescribing. This approach has traditionally guided the development and market authorization of drugs and is still widely used to support pediatric treatment guidelines and thus rational prescribing. It is obvious that performing multiple high quality RCTs for the > 2,000 off‐label records we have identified would not be feasible for obvious financial, ethical, and practical reasons. Alternatively, we advocate the newer regulatory approach for pediatric drug development and the use of real‐world data (RWD) to generate real world evidence. In the regulatory approach, extrapolation of efficacy data from other age groups can be considered when the disease mechanism is the same, thereby reducing the need for challenging RCTs. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies may still be needed to verify extrapolated doses from adults, as unexpected variation in the mechanisms involved in drug disposition may affect drug disposition in children of different ages. However, these studies may include less children or may be less complicated when modeling and simulation can support their design. In addition, electronic health records host a pool of RWD generated by clinical practice, such as patient characteristics, laboratory findings, routinely collected blood concentrations, and pharmacodynamic outcomes. The usability of RWD, however, is still hindered by the diversity of systems that capture these data and most importantly the temporal relation to these data. Yet, these data may aid in closing the information gap without exposing children to the burden of clinical trials.

### First-generation antihistamines and seizures in young children [^111Smb3Y]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study had several strengths. First, it used a longitudinal design with a large, representative sample of children, allowing for robust and generalizable findings. Second, unlike previous studies that focused on ictal effects in adults or febrile children, our study concentrated on children with epilepsy or nonfebrile seizures, excluding those with febrile seizures.

It is essential to recognize the limitations of this study. First, seizure information was obtained from primary diagnoses using insurance data, which did not include details on seizure symptoms. Moreover, we only observed children visiting the emergency department; hence, we could not include those treated in the pediatric outpatient clinic. Second, we could not verify the actual intake of prescribed first-generation antihistamines due to the nature of our database. Third, unmeasured clinical conditions during hazard periods might affect our findings. To address these limitations, we sought to confirm our results by adjusting for concomitant infectious diseases as a time-dependent variable.

### Safety of new medicines in young children [^115V7zW8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

History has also shown that young children may be more prone to specific adverse drug reactions than older children. The retrospective review of cases of hepatotoxicity secondary to sodium valproate identified that young children under the age of 3 years were at the greatest risk. Antihistamines are widely used in both adults and children. Their use in infants under the age of 1 year, however, has been shown to increase the risk of sleep apnoea, and hence, sudden infant death syndrome. One therefore needs to be aware that the safety profile of medicines may be different within different paediatric age groups.

New medicines can result in a significant improvement in reducing morbidity and mortality. However, one has also to be aware that the safety profile of a new medicine is not established until it has been extensively used for several years. It would seem sensible to use angiotensin II receptor blockers more extensively in older children, and thus establish more safety data, before rushing to use them in preschool children.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^112MExti]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The safety and efficacy of the dosing regimen (Table 4) has been established in clinical practice for over 20 years. In children, a dose of 0.01 mg/kg (max 500 microgram) titrated to clinical response is recommended in international guidelines. Many guidelines (including those from EAACI, WAO and RCUK) simplify the dosing regimen to age categories, based on what is considered to be safe and practical to draw up and inject in an emergency. This pragmatic approach (which matches the licensed doses used for auto-injectors) seems to be effective and safe. Four small crossover RCTs have been published which compare different doses of IM adrenaline: one in children (weight 15–30 kg) comparing 150/300 micrograms; and three comparing 300/500 micrograms in teenagersor adults. In all four studies, the higher dose had a more favourable absorption profile, however how this impacts on clinical response in patients with anaphylaxis is unknown. While the certainty of evidence with respect to dose is low, the working group concluded that a strong recommendation was appropriate given these doses have been widely used globally for many decades. In addition, we did not identify any new evidence to challenge current dosing recommendations.

In terms of the practicalities of IM administration, the EAACI 2020 systematic review identified one study in which untrained caregivers were more able to give adrenaline using a prefilled syringe correctly, than when using an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) (OR 4.07, 95%CI 1.29–12.86; low certainty). A study with radiologists found that using an AAI reduced the time to administration by an average of 70 s compared to drawing up manually from an ampoule, and resulted in fewer administration errors. Most AAIs deliver a maximum of 300 micrograms epinephrine, while the appropriate dose in teenagers and adults is 500 micrograms. Coronial inquests have identified that the use of AAIs for anaphylaxis can therefore result in substantial underdosing, which may contribute to fatal outcomes. A single-blinded, cross-over RCT in 12 food-allergic teenagers reported that a 500 microgram dose (given by AAI) had a more favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile compared to 300 micrograms, without causing a higher rate of systemic adverse events. Therefore, while some settings may prefer to use an AAI to administer an initial dose of adrenaline (for speed and ease), further doses should be given by needle/syringe in order to deliver an optimal dose.

### Use of sleep medications in hospitalized pediatric patients [^116mf2Ag]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Little is known about the medications prescribed for sleep in hospitalized children. The aims of this study were to (1) determine the percentage of hospitalized children who receive medication for sleep disturbances, (2) determine what medications are prescribed for sleep difficulties, and (3) examine medical and demographic variables related to medications prescribed during hospitalization.

Patients and Methods

A chart review was conducted for all inpatients at 3 pediatric hospitals across 26 randomly selected days in 2004. Demographic, medical, and medication data were collected on 9440 patients. The sample was 54.5% male, had a mean age of 7.0 years, and was 63% white. Almost 19% of the patients had at least 1 psychiatric diagnosis.

Results

Overall, 6.0% of all hospitalized children (3% of all medically hospitalized children, excluding children with a psychiatric diagnosis) were prescribed medications for sleep, with antihistamines the most frequently prescribed medication (36.6%), followed by benzodiazepines (19.4%); hypnotic agents were the least frequently prescribed (2.2%). Significant differences were found in both the frequency of sleep-medication prescriptions and the types of medications used across hospitals, as well as for age, length of hospitalization, and service that the child was discharged from. Children with a psychiatric diagnosis were more likely to receive a sleep medication, with 22% of children on a psychiatric service receiving a sleep-related medication.

Conclusions

Approximately 3% to 6% of children are treated pharmacologically with a broad array of sleep medications in hospital settings. Prescription practices vary by hospital, medical service, child age, and diagnosis. The results from this study indicate that medications are being prescribed for sleep in hospitalized children, especially in children with psychiatric diagnoses. However, given that there are neither Food and Drug Administration-approved sleep medications for children nor clinical consensus guidelines regarding their use, clinical trials, practice guidelines, and additional research are clearly needed.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^112iAu8T]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

This practice parameter update focuses on 7 areas in which there are new evidence and new recommendations. Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis have been revised, and patterns of anaphylaxis are defined. Measurement of serum tryptase is important for diagnosis of anaphylaxis and to identify underlying mast cell disorders. In infants and toddlers, age-specific symptoms may differ from older children and adults, patient age is not correlated with reaction severity, and anaphylaxis is unlikely to be the initial reaction to an allergen on first exposure. Different community settings for anaphylaxis require specific measures for prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis. Optimal prescribing and use of epinephrine autoinjector devices require specific counseling and training of patients and caregivers, including when and how to administer the epinephrine autoinjector and whether and when to call 911. If epinephrine is used promptly, immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required if the patient experiences a prompt, complete, and durable response. For most medical indications, the risk of stopping or changing beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication may exceed the risk of more severe anaphylaxis if the medication is continued, especially in patients with insect sting anaphylaxis. Evaluation for mastocytosis, including a bone marrow biopsy, should be considered for adult patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis or recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis. After perioperative anaphylaxis, repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision-making and based on the history and results of diagnostic evaluation with skin tests or in vitro tests when available, and supervised challenge when necessary.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111DJ5mc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (stepwise management), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following track as the preferred stepwise approach to the management of asthma in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years, with as-needed short-acting β-agonist or low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever in Steps 3 and 4:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1. Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week|- Offer low-dose ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken <br/> -, in separate inhalers or in combination if available|
|Step 2. Symptoms 2–5 days per week|- Offer low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> -; consider offering ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken, in combination or separate inhalers, <br/> - or daily leukotriene receptor antagonist as non-preferred options; consider the probability of adherence to maintenance treatment if reliever is short-acting β-agonist|
|Step 3. Symptoms on most days of the week or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week|- Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> -; offer very low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> -; consider offering daily low-dose ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonist, plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as a non-preferred option|
|Step 4. Symptoms daily, waking at night ≥ 1 per week, low lung function|- Offer medium-dose maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> - Consider referring for expert advice|
|Step 5.|- Refer for phenotypic assessment <br/> - Offer higher-dose ICS-LABA <br/> - Offer add-on therapy, such as anti-IgE, anti-interleukin 4 receptor, or anti-interleukin 5 therapy|
|Initial presentation with exacerbation|- Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe <br/> - Offer Step 3 or 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up|

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^111sJxD2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast is FDA-approved for treatment of symptoms of seasonal AR in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older and perennial AR in adults and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older; evidence shows LTRAs are more effective than placebo, are as effective as oral antihistamines in some trials, but are less effective than oral antihistamines and INS. In a single randomized, double-blind study, montelukast had a similar effect to pseudoephedrine except for nasal congestion where pseudoephedrine was more effective; montelukast is generally well tolerated and is not associated with drowsiness, behavior-related adverse events were infrequent in placebo-controlled trials, but rare drug-induced neuropsychiatric events have been reported and suicidal ideation was reported in 1 of 9929 patients (0.01%) in clinical trials treated with montelukast. Because montelukast is currently more expensive and equally as effective as or less effective than oral antihistamines for AR and is less effective than INS, clinicians should not routinely offer an LTRA as primary therapy for patients with AR.

### Trends and variation in pediatric anaphylaxis care from 2016 to 2022 [^116StV4L]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Variation in the use of treatments and hospitalization for anaphylaxis would suggest a lack of consensus in therapeutic approach.

Objective

To evaluate trends and practice variation in the emergency department (ED) care of children with anaphylaxis in a large US cohort.

Methods

We conducted a 48-site retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System from January 2016 through September 2022. Children younger than 18 years with a primary diagnosis of anaphylaxis were included. Care trends were assessed using negative binomial regression modeling. Rates of medication use, hospitalizations, and revisits were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs).

Results

There were 42,909 ED visits for anaphylaxis, with a 4.2% per-year increase in visit incidence (95% CI, 1.8–6.7) during the study period. The median hospitalization rate was 3.5% (IQR, 2.2–6.0), and the 3-day ED revisit rate was 0.6% (IQR, 0.4–0.9). The hospital-level median use of therapies included intramuscular epinephrine (55.3%; IQR, 50.1–59.9), systemic steroids (73.8%; IQR, 63.9–81.4), antihistamines (59.9%; IQR, 53.5–65.5), H2-receptor antagonists (56.8%; IQR, 42.3–66.2), bronchodilators (15.1%; IQR, 12.5–17.0), inhaled epinephrine (1.1%; IQR, 0.6–1.9), and fluid boluses (19.8%; IQR, 11.3–29.3). Severe reactions requiring intensive care unit admission (1.5%; IQR, 0.8–2.2), vasopressors (0.3%; IQR, 0.0–0.6), and intubation (0.2%; IQR, 0.0–0.3) were rare.

Conclusions

ED visits for anaphylaxis increased during the study period, but hospitalization rates were low. Substantial variation exists between EDs regarding the use of anaphylaxis therapies, supporting the need for future research to evaluate the efficacy of these medications.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^115hzfhP]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Reason for recommendation

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life‐threatening allergic reaction for which adrenaline remains the treatment of choice. In the community, adrenaline should ideally be administered intramuscularly using an AAI, with an adequate needle length and a dosage adapted to weight and to age.

Strength of recommendation

There are data to support different training strategies for recognising anaphylaxis and its treatment; however, they were not obtained in an acute real‐world setting. Therefore, the certainty of evidence is low, but the strength or recommendation is strong as it places high value on the patients' safety.

Practical implications

Training programs for patients and caregivers that focus on recognising anaphylaxis and other allergic symptoms and signs and stepwise treatment are essential. Training teachers and peers is also important. A switch of focus from child to adolescent and in transition to adulthood is key to ensure that patients feel confident and empowered to manage their allergic reactions and self‐administer treatment, if needed. Training programs should be tailored to the specific patient setting, age, language, and baseline allergy understanding of the disease and risk of anaphylaxis. Different strategies and educational tools may be required, sometimes repeatedly, to empower patients to identify allergic symptoms and initiate medical treatment. Indeed, AAI training should be repeated as part of every follow up visit.

Patients and their caregivers must be empowered to identify and treat anaphylaxis. Whilst definitions of anaphylaxis vary across the world, all these reactions are severe and life‐threatening. We shall refer to the EAACI definition of anaphylaxis as a reference. It is critical that patients can identify airway, breathing and circulatory compromise as these can prove fatal. Skin and mucosal changes are usually present but are not required to support a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

Adrenaline administration, preferably using an AAI device, remains the treatment of choice in moderate–severe food‐induced allergic reactions. AAI are available in many countries worldwide, but access and reimbursement greatly vary. Doses may include 0.15 mg, 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg adrenaline (additionally, 0.1 mg in the US), and the prescribing clinician should best match these to the patient's age and weight. The instructions for each device vary, so patients must be trained to use the device they are carrying. Patients must be trained to identify the correct body positioning during anaphylaxis and the anatomical landmarks needed for AAI administration into the thigh muscle.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111zDWFP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the reviewed studies, the indication for increasing the ICS dose was decreased peak flow and/or increased symptoms. When increased, the ICS dose was doubled, quadrupled, or quintupled. –

Rationale and discussion

In children aged 4 to 11 years, the intervention did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve asthma quality of life in one studyin the systematic review report. The intervention's potential to suppress growth in a more recent studyand the lack of demonstrated efficacy of the intervention in either of the reviewed articles led to the Expert Panel's recommendation against this intervention in this age group.

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the intervention as implemented also did not significantly reduce exacerbations in three studies – in the evidence summary, but the certainty of evidence is low. The more recent study by McKeever et alshowed modest but significant reductions in time to severe exacerbation and rate of ICS use in individuals whose action plan included a quadrupling of the ICS dose. However, unlike the studies in the AHRQ systematic review report, this study did not include a placebo group or use blinding, and the baseline adherence rate was low (42%−50%). The adherence rate in the McKeever et al study might be more similar to the adherence rates in routine clinical practice, whereas adherence rates in the RCTs – were probably higher than in most real-world settings.

Thus, the Expert Panel believes that this recommendation applies most specifically to individuals who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS regimen. An increase in the ICS dose might be a reasonable strategy to include in the action plans of individuals whose adherence rates are less certain. How to assess adherence or the threshold for adequate adherence for this recommendation cannot be determined from the reviewed studies. Based on the study of McKeever et alin individuals aged 12 years and older described in the previous paragraph, the ICS dose could be quadrupled in the short-term in individuals aged 16 years and older in response to an increased need for reliever therapy, greater interference of asthma with sleep, or a peak flow of less than 80% of the individual's normal level. The potential discrepancy between the efficacy and effectiveness studies described above and the overall low certainty of evidence led to a conditional recommendation for this age group as well.

### H1-antihistamine treatment in young atopic children: effect on urticaria [^112pxp5Q]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There are few published, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of interventions for urticaria in the pediatric population.

Objective

To study the effect of long-term treatment with the H1-antihistamine levocetirizine on urticaria in young atopic children.

Methods

In the randomized, double-masked, parallel-group Early Prevention of Asthma in Atopic Children Study, children with atopic dermatitis aged 12 to 24 months at enrollment received levocetirizine, 0.125 mg/kg, or matching placebo twice daily for 18 months. On a diary card, the child's caregiver recorded the days on which urticaria was observed. This was validated by the study investigator and entered into the electronic case report form, along with any additional relevant information.

Results

A total of 510 atopic children (mean ± SEM age, 19.4 ± 0.2 months) composed the intention-to-treat population. During the subsequent 18 months, 27.5% (70/255) of the children taking levocetirizine and 41.6% (106/255) of the children taking placebo experienced urticaria (P < .001). The mean ± SEM number of urticaria episodes was 0.71 ± 0.11 in those receiving levocetirizine and 1.71 ± 0.25 in those receiving placebo (P < .001). The mean ± SEM duration of urticaria episodes was 4.43 ± 1.57 days in those receiving levocetirizine and 5.36 ± 1.27 days in those receiving placebo (P < .001).

Conclusions

Urticaria is common in atopic toddlers and deserves recognition as an important disorder that occurs early in the atopic marathon. Regular long-term treatment with levocetirizine effectively prevents and treats urticaria in young children. The results of this study strengthen the evidence base for the use of relatively nonsedating, second-generation H1-antihistamines in the pediatric population.

### Trends in off-label drug use in ambulatory settings: 2006–2015 [^112JJnYy]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Off-label drug use in children is common and potentially harmful. In most previous off-label use research, authors studied hospitalized children, specific drug classes, or non-US settings. We characterized frequencies, trends, and reasons for off-label systemic drug orders for children in ambulatory US settings.

Methods

Using nationally representative surveys of office-based physicians (National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, 2006–2015), we studied off-label orders of systemic drugs for children age < 18 based on US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling for age, weight, and indication. We characterized the top classes and diagnoses with off-label orders and analyzed factors and trends of off-label orders using logistic regression.

Results

Physicians ordered ≥ 1 off-label systemic drug at 18.5% (95% confidence interval: 17.7%-19.3%) of visits, usually (74.6%) because of unapproved conditions. Off-label ordering was most common proportionally in neonates (83%) and in absolute terms among adolescents (322 orders out of 1000 visits). Off-label ordering was associated with female sex, subspecialists, polypharmacy, and chronic conditions. Rates and reasons for off-label orders varied considerably by age. Relative and absolute rates of off-label orders rose over time. Among common classes, off-label orders for antihistamines and several psychotropics increased over time, whereas off-label orders for several classes of antibiotics were stable or declined.

Conclusions

US office-based physicians have ordered systemic drugs off label for children at increasing rates, most often for unapproved conditions, despite recent efforts to increase evidence and drug approvals for children. These findings can help inform education, research, and policies around effective, safe use of medications in children.

### Safety of cetirizine in infants 6 to 11 months of age: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115PAEJ6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

H(1)-antihistamines are widely used for symptom relief in allergic disorders in infants and children; however, there are few prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled studies of these medications in young children, and to date, no such studies have been conducted in infants.

Objective

This prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the safety of the H(1)-antihistamine cetirizine, particularly with regard to central nervous system and cardiac effects, in infants age 6 to 11 months, inclusive.

Methods

Infants who met the entry criteria for age and had a history of treatment with an H(1)-antihistamine for an allergic or other disorder were randomized to receive 0.25 mg/kg cetirizine orally or matching placebo twice daily orally for 1 week.

Results

The mean daily dose in cetirizine-treated infants was 4.5 ± 0.7 mg (SD). No differences in all-cause or treatment-related adverse events were observed between the cetirizine- and placebo-treated groups. A trend was observed toward fewer adverse events and sleep-related disturbances in the cetirizine group compared with the placebo group. No prolongation in the linear corrected QT interval was observed in cetirizine-treated infants compared with either baseline values or with values in placebo-treated infants.

Conclusions

We have documented the safety of cetirizine in this short-term investigation, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of any H(1)-antihistamine in infants. Additional prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term studies of cetirizine and other H(1)-antihistamines are needed in this population.

### The management of anaphylaxis in childhood: position paper of the European academy of allergology and clinical immunology [^1167RcDR]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a growing paediatric clinical emergency that is difficult to diagnose because a consensus definition was lacking until recently. Many European countries have no specific guidelines for anaphylaxis. This position paper prepared by the EAACI Taskforce on Anaphylaxis in Children aims to provide practical guidelines for managing anaphylaxis in childhood based on the limited evidence available. Intramuscular adrenaline is the acknowledged first-line therapy for anaphylaxis, in hospital and in the community, and should be given as soon as the condition is recognized. Additional therapies such as volume support, nebulized bronchodilators, antihistamines or corticosteroids are supplementary to adrenaline. There are no absolute contraindications to administering adrenaline in children. Allergy assessment is mandatory in all children with a history of anaphylaxis because it is essential to identify and avoid the allergen to prevent its recurrence. A tailored anaphylaxis management plan is needed, based on an individual risk assessment, which is influenced by the child's previous allergic reactions, other medical conditions and social circumstances. Collaborative partnerships should be established, involving school staff, healthcare professionals and patients' organizations. Absolute indications for prescribing self-injectable adrenaline are prior cardiorespiratory reactions, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, idiopathic anaphylaxis and persistent asthma with food allergy. Relative indications include peanut or tree nut allergy, reactions to small quantities of a given food, food allergy in teenagers and living far away from a medical facility. The creation of national and European databases is expected to generate better-quality data and help develop a stepwise approach for a better management of paediatric anaphylaxis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^1141sgGE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal antihistamines in allergic rhinitis (AR) — somnolence rates and clinical use: "Somnolence rate ranges of intranasal antihistamines (0.9%-11.5%), oral antihistamines (1.3%-14%), and placebo (0.3%-10%) overlap as well". "Caution should be taken at the initiation of intranasal antihistamines for signs of somnolence, and follow-up with a clinician is advised to assess response and side effects". They "are an effective treatment for AR and can be used as first- or second-line therapy", are "especially useful in patients with episodic nasal symptoms or as a pretreatment prior to nasal allergen exposure", and "the need for twice-daily dosing and the side effects of somnolence and bitter taste… may lead clinicians and/or patients to prefer initial treatment with a different class of medication".

Sleep medications, which are sometimes prescribed for adults with insomnia, such as benzodiazepines or even antihistamines, can cause activation or agitation in some children and should be used with caution. There are no FDA-approved medications for sleep for pediatric insomnia. Antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, are frequently used by pediatricians for the management of sleep onset difficulties, although they might have a paradoxical effect in children under the age of 5 years. Since the long-term use of these medications in young children has yet to be studied, they are not recommended for long-term use for young children. Hydroxyzine can be started at a dose of 10 mg at bedtime and increased up to a maximum dose of 25 mg.

Zolpidem is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A agonist that has received FDA approval for short-term treatment of insomnia in individuals 18 years and older; it can be considered for sleep in teens and adults. Zolpidem is less useful for children who may be at risk for a paradoxical reaction from benzodiazepines. Zolpidem IR can be dosed at 5–10 mg at bedtime, and zolpidem ER can be dosed at 6.25–12.5 mg at bedtime.

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. While there is no data in the literature for children, the use of amitriptyline in low dosages is often effective for insomnia for children and adults with ASD. Start with a low dose of 5 mg at bedtime and increase weekly by 5 mg. Typically, it is effective in doses ≤ 50 mg at bedtime. Amitriptyline can cause constipation, which is common in individuals with ASD. Patients with prior heart disease will need an electrocardiogram (ECG) before they take amitriptyline, as it can prolong the time that the heart muscle takes to contract and relax (QTc cardiac interval).

For the patient who does not respond to medication for sleep disturbances, referral to a sleep specialist or psychiatrist is recommended. See Fig. 1 for pharmacological approaches to the treatment of sleep disturbances in individuals with ASD.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^1139i5Kv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes new research developments and clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis presented in the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters 2023 Anaphylaxis practice parameter Update. It is intended to serve as a high-level summary of the 2023 practice parameter, which makes clinically impactful recommendations based on evidence that has emerged since the 2015 practice parameter. We invite clinicians to explore the full 2023 practice parameter to understand the research methods and underlying evidence that have informed the recommendations summarized here. There are new and evolving diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, rules for defining elevated tryptase levels, and recognition of signs and symptoms particular to infants and toddlers. The administration of epinephrine should not be used as a surrogate to diagnose anaphylaxis. Risk factors for anaphylaxis should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Patient counseling and shared decision-making are essential to support patients' treatment decisions and capacity to manage the risk of anaphylaxis at home and in other community settings. Activation of emergency medical services after home epinephrine administration may not be required in all cases, and patients should be engaged in shared decision-making to determine when home management may be appropriate.

Overall, 79/164 patients (48%) in the BESPONSA arm and 35/162 patients (22%) in the Investigator's choice of chemotherapy arm had a follow-up HSCT.

Figure 1 shows the analysis of overall survival (OS). The analysis of OS did not meet the pre-specified boundary for statistical significance.

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival (Intent-to-Treat Population)

WI203581 (ITCC-059) – Pediatric Patients

BESPONSA was evaluated in a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study in 53 pediatric patients ≥ 1 and < 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor ALL.

In 53 patients, there were two dose levels: an initial dose of 1.4 mg/m2/cycle (approximately 0.78 times the recommended initial dosage) in 12 patients and 1.8 mg/m2/cycle in 41 patients (premedications included methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg with a maximum of 50 mg, an antipyretic, and an antihistamine). Table 1 shows the dosing regimen used to treat patients. Patients received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range: 1 to 4 cycles). The median age was 9 years (range: 1 to 17 years), and 55% of patients had second or greater relapsed B-cell precursor ALL.

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^113Hr835]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2012 Issue 3 which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 1 2012), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2012), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2012), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2012), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2012) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes and secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

Twenty-six trials (18 in adults, eight in children) involving 4037 people (3421 adults and 616 children) were included. In the adult studies six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Two trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit whereas the other did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. In the children studies antitussives (two studies), antihistamines (two studies), antihistamine decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. A minority of studies reported adverse effects and described a low incidence of mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self care treatments for acute cough.

### Levocetirizine dihydrochloride [^111FpJNM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 1 to 5 Years of Age

A total of 114 pediatric patients 1 to 5 years of age received levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg twice daily in a two week placebo-controlled double-blind safety trial. The mean age of the patients was 3.8 years, 32% were 1 to 2 years of age, 71% were Caucasian and 18% were Black. Table 3 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects aged 1 to 5 years exposed to levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg twice daily in the placebo controlled safety trial and that were more common with levocetirizine dihydrochloride than placebo.

Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Months of Age

A total of 45 pediatric patients 6 to 11 months of age received levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg once daily in a two week placebo-controlled double-blind safety trial. The mean age of the patients was 9 months, 51% were Caucasian and 31% were Black. Adverse reactions that were reported in more than 1 subject (i.e.g.reater than or equal to 3% of subjects) aged 6 to 11 months exposed to levocetirizine dihydrochloride 1.25 mg once daily in the placebo-controlled safety trial and that were more common with levocetirizine dihydrochloride than placebo included diarrhea and constipation which were reported in 6 (13%) and 1 (4%) and 3 (7%) and 1 (4%) children in the levocetirizine dihydrochloride and placebo-treated groups, respectively.

Long-Term Clinical Trials Experience

In two controlled clinical trials, 428 patients (190 males and 238 females) aged 12 years and older were treated with levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg once daily for 4 or 6 months. The patient characteristics and the safety profile were similar to that seen in the short-term studies. Ten (2.3%) patients treated with levocetirizine dihydrochloride discontinued because of somnolence, fatigue or asthenia compared to 2 (< 1%) in the placebo group.

There are no long term clinical trials in children below 12 years of age with allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria.

Laboratory Test Abnormalities

Elevations of blood bilirubin and transaminases were reported in < 1% of patients in the clinical trials. The elevations were transient and did not lead to discontinuation in any patient.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^115bUP1w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis guideline — epidemiology and scope: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is characterized as one of the most common diseases affecting adults and as the most common chronic disease in children in the United States and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall, affecting nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generating $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually, with as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. The guideline is applicable to both pediatric and adult patients with AR, but children under the age of 2 years were excluded; there is considerable variation in use of diagnostic tests and treatments, and the recommendations are not intended to represent the standard of care or limit individual care.

### Advances in the management of pediatric asthma: a review of recent FDA drug approvals and label updates [^114kR39C]. The Journal of Asthma (2005). Low credibility.

Children have the highest prevalence of asthma of any age group. In the United States during 2001, there were 12.6 million physician and hospital outpatient visits for asthma treatment, of which almost 5 million involved children 18 years and younger. Therapeutic advances in pediatric asthma could improve patient outcomes and potentially reduce the burden on health care systems. Efforts to obtain efficacy and safety data in pediatric populations and develop pediatric formulations of asthma treatments have been encouraged by the FDA and clinicians. This article reviews the newest additions to asthma therapies approved for use in children, including an inhaled corticosteroid, some long-acting beta2-agonists, some leukotriene-receptor blockers, and a single-isomer, short-acting beta2-agonist.

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings [^116zx6CN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine-decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three-day period. Twenty-one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over-the-counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^112yepFo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Appropriate dose based on PK studies

The appropriate dose for children ≥ 1–6 months is 0.1 mg/kg/dose, with a maximum of 8 mg/dose. For children ≥ 6 months, the 0.15 mg/kg/dose should be used.

Spahr Schopfer et al. conclude that a dose of 0.1 mg/kg in children 3–12 years old results in PK parameters of ondansetron predictable and similar to those in adults.

Dose in efficacy studies

Dose evaluated in meta‐analyses in children from 1 months to 18 years varied from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/dose orally or intravenously in single or repeated doses.

Dose response studies

Dose response has been evaluated in several pediatric studies in PONV concluding that low dose (< 0.1 mg/kg) and high dose (0.15–0.2 mg/kg) are equally effective. Treatment of nausea and vomiting involves different receptors. If ondansetron is not effective at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, a combination of anti‐emetic drugs should be used instead of increasing the dose of ondansetron.

Can the dose be simulated?

Dose simulations are performed by Mondick et al.

Conclusion on dose

Dose response studies in PONV show that lower doses (< 0.1 mg/kg) are equally effective as higher doses (0.15–0.2 mg/kg). Therefore, for children > 6 months, a 0.1 mg/kg/dose is recommended, with the option to repeat the dose up to 3 times daily.

PK parameters indicate that infants (≤ 6 months) need a lower daily dosage as clearance is lower in this age group. At the same time, as young infants have an increased volume of distribution (Vd), the initial dose should at least be similar to older children or even higher to attain the same maximum concentration (C max). Hence, for infants < 6 months, a 0.1 mg/kg/dose as an initial dose is recommended, with the option to repeat the dose up to 2 times daily, instead of 3 times daily.

### Allergy and immunology practice parameters and guidelines: the new normal [^1128D3V3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Grade system — advantages and recommendation implications are detailed, emphasizing separation of evidence from recommendations and clarity of "strong" versus "weak" guidance. The page notes that "The GRADE approach entails a transparent process, in which there is a clear separation of evidence from recommendations", and that "we can make a strong recommendation when an intervention offers benefit that outweighs risks and inconvenience, harm, burden, or cost — such as epinephrine administration for acute anaphylaxis — despite the absence of an RCT demonstrating efficacy". In contrast, in allergic rhinitis, "use of combination intranasal corticosteroid and intranasal antihistamine, compared with intranasal corticosteroid monotherapy, is associated with a weak recommendation". It adds, "With a strong recommendation, the decision-making process is more straightforward: most patients should receive (or not receive) the recommended management", whereas "A weak recommendation is a navigational signal for clinicians indicating that treatment decisions can vary based on patient circumstances". Advantages listed include "Separation between quality of evidence and strength of recommendation" and related considerations of values and preferences in making recommendations.

### Development of a validated, updated north American pediatric food allergy anaphylaxis management plan [^116ZE5YN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current North American anaphylaxis action plans (AAPs) lack updated anaphylaxis guidelines that conditionally recommend "immediate activation of emergency medical services" after epinephrine use for patients experiencing a "prompt, complete, and durable response" to treatment. This offers a contextualized "watchful waiting" approach. AAPs may not include newly approved nasal epinephrine or differentiate anaphylaxis presentations by age.

Objective

To develop an updated AAP.

Methods

A prototype AAP was iteratively developed incorporating a "watchful waiting" approach, the nasal epinephrine option, and age-specific anaphylaxis symptom presentations among a team of anaphylaxis experts and patient and advocacy stakeholders to assess medical accuracy, readability, clarity, and bias. This underwent validated assessment of decisional acceptability, decisional conflict, and decisional self-efficacy in a sample of stakeholders with children at risk for anaphylaxis, or at risk themselves.

Results

We developed a 2-page written plan (Flesch-Kincaid reading level 5.9) explaining management choices for severe and nonsevere reactions, indications for watchful waiting vs emergency medical services activation after epinephrine use, updated medication options, and age-based symptom differentiation. A total of 229 stakeholders assessed the AAP, noting good acceptability, high decisional self-efficacy (mean score 86.2/100, SD 15.9), and moderate decisional conflict (mean score 43.7/100, SD 18.8). Decisional conflict was unrelated to past anaphylaxis or epinephrine use. Information content was clear and sufficiently explained options with balanced and without a "best choice" bias. Overall, 86% of the respondents would recommend using this AAP.

Conclusion

This is the first validated AAP incorporating preference-sensitive post-epinephrine management options consistent with updated North American guidelines, newly approved nasal epinephrine, and age-specific anaphylaxis presentation.

### First-generation antihistamines and seizures in young children [^1113K7RY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The widespread use of antihistamines in children for treatment of common cold symptoms and their central nervous system effects, like drowsiness, underscore the importance of being aware of the associated risks.

Objective

To assess associations between prescriptions of first-generation antihistamines and seizures in children using a comprehensive and nationwide dataset.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used a self-controlled case-crossover design. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service database in Korea. Children born between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2005, who visited the emergency department for seizure events (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, codes R56.8, G40, and G41) during the follow-up period were included. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2019, and data were analyzed from June 3, 2023, to January 30, 2024.

Exposure

First-generation antihistamine prescription.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome consisted of an index seizure event. Odds ratios (ORs) for seizure events were estimated using a conditional logistic regression model, comparing first-generation antihistamine prescription 1 to 15 days before seizure (hazard period) against control period 1 (31–45 days before the event) and control period 2 (61–75 days before the event) using the same period windows. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine the association with individual participant characteristics.

Results

Of 11 729 children who had a seizure event, 3178 (1776 [55.9%] boys) were identified as having been prescribed antihistamines during the hazard or the control period, but not both. Seizure events were predominantly observed in children aged 6 to 24 months (985 [31.0%]) and 25 months to 6 years (1445 [45.5%]). During the hazard period, 1476 first-generation antihistamine prescriptions were recorded, in contrast to 1239 and 1278 prescriptions during control periods 1 and 2, respectively. After multiple confounder adjustments, first-generation antihistamine prescription was associated with an increased seizure event risk during the hazard period (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.22 [95% CI, 1.13–1.31]). Stratified subgroup analyses showed consistent results, particularly in children aged 6 to 24 months who were prescribed first-generation antihistamines having a higher risk (AOR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.31–1.70]) than children aged 25 months to 6 years (AOR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.00–1.24]; p = 0.04 for interaction). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses, including adjustment for exposure window periods, evaluation of new first-generation antihistamine prescriptions, comparison of control points from the same period 1 year prior, and exclusion of individuals using combination drugs, confirmed a similarly high risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, prescriptions for first-generation antihistamines were associated with a 22.0% higher seizure risk in children, especially in those aged 6 to 24 months. These findings emphasize the need for careful and judicious prescription of first-generation antihistamines in young children and underline the need for further research to elucidate associations between antihistamine prescriptions and seizure risk.

### Allergy relief for your child… [^116SpnUo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration regulates nonprescription and prescription medicines that offer allergy relief, as well as allergen extracts used to diagnose and treat allergies. Take care to read and follow the directions provided when giving any medicine to children, including these products. It may help to keep windows closed in your house and car and run the air conditioner. Allergy Medicines for Children For most children, symptoms may be controlled by avoiding the allergen, if known, and using nonprescription medicines. But if a child's symptoms are persistent and not relieved by nonprescription medicines, see a health care professional. Always read the product label to make sure a medication is right for your child's age. Some OTC allergy medicines are approved for children as young as 6 months — but not all. Just because a product's box says it's intended for children, doesn't mean it is intended for children of all ages.

If your child is taking more than one medication, read the label to be sure that the active ingredients aren't the same. Different products marketed to treat different symptoms might still have the same active ingredient. The result: Your child might be taking too much of one type of medicine. Children are more sensitive than adults to many drugs. For example, some antihistamines can have harmful side effects at lower doses in young patients, causing excitability or excessive drowsiness. Allergy Shots and Children Children who don't respond to other nonprescription or prescription medications, or who suffer from frequent complications of allergic rhinitis, may be candidates for allergen immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots. After allergy testing, typically by skin testing to detect what allergens your child may react to, a health care professional injects the child with "extracts, " small amounts of the allergens that trigger a reaction.

The doses are gradually increased so that the body builds up immunity to these allergens. Allergen extracts are manufactured from natural substances, such as pollens, insect venoms, and animal hair. More than 1, 200 extracts are licensed by the FDA. In the last 20 years, there has been a remarkable transformation in allergy treatments. Children used to be miserable for months out of the year, and drugs made them incredibly sleepy. Today's products offer proven approaches for relief of seasonal allergy symptoms.

### Use caution when giving cough and cold products to kids… [^1145koLb]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Safety Information for Parents and Caregivers Children under 2 years of age should not be given any kind of cough and cold product that contains a decongestant or antihistamine because serious and possibly life-threatening side effects could occur. Reported side effects of these products included convulsions, rapid heart rates and death. What about older children. When giving cough and cold medicine to children over 2 years of age, parents and caregivers should use caution. A meeting about the safety and effectiveness of cough and cold drug product use in children by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007 revealed that there were many reports of harm, and even death, in children who used these products. During 2004–2005, an estimated 1, 519 children less than 2 years of age were treated in U. S. emergency departments for adverse events, including overdoses, associated with cough and cold medications.

Manufacturers voluntarily removed over-the-counter infant cough and cold products intended for children under 2 years of age due to these safety concerns. Treating Toddlers and Older Children Cough and cold products for children older than 2 years of age were not affected by the voluntary removal and these products are still sold in pharmacies and other retail outlets. Manufactures also voluntarily re-labeled these cough and cold products to state: " do not use in children under 4 years of age". Parents need to be aware that many OTC cough and cold products contain multiple ingredients which can lead to accidental overdosing. Reading the Drug Facts label can help parents learn about what drugs are in a product. When giving children 4 years of age and older a cough and cold product, remember, OTC cough and cold products can be harmful if:

- more than the recommended amount is used
- they are given too often
- more than one product containing the same drug is being used. Children should not be given medicines that are packaged and made for adults. Other Options for Treating Colds Here are a few alternative treatments for infants to help with cough and cold symptoms:

- Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used to reduce fever, aches and pains. Parents should carefully read and follow the product's instructions for use on the Drug Facts label
- Drinking plenty of liquids will help children stay hydrated.
