## Question

Regalin

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "Regalin". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Regalin" is a known drug name or a misspelling. Then, I should verify the most likely intended drug and its core pharmacology. Next, I will review FDA-approved indications and dosing. After that, I need to examine efficacy data by condition and safety, including boxed warnings. Finally, I will consider special populations, practical prescribing pearls, and off-label considerations, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding with a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the identity, because "Regalin" does not map to a recognized medication in the provided sources; wait, let me verify the closest match. Given context and common misspellings, the intended drug is almost certainly pregabalin, which is repeatedly referenced across FDA labels and clinical reviews, so I will proceed using pregabalin as the target and explicitly note the name correction for clarity [^4c031a7d] [^18f1e21e].

> I need to check the mechanism of action next. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in CNS tissues, reducing calcium-dependent release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine, and substance P; importantly, it does not bind GABA-A or GABA-B receptors despite being a GABA analogue, and it does not inhibit monoamine reuptake, which helps explain its analgesic, anxiolytic, and antiseizure effects without direct GABAergic receptor agonism [^4c031a7d] [^aa4d0c06] [^0ca13956].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacokinetics because dosing and titration depend on it. Pregabalin has high oral bioavailability (≥ 90%), linear pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption with peak at about 1.5 hours, minimal protein binding, no significant hepatic metabolism, and renal elimination with a half-life around 6 hours; food delays absorption and lowers Cmax but does not meaningfully change total exposure, and dose adjustments are required in renal impairment, which I will revisit shortly [^12d72e87] [^7a899331] [^505d83ec].

> Next, I should review FDA-approved indications and typical dosing. Pregabalin is approved for neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and spinal cord injury; for fibromyalgia; as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures; and for generalized anxiety disorder in some regions; dosing commonly starts at 150 mg/day and is titrated to 300–600 mg/day depending on indication and tolerability, with flexible dosing strategies often used in practice to balance efficacy and adverse effects [^4c031a7d] [^f10c7a32] [^2c0f4f9a].

> I will now examine efficacy by condition, starting with neuropathic pain. High-quality evidence shows pregabalin provides clinically meaningful pain relief in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, with dose-related response and NNTs for ≥ 50% pain reduction around 4–6 at 600 mg/day; benefits are smaller but still present in some mixed or central neuropathic pain syndromes, whereas evidence is limited or negative in HIV neuropathy and chronic low back pain, so I should be cautious about overgeneralization [^18f1e21e] [^27c9c89e] [^ece73155].

> Let me consider fibromyalgia specifically. Multiple randomized trials and Cochrane analyses demonstrate that pregabalin 300–600 mg/day increases the likelihood of moderate and substantial pain relief, improves sleep, and enhances quality of life, with NNTs around 7–14 for clinically meaningful benefit; adverse effects are common but often manageable with slow titration and dose adjustment [^e3019416] [^70bc1f1f].

> For epilepsy, I should confirm adjunctive therapy data. Pregabalin as add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy roughly doubles the odds of a ≥ 50% seizure reduction versus placebo, with a clear dose–response and evidence for seizure freedom in a subset; however, tolerability wanes at higher doses, and comparative data suggest similar or inferior efficacy versus some active controls in certain contexts, so individualized selection is key [^aa9d637f] [^162c346d].

> Now, I need to ensure I address anxiety. Pregabalin 150–600 mg/day has consistent efficacy in generalized anxiety disorder across randomized trials, with relatively rapid onset and favorable tolerability compared with some alternatives, though somnolence and dizziness remain common and dose-related [^2c0f4f9a].

> Safety is critical, so I should double-check boxed warnings and common adverse effects. The FDA warns of increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior with antiepileptics including pregabalin, observed as early as week 1 and persisting through treatment; other key risks include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, weight gain, blurred vision, and rare angioedema; abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal and rebound symptoms, so tapering over at least 1 week is advised; respiratory depression can occur, especially with CNS depressants or underlying respiratory disease, warranting caution and monitoring [^1ea08a35] [^5cb084f5] [^e5b1d171] [^40f69505].

> But wait, what about special populations and practical pearls. In chronic kidney disease, dose must be reduced in proportion to creatinine clearance to avoid accumulation and neurotoxicity; in older adults, start low and go slow due to higher susceptibility to sedation and falls; in pregnancy, data are limited and risk–benefit discussions are essential; for perioperative pain, pregabalin can modestly reduce opioid consumption but increases sedation, so patient selection and dosing matter; for combination therapy, pairing with duloxetine or tramadol may yield additive or synergistic effects in refractory neuropathic pain, though evidence quality varies and monitoring for CNS depression is necessary [^505d83ec] [^a63199a6] [^13ad2f8a] [^20a1a639] [^722740cf].

> I should confirm off-label realities and counsel accordingly. Despite widespread off-label use for various pain syndromes, high-quality evidence is sparse for many conditions, so clinicians should communicate uncertainty, monitor closely, and reassess early; professional society guidance often remains neutral or recommends caution outside approved indications, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and periodic deprescribing trials when benefit is unclear [^c69f3984] [^fc032740].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting statements before concluding. Earlier I implied pregabalin is a controlled substance; wait, I should verify scheduling because this varies by jurisdiction. In the U.S., pregabalin is a Schedule V controlled substance due to abuse potential, whereas gabapentin is federally unscheduled though some states have moved to schedule it; I should explicitly note this jurisdictional nuance to avoid overgeneralization [^fc032740].

> In summary, pregabalin is a first-line, mechanistically distinct alpha2-delta ligand with predictable pharmacokinetics and broad clinical utility across approved indications, offering meaningful benefit to a subset of patients with neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, focal epilepsy, and generalized anxiety, while requiring careful dose titration, renal dosing, and vigilance for CNS adverse effects, abuse potential, and withdrawal; individualized risk–benefit assessment and transparent counseling are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize harm [^4c031a7d] [^18f1e21e] [^e3019416] [^aa9d637f] [^2c0f4f9a].

12. Clinical Pharmacology

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results with genetically modified mice and with compounds structurally related to pregabalin (such as gabapentin) suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects in animals. In animal models of nerve damage, pregabalin has been shown to reduce calcium-dependent release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, possibly by disrupting alpha2-delta containing-calcium channel trafficking and/or reducing calcium currents. Evidence from other animal models of nerve damage and persistent pain suggest the anti-nociceptive activities of pregabalin may also be mediated through interactions with descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways originating from the brainstem that modulate pain transmission in the spinal cord.

While pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma­-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB, or benzodiazepine receptors, does not augment GABAA responses in cultured neurons, does not alter rat brain GABA concentration or have acute effects on GABA uptake or degradation. However, in cultured neurons prolonged application of pregabalin increases the density of GABA transporter protein and increases the rate of functional GABA transport. Pregabalin does not block sodium channels, is not active at opiate receptors, and does not alter cyclooxygenase enzyme activity. It is inactive at serotonin and dopamine receptors and does not inhibit dopamine, serotonin, or noradrenaline reuptake.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pregabalin extended-release tablets has linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increases in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 82.5 mg/day to 660 mg/day. Following repeated administration, steady state is achieved within approximately 48 to 72 hours.

Pregabalin extended-release tablets administered once daily following an evening meal has equivalent AUC and lower Cmaxrelative to a comparative dose of LYRICA administered without food twice daily (Table 5). Variability in Cmaxand AUC for pregabalin extended-release tablets is less than or equal to 25%.

### A review of the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance across multiple clinical conditions [^5d11f079]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pregabalin is approved for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions and its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties are well documented. Pregabalin's effects on sleep, however, are less well known. This review summarizes the published data on the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance associated with neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless legs syndrome, partial onset seizures and general anxiety disorder. The data demonstrate that pregabalin has a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with several different clinical conditions. Polysomnographic data reveal that pregabalin primarily affects sleep maintenance. The evidence indicates that pregabalin has a direct effect on sleep that is distinct from its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^2983a3c0]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the treatment response over the first 6 weeks of clinical trials of flexible-dose pregabalin in all chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is an approved treatment option to determine when patients first respond to treatment and when new AEs emerge or worsen. In these trials, it was decided on a weekly basis over the first 3–4 weeks of the trial if each patient’s dose should be adjusted based on pain relief and AEs, after which patients completed the trial receiving their optimal dose. As the pregabalin dose was tailored to the patient’s needs, this type of study design is a better representation of real-world clinical practice–than a fixed-dose design, used to establish, typically for regulatory purposes, an effective dosing range for a population rather than an individual.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^dd4bd6ba]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA; however, its mechanism of action is distinct from GABAergic modulation and is yet to be fully elucidated. Pain relief usually occurs within 1 week of initiating therapy and is thought to be mediated via high-affinity binding to the alpha2-delta subunit (α2δ) of voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic terminals. This results in modulation of the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate through the glutamate synthesising enzyme, branched-chain amino acid transaminase.

Pregabalin’s mechanism of action is similar to that of gabapentin; however, it has 2–4 times more potency and thus a lower dosing strategy is required. Typically starting doses range from 75 to 150 mg per day for neuropathic pain, with relatively quick up-titration over several weeks to maximal tolerated doses (600 mg/day) due to the more linear pharmacokinetics compared with gabapentin. It has high bioavailability (≥ 90% rapidly absorbed) with a half-life of approximately 9 h. Very common adverse effects (> 10% of patients) include dizziness, somnolence and headache. Pregabalin demonstrates quick absorption, reducing the probability of drug-drug interactions as it is not bound to plasma proteins and does not undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver. Although pregabalin poses low risk for addiction and drug dependence at therapeutic doses, recent statistics in England and Wales showed a > 20-fold increase in the number of deaths linked to pregabalin—4 to 111 deaths from 2012 to 2016, whilst for gabapentin—8 to 59 deaths during the same period. Rapid rise in mortality is associated with individuals with previous history of recreational polydrug misuse, or misuse in combination with opioids, as some report self-administration of dosages in excess (e.g. up to 10–20 times) of clinically advisable dosages. Consequently, this led to guidance from Public Health England and the NHS on safe prescribing of both pregabalin and gabapentin. However, in December 2017 NHS England launched a consultation to seek views on whether to schedule pregabalin and gabapentin as Controlled drugs in the UK. A similar consultation is underway with the WHO and a decision is expected in early 2019. Due to their “risk of addiction, potential illegal diversion and medicinal misuse” by a minority, the reclassification of these drugs will have major repercussions on the many millions of people suffering from neuropathic pain, as it will restrict prescribing and also prevent them from acquiring the drug on a repeat prescription.

### Efficacy and safety of pregabalin in generalised anxiety disorder: a critical review of the literature [^2c0f4f9a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to summarise the literature on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Of 241 literature citations, 13 clinical trials were identified that were specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in GAD, including 11 randomised double-blind trials and two open-label studies. Pregabalin efficacy has been consistently demonstrated across the licensed dose range of 150-600 mg/day. Efficacy has been reported for pregabalin monotherapy in elderly patients with GAD, patients with severe anxiety, and for adjunctive therapy when added to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in patients who have failed to respond to an initial course of antidepressant therapy. The two most common adverse events with pregabalin are somnolence and dizziness, both of which appear to be dose-related. Pregabalin appears to have a low potential for causing withdrawal symptoms when long-term therapy is discontinued; however, tapering over the course of at least one week is recommended. A review of available evidence indicates that pregabalin is a well-tolerated and consistently effective treatment for GAD, with a unique mechanism of action that makes it a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### Perioperative use of pregabalin for acute pain-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^20a1a639]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence supporting postoperative pain management using pregabalin as an adjunct intervention across various surgical pain models is lacking. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate "model-specific" comparative effectiveness and harms of pregabalin following a previously published systematic review protocol. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception through August 2013. Data were screened and single extraction with independent verification and dual risk of bias assessment was performed. Quality of evidence (QoE) was rated using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were pain relief at rest and on movement and reduction in postoperative analgesic consumption. A total of 1423 records were screened, and 43 studies were included. Perioperative pregabalin resulted in: 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9%-21%) reduction in analgesic consumption (moderate QoE, 24 trials) and a small reduction in the magnitude of pain in surgeries associated with pronociceptive pain. Per 1000 patients, 10 more will experience blurred vision (95% CI, 5-20 more; moderate QoE, 17 trials) and 41 more sedation (95% CI, 13-77 more, 17 trials). To prevent 1 case of perioperative nausea and vomiting, the number needed to treat is 11 (95% CI: 7-28, 25 trials). Inadequate evidence addressed outcomes of enhanced recovery and serious harms. Pregabalin analgesic effectiveness is largely restricted to surgical procedures associated with pronociceptive mechanisms. The clinical significance of observed pregabalin benefits must be weighed against the uncertainties about serious harms and enhanced recovery to inform the careful selection of surgical patients. Recommendations for future research are proposed.

### Pregabalin: its pharmacology and use in pain management [^0ca13956]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Pregabalin is a new synthetic molecule and a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is an alpha2-delta (alpha2-delta) ligand that has analgesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sleep-modulating activities. Pregabalin binds potently to the alpha2-delta subunit of calcium channels, resulting in a reduction in the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, and substance P. In this review, I will discuss the pharmacology of pregabalin and available efficacy studies in pain management. This review will focus on the advances in pregabalin pharmacology since my previous review in 2005.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^89df8fb9]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that many patients who do not respond to pregabalin at lower doses will subsequently respond when the dose is increased. Physicians are advised to follow treatment guidelines and escalate pregabalin to the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects.

### Expert opinion: exploring the effectiveness and tolerability of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch and pregabalin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^bd55f58a]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The mechanism of action of pregabalin is not completely understood, but it is an antagonist of voltage-gated calcium ion channels and is thought to bind to the alpha-2-delta subunit.This action is thought to reduce the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, and substance P, reducing neuronal excitability and alleviating allodynia and hyperalgesia.Pregabalin is administered orally and is rapidly absorbed from the intestines, with ~90% bioavailability.It is excreted almost exclusively via the kidneys.It is also known to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the CNS.

### Discovery and development of pregabalin (lyrica): the role of public funding [^f3673d1f]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Pregabalin (Lyrica), a widely used drug that has generated billions in revenue as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy and other conditions, was originally discovered in an academic medical center, largely supported by public funding. We aimed to define the extent of direct federal public funding that contributed to various stages of pregabalin's development prior to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.

Methods

We identified key research, scientists, and organizations involved in the development of pregabalin from its discovery through FDA approval. Using key terms (e.g., its indications and mechanism of action), we searched PubMed for relevant publications and determined whether each publication was based on federal public funding using the NIH RePORTER. For each award prior to the drug's FDA approval, we scored its potential relatedness to pregabalin's development based on its title, investigator, and organization, and then examined descriptions of the most relevant awards to aid in defining these relationships. The budgets for all related awards were converted to 2020 dollars.

Results

Pregabalin was discovered largely on the basis of publicly funded research at Northwestern University; in 1990, it was licensed to Parke-Davis, which further developed it through its FDA approval in 2004. Most key terms were related to the drug and drug target (n = 5) and organizations involved (n = 5), followed by patent-listed inventors (n = 3). These key terms linked 6,438 core project awards and we identified 37 NIH awards related to pregabalin's development: 9 awards through 1990 ($3.3 million) and 28 from 1991 through 2004 ($10.5 million).

Conclusion

Like that of many other widely sold medications, the development of pregabalin relied on public sector as well as industry contributions to its discovery, with relevant NIH awards totaling $13.8 million during its preapproval development.

### Pregabalin [^b9b28b3c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

### Pregabalin in the treatment of depression [^f107cb0b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Although studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the new anti-epileptic on the block, Pregabalin, in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder, there is no study so far of such efficacy for the treatment of depression. This case study in a patient with chronic major depression demonstrates that Pregabalin could be an effective augmenting agent to other anti-depressants, e.g. SSRI's and SNRI's. This added property of Pregabalin may be related to its probable GABA-ergic mechanism of action that could be soon the emerging treatment pathway for achieving better remission in chronic depression that is yet clinically problematic.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^aa9d637f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review last published in Issue 7, 2019; it includes two additional studies. Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs that has been developed to improve outcomes. In this review we summarised the current evidence regarding pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 16 November 2020: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 16 November 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Epilepsy. We imposed no language restrictions. We contacted the manufacturers of pregabalin and authors in the field to identify any relevant unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT). We presented summary risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 randomised controlled trials (3949 participants). Nine trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.72, 9 trials, 2663 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.60; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.64; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12; 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12; 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine for seizure freedom (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83). However, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We detected no significant differences in treatment withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse effects, specifically, during either pooled analysis or subgroup analysis. Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, headache and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin than in active control. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We assessed all the studies to be at a high risk of funding bias as they were all sponsored by Pfizer. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

For people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment was significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, although there were issues with tolerability at higher doses. However, the trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making. This review focused on the use of pregabalin in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of pregabalin when used as monotherapy.

### Central nervous system targets: supraspinal mechanisms of analgesia [^88f79882]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

This is not necessarily the case for all anti-convulsants. The anti-hyperalgesic action of the α-2 δ ligands, gabapentin and pregabalin, is attributable to upregulation of the α-2 δ-1 accessory subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in sensory neurons and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The gabapentinoids have supraspinal mechanisms of action despite spinal actions in controlling afferent inputs. What is the supraspinal circuitry involved? Injury-specific interactions between pregabalin and RVM MOR cells is not a permissive factor for pregabalin analgesia when applied to visceral pain, and opioid receptors are not necessary for the antiallodynic action of pregabalin in the context of NeP pain. At the supraspinal level, gabapentin engages descending inhibitory controls in the brainstem to indirectly regulate spinal nociceptive processing. Interestingly, ACC gabapentin may induce a pain-relieving effect without concurrent blockade of mechanical allodynia. Whether or not direct ACC microinjection of gabapentin is representative of what occurs following systemic gabapentin injection is a valid question. Intracerebroventricular injection of the same drug is rewarding in the presence of injury and reliant on the engagement of descending inhibitory controls. In a centrally driven rodent pain model, pregabalin-mediated analgesia in the absence of a peripheral pathology reflects upregulation of a serotonergic facilitatory system, presumably projecting supraspinally to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Further evidence implicating higher brain center involvement in gabapentinoid-mediated analgesia was provided by a study that quantified CeA evoked and spontaneous activity. Both were increased in nerve ligated versus control rats and systemic pregabalin reduced the hyperexcitability in this brain region that was associated with disease progression.

### Pregabalin for neuropathic pain in adults [^18f1e21e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled "Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults", and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment.Postherpetic neuralgia: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (50% vs 25%; RR 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 2.6); NNTB 3.9 (3.0 to 5.6); 3 studies, 589 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (32% vs 13%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.4); NNTB 5.3 (3.9 to 8.1); 4 studies, 713 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (62% vs 24%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2); NNTB 2.7 (2.2 to 3.7); 3 studies, 537 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 15%; RR 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.5); NNTB 3.9 (3.1 to 5.5); 4 studies, 732 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 16% versus 5.5%, 600 mg 25% versus 5.8%; dizziness 300 mg 29% versus 8.1%, 600 mg 35% versus 8.8%.Painful diabetic neuropathy: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (47% vs 42%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.2); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 8 studies, 2320 participants, moderate-quality evidence), more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (31% vs 24%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 11 studies, 2931 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had PGIC much or very much improved (51% vs 30%; RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0); NNTB 4.9 (3.8 to 6.9); 5 studies, 1050 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (63% vs 52%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.4); NNTB 9.6 (5.5 to 41); 2 studies, 611 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 28%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7); NNTB 7.8 (5.4 to 14); 5 studies, 1015 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 11% versus 3.1%, 600 mg 15% versus 4.5%; dizziness 300 mg 13% versus 3.8%, 600 mg 22% versus 4.4%.Mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (48% vs 36%; RR 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4); NNTB 8.2 (5.7 to 15); 4 studies, 1367 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (34% vs 20%; RR 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9); NNTB 7.2 (5.4 to 11); 4 studies, 1367 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence (12% vs 3.9%) and dizziness (23% vs 6.2%) were more common with pregabalin.Central neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (44% vs 28%; RR 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0); NNTB 5.9 (4.1 to 11); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence) and at least 50% pain intensity reduction (26% vs 15%; RR 1.7 (1.2 to 2.3); NNTB 9.8 (6.0 to 28); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence (32% vs 11%) and dizziness (23% vs 8.6%) were more common with pregabalin.Other neuropathic pain conditions: Studies show no evidence of benefit for 600 mg pregabalin in HIV neuropathy (2 studies, 674 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and limited evidence of benefit in neuropathic back pain or sciatica, neuropathic cancer pain, or polyneuropathy.Serious adverse events, all conditions: Serious adverse events were no more common with placebo than with pregabalin 300 mg (3.1% vs 2.6%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 17 studies, 4112 participants, high-quality evidence) or pregabalin 600 mg (3.4% vs 3.4%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.5); 16 studies, 3995 participants, high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.

### Genotype-dependence of gabapentin and pregabalin sensitivity: the pharmacogenetic mediation of analgesia is specific to the type of pain being inhibited [^ae35dc6e]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

The antiepileptic drug, gabapentin, and another structurally related compound, pregabalin, are increasingly employed in the pharmacotherapy of chronic pain states, although their primary mechanism of action remains a topic of active study. A genomic approach to the study of these drugs may elucidate their potentially novel mechanisms. We examined the heritability of sensitivity to analgesia from gabapentin and pregabalin as a precursor to linkage mapping efforts. Accordingly, 11 inbred mouse strains were tested for inhibition of nociception by gabapentin or pregabalin (50-300 mg/kg, i.p.) in two different preclinical assays of inflammatory pain, the formalin test (5% formalin; 20 microl) and zymosan thermal hyperalgesia on the paw-withdrawal test (3 mg/ml zymosan; 20 microl). Significant strain-dependence of drug action was noted in each case, indicating that sensitivity to these analgesics is heritable. Furthermore, the pattern of strain sensitivities to gabapentin and pregabalin were mostly similar, supporting the notion that they act via similar genetic and physiological mechanisms. However, there was virtually no correlation between strain sensitivities to pregabalin inhibition of formalin nociception and zymosan thermal hyperalgesia. In light of previous data from our laboratory and others regarding morphine analgesia, we now establish and empirically demonstrate the general principle that pharmacogenetic mechanisms underlying analgesic sensitivity are specific to the type of pain being inhibited. This has considerable implications for ongoing pharmacogenetic investigations and, more generally, for the choices of preclinical models of pain used in drug development.

### Pregabalin [^12d72e87]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pregabalin is well absorbed after oral administration, is eliminated largely by renal excretion, and has an elimination half-life of about 6 hours.

Absorption and Distribution

Following oral administration of pregabalin capsules under fasting conditions, peak plasma concentrations occur within 1.5 hours. Pregabalin oral bioavailability is greater than or equal to 90% and is independent of dose. Following single- (25 to 300 mg) and multiple-dose (75 to 900 mg/day) administration, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values increase linearly. Following repeated administration, steady state is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics can be predicted from single-dose data.

The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food, resulting in a decrease in Cmax of approximately 25% to 30% and an increase in Tmax to approximately 3 hours. However, administration of pregabalin with food has no clinically relevant effect on the total absorption of pregabalin. Therefore, pregabalin can be taken with or without food.

Pregabalin does not bind to plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution of pregabalin following oral administration is approximately 0.5 L/kg. Pregabalin is a substrate for system L transporter which is responsible for the transport of large amino acids across the blood brain barrier. Although there are no data in humans, pregabalin has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in mice, rats, and monkeys. In addition, pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of lactating rats.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of pregabalin preclinical studies [^ecae1ac7]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite large efforts to test analgesics in animal models, only a handful of new pain drugs have shown efficacy in patients. Here, we report a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies of the commercially successful drug pregabalin. Our primary objective was to describe design characteristics and outcomes of studies testing the efficacy of pregabalin in behavioral models of pain. Secondarily, we examined the relationship between design characteristics and effect sizes. We queried MEDLINE, Embase, and BIOSIS to identify all animal studies testing the efficacy of pregabalin published before January 2018 and recorded experimental design elements addressing threats to validity and all necessary data for calculating effect sizes, expressed as the percentage of maximum possible effect. We identified 204 studies (531 experiments) assessing the efficacy of pregabalin in behavioral models of pain. The analgesic effect of pregabalin was consistently robust across every etiology/measure tested, even for pain conditions that have not responded to pregabalin in patients. Experiments did not generally report using design elements aimed at reducing threats to validity, and analgesic activity was typically tested in a small number of model systems. However, we were unable to show any clear relationships between preclinical design characteristics and effect sizes. Our findings suggest opportunities for improving the design and reporting of preclinical studies in pain. They also suggest that factors other than those explored in this study may be more important for explaining the discordance between outcomes in animal models of pain and those in clinical trials.

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^55f83c38]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin extended-release tablets must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Inform patients, their caregivers, and families that pregabalin extended-release tablets can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Report behaviors of concern immediately to healthcare providers.

### Pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults [^e3019416]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane review on 'Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults' (Moore 2009), and considers only fibromyalgia pain.Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia. Pain response with pregabalin is associated with major benefits for other symptoms, and improved quality of life and function in people with chronic painful conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults, compared with placebo or any active comparator.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials from inception to May 2009 for the original review and to 16 March 2016 for this update. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of eight weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin with placebo or another active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, and reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on PGIC). Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat (NNT), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

Our searches identified two new published studies with classic design, and one new published study with an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design.We included eight studies. Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment. No studies included active comparators. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect.Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment (450 mg: RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.1, 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence)). Substantial benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 14% of participants with placebo, but about 9% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (22% to 24%) (high quality evidence). Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment) (450 mg: RR 1.5, 95% CI (1.3 to 1.7), 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence). Moderate benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 28% of participants with placebo, but about 11% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (39% to 43%) (high quality evidence). A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC of 'very much improved' and 'much or very much improved'. NNTs for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14 (high quality evidence).A small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily pregabalin, and concluded there was no difference in effect.Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration, 687 participants randomised) had an EERW design in which those with good pain relief after titration were randomised, double blind, to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg pregabalin daily) or a short down-titration to placebo for 13 or 26 weeks. We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit. Of those randomised, 40% had MTR with pregabalin and 20% with placebo (high quality evidence). The NNT was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12. About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design. MTR had no imputation concerns.The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events. Specific adverse events were more common with pregabalin than placebo, in particular dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema, with number needed to harm of 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined (high quality evidence). Serious adverse events did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo (very low quality evidence). Withdrawals for any reason were more common with pregabalin than placebo only with the 600 mg dose in studies of classic design. Withdrawals due to adverse events were about 10% higher with pregabalin than placebo, but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable adverse events for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo) with moderate or severe pain due to fibromyalgia. The degree of pain relief is known to be accompanied by improvements in other symptoms, quality of life, and function. These results are similar to other effective medicines in fibromyalgia (milnacipran, duloxetine).

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^3fe5deea]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Key points

Question Is pregabalin efficacious and tolerable for the treatment of chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain?

Findings In a double-blind, randomized international study of 542 evaluable patients (pregabalin n = 274) of whom approximately half had post-surgical neuropathic pain, the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo in change from baseline to week 15 (p = 0.1823). However, comparisons for key secondary outcome measures yielded p values < 0.05 favoring pregabalin. Safety and tolerability were consistent with the known profile of pregabalin.

Meaning Additional studies are needed to characterize the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin for chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain.

### Routine prescribing of gabapentin or pregabalin in supportive and palliative care: what are the comparative performances of the medications in a palliative care population? [^605c5e1e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a prevalent and distressing problem faced by people with life-limiting illness that is often difficult to palliate. Gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed as part of the routine approach to palliating neuropathic pain. Although they are often viewed as interchangeable agents, very little comparative data of their benefits and harms exists in clinical practice. Two previously reported pharmacovigilance studies that had used the same methodology for gabapentin and pregabalin were compared. These studies examined the benefits and harms of gabapentin and pregabalin after the medications had been routinely prescribed by clinicians working in a network of palliative care services using the same data collection tools with the same definitions and the same time points. Data were collected over 21 days from 282 patients prescribed either gabapentin or pregabalin for pain. Items included medication doses, pain scores, and adverse effects. In order to compare the medication responses, the final doses of pregabalin were converted to gabapentin does equivalents using previously published recommendations. The final pain scores were similar for both groups, and the reduction in pain were similar (OR=11.2; 95 % CI 3.9, 32.7, p<0.001). However, this was achieved at lower doses of gabapentin compared to pregabalin. Those receiving gabapentin were more likely to experience harms (OR=3.5; 95 % CI 1.4, 9.1, p=0.009) with the reported harms including somnolence, ataxia, nausea, tremor and nystagmus This hypothesis-generating work strongly supports the need for further trials to best delineate clinical differences in the GABA analogues.

### Rational dosing of gabapentin and pregabalin in chronic kidney disease [^a63199a6]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used for neuropathic pain in CKD patients but are not fully understood as this population remains excluded from efficacy and safety trials. Renal adjustments for the gabapentinoids are prodigiously recommended in the literature. However, current guidance is based on pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies, but studies confirming efficacy of these dosing strategies are lacking. Considering their widespread use for numerous neuropathic pain conditions, studies evaluating their efficacy at recommended doses in renal impairment should be a priority for future research.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: findings from seven randomized, controlled trials across a range of doses [^0309a4dd]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS—

In this pooled analysis of patients with painful DPN from seven randomized, controlled trials spanning the effective dose range, pregabalin was shown to significantly reduce pain associated with DPN. The pooled analysis, in contrast to individual reports, revealed efficacy of the 150-mg dose; however, efficacy with BID dosing was only present with the 600-mg dose. In addition, time to event analysis revealed that pregabalin was associated with a dose-related, rapid onset of sustained pain relief.

Several anticonvulsants with diverse mechanisms of action have been subjected to large-scale randomized controlled trials assessing therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of painful DPN. These agents, which include topiramate (–), lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and gabapentin (–) have shown varying efficacy in clinical trials.

In contrast, pregabalin has shown efficacy in six of seven clinical trials. Among the seven trials, one included 150-, 300-, and 600-mg/day treatment arms, two included two of these dosages, and four included only one of these dosages (Fig. 1 A). Pooling data from all treatment arms in this analysis adds to our knowledge of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin for treatment of painful DPN. In terms of efficacy, there was an evident dose response, with the greatest efficacy observed among patients treated with 600 mg/day. Equally evident from this pooled analysis—but not from examination of the trials individually, as 150 mg/day was not significantly efficacious in any individual study—was the observation that patients treated with pregabalin at its lowest effective dosage for chronic neuropathic pain, 150 mg/day, experienced statistically significant improvements in their pain and pain-related sleep interference and responded to pregabalin (≥30% improvement) in proportions significantly greater than placebo.

### Pregabalin for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy: background and rationale for further study [^5e78d1dd]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is difficult to manage, and the pain associated with neuropathy is poorly responsive to gabapentin in a randomized trial. Duloxetine is the only drug that has been found to be effective in reducing pain from chemotherapy neuropathy. In this qualitative review, the use of pregabalin for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is discussed including the rationale and pharmacological reasons why pregabalin should be considered in a large, randomized placebo-controlled trial.

### Gabapentin or pregabalin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^d4cac770]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin/gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of gabapentin/gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between gabapentin and comparator (placebo, active control, or gabapentin in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We also summarised data on adverse events from all single dosage studies and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Five trials on gabapentin and one trial on its prodrug gabapentin enacarbil met the inclusion criteria; no reports on pregabalin were identified. In total, data from 1009 patients were considered. One trial each of gabapentin 900 mg (53 patients), and gabapentin titrated to 1200 mg (63 patients) and 1800 mg (122 patients) failed to show a statistically significant reduction in headache frequency in the active treatment group as compared to the placebo group, whereas one trial of gabapentin titrated to 1800 to 2400 mg (113 patients) demonstrated a small but statistically significant superiority of active treatment for this outcome (MD -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.55 to -0.05). The pooled results of these four studies (MD -0.44; 95% CI -1.43 to 0.56; 351 patients) do not demonstrate a significant difference between gabapentin and placebo. One trial of gabapentin titrated to 1800 mg (122 patients) failed to demonstrate a significant difference between active treatment and placebo in the proportion of responders (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.11), whereas one trial of gabapentin titrated to 1800 to 2400 mg (113 patients) demonstrated a small but statistically significant superiority of active treatment for this outcome (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.09 to 7.17). The pooled results of these two studies (OR 1.59; 95% CI 0.57 to 4.46; 235 patients) do not demonstrate a significant difference between gabapentin and placebo. Comparisons from one study (135 patients) suggest that gabapentin 2000 mg is no more effective than gabapentin 1200 mg. One trial of gabapentin enacarbil (523 participants) failed to demonstrate a significant difference versus placebo or between doses for gabapentin enacarbil titrated to between 1200 mg and 3000 mg with regard to proportion of responders; there was also no evidence of a dose-response trend. Adverse events, most notably dizziness and somnolence, were common with gabapentin.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled evidence derived from trials of gabapentin suggests that it is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. Since adverse events were common among the gabapentin-treated patients, it is advocated that gabapentin should not be used in routine clinical practice. Gabapentin enacarbil is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. There is no published evidence from controlled trials of pregabalin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults.

### Pregabalin capsules, cv [^06f8f8d3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pregabalin is well absorbed after oral administration, is eliminated largely by renal excretion, and has an elimination half-life of about 6 hours.

Absorption and Distribution

Following oral administration of pregabalin capsules under fasting conditions, peak plasma concentrations occur within 1.5 hours. Pregabalin oral bioavailability is greater than or equal to 90% and is independent of dose. Following single- (25 to 300 mg) and multiple-dose (75 to 900 mg/day) administration, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values increase linearly. Following repeated administration, steady state is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics can be predicted from single-dose data.

The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food, resulting in a decrease in Cmaxof approximately 25% to 30% and an increase in Tmaxto approximately 3 hours. However, administration of pregabalin with food has no clinically relevant effect on the total absorption of pregabalin. Therefore, pregabalin can be taken with or without food.

Pregabalin does not bind to plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution of pregabalin following oral administration is approximately 0.5 L/kg. Pregabalin is a substrate for system L transporter which is responsible for the transport of large amino acids across the blood brain barrier. Although there are no data in humans, pregabalin has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in mice, rats, and monkeys. In addition, pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of lactating rats.

### Pregabalin: a new neuromodulator with broad therapeutic indications [^7e2e4948]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review pregabalin's pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects in the treatment of neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1993-October 2005) for peer-reviewed English-language publications was performed. Abstracts from professional meetings were also included. Key terms were anxiety, diabetic neuropathy, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, pregabalin, and seizures.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Basic pharmacology data were extracted from animal studies; pharmacokinetic data were extracted from human studies. Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies were included to describe the efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin.

Data Synthesis

Pregabalin is a new agent that exerts its pharmacodynamic effect by modulating voltage-gated calcium channels. Pregabalin has a linear pharmacokinetic profile. It is completely absorbed, not bound to plasma proteins, not metabolized, and eliminated unchanged through the kidneys. Doses must be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. Clinical trials showed that pregabalin is effective in neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, in partial epilepsy as adjunctive therapy, and in generalized and social anxiety disorders. The most common adverse effects were dizziness and somnolence. Few serious adverse effects were reported. Pregabalin should not be discontinued rapidly.

Conclusions

Pregabalin is an effective and safe analgesic, antiepileptic, and anxiolytic medicine. It will provide a new treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain and partial epilepsy.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^162c346d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs which have been developed to improve outcomes.This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2014, and includes three new studies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), on 5 July 2018, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 5 July 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (5 July 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 5 July 2018), and contacted Pfizer Ltd, manufacturer of pregabalin, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. We presented results as risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Two review authors assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

We included nine industry-sponsored randomised controlled trials (3327 participants) in the review. Seven trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.42, 7 trials, 2193 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.65, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.88 to 3.74, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence).Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12, 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11, 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12, 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83) for seizure freedom, however, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.52), levetiracetam (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49), or gabapentin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.07) for treatment withdrawal due to any reason or due to adverse effects (pregabalin versus lamotrigine: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48; versus levetiracetam: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.54; versus gabapentin: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.11). Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin.We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant focal epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, however issues with tolerability were noted at higher doses. The trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making.

### Pregabalin rectifies aberrant brain chemistry, connectivity, and functional response in chronic pain patients [^edc36952]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain remains a significant challenge for modern health care as its pathologic mechanisms are largely unknown and preclinical animal models suffer from limitations in assessing this complex subjective experience. However, human brain neuroimaging techniques enable the assessment of functional and neurochemical alterations in patients experiencing chronic pain and how these factors may dynamically change with pharmacologic treatment.

Methods

To identify the clinical action of pregabalin, a proven analgesic, the authors performed three complementary brain neuroimaging procedures: (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging) in 17 chronic pain patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

Results

The authors found that pregabalin but not placebo reduces combined glutamate + glutamine levels within the posterior insula (pregabalin P = 0.016; placebo P = 0.71). Interestingly, reductions in clinical pain were associated with reductions in brain connectivity of this structure to brain regions within the default mode network during pregabalin (r = 0.82; P = 0.001) but not placebo (r = -0.13; P = 0.63). Response of default mode network regions to experimental pain was also reduced with pregabalin (P = 0.018) but not placebo (P = 0.182). Perhaps most importantly, baseline values for all three neuroimaging markers predicted subsequent analgesic response to pregabalin but not placebo.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that pregabalin works in part by reducing insular glutamatergic activity, leading to a reduction of the increased functional connectivity seen between brain regions in chronic pain states. The study also supports a role for human brain imaging in the development, assessment, and personalized use of central-acting analgesics.

### Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults [^ece73155]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is a recently developed antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of pregabalin in acute and chronic pain.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL to May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers and on-line clinical trial databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double blind trials reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the patient as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse events and study withdrawals.

Main Results

There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis.Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia.With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo.Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin has proven efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions and fibromyalgia. A minority of patients will have substantial benefit with pregabalin, and more will have moderate benefit. Many will have no or trivial benefit, or will discontinue because of adverse events. Individualisation of treatment is needed to maximise pain relief and minimise adverse events. There is no evidence to support the use of pregabalin in acute pain scenarios.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^f10c7a32]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin

Pregabalin also belongs to the anticonvulsant categories of medication. Pregabalin acts similarly to gabapentin mechanistically.Pregabalin is FDA-approved for use in the treatment of neuropathic pain from PDN, post-herpetic neuralgia, and spinal cord injury.It is also used for fibromyalgia and partial onset seizure.Pregabalin is available in 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 225 mg, and 300 mg capsules as well as a liquid formulation in 20 mg/mL dosage.The FDA recommends a maximum of 300 mg per day divided into 3 doses for the treatment of PDN; however, in clinical practice, the regimen is more nuanced and varies with patients with a maximum of 300 mg per day. The effectiveness of pregabalin for the treatment of PDN is demonstrated in randomized clinical trials.In one trial, subjects with PDN were randomized to pregabalin 300 mg per day (100 mg three times daily) and a placebo group. After 8 weeks of treatment, the pregabalin group has significantly improved pain VAS scores compared to the placebo group.

Tricyclic Antidepressants

TCAs are a class of antidepressant medication that can be used to alleviate neuropathic pain. It is believed that the mechanism of action of TCAs in neuropathic pain involves multiple pharmacological effects. TCAs are believed to function primarily by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, two neurotransmitters implicated in pain modulation. By increasing the concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, TCAs can enhance the inhibitory pathways that modulate pain transmission. This modulation of neurotransmitter activity may contribute to the analgesic properties of TCAs.Moreover, sodium channel-blocking properties have been discovered in TCAs. By inhibiting sodium channels, particularly voltage-gated sodium channels, TCAs can reduce the aberrant discharge of neurons in neuropathic pain states. By inhibiting the transmission of pain signals, this action functions to decrease pain perception.

### Antiepileptic drugs for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia [^27c9c89e]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antiepileptic drugs associated with reduced pain intensity in patients with neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia?

Bottom Line

In treating diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia compared with placebo, gabapentin and pregabalin are associated with a modest increase in the number of patients experiencing meaningful pain reduction. In treating fibromyalgia, compared with placebo, pregabalin alone is associated with a small increase in the number of patients experiencing meaningful pain reduction. There is insufficient evidence for other antiepileptics.

### Pregabalin monotherapy for epilepsy [^be2f909f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many people with epilepsy suffer from poorly controlled seizures, despite current antiepileptic treatments. Due to high rates of treatment resistance, there is interest in new pharmacological treatment options such as pregabalin. However, it remains unclear whether existing evidence of pregabalin is rigorous enough to support its monotherapy.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in people with epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7 ), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to August 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to August 2012). No language restrictions were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pregabalin with placebo or another antiepileptic drug monotherapy for epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (QZ and LY) independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality. We assessed the following outcomes: (1) time to withdrawal after randomisation; (2) time to achieve six-, 12- or 24-month remission; (3) the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months; (4) time to first seizure after randomisation; (5) validated quality of life measures; (6) health economic outcomes; (7) adverse effects. We expressed time-to-event outcomes as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI), where an HR > 1 indicates an event is more likely to occur earlier on pregabalin than the comparator.

Main Results

Two short-term studies involving 753 participants met the inclusion criteria. Only one study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with lamotrigine in patients with newly diagnosed partial seizures, and the other study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with gabapentin in hospitalised patients with refractory partial epilepsy. There were no studies on generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).We found that pregabalin was inferior in comparison to lamotrigine when measuring time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after dose stabilisation from randomisation: hazard ratio (HR) 4.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 10.60; time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76; the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87 (Europe: 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99; Asia: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; the Americas: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.19); and time to first seizure after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.39. There was no significant difference in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and lamotrigine, but more participants in the pregabalin group developed somnolence, weight increase and convulsion. Pregabalin was better than gabapentin when measuring time to withdrawal due to all reasons after randomisation: HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; and time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after randomisation: HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92. No significant difference was found in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and gabapentin. But we found some limitations in the study design which may have had an influence on the results.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin seems to have similar tolerability but inferior efficacy in comparison to lamotrigine for newly diagnosed partial seizures. However, considering the limitations in the study design (such as the short-term follow-up and the low initial target dose selection), the results should be interpreted with caution. The available data were too limited to draw any conclusions between pregabalin and gabapentin. The result indicated that the treatment effects were influenced by the study regions. The clinical disadvantage of pregabalin was more prominent in Asia when compared with lamotrigine. We should determine whether pregabalin has ethnic differences in the treatment of epilepsy in the future. This review does not inform any treatment policy for patients with generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Further long-term trials are needed to investigate the genuine effectiveness of pregabalin as monotherapy.

### Different gabapentin and pregabalin dosages for perioperative pain control in patients undergoing spine surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^b34759ae]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Successful pain management for patients undergoing spine surgery is essential for patient satisfaction. Adequate postoperative pain control has been linked to better outcomes, lower opioid consumption, shorter hospital stays, and reduced costs. Multimodal analgesia is currently the standard of care for postoperative pain management, and gabapentinoids are often used as part of this approach to decrease neuropathic pain.

Gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, can inhibit central nervous sensitization. Although these 2 drugs have similar mechanisms of action and chemical structures, pregabalin is more potent and takes effect more quickly than gabapentin.In recent years, high-quality evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of using gabapentinoids to treat neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury. A previous meta-analysiswith limited sample size and no head-to-head comparisons found that both gabapentin and pregabalin were effective in reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption following spine surgery compared with placebo. However, new trials with direct comparisons have been published, and the results are conflicting. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety of gabapentin and pregabalin for spine surgery in the perioperative period.

Adjuvant analgesics—gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may lessen neuropathic pain but require caution. They “reduce neuropathic pain by inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels,” and “gabapentinoid use decreases opioid requirements in select populations (e.g., in patients with spinal cord injury or burn),” yet “limited evidence exists to support a broad analgesic effect.” Safety concerns include that “abuse and misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was reported,” the directive to “Use gabapentinoids with caution in patients with or at risk of developing an SUD,” and that they “produce additive CNS depression and increase risk of death when used in combination with opioids.” Because “both pregabalin and gabapentin are renally eliminated,” the page advises to “use lower doses or avoid them in patients with underlying renal disease and in elderly patients.”

### Effect of valproate and pregabalin on human anxiety-like behaviour in a randomised controlled trial [^bb6fe636]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Our paradigm was designed to induce behavioural strategies that resemble those seen in clinical anxiety states, such as passive avoidance and behavioural inhibition. Because the diagnosis of anxiety disorders primarily relies on patients’ introspective assessment, i.e. symptoms rather than signs, it would be useful to assess the feelings induced in healthy persons while being engaged in the task presented here, which was not the focus of the current study. At the same time, it may be informative to assess the behavioural strategies that GAD patients use in our task.

Interestingly, the anxiolytic effects of lorazepam, pregabalin, and valproate are probably mediated via the GABAergic system, but by different mechanisms of action. Lorazepam, like other benzodiazepines, binds allosterically to the GABA (A) receptor and thus increases the impact of GABA. The other two drugs increase GABA levels, but by less well understood mechanisms. Pregabalin does not bind to GABA receptors but to the α 2 δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, and this binding is required for the anxiolytic properties of the drug. Valproate inhibits succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, such reducing the degradation of succinic semialdehyde, which inhibits the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase,. It also acts on non-GABAergic transmission by inhibiting voltage-gated Na channels, and several further mechanisms of action have been speculated, including at the genomic level, but without clear evidence for their relevance even in the main indications for valproate, namely, epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Other antiepileptic drugs potentially acting via GABA-mediated mechanisms are gabapentin, vigabatrin, and tiagabin, which are therefore candidate drugs for future preclinical tests. Once the relevant pathways mediating the anxiolytic action of pregabalin and valproate are elucidated, this could lead to the development of new anxiolytic compounds. We propose all of these substances could be evaluated in our human pre-clinical model, as this would render an investment into large-scale clinical studies more feasible. One concern sometimes raised with respect to rodent approach/avoidance tests is their sensitivity to GABAergic but not other anxiolytic substances such as antidepressants. Investigating the sensitivity of our human model to non-GABAergic anxiolytic as well as non-anxiolytic substances could facilitate the screening of new drugs.

### Benefit and harm of pregabalin in acute pain treatment: a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^e4469780]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Pregabalin has demonstrated anti-hyperalgesic properties and was introduced into acute pain treatment in 2001. Our aim was to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of pregabalin in postoperative pain management. We included randomized clinical trials investigating perioperative pregabalin treatment in adult surgical patients. The review followed Cochrane methodology, including Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), and used trial sequential analyses (TSAs). The primary outcomes were 24h morphine i.v. consumption and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) defined by International Conference of Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Conclusions were based primarily on trials with low risk of bias. Ninety-seven randomized clinical trials with 7201 patients were included. The 24h morphine i.v. consumption was reported in 11 trials with overall low risk of bias, finding a reduction of 5.8mg (3.2, 8.5; TSA adjusted confidence interval: 3.2, 8.5). Incidence of SAEs was reported in 21 trials, with 55 SAEs reported in 12 of these trials, and 22 SAEs reported in 10 trials with overall low risk of bias. In trials with overall low risk of bias, Peto's odds ratio was 2.9 (1.2, 6.8; TSA adjusted confidence interval: 0.1, 97.1). Based on trials with low risk of bias, pregabalin may have a minimal opioid-sparing effect, but the risk of SAEs seems increased. However, the GRADE-rated evaluations showed only moderate to very low quality of evidence. Consequently, a routine use of pregabalin for postoperative pain treatment cannot be recommended.

### Pregablin [^ba4061b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

Table 3. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

5.4 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

As with all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), withdraw pregabalin capsules gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.

Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin capsules, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of pregabalin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

If pregabalin capsules is discontinued, taper the drug gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinue the drug abruptly.

### Pregabalin population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses for focal onset seizures in children (4-16 years) and adults, to support dose recommendations in children [^644c11dc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The pregabalin pediatric FOS program was started in 2005, prior to regulatory guidelines on Paediatric Investigational Plans (PIP),Pediatric Study Plans (PSP),and the acceptance of efficacy extrapolation by the FDA from adult to pediatric patients with FOS.The program included a phase I PK study in pediatric patients with FOS (1 month to 16 years),and two randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled efficacy and safety studies in pediatric patients with FOS, aged 4–16 years (PERIWINKLE)or 1 month to < 4 years,in addition to long‐term safety and tolerability assessments. Shortly before completion of PERIWINKLE in 2016, the FDA announced that efficacy data could be extrapolated from adults to represent pediatric patients with FOS,in order to improve pediatric drug development efficiency and early access to therapeutics. The confirmation of efficacy extrapolation took > 2 decades of multidisciplinary collaboration among multiple sectors from the initial extrapolation proposal,,to the consensus of disease similarity,to confirmation of efficacy response similarity,and drug E‐R similarity across multiple drugs in multiple mechanisms of actions.Collectively, guidances were issued by the FDA in an attempt to limit the need for a full, controlled clinical efficacy trials in young patients,,and these are based on the assumptions that, compared with adults, even young children have a similar progression of disease, similar response of disease to treatment, and similar E‐R relationship.

### Defining success in clinical trials – profiling pregabalin, the newest AED [^4d210b51]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy for patients with partial epilepsy with or without secondary generalization has been established by four randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (n = 1396) and four long-term open-label studies (n = 1480). Patients in the three fixed-dose trials were >/=12 years of age, had >/=6 partial seizures and no 4-week seizure-free period during the 8-week baseline period. Seventy-three per cent of patients were taking >/=2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Responder rates across the effective doses (150-600 mg/day) ranged from 14% to 51% and demonstrated a significant dose-response relationship. The most common adverse events were central nervous system related, generally mild or moderate, transient, and tended to be dose related. The fourth placebo-controlled trial compared a fixed dose of pregabalin 600 mg/day with a flexible-dose regimen (150-600 mg/day). Responder rates were greater for both the fixed dose (45.3%, P < 0.001) and flexible dose (31.3%, P < 0.001) when compared with placebo (11.0%). Compared with the fixed-dose group, the flexible-dose patients had a lower incidence of adverse events and study discontinuations. In long-term open-label trials, the efficacy of pregabalin was maintained with respect to 50% responder rates suggesting no obvious tolerance developing over 2 years. Seizure-free rates were 8.9% and 5.8% for the last 6 months and 1 year of pregabalin treatment, respectively. Long-term open-label pregabalin treatment was well tolerated.

### A clinical overview of off-label use of gabapentinoid drugs [^c69f3984]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

The gabapentinoid drugs gabapentin and pregabalin were originally developed as antiseizure drugs but now are prescribed mainly for treatment of pain. For gabapentin, the only pain-related indication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is postherpetic neuralgia. For pregabalin, FDA-approved indications related to pain are limited to postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy or spinal cord injury, and fibromyalgia. Despite these limited indications, gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed off-label for various other pain syndromes. Such use is growing, possibly because clinicians are searching increasingly for alternatives to opioids.

Observations

This report summarizes the limited published evidence to support off-label gabapentinoid uses, describes clinical cases in which off-label use is problematic, and notes how review articles and guidelines tend to overstate gabapentinoid effectiveness.

Conclusions

Clinicians who prescribe gabapentinoids off-label for pain should be aware of the limited evidence and should acknowledge to patients that potential benefits are uncertain for most off-label uses.

### Can a single dose of 300 mg of pregabalin reach acute antihyperalgesic levels in the central nervous system? [^db90edbe]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Central spinal cord sensitization can occur during surgery and may lead to persistent pain after surgery. Pregabalin has been shown to decrease central sensitization in experimental pain paradigms, and so the same antihyperalgesic effect of pregabalin may occur during and immediately after surgery. Our study investigated whether a single 300-mg dose of pregabalin in patients has sufficient central nervous system bioavailability to be useful under acute conditions where brain or spinal cord excitability may lead to long-term disease, such as chronic pain.

Methods

Nine patients undergoing primary total knee replacement received pregabalin 300 mg orally, 1 hr before surgery. An intrathecal catheter was inserted for anesthesia, postoperative analgesic drug administration, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling. Blood and CSF were then simultaneously sampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hrs after oral pregabalin administration. Pregabalin concentration in plasma and CSF was measured using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography assay.

Results

By 2 hrs after pregabalin administration, the CSF pregabalin concentration is high enough (0.115 μg/mL) to have anticonvulsant activity, and by 6 hrs after pregabalin administration, the CSF pregabalin level is high enough (0.359 μg/mL) to reduce central nervous system hypersensitivity. The median time to peak pregabalin concentration in CSF was at 8 hrs. The pregabalin CSF/plasma based on area under the curve (AUC[0-24 hrs]) was 0.098 ± 0.016, and for AUC[0-∞], the ratio was 0.176 ± 0.064.

Conclusions

Sufficient central nervous system drug concentrations are reached after oral administration of pregabalin, suggesting that postoperative pain hypersensitivity can be reduced. Decreasing this acute brain or spinal cord excitability may prevent chronic pain from developing after surgery.

### Rational dosing of gabapentin and pregabalin in chronic kidney disease [^f167b2f0]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Pharmacology

Gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used first-line agents for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and other common neuropathies. Pharmacologically, both agents inhibit alpha-2-delta (α2δ) subunit of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, a key receptor involved in regulating the excitability of neurons.Peripheral nerve injury results in the upregulation of α2δ-1 receptors in the dorsal root ganglion neurons and subsequent increase in the trafficking of α2δ-1 to nerve terminals within the spinal cord.–Inhibition of α2δ-1 receptors decreases calcium-mediated release of excitatory neurotransmitters into the dorsal horn and subsequently reduces pain signaling.–Despite sharing the same mechanism of action, there are key pharmacologic differences between both agents. Pregabalin has six times higher binding affinity for the α2δ-1 receptor compared to gabapentin.Gabapentin follows zero-order saturable absorption, where its bioavailability decreases as the dose increases.Following oral administration, gabapentin’s bioavailability is 60%, 47%, 34%, and 33%, with 900, 1200, 2400, and 3600 mg/day in three divided doses, respectively.Notwithstanding, the two extended-release branded products, Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) and Gralise (a prodrug), are pharmaceutically designed to enhance absorption.Pregabalin exhibits linear absorption with bioavailability equal to or greater than 90% irrespective of the dose, which gives it a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.

The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

Table 3. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness.

### Pregabalin for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome [^70bc1f1f]. Journal of Pain Research (2010). Low credibility.

This last article in a three-part series on approved medications for managing fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) reviews pregabalin (Lyrica(®)). Pregabalin was the first drug approved for FMS management and, as an anticonvulsant, differs from the other approved agents that are antidepressants. Pregabalin inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter release by blocking α(2)δ calcium channels. Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated pregabalin reduces pain and improves sleep and health-related quality of life in FMS patients. While indicated dosing is 300-450 mg divided twice daily, initial dosing of 25-50 mg at night is recommended owing to side effects including somnolence, dizziness, and cognitive dysfunction. Since side effects such as weight gain and peripheral edema are dose-related, uptitration in weekly increments based on tolerability and therapeutic response is recommended. Due to its lack of protein binding and negligible hepatic metabolism, pregabalin can be safely combined with other medications and used in patients with renal failure when the dose is appropriate. Pregabalin may worsen sedation when combined with central nervous system depressants. Pregabalin should be discontinued gradually. Pregabalin-treated patients should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior. Pregabalin in combination with the other approved medications may be synergistic in treating FMS.

### GABA-ergic drugs: exit stage left, enter stage right [^d86a7900]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by interacting at post-synaptic GABA(A) receptors have long been used as hypnotics, sedatives, tranquillizers and anticonvulsants. In this category, benzodiazepines rapidly gained pride of place, replacing barbiturates and becoming the most commonly prescribed of all drugs in the Western world in the 1970s. However, problems such as dependence and withdrawal reactions became apparent in the 1980s, and it seemed that the usefulness of drugs with this mode of action was limited. Recently, focus has shifted to a new group of drugs with GABA-ergic actions mediated through various mechanisms not directly involving the GABA(A) receptor. These drugs include gabapentin, vigabatrin, tiagabine, lamotrigine, pregabalin and others. Although originally developed as anticonvulsants for epilepsy, they appear to have wider applications for use in affective disorders, especially bipolar depression, anxiety disorders and pain conditions. The current information on the properties and therapeutic potential of this new generation of GABA-ergic drugs is reviewed. It remains to be seen whether long-term use leads to tolerance, dependence and withdrawal or discontinuation reactions.

### Improvement in pain severity category in clinical trials of pregabalin [^1142247b]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The pain intensity experienced by patients with chronic pain conditions is often delineated into the categories of mild, moderate, and severe.These categories attempt to reflect the degree of interference a patient’s pain has on their ability to function and can be linked to patient outcomes and health resource utilization.–It is important to note that the relationship between a pain severity score and the degree of interference on patient function is not always linear, meaning that an equivalent change in pain score may not always equate to the same degree of change in function.As a result, while statistical difference from placebo (or from other treatment) is a necessary and important outcome measure, taken on its own it may not always represent clinically meaningful pain relief, while pain relief may not always represent clinically meaningful changes in function.

Pregabalin is an α2δ ligand indicated in the United States for the treatment of a range of chronic pain conditions including fibromyalgia (FM) and neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and spinal cord injury (SCI).Pregabalin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures.The efficacy of pregabalin in these chronic pain conditions was demonstrated in a number of randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which pregabalin treatment improved mean pain score when compared with placebo.–However, how directly improvements in mean pain score relate to clinical and functional benefits for patients is not always clear.

In this pooled analysis of patient-level data from all chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment option, shifts in pain severity category following treatment were examined. Shifts in pain severity with pregabalin were compared with placebo to further understand the clinical impact of pregabalin treatment.

### Pregabalin [^40f69505]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There is more limited evidence from case reports, animal studies, and human studies associating pregabalin with serious respiratory depression, without co-administered CNS depressants or without underlying respiratory impairment.

5.5 Dizziness and Somnolence

Pregabalin may cause dizziness and somnolence. Inform patients that pregabalin-related dizziness and somnolence may impair their ability to perform tasks such as driving or operating machinery [SEE PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)].

In the pregabalin controlled trials in adult patients, dizziness was experienced by 30% of pregabalin-treated patients compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients; somnolence was experienced by 23% of pregabalin-treated patients compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. Dizziness and somnolence generally began shortly after the initiation of pregabalin therapy and occurred more frequently at higher doses. Dizziness and somnolence were the adverse reactions most frequently leading to withdrawal (4% each) from controlled studies. In pregabalin-treated patients reporting these adverse reactions in short-term, controlled studies, dizziness persisted until the last dose in 30% and somnolence persisted until the last dose in 42% of patients [SEE DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

### Effects of oral pregabalin and aprepitant on pain and central sensitization in the electrical hyperalgesia model in human volunteers [^287f2bb2]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Central sensitization is an important mechanism of neuropathic pain; its human models could be useful for early detection of efficacy of novel treatments. The electrical hyperalgesia model invokes central sensitization by repetitive stimulation of the skin. To assess its predictive value, we have investigated pregabalin, a standard neuropathic pain treatment, and aprepitant, an NK(1) antagonist, as an example of a drug class active in animal models but not in neuropathic pain patients. Furthermore, we explored if combinations of either of these drugs with the COX-2 inhibitor parecoxib could improve its efficacy.

Methods

This was a double-blind, two-period, placebo-controlled study using incomplete block design. Thirty-two healthy volunteers received either oral pregabalin (titrated to 300 mg) or aprepitant (titrated to 320 mg), or matching placebo over 6 days before testing. Sensitization was assessed over 3 h; at 2 h, subjects received either parecoxib (40 mg) or saline i.v.

Results

Pregabalin significantly reduced the areas of punctate mechanical hyperalgesia and dynamic touch allodynia vs placebo (both P < 0.0001); no significant reduction in the area of hyperalgesia or allodynia vs placebo was observed with aprepitant. In the pregabalin + parecoxib treated group, the area of allodynia was significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) and the area of hyperalgesia insignificantly attenuated (P = 0.09) vs placebo + parecoxib; no efficacy improvement was observed with aprepitant + parecoxib.

Conclusions

The model can serve to predict analgesic efficacy in early human development and investigate the mechanism of action. The model could also be used to explore efficacy of analgesic combinations to provide a rationale for patient studies.

### Expert opinion: exploring the effectiveness and tolerability of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch and pregabalin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^12cb70cc]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Modes of Action and Pharmacodynamics of Capsaicin 179 mg Patch and Pregabalin

The active ingredient in the capsaicin 179 mg patch is chemically synthesized capsaicin, which is absorbed into the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. It is applied for 30 minutes to the feet (eg in human immunodeficiency virus-associated neuropathy [HIV-AN], painful DPN) or 60 minutes to other locations (eg the trunk in PHN).Capsaicin is a potent and highly selective exogenous agonist of the TRPV1 channel, a transmembrane receptor–ion channel complex distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system.–TRPV1 is preferentially expressed on sensory (nociceptive) nerve fibers and is important in pain perception. When capsaicin comes into contact with these nociceptors, the initial excitation of primary sensory TRPV1-expressing neurons is experienced as a warming, burning, or stinging sensation with hyperalgesia.With continued exposure, the peripheral nociceptors become less sensitive, leading to the “defunctionalization” and degeneration of nociceptors, causing them to recede from the epidermis (Figure 1).,In addition, secondary pharmacodynamic mechanisms in response to high doses of capsaicin have been implicated in the persistent effects of capsaicin on nociceptors, including the defunctionalization of mitochondria due to calcium overload leading to nerve terminal necrosis.

Figure 1 
Mechanism of action of capsaicin in treatment of localized peripheral neuropathic pain. Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) by capsaicin results in sensory neuronal depolarization, and can induce local sensitization to activation by heat, acidosis, and endogenous agonists. Topical exposure to capsaicin leads to the sensations of heat, burning, stinging, or itching. High concentrations of capsaicin or repeated applications can produce a persistent local effect on cutaneous nociceptors, which is best described as “defunctionalization” and constituted by reduced spontaneous activity and a loss of responsiveness to a wide range of sensory stimuli.Reproduced from Anand P, Bley K.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^3b9be202]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Insufficient scientific evidence was found by the Delphi panel for the combination of pregabalin/gabapentin and other antiepileptics (Table 2). In theory, the combination could be effective due to different mechanisms of action. However, neither sodium channel blockers such as lamotrigine nor multiple modes of action drugs such as topiramate have any certain role in the treatment of NeP.In general, this combination was seldom used by the experts.

No clear consensus was reached for the combination of pregabalin/gabapentin and cutaneous patches as studies are add-on and not combination studies (Table 2). Casale et aland Meier et alhave studied lidocaine patches in clinical trials as add-on treatment to oral therapy, including pregabalin/gabapentin, with good effect and hardly any side effects. Other trials, for example, Irving et al,added capsaicin patches to chronic pain medications, such as anticonvulsants and found also a favorable response. Haanpää and Hietaharjuadvocate for combining a locally acting preparation with a systemic drug for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. The advisors gave mixed responses: good and insufficient evidence for localized NeP, which is the indication for patches. Overall, experience in clinical practice is that cutaneous patches can be combined with all types of oral therapy in patients who are suitable for local treatment.

Finally, the Delphi panel found insufficient scientific evidence for the combination of pregabalin/gabapentin and other pharmacological options like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen than those described above (Table 2).

### Rash associated with pregabalin use [^a2c74323]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of extensive rash induced by orally administered pregabalin in a patient with neuropathic pain.

Case Summary

A 35-year-old white female with a diffuse, erythematous, maculopapular rash localized to her back and extremities presented to the preoperative holding area for planned exploratory nerve surgery. Prior to presentation, she had been receiving oral pregabalin 50 mg 3 times a day for approximately 2 weeks to treat her neuropathy. Prior to pregabalin therapy, the patient indicated that she had taken gabapentin for approximately 3 weeks for the pain, but had discontinued it due to adverse effects and perceived lack of efficacy. Pregabalin was discontinued and diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone were given to treat the rash. The rash almost completely resolved one week after pregabalin was discontinued.

Discussion

Pregabalin-induced rash was rarely reported in Phase 3 trials, and a clinical description of such events has not been published. Pregabalin exhibits pharmacokinetics different from those of most other antiepileptic agents. Presently, there are no clear mechanisms known for rash associated with pregabalin. The Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the development of rash and use of pregabalin by our patient.

Conclusions

There are currently no other available reports of the development of a rash coinciding with the use of pregabalin. As both Food and Drug Administration-approved and off-label use of this drug increases, further consideration of risk factors associated with the development of rash is needed.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^505d83ec]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Absorption Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Interactions

Pregabalin’s bioavailability is over 90% and is dose independent. Food does not affect pregabalin’s overall exposure; however, it can reduce the rate of absorption with the content of the food having little effect on this. Maximal serum concentrations appear 0.7–1.3 h post-dose with the serum half-life ranging from 4.6 to 6.8 h. Over 90% of its excretion is via the kidney. There are very few drug-drug interactions reported with pregabalin, which may be in part because it has no significant effects on the CYP450 family. As such, the only major clinical factor relevant to dosing is renal function. The maximum dose of 600 mg/day should only be used in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 60 ml/min. In patients whose CrCL is 15–30 ml/min, the maximum dose should be reduced 150 mg in 1–2 divided doses and when CrCL is < 15 ml/min this needs to be reduced further to a maximum of 75 mg once daily. The indications, dosing, renal dosing, and minor and major side effects for pregabalin, gabapentin and the emerging GABAergic therapy, mirogabalin, are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

### Cerebral biochemical effect of pregabalin in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy: a randomized controlled trial [^a5b42278]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

This brings us to our second point of emphasis, as all of the previous high-level RCTs describe a decrease in numerical rating scale or VAS as a successful treatment, relying on self-reporting to assess treatment effectiveness. However, some patients suffering from PDN feel no pain, while others with the exact same pathology suffer from severe pain, implying that cortical processing and individual variability in antinociceptive mechanisms play an important role in the development of pain and pain perception. Therefore, we suggest that brain imaging is an objective diagnostic tool to assess brain chemistry and treatment efficacy, providing a solution by objectifying the neural correlates of pain perception and pain modulation. Imaging modalities have already shown promise for further unraveling of the central mechanisms contributing to pain chronification [,–], which is of utmost importance as recent publications stress the underlying central mechanisms of  PDN, which are not yet fully understood and seem to play an important role.

### Pregabalin-associated heart failure decompensation in a patient with a history of stage I heart failure [^3566b363]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an elderly male patient with a prior history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I heart failure (HF) who presented with cardiac decompensation related to pregabalin therapy and to review the literature involving the effects of pregabalin in HF patients.

Case Summary

An 84-year-old man with NYHA class I HF (left-ventricular ejection fraction between 45% and 50%) presented to the emergency department with acute HF decompensation approximately 10 days after initiation of pregabalin for the management of peripheral neuropathy. Discontinuation of pregabalin and administration of furosemide resulted in resolution of symptoms. Shortness of breath; facial, neck, and peripheral edema; and weight gain all improved within 2 days. Three months following discontinuation of furosemide and pregabalin, the patient remained stable without any recurring symptoms or progression in HF.

Discussion

Pregabalin is associated with a 10% to 15% prevalence of peripheral edema and weight gain, with cases reported in patients both with and without HF. Whereas most reported HF exacerbations have occurred in patients with NYHA class II to IV HF, this case is one of the first to be reported in a patient with NYHA class I. According to the Naranjo probability scale (score of 4), it was possible that the patient's HF symptoms were related to pregabalin. The mechanism of action of pregabalin-induced HF is unknown, but pregabalin has been shown to act as a calcium channel antagonist.

Conclusion

Although further studies are needed, this case suggests that close monitoring of patients with NYHA class I HF should be considered when initiating pregabalin therapy.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^23984444]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain (NeP) is triggered by a lesion or a disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system that alters its structure and function, so that pain occurs spontaneously and responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli are pathologically amplified.Peripheral causes of NeP are for example, polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, postoperative pain, and posttraumatic neuralgia, while causes of central NeP are spinal cord injuries, stroke, and so on. The current Danish treatment algorithms–are founded on the evidence-based recommendations provided by the international pain societies. The European guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of NeP issued by the European Federation of Neurological Societies recommend tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), gabapentin, and pregabalin as first-line treatment for the most common NeP conditions, including diabetic neuropathy where serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are also recommended.Finnerup et al, recently revised the worldwide applied NeP pharmacotherapy recommendations from the Special Interest Group on neuropathic pain concluding that there was a strong Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendation for use and proposal as first-line treatment for TCA, SNRI, pregabalin, and gabapentin.

Combination therapy, that is, the combination of different pharmacological treatments, has not been a part of guidelines until recently. The combination of pregabalin or gabapentin with either TCAs or SNRIs is now mentioned as a treatment option if a patient cannot tolerate high-dose monotherapy.The idea of combination therapy using two drugs with different mechanisms of action is of great interest, as it is widely acknowledged that many patients have insufficient pain relief on monotherapy with the currently used drugs. Furthermore, the drugs used for treatment of NeP have severe dose-dependent side effects and tolerability issues, that often lead to discontinuation of high-dose monotherapies. Other fields of medicine apply combination therapy so as to avoid high-dose monotherapy such as for example, treatment of hypertension or diabetes. In a similar fashion, pain medicine could benefit from using lower dose combination therapies with different mechanisms of action. An example could be a moderate dose of a drug reducing calcium influx (pregabalin or gabapentin) combined with a moderate dose of a drug inhibiting the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake (duloxetine).

### Pregabalin (Lyrica) [^1ea08a35]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing LYRICA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

5.4 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

As with all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), withdraw LYRICA gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.

Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of LYRICA, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] . Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of pregabalin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

If LYRICA is discontinued, taper the drug gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinue the drug abruptly.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^fb58285a]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

These analyses included pregabalin data only from studies and treatment arms with a flexible dosing design, as this design is a closer representation of the recommended approach in clinical practice where pregabalin should be carefully titrated to the highest tolerable dose.–The recommended dosing for pregabalin in the USA is up to a maximum of 300 mg/day for DPN, between 300 and 600 mg/day for PHN, up to a maximum of 600 mg/day for SCI, and between 300 and 450 mg/day for FM.For all conditions, it is recommended that treatment start at 150 mg/day and escalate to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on individual efficacy and tolerability.Each of the trials in this analysis started with all patients receiving 150 mg/day before escalation to higher doses each week. As such, the emergence of 30% responders in this analysis after 1 week (15.0% with DPN/PHN, 19.0% with SCI, and 9.6% with FM) suggests a small degree of effectiveness of pregabalin, in some patients, before the optimal dose is reached. However, not all patients will respond to pregabalin at 150 mg/day, as also indicated here with higher numbers of responders at weeks 2 and 3. Current clinical guidelines support careful escalation to the highest tolerable approved dose,,–with the reported average maintenance dose in the studies included in this analysis being ≥370 mg/day.

Consistent with previous studies,,these analyses demonstrated that the most common AEs with pregabalin (somnolence and dizziness) typically emerge within the first 2 weeks. Other common AEs in these trials also tended to emerge within the 6 weeks of this analysis. One possible exception was increased weight in patients with FM (with 14 of 39 total instancesemerging in the first 6 weeks). This observation is consistent with previous analyses indicating that increased weight typically emerges following a longer period of pregabalin treatment (>56 days).

The ability to anticipate which AEs may emerge, and when, could potentially improve adherence to pregabalin, by managing patient expectations. Some observational studies of pregabalin have reported lower rates of AEs and this has been credited to ongoing discussions between physicians and their patients regarding potential AEs.It could be that this is related to a reduction in the patient’s anxiety, which then alters how they would perceive the occurrence of a mild AE.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^de0225b6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The GABA analogue pregabalin has also been investigated in combination with speech therapy compared with speech therapy alone in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in patients with RCC/UCC (Table 1). 82 Addition of pregabalin to speech therapy improved subjective, but not objective, measures of cough. The authors proposed that this discrepancy may be due to the psychoactive properties of pregabalin, which may alter the perception of cough (i.e. subjective cough measures such as cough severity or cough‐related quality of life) but not objective cough frequency.

Antidepressants: rationale and clinical evidence in CC

Similar to gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline and nortriptyline), which can treat chronic neuropathic pain, have been investigated for treatment of CC because of shared similarities between CC and chronic neuropathic pain. 24, 27, 77 The mechanism of action of tricyclic antidepressants is not well understood in CC, but these agents are known to exert effects on serotoninergic, noradrenergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic signaling. 83 A retrospective chart review of 48 patients with RCC/UCC revealed that the vast majority of patients treated with amitriptyline reported a subjective improvement in their cough. 84 An anonymous survey deployed 2–3 years after initiation of amitriptyline treatment revealed that many patients still reported an improvement in their cough; however, 64% of patients who responded to the survey had stopped taking amitriptyline, with the most commonly cited reasons for discontinuation being side effects (e.g. sedation and dry mouth) and lack of improvement.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^51385a62]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain, defined as “pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system”is a common chronic pain condition. The condition represents a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems, and can be challenging to diagnose and effectively treat.Despite the availability of a number of effective pharmacological treatment options,many patients with neuropathic pain, particularly those with more severe conditions, may be untreated or undertreated.

Pregabalin (Pfizer, New York, USA), an α 2 δ ligand, is indicated in the USA for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), peripheral herpetic neuralgia (PHN), and spinal cord injury,and in Europe for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain.It is recommended as a first-line treatment for diverse neuropathic pain conditions (including DPN, PHN, and central pain) by the European Federation of Neurological Societies,the International Association for the Study of Pain,and the American Academy of Neurology.While pregabalin is not effective in every patient with neuropathic pain, its efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical trials and meta-analyses.Cumulatively, it is estimated that there have now been over 34 million patient-years of exposure to pregabalin.

A meta-analysis of clinical trials of different treatments for the neuropathic pain condition DPN concluded that pregabalin at doses ≥300 mg/day was more effective in improving pain than pregabalin at doses ≤150 mg/day;although many patients do respond to treatment with pregabalin at lower doses (≤300 mg/day).As a consequence, it is recommended that in clinical practice, pregabalin should be carefully escalated to the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects.Despite this, some physicians may not attempt a higher dose of pregabalin in patients who do not respond at an initial low dose and many patients receive doses ≤150 mg/day.

New evidence showing that there are patients who do not respond to a low dose of pregabalin but who do subsequently respond when the dose is increased may help to provide clearer guidance to physicians and more effective treatment to patients. This analysis pooled individual patient-level data from 6 randomized, placebo-controlled studies of flexible-dose pregabalin in neuropathic pain with the aim of assessing how patients who do not initially respond to pregabalin at lower doses react to increasing doses.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^6bda5c0a]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system exerting inhibitory control on the spinal dorsal horn. It is released by inhibitory descending fibres and interneurons and binds to both the GABA A (via ionotropic) and GABA B (via metabotropic) receptors depressing neuronal excitation and reducing glutamate release from primary afferent fibres onto dorsal horn neurones. Modulation of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate through the glutamate synthesising enzyme, branched-chain amino acid transaminase, is thought to play a possible role in pain in pDPN. Loss of the GABAergic inhibitory process has been identified as an underlying mechanism of inflammatory and neuropathic pain ; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. A reduction in the expression of the potassium chloride transporter (KCC2) with primary sensory neurones exhibiting a higher intracellular chloride level has also been proposed as a possible contributory mechanism.

Despite being developed as a mimetic of GABA, pregabalin is not believed to produce any of its therapeutic effects directly via the GABA receptor. A high affinity to the α 2 -δ subunit found in a number of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) is considered its primary mechanism of action. Indeed, genetic knock-out of α 2 -δ in animal models entirely negates the analgesic effects of pregabalin.

### Pregabalin for chronic prostatitis [^b979b4c3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a condition that is detrimental to the quality of life of men. Evidence suggests that it may have a neuropathic origin and therefore medications such as pregabalin might have a role in the controlling of symptoms.

Objectives

The primary objective was to compare pregabalin to other modalities of pain relief to alleviate men's symptoms of CP/CPPS.The secondary objective was to assess the safety and effectiveness of pregabalin to improve various individual symptoms consistent with CP/CPPS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2012), EMBASE (1980 to May 2012), CINAHL, clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, and reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings, without language restriction for pregabalin treatment of Class III prostatitis and CP/CPPS.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pregabalin to placebo or other types of analgesics for the management of patients with CP/CPPS were included. Patients with known causes of pain/discomfort were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Only one RCT was included. The trial compared pregabalin to placebo for patients who had CP/CPPS.

Main Results

For men who responded clinically (≥ 6-point improvement), there was no difference between the pregabalin (103/218; 47.2%) and placebo (38/106; 35.8%) arms (risk ratio (RR) 1.32; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.76). There was less pain with a higher point improvement in the pregabalin group compared to the placebo group (4.2 points versus 1.7 points, respectively; mean difference (MD) -2.3 points; 95% CI -4.0 to -0.7 points).Though 59% (191/324) of the patients developed side effects, no serious effects were experienced. There were significantly more neurologic side effects in the pregabalin group compared to the placebo group (38.5% (84/218) versus 22.6% (24/106), respectively; RR 1.7; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.51), and less pain in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group (17.4% (38/218) versus 33.3% (35/106), respectively; RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.78). However, no significant differences were seen between the pregabalin and placebo groups with regards to gastrointestinal disturbances (18.3% (40/218) versus 18.9% (20/106), respectively; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.58), ocular/visual symptoms (6.9% (15/218) versus 2.8% (3/106), respectively; RR 2.43; 95% CI 0.72 to 8.22), and renal/genitourinary symptoms (5.5% (12/218) versus 1.9% (2/106), respectively; RR 3.03; 95% CI 0.67 to 13.79).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from one RCT that pregabalin does not improve CP/CPPS symptoms and causes adverse effects in a large percentage of men. However, research is required to assess further whether pregabalin has a role in patients with CP/CPPS for symptom control.

### Rational dosing of gabapentin and pregabalin in chronic kidney disease [^934b1a84]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Dosing considerations in chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD alters renal drug elimination by affecting glomerular blood flow, filtration rate, tubular secretion and reabsorption, and renal bioactivation and metabolism.Additionally, pharmacokinetic handling of medications (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) may be affected.Reducing the dose is recommended for medications with narrow therapeutic index.Extending the interval is recommended for medications with prolonged half-life in renal impairment; however, this may be subtherapeutic and may cause end-of-dose failure. Understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of medications is important when making these adjustments. Nevertheless, while dosing gabapentinoids, we must also consider reports by the patient that include side effect profile and tolerability as measured against efficacy, irrespective of the theoretical calculations.

Pregabalin (PGB) vs lamotrigine (LTG)—Class II double-blind study—used the proportion of patients seizure free for 6 continuous months as the primary endpoint; doses were adjustable for the first 24 weeks and then fixed, with a majority receiving PGB 150 mg/d or LTG 100 mg/d. Significantly more patients achieved seizure freedom with LTG than PGB; weight gain occurred more often with PGB; other frequent AEs (headaches, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue) did not differ, and AE-related withdrawal was 8% taking PGB vs 7% taking LTG.

### Mechanism of action of alpha2delta ligands: voltage sensitive calcium channel (VSCC) modulators [^9b58aee0]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Issue

Voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) have unique structures and functions that distinguish them from other ion channels, especially the voltage sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs). Modulation of VSCCs by certain drugs such as pregabalin and gabapentin via binding to the alpha2delta subunits of VSCCs can lead to anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and chronic pain-relieving actions.

### Impact of pregabalin on acute and persistent postoperative pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f507a3ca]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

We performed this systematic review to assess the analgesic efficacy of perioperative pregabalin. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to assess the impact of individual dose and frequency of pregabalin administration on analgesic efficacy. We included 55 studies. When all doses and administration regimens were combined, pregabalin was associated with a significant reduction in pain scores at rest and during movement and opioid consumption at 24 h compared with placebo {mean difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]=-0.38 (-0.57, -0.20), -0.47 (-0.76, -0.18), and -8.27 mg morphine equivalents (-10.08, -6.47), respectively}. Patients receiving pregabalin had less postoperative nausea and vomiting and pruritus compared with placebo [relative risk (RR) (95% CI)=0.62 (0.48, 0.80) and 0.49 (0.34, 0.70), respectively]. Sedation, dizziness, and visual disturbance were more common with pregabalin compared with placebo [RR (95% CI)=1.46 (1.08, 1.98), 1.33 (1.07, 1.64), and 3.52 (2.05, 6.04), respectively]. All doses of pregabalin tested (≤75, 100-150, and 300 mg) resulted in opioid sparing at 24 h after surgery. There were no significant differences in acute pain outcomes with pregabalin 100-300 mg between single preoperative dosing regimens and those including additional doses repeated after surgery. Data were insufficient to reach conclusions regarding persistent pain, but limited data available from two studies suggested that pregabalin might be effective for the reduction of neuropathic pain. In conclusion, this review suggests that pregabalin improves postoperative analgesia compared with placebo at the expense of increased sedation and visual disturbances.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^fc032740]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain—antiepileptics (gabapentin and pregabalin) are supported by very low quality evidence and a neutral stance; evidence on antiepileptics was limited to pregabalin and gabapentin, the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation. Pregabalin is a controlled substance with the potential for abuse and dependence, while gabapentin is not federally scheduled but some states have scheduled it due to addiction and dependence concerns. One study indicates that gabapentin in combination with opioids significantly increases the risk of opioid-related mortality and respiratory depression. Gabapentin or pregabalin may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety or insomnia, as these agents have been used off-label for these indications. The potential harms of adverse events (AEs), including medication abuse and dependence, slightly outweighed the benefits versus placebo.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^09da8e61]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 17—gabapentin or pregabalin for multimodal analgesia: The panel recommends that clinicians consider use of gabapentin or pregabalin as a component of multimodal analgesia (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Both medications are associated with reduced opioid requirements after major or minor surgical procedures, and some studies reported lower postoperative pain scores. Effective preoperative regimens in trials used 600 or 1200 mg of gabapentin or 150 or 300 mg of pregabalin, administered 1–2 hours preoperatively. These drugs are only available in oral form, potentially limiting their use in the immediate postoperative period. Potential adverse effects include dizziness and sedation that has not been linked to respiratory depression; dose reductions are recommended in patients with impaired renal function. Although evidence on effectiveness of gabapentin or pregabalin in children is limited, some randomized trials found beneficial effects of preoperative gabapentin on postoperative pain and opioid use.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^389ad167]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pregabalin is recommended as a treatment for diverse neuropathic pain conditions,–where it is advised that it be carefully escalated to the optimal dose.In the USA, the maximum approved dose of pregabalin is 300 mg/day for DPN and 600 mg/day for PHN,while in Europe it is 600 mg/day for all neuropathic pain.Despite this, many patients may not receive the most effective dose of pregabalin, with a recent drug utilization study in the UK indicating that the approximate median prescribed dose of pregabalin for neuropathic pain was only 150 mg/day.This analysis provides evidence that new patients will tend to respond with every increase in pregabalin dose.

Neuropathic pain can be challenging to treat effectively.While there are a number of treatment options, not all are effective in all patients. For instance, data on the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with lower back pain are inconsistent.In a randomized withdrawal trial, pregabalin was not shown to be effective in patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy.Even for those conditions where its efficacy is well established, many patients will not respond to treatment with pregabalin.As physicians are advised to ensure that effective and tolerable treatment for neuropathic pain is initiated as soon as possible,it is important to ascertain quickly if a treatment is ineffective so that other options can be tested. In these circumstances, it may be understandable why the time is not taken to escalate some patients to a higher, efficacious dose of pregabalin. However, of the 701 patients in this analysis who took the 150 mg/day dosing, 136 (19.4%) responded at that dose. Of those who continued to higher doses, 231 (33.0%) responded at a higher dose. These data do not correct for the tendency for higher doses to be used when patients have inadequate response at a lower dose. The MSM analyses make some correction for this tendency in dose escalation and indicate that it can be worthwhile to persist with pregabalin until the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects is utilized.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: findings from seven randomized, controlled trials across a range of doses [^0d102317]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Over the course of 5 to 13 weeks of treatment, the incidence of clinically meaningful weight gain (defined using a Food and Drug Administration–guided criterion of ≥7% weight increase from baseline to end point) for pregabalin versus placebo was dose related: 2.01% for pregabalin at 150 mg/day (P = 0.14 [95% CI −0.47 to 3.03%]), 2.12% for pregabalin at 300 mg/day (P = 0.04 [−0.09 to 2.86%]), and 3.88% for pregabalin at 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [1.76–4.54%]) groups, compared with 0.73% for the placebo group. The odds of weight gain compared with placebo are 2.3-fold for pregabalin at 150 mg/day (P = 0.14 [0.77–6.60%]), 2.8-fold for pregabalin at 300 mg/day (P = 0.04 [1.06–7.47%]), and 6.2-fold for pregabalin at 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [2.82–13.67%]). Mean changes in weight from baseline to end point for pregabalin-treated patients versus placebo control subjects were 0.76 kg for pregabalin at 150 mg/day (P = 0.02 [0.08–1.11 kg]), 1.86 kg for pregabalin at 300 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [1.26–2.14 kg]), and 2.04 kg for pregabalin at 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [1.54–2.22 kg]); the mean change was 0.16 kg for placebo. The incidence of ≥7% weight gain by study duration across all pregabalin doses is as follows: 5 weeks, 2.8%; 8 weeks, 6.8%; and 12–13 weeks, 7.9%.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^745df37c]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

This was the first large phase 3, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of pregabalin in PTNP for registration purposes in the United States. The conduct of this trial indicates that a large, multinational, phase 3 trial of pregabalin in PTNP is feasible. The significant effect of pregabalin on a number of secondary endpoints, including second measure of pain intensity (BPI-sf) raises the possibility that the absence of a statistically significant difference on the primary endpoint may be partly attributed to additional factors individually or in aggregate including (1) the study design, (2) dose titration, (3) adequacy of dose achieved, (4) duration of the fixed dose period, (5) the number and wide geographical location of study sites needed to conduct the study, (6) the level of refractoriness of the study population, and (7) differential response to study treatments over time in study, particularly the placebo response. A review of randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials in neuropathic pain found that the magnitude of the placebo response accrues slowly and continually, whereas pain reduction in response to active treatments manifests more rapidly, before leveling off. Such a pattern of placebo response occurred over the course of the present study and possibly explains why pregabalin demonstrated a significant treatment effect on mean pain intensity in earlier weeks, but not in the primary analysis at week 15. Moreover, the efficacy of pregabalin observed in the earlier weeks of this trial is consistent with the results from a prior, shorter trial with an 8-week double-blind period. Although subjects in this study by Van Seventer et al. had an equally diverse set of etiologic mechanisms associated with chronic neuropathic pain, it should also be noted that the duration of the syndromes was nearly 50% shorter (4.4 vs 8 years in this study) and, therefore, the studies may not be strictly comparable.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^8cb98f66]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Patient population

A total of 889 patients were treated with flexible-dose pregabalin; 761 of which met the inclusion criteria (≥80% compliance on pregabalin, had remained in their study for ≥28 days, and receiving a stable dose of pregabalin for ≥4 days) and were included in the descriptive analysis. Of these, 717 could be grouped into one of the six established dose response pathways. The demographic characteristics and baseline clinical characteristics of patients were broadly similar regardless of treatment compliance (Table 1).

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

Table 3. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

5.4 Respiratory Depression

There is evidence from case reports, human studies, and animal studies associating pregabalin with serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression when co-administered with central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. When the decision is made to co-prescribe pregabalin with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or to prescribe pregabalin to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and consider initiating pregabalin at a low dose. The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants (including pregabalin).

Adverse Effects

The frequently reported side effects of pregabalin include somnolence, dizziness, peripheral oedema and weight gain, which are usually mild to moderate. These effects are thought to be related to the drug’s effects on neurotransmitter release and calcium currents. Pregabalin may cause adverse events on cognition and coordination. In addition, treatment is associated with weight gain, which is in part dependent on the total drug dose, thus raising an issue that needs to be considered in treating patients with type 2 diabetes. There is a theoretical risk of worsening metabolic control with the associated weight gain from gabapentanoids; a pooled analysis of data from 11 double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCT) of pregabalin (150–600 mg/day) vs. placebo showed no clinically meaningful effects of pregabalin on glycaemic or lipid profiles in patients with pDPN, whilst data on weight were not presented. The effects on weight should be considered when starting pregabalin as part of a personalised treatment approach.

Introduction

Pain control in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) continues to be a challenge, with many patients receiving unsatisfactory treatment.The efficacy of many currently available medications is unsatisfactory owing to their limited effect size and the low responder rate (<50%).After diagnosis of PNP, a treatment focusing on the underlying disease could be a first step (eg glucose control for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy [DPN] or interruption of chemotherapy when chemotherapy-induced neuropathy occurs), although this does not often lead to a successful reversal of the neuropathic pain.PNP is difficult to treat and often does not respond to conventional pain therapies because of the heterogeneity and complexity of the mechanisms underlying peripheral pain conditions, as well as the co-existence of psychological and emotional aspects of chronic pain.

Treatment of pain requires a multimodal and individualized approach. In the absence of clear predictors of treatment response, a stepwise approach is taken to identify which drugs or drug combinations offer the greatest pain relief with the fewest adverse effects.Pharmacotherapy is typically the first step and treatment classes often trialed include antidepressants (ie tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs/SNRIs]), antiarrhythmic medications, alpha-2-delta subunit ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, sodium channel inhibitors, and synthetic opioids.Pregabalin (Lyrica ® ; Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) is an orally administered calcium channel alpha-2-delta subunit ligand. It was one of the first pharmacotherapies introduced for the treatment of PNP (in 2004) and is approved in the USA and Europe for the treatment of pain from DPN and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults.Pregabalin was developed in follow-up to gabapentin.While both have shown efficacy in neuropathic pain disorders, pregabalin has some pharmacological advantages, including more rapid absorption, linear pharmacokinetics, and greater bioavailability (≥90%) compared with gabapentin.It is approximately 2.5-times more potent than gabapentin based on plasma concentrations. In a study from Sweden, the first prescription in 2220 patients with neuropathy was pregabalin in 25% of patients, gabapentin in 29%, and amitriptyline in 36%.Nevertheless, a recent Cochrane review concluded that “some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment”.

### Efficacy of combination therapy with pregabalin in neuropathic pain: a preclinical study in the rat L5 spinal nerve ligation model [^722740cf]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Neuropathic pain is a debilitating symptom of a range of different etiologies that does not always respond to single pharmacological treatment regimens. Evidence for the efficacy of combination therapy is limited.In this study, we demonstrated the antiallodynic efficacy of pregabalin in combination with four other drugs, namely duloxetine, tramadol, celecoxib, and venlafaxine, in the rat L5 SNL neuropathic pain model. The antiallodynic effect was most prominent when pregabalin was combined with tramadol, and the isobolographic analysis of this combination revealed synergistic effects. Additionally, pregabalin combinations with duloxetine and venlafaxine showed additive and antagonistic effects, respectively.

Consistent with the findings reported in the literature regarding the use of pregabalin (anticonvulsant), duloxetine and venlafaxine (SNRIs), and tramadol (weak opioid) for neuropathic pain,the results from our single-drug experiment indicated antiallodynic effects of each of these drugs. Celecoxib, however, did not have any impact on the SNL rats. Celecoxib is an NSAID (cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor) typically prescribed to treat nociceptive pain and is frequently combined with pregabalin in clinical practice for pain relief when neuropathic pain is present as a symptom.

The von Frey test showed reduced mechanical allodynia in most combination subgroups. Across all the different combinations with pregabalin, the subgroup receiving the combination of pregabalin and tramadol experienced the greatest increase in withdrawal threshold after drug administration. This finding was supported further by isobolographic analyses, which demonstrated the synergistic effects of the combination. The synergism could be attributed to the distinct mechanisms of action of tramadol and pregabalin. Tramadol binds to the µ-opioid receptors in the brain and inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.On the other hand, pregabalin has several possible mechanisms of action. It primarily targets the α 2 -δ-1 subunit of VGCCs to reduce overall neural excitability.Other mechanisms include the inhibition of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and sodium currents and reduced VGCC trafficking via the β4a subunit.

### Delirium following pregabalin discontinuation in an individual with no psychiatric or substance use history [^aae2b59a]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Pregabalin, a γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogue, is approved in the USA for treating fibromyalgia, various forms of neuropathic pain and partial onset seizures.Additionally, it is prescribed off-label for a range of clinical conditions,with recent trends indicating a surge in its off-label utilisation.Review articles and case studies have highlighted the potential for pregabalin abuse, and multiple cases have documented withdrawal symptoms following its sudden cessation.This case emphasises the importance for clinicians to recognise potential misuse of pregabalin to educate patients while prescribing pregabalin and to be cognisant of severe symptoms that might arise from its abrupt discontinuation.

### Efficacy of combination therapy with pregabalin in neuropathic pain: a preclinical study in the rat L5 spinal nerve ligation model [^cf4fec59]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that pregabalin combined with tramadol has synergistic effects and may be a promising treatment for neuropathic pain. This combination strategy enables the use of lower doses of each constituent drug to provide a therapeutic benefit similar to that achieved using high-dose monotherapy but with possibly fewer adverse effects. Our findings lay the foundation for assessing combination therapy in real-world clinical practice to determine the optimal dose and confirm the efficacy and safety of this drug combination for the effective management of neuropathic pain.

Pregabalin

As an analog of γ-aminobutyric acid, pregabalin has been investigated whether it has an analgesic effect on CP patients. In 2011, a double-blind RCT conducted by Olesen et al. in a cohort of 64 CP patients found that more effective pain relief was observed after 3 weeks of pregabalin (150–300 mg, twice daily) treatment compared with placebo treatment.Further studies revealed that pregabalin could inhibit central sensitization manifested as spreading hyperalgesia, which might be mediated through subcortical mechanisms. Besides, it was also confirmed by a population pharmacokinetic model that pregabalin had a well-absorption profile in patients with CP.However, a systematic review published in 2016 by Cochrane Library which only included the study of Olesen et al. in 2011 suggested that the relevant evidence of pregabalin administration in CP patients was of low-to-moderate quality because of the short-term period of the trial and more adverse events compared with placebo group.

Except for monotherapy with pregabalin, some RCTs were conducted to evaluate the effect of antioxidants combined with pregabalin. In 2016, Talukdar et al. conducted a double-blinded RCT involving 87 patients to evaluate the effect of antioxidants combined with pregabalin for 2 months. It was shown that antioxidant plus pregabalin could significantly relieve pain in CP patients after ductal clearance.Moreover, a prospective, double-blinded RCT from India in 2020 including a total of 90 patients with CP revealed that the combination of antioxidants and pregabalin could significantly reduce pain, requirement of non-opioid analgesics, and the number of hospital admissions, improving the overall satisfaction among patients.However, more high-quality evidence is needed in the future as the efficacy and safety of pregabalin administration to CP patients in the short and long term are still unclear.

### Moving toward a multimodal analgesic regimen for acute sickle cell pain with non-opioid analgesic adjuncts: a narrative review [^89a19b6a]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Anticonvulsants (Gabapentin and Pregabalin)

Over the past decade, a deeper understanding of VOCs and the neurobiology of SCD has revealed that acute sickle cell pain has nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic components.Neuropathic pain is generally defined as pain secondary to injury/lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. Hyperalgesia – increased sensitivity to a painful stimulus – and allodynia – pain that is provoked by a stimulus that is normally non-painful – are defining descriptors of neuropathic pain. The mechanism for sickle cell-related neuropathic pain is believed to be vaso-occlusion of the vessels supplying blood to nerves, then leading to peripheral nerve injury.

In general, neuropathic pain is not responsive to analgesics such as opioids, NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Gabapentin and pregabalin – analogues of the neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) – are the two most widely prescribed analgesics for neuropathic pain and are considered first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. The specific mechanism of gabapentin (and pregabalin) is unknown, but it is believed to bind to α 2 δ-1 subunit of voltage gated calcium channels, leading to decreased central sensitization.Adverse effects include sedation, dizziness, and peripheral edema. Dosing should be adjusted in patients with renal disease due to the drugs’ renal excretion.

Preclinical studies in SCD mice found that a single dose of gabapentin alleviated acute sickle cell pain induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation tissue damage.Human studies, however, provide limited evidence about the anticonvulsant’s effectiveness in SCD. To date, there have been two published RCTs,examining the role of either gabapentin or pregabalin for treatment of acute sickle cell painor chronic sickle cell pain.Puri et alrandomized 90 pediatric sickle cell patients with an acute VOC to single dose of gabapentin (15 mg/kg) or placebo plus standard opioid therapy. The study reported a ≥33% decrease in pain scores in 68% of the gabapentin group compared to 60% of the placebo group (p = 0.23). Interestingly, the study also found that patients with the more severe SCD genotype (HbSS) had a significantly greater reduction in mean absolute pain scores (p = 0.032). It is important to highlight that the Puri et al study did not assess for the presence of neuropathic pain among study participants, and thus the differences in the efficacy of gabapentin among SCD patients with neuropathic pain compared to those without neuropathic pain could not be determined.
