## Question

Soft tissue sarcoma of the small intestine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evaluation and management of a soft‑tissue sarcoma arising in the abdomen/small bowel region. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and referral to a sarcoma center to avoid unplanned excisions. Then, I should verify optimal staging imaging. Next, I will need to check the biopsy strategy and the key pathologic and molecular tests to distinguish GIST from non‑GIST STS and mimics. After that, I will consider management of localized disease by histology, including surgical principles and when to add radiotherapy or targeted therapy. Finally, I should review systemic therapy for advanced disease, special scenarios such as lung metastasectomy, genetic testing considerations in younger patients, and principles for follow‑up and surveillance.

> Let me first confirm the initial approach. Soft‑tissue sarcomas are rare and heterogeneous, so I need to ensure prompt referral to a multidisciplinary sarcoma center and avoid unplanned excisions that can contaminate planes and worsen local control; hold on, I should verify prevalence and the importance of expertise. Prevalence in Europe is on the order of 30 per 100,000, and consensus guidelines emphasize management by sarcoma‑trained teams with planned en bloc oncologic surgery rather than piecemeal resections done without diagnosis, as unplanned excisions increase residual disease and recurrence risk [^1114U74h] [^1123PyeQ] [^1138rQ66].

> Next, I should review staging and imaging. Wait, let me verify the recommended cross‑sectional work‑up. ESMO‑EURACAN‑GENTURIS recommends contrast‑enhanced CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis for staging; whole‑body MRI can be considered in selected histotypes; brain MRI/CT only for alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear‑cell sarcoma, or angiosarcoma; FDG PET/CT is a problem‑solving tool in equivocal cases rather than routine; I initially thought PET‑CT was standard for all, but that would be overuse here [^116iN9P6].

> I will now examine tissue diagnosis strategy. Hold on, I should verify whether to proceed directly to resection or obtain a biopsy. For retroperitoneal/visceral sarcomas and indeterminate intra‑abdominal masses, image‑guided core needle biopsy with tract planning is standard to direct therapy and avoid non‑oncologic operations; in suspected small‑bowel or duodenal masses accessible endoscopically, EUS‑FNA may be used. Critically, if GIST is in the differential, immunohistochemistry and, if necessary, molecular analysis are recommended to establish the diagnosis and guide therapy, so I need to ensure KIT/DOG1 IHC and reflex KIT/PDGFRA sequencing when indicated [^11238a74] [^113XSabF] [^113Eqai2].

> But wait, what if this "sarcoma" is actually a GIST mimic or a sarcomatoid carcinoma? Let me consider the differential. Intra‑abdominal spindle cell lesions include GIST, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and sarcomatoid carcinoma; careful morphology plus IHC panels are essential. Features such as lymphatic invasion, fat entrapment, and alternating low/high‑grade areas favor undifferentiated (sarcomatoid) carcinoma over GIST, whereas strong KIT/DOG1 supports GIST; I should double‑check DOG1/KIT along with cytokeratin and vimentin if sarcomatoid carcinoma is suspected to avoid misclassification that would misdirect therapy [^114zxbHU] [^114KPVS8] [^113XSabF].

> Let me think about localized non‑GIST STS management. I should confirm the surgical standard. For adult‑type localized STS, en bloc wide excision aiming for R0 margins is the standard and should be performed by surgeons trained in STS; for high‑grade (G2–3) lesions, postoperative radiotherapy is generally recommended to improve local control. I need to ensure the operative note documents pre/intraoperative diagnosis, any tumor rupture or contamination, and planned margin quality because these factors are prognostically relevant and guide adjuvant decisions [^1123PyeQ] [^111PfcjU] [^114Rzie4].

> Hold on, I should verify how localized GIST diverges. For localized GIST, complete resection to achieve an R0 margin without routine lymphadenectomy is the standard; I almost said to perform nodal dissection, but GIST rarely spreads to nodes and guidelines advise against clearance of clinically negative lymph nodes. Risk stratification then drives consideration of adjuvant imatinib in higher‑risk disease, and mutation testing is crucial because PDGFRA exon 18 D842V is intrinsically resistant to imatinib, which should steer adjuvant planning and agent selection; I should confirm mutation status before committing to TKI therapy [^114JNhwj] [^115KotpR] [^116FENCk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if tumor rupture occurred or margins are close? I need to ensure we capture rupture because it upstages GIST risk and influences adjuvant therapy and surveillance strategies; surgical manipulation or spontaneous rupture with peritoneal spill portends peritoneal dissemination and high recurrence risk, so meticulous handling and documentation are essential. If I initially overlooked subtle capsular disruption, I should reconsider operative details and pathology to correctly classify rupture and tailor adjuvant therapy and follow‑up intensity [^116M7qVR] [^114Rzie4].

> Next, I should review systemic therapy for advanced or unresectable non‑GIST STS. Let me first confirm first‑line chemotherapy. Anthracyclines are standard first‑line; multi‑agent regimens with adequate‑dose ifosfamide or dacarbazine can be considered in chemosensitive subtypes when tumor shrinkage is advantageous and performance status allows; for doxorubicin‑pretreated patients, gemcitabine‑based regimens such as gemcitabine/docetaxel or dacarbazine/gemcitabine are reasonable options. Whenever feasible, I should also assess for metastasectomy of isolated lung disease after a disease‑free interval when complete resection is possible [^116Ms2Wg] [^1164Bt86] [^116FEkNU].

> For advanced or metastatic GIST, I should verify TKI sequencing. Imatinib 400 mg daily is the treatment of choice and should be continued until progression or intolerance, but I need to check mutational status first because PDGFRA D842V predicts primary resistance and would alter first‑line strategy; subsequent lines and dose adaptations depend on mutation and response assessment by contrast‑enhanced CT, while PET can help in early metabolic response assessment when morphology is equivocal [^115KotpR] [^113XSabF] [^116iN9P6].

> I need to ensure I do not miss special considerations. In patients younger than 46 years, I should consider germline TP53 testing in selected contexts due to implications for Li‑Fraumeni syndrome surveillance and radiation sensitivity; also, brain imaging is not routine and should be reserved for specific histotypes such as alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear‑cell sarcoma, and angiosarcoma, so I should not over‑order neuroimaging unless clinically or histologically indicated [^1161WFxQ] [^116iN9P6].

> Let me verify surveillance planning. Follow‑up after curative‑intent treatment should be risk‑adapted, using periodic clinical exams and cross‑sectional imaging of the primary site and lungs given the propensity for pulmonary metastases in many STS and hepatic/peritoneal spread in GIST; contrast‑enhanced CT is typical, with MRI used selectively. If I initially planned PET for routine surveillance, I should correct that plan, since PET is better reserved for problem‑solving or early treatment‑response assessment rather than standard follow‑up imaging [^116iN9P6].

Soft-tissue sarcomas of the small bowel are rare [^111g5QSB] and most often present with **nonspecific symptoms** — such as abdominal pain, obstruction, or bleeding [^111jdvKr] — which delay diagnosis and worsen outcomes [^113ThP55]. **Contrast-enhanced CT** is the primary imaging modality for detection and staging [^116iN9P6], while MRI is useful for further characterization and for patients with contraindications to CT [^112h8SFu] [^1172awgL]. Definitive diagnosis relies on **histopathology and immunohistochemistry** [^11238a74], with molecular testing guiding targeted therapy [^116FENCk]. **Surgical resection with negative margins** [^111PfcjU] is the mainstay of treatment [^1123PyeQ]; adjuvant radiotherapy is considered for high-grade tumors, and chemotherapy is reserved for advanced or metastatic disease [^116Ms2Wg]. Prognosis is **generally poor** due to late presentation [^111g5QSB], with 5-year survival approximately 39% [^111g5QSB].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

- **Rarity**: Small bowel sarcomas are rare, comprising about 10% of small bowel cancers [^111g5QSB].
- **Symptoms**: Patients typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including abdominal pain, obstruction, or gastrointestinal bleeding [^111undig].
- **Delay**: Nonspecific symptoms often lead to delayed diagnosis and advanced disease at presentation [^111undig].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

- **CT**: Contrast-enhanced CT is the primary imaging modality for detecting and staging small bowel sarcomas [^116iN9P6].
- **MRI**: MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast [^1172awgL] and is useful for further characterization and in patients with contraindications to CT [^112h8SFu].
- **PET**: FDG-PET/CT can be useful in equivocal cases or for detecting metastatic disease [^116iN9P6].

---

### Histopathological and molecular diagnosis

**Histopathology** is central to definitive diagnosis [^116FENCk] and relies on histopathological examination with immunohistochemical staining [^11238a74]. **Molecular testing**, including TP53 testing in selected patients, is recommended to guide targeted therapy.

---

## Treatment strategies

### Surgical management

Surgery with **negative margins (R0 resection)** [^1123PyeQ] is the primary treatment for localized small bowel sarcomas [^111PfcjU]. **Laparoscopy** is feasible and safe for selected patients, with oncologic outcomes comparable to open surgery [^111518Ph].

---

### Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies

**Radiotherapy** is recommended for high-grade (G2–3) tumors to reduce local recurrence [^111PfcjU]. **Chemotherapy**, including anthracyclines [^116Ms2Wg] and ifosfamide, is considered for advanced or metastatic disease [^1164Bt86].

---

### Targeted therapies

**TKIs** (e.g. imatinib) [^11238a74] are effective for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), a common small bowel sarcoma subtype [^115KotpR].

---

## Prognostic factors and outcomes

- **Prognosis**: Prognosis is generally poor due to late presentation and advanced disease stage at diagnosis [^115am7de].
- **Survival**: Five-year disease-specific survival is approximately 39%, with median survival of 34 months [^111g5QSB].
- **Factors**: Favorable prognostic factors include smaller tumor size (< 5 cm), localized disease, and complete surgical resection [^111g5QSB].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Imaging with regular **CT or MRI** is recommended to detect recurrence or metastasis [^116iN9P6]. **Multidisciplinary care** is essential for optimal outcomes [^1149NtDb].

---

Soft-tissue sarcomas of the small bowel are rare malignancies that often present with nonspecific symptoms, making early diagnosis challenging. **Surgical resection with negative margins** [^1123PyeQ] is the primary treatment, with adjuvant therapies considered based on tumor grade and stage [^111PfcjU]. Prognosis remains **poor** due to late presentation, underscoring the need for early detection and multidisciplinary management [^113FxG3R].

### Small bowel liposarcoma: A rare cause of small bowel perforation [^111jdvKr]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old patient was admitted with right-sided lower abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated a fatty mass arising around the bowel in the left iliac fossa, causing local distortion of the vasculature. His clinical condition rapidly deteriorated with worsening abdominal signs, necessitating an exploratory laparotomy. A segment of perforated small bowel associated with a mesenteric mass was excised, and the patient died three days later. The histology demonstrated a well-differentiated liposarcoma.

Liposarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcomas in adults, but occurrence in the gastrointestinal tract is extremely rare. The clinical presentation of these tumours is frequently non-specific, and the most common symptoms are generalized, intermittent abdominal pain. Surgical resection with clear margins is the treatment of choice for primary liposarcomas. They are moderately radiosensitive, and chemotherapy is non-effective. Although gastrointestinal liposarcomas have been previously reported, this is the first reported case of a primary liposarcoma associated with a small bowel perforation.

### Small bowel sarcoma: Analysis of survival from the National Cancer Data Base [^111g5QSB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel sarcomas (SBS) are rare, accounting for 10% of small bowel cancers. Consequently, few studies have had sufficient patient numbers to accurately define their natural history and determine factors impacting patient survival. This study aimed to examine patient and tumor factors in SBS and to identify prognostic factors for disease-specific survival (DSS) using the National Cancer Data Base.

- **Methods**: Data from the National Cancer Data Base, for patients diagnosed with primary SBS between 1985 and 1995, were analyzed. The chi-square statistic was used to determine significant differences among patient, tumor, and treatment factor groups. DSS was calculated for patients diagnosed between 1985 and 1990. Significant survival differences were determined using the Wilcoxon statistic for univariate analyses and Cox regression for multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: Among 14,253 small bowel tumors diagnosed between 1985 and 1995, sarcomas represented 10.1%. Overall, the 5-year DSS was 38.9%, with a median survival of 34.1 months (n = 590). Univariate analysis showed significant correlation of DSS with patient age, sex, tumor size, tumor grade, histologic type, general summary stage, nodal status, and whether cancer-directed surgery was performed. Multivariate analysis identified tumor size < 5 cm, leiomyosarcoma histology, and localized disease as significant favorable prognostic factors for DSS.

- **Conclusions**: SBS are rare tumors that pose challenges in terms of their histopathologic classification, grading, and staging. These factors must be considered in the management and prognosis of patients with SBS.

### Metastatic osteosarcoma presenting as a small-bowel polyp. A case report and review of the literature [^1145tc4n]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal metastases of osteosarcoma are an extraordinarily rare event and, as far as we can determine, have been reported previously only five times; these cases represent an unusual pattern of progression. We describe a 21-year-old man with an osteosarcoma of the right tibia that was removed four years previously. Two years later, the patient showed lung metastases. At his most recent presentation, he complained of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Radiologic examination revealed an abdominal mass close to the jejunum and three nodules in the liver. One metastasis was an ulcerated and pedunculated polypoid mass located in the mucosa of the bowel, and the other involved the entire thickness of the jejunum. This unusual phenomenon represents an alteration in the natural history of osteosarcoma as a result of increased long-term survival.

### Unusual presentation of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the duodenum mimicking an inflammatory enlargement of a peripancreatic lymph node [^115mdJfX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are low-grade malignant mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract and are believed to originate from malignant transformation of the interstitial cells of Cajal from their precursors. Duodenal GISTs are usually exophytic and appear as submucosal swellings; however, in the absence of specific mucosal changes or anatomical variations of the duodenal lumen, it may be difficult to differentiate a duodenal GIST from a malignant lymphoma, duplication cyst, retroperitoneal tumor, or pancreatic head tumor.

We present a case of a 40-year-old woman referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) after she underwent a contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography scan for diffuse abdominal pain. The scan showed a mass of 2 cm at the level of the internal part of the pancreas, suggesting a neuroendocrine tumor. Biochemistry and tumor markers were within normal limits.

At the level of the second part of the duodenum, a hypoechogenic pericholedochal mass was visualized between the pancreatic head and the duodenal wall. The mass was well-delineated, multilobular, and seemed not to derive from either the duodenal wall or the pancreatic parenchyma, suggesting an inflammatory enlargement of a lymph node given its appearance, i.e. triangular, homogeneous, and grayish. However, because of its abnormal size, we decided to proceed to EUS fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Surprisingly, histology confirmed a GIST characterized by spindled cells, strongly reactive to the antibody DOG1, with a proliferation index counted by Ki67 antibody to less than 5%.

### Small intestine leiomyosarcoma mimicking gastrointestinal stromal tumour [^115tAzRK]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Small bowel malignant tumors constitute only 2% of all gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Small bowel leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is even rarer, accounting for only 0.1%-3% of these tumors. Cases may present as asymptomatic intra-abdominal masses, anemia due to GI bleeding, or acute abdominal conditions such as perforation peritonitis, intussusception, and bowel ischemia. The standard of care is surgical resection. Our case involved a large, lobulated exophytic ileal LMS measuring 10.8 × 11 × 14.7 cm, affecting multiple small bowel loops and abutting the right iliac vessels and uterus. The patient's clinical course was complicated by COVID-19 positivity, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary thromboembolism. She was managed with preoperative anticoagulation followed by tumor resection with end ileostomy.

### Concurrent leiomyosarcoma causing small bowel obstruction in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^1128gUgS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common general surgical pathology, responsible for up to 15% of inpatient general surgery admissions in North America annually. SBO is most commonly associated with adhesions related to prior abdominal and/or pelvic surgery (75%). Less common causes include abdominal wall hernias, Crohn's disease, and small bowel (SB) neoplasia (5%).

Neoplastic SBO can be caused by a variety of disease processes, ranging from primary SB malignancies such as adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, or neuroendocrine tumors (NET) to metastatic lesions involving the SB, mesentery, or peritoneum. Primary lymphoma may develop in the SB; however, more frequently, the SB or mesenteric lymph nodes are involved secondarily in a systemic lymphoma. Collectively, lymphoma is one of the most common neoplastic processes involving the SB, prompting emergency presentation.

By contrast, sarcoma involving the SB is exceedingly rare, accounting for only 10% of SB neoplasms. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are the most common form of SB sarcoma (86%), followed by leiomyosarcomas (3%). Irrespective of the underlying cause of SB neoplasia, only 22% of patients present with SBO. Unlike adhesional SBO, which typically resolves without operative intervention, neoplastic SBO often requires surgical intervention.

Here, we present a rare case of SBO due to primary SB leiomyosarcoma in a patient with known lymphoma.

### Desmoplastic small-round-cell rectal tumor [^111brPU2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor was first described as a pathological entity by Gerald and Rosai in 1989. It is a rare, highly aggressive tumor associated with a poor prognosis, predominantly affecting young males. This tumor is a sarcoma belonging to the family of "small round blue cell tumors" of the pediatric population. It is associated with a unique chromosomal translocation t (11:22) (p 13; q 12) that involves the EWSR1 and WT1 genes.

This tumor is usually large and widespread at presentation, making it impossible to identify the organ of origin in many instances. Hence, it is speculated that the tumor most likely arises from mesothelial cells, explaining its occurrence in the peritoneum and occasionally in the pleura, lung, tunica vaginalis, sinus cavity, and the posterior cranial fossa. However, it has also been reported to arise from organs like the stomach, ovary, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and bone. One report described a localized origin from the sigmoid. In our reported case, the rectum was the organ of origin with metastasis to the peritoneal cavity.

CT scans aid in the diagnosis of these tumors by demonstrating multiple, bulky low-attenuation soft tissue masses in the omentum, mesentery, or peritoneum, mostly without a distinct organ of origin. Histological analysis typically shows small round blue cells in nests separated by an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates a polyphenotypic antigen expression profile and is positive for desmin, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, neuron-specific enolase, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen.

### Spindle cell sarcoma: A rare cause of a large abdominal mass [^113xaMY2]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old man presented with a huge intra-abdominal mass. Initially, a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) was diagnosed, but his tumour was subsequently classified as a spindle cell sarcoma. Difficulties in the classification of rare intra-abdominal tumours are discussed.

### Outcomes for soft-tissue sarcoma in 8249 cases from a large state cancer registry [^115am7de]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2007). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, outcome reports for soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) have largely been limited to single or paired institutional series. To more accurately elucidate population-based outcomes and prognostic factors associated with STS, a large cancer registry was examined.

- **Methods**: STS arising in the Florida Cancer Data System were examined (1981–2004).

- **Results**: A total of 8249 patients were identified, with the calculated annual incidence of sarcoma being approximately 38 cases per million in 2003. The tumor histologies among these patients were leiomyosarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (LMS/GIST) (43.5%), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) (31.5%), liposarcoma (19.0%), and fibrosarcoma (6.0%). Tumors were situated in the extremities (30.7%), truncal or visceral locations (50.4%), retroperitoneum (11.7%), and head or neck (7.2%). Thirty-three percent of lesions were over 10 cm in greatest dimension, while 50.2% were classified as high grade. Median overall survival was 25 months. Superior survival was observed for liposarcomas and fibrosarcomas as compared to MFH and LMS/GIST (P < 0.001). Retroperitoneal and truncal sarcomas had a more ominous prognosis than did other sites (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis of pretreatment variables demonstrated that increasing age, male gender, non-Caucasian race, advanced stage, and a truncal or retroperitoneal location were each independently associated with lower survival. Histological subtype was also an independent predictor of outcome. Surgical resection and radiation therapy were the only treatment variables shown to influence survival.

### Gastrointestinal stromal tumor: Advances in diagnosis and management [^111w2A6k]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract and should be differentiated from other mesenchymal tumors. They harbor specific activating mutations in the KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) receptor tyrosine kinases, which make them responsive to pharmacologic inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate.

- **Objectives**: To provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of GIST and the underlying principles of targeted therapy, to review the salient histologic and immunohistochemical features that facilitate the distinction of GIST from other mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, and to present the prognostic parameters for risk stratification that guide clinical management.

- **Data sources**: Review of the English literature through PubMed as well as personal experience. Photographs were taken from cases encountered at the Cleveland Clinic.

- **Conclusions**: The discovery of the KIT-GIST connection has not only improved the diagnostic accuracy of GISTs but also provided us with a better understanding of the histogenesis and molecular pathogenesis of these neoplasms.

### Sarcomatoid carcinoma of small intestine [^11331ZwE]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare type of tumor consisting of neoplastic cells expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal cell markers. The small intestine is an uncommon site for sarcomatoid carcinoma, and as of the time of writing, only a few cases have been reported. This manuscript details a case of jejunal sarcomatoid carcinoma in a man in his 50s and provides a review of the literature on sarcomatoid carcinomas of the small bowel.

### Technical considerations in surgical resection of desmoplastic small round cell tumors [^116RwYfh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Abdominal metastatic disease is a nearly universal feature of desmoplastic small round cell tumor. The presence of this large tumor burden can be dissuasive to surgeons. Aggressive attempts at resection of all the dozens to hundreds of nodules in the abdomen are often fraught with difficulty. This author has operated on over 200 patients with desmoplastic small round cell tumor and offers technical considerations that aid in the complete removal of all intra-abdominal tumors (sarcomatosis) with an organ-sparing approach.

The most challenging portion of the operation is resection of the pelvic tumor in the pouch of Douglas without removing either the bladder or the rectum. These tumors are almost always large and adherent to the bladder and rectum. The desired result should be a partial peritonectomy without any evidence of gross, visible disease.

### Highlights in soft tissue sarcomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) trials reported at ASCO 2017 Annual Meeting [^116zPfaM]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Herein, we summarise the results of the most relevant studies presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting in the field of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). Innovations in the management of localised disease and highlights from different experiences in the metastatic setting, as well as large studies on rare histologies, will be included. Special attention will be paid to results on immunotherapy, the use of antiangiogenics in histologies with limited sensitivity to standard chemotherapy, and new compounds. The preliminary results on the impact of next-generation sequencing in the everyday management of STS and GIST patients will also be discussed.

### Soft tissue sarcoma, version 2.2016, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1178Ysxu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare solid tumors of mesenchymal cell origin that display a heterogeneous mix of clinical and pathologic characteristics. STS can develop from fat, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, and other connective tissues. The evaluation and treatment of patients with STS requires a multidisciplinary team with demonstrated expertise in the management of these tumors. The complete NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma (available at NCCN.org) provide recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of extremity/superficial trunk/head and neck STS, as well as intra-abdominal/ retroperitoneal STS, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, desmoid tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma. This manuscript discusses guiding principles for the diagnosis and staging of STS and evidence for treatment modalities that include surgery, radiation, chemoradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.

### Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine: a case report and review of the literature [^114VX99R]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small bowel is rare; to our knowledge, 19 cases have been reported at the time of writing in the English literature under several names. We report an additional case occurring in the jejunum of a 55-year-old man. The tumor was a polypoid 7.5-cm mass, which infiltrated the full thickness of the intestinal wall and the serosa of an adhesed loop of small bowel. On microscopic examination, the neoplasm was composed of sheets of spindle cells; focally, an anaplastic component was present, including tumor giant cells with bizarre nuclei. On immunohistochemical stains, tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, vimentin, and, focally, epithelial membrane antigen. No staining for cytokeratin 20 was found. Sarcomatoid carcinoma must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of malignant spindle cell tumors of the small bowel. As consensus regarding the terminology of these rare tumors is being reached, immunohistochemical stains are essential for accurate diagnosis.

### Involvement of small bowel in systemic disease: CT and MR imaging finding [^114Vz796]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly MR enterography, are the standard cross-sectional imaging modalities used to study small bowel involvement in the context of multiorgan disease. Clinical symptoms are generally nonspecific in such cases. Moreover, imaging findings of the different conditions often overlap. However, analysis of the location and distribution of the lesions on the small bowel wall, as well as the rest of the bowel and distant organs, may help narrow the spectrum of diagnoses of multiorgan conditions involving both the small bowel and other organs.

The purpose of this presentation is to review and illustrate the CT and MRI features of small bowel involvement in systemic disease. Based on the underlying mechanism, we will categorize them as follows: congenital/hereditary, immunologic, infiltrative, vascular, infectious, and miscellaneous.

After the revelation of kinase targeting with orally available small molecules, the use of imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) has now become commonplace and is just one of many examples of the use of kinase inhibitors in cancer. In this article, we discuss important practice points that may impact therapy questions of primary and metastatic GIST, hoping the questions addressed in this rare solid tumor can serve as examples of what can be achieved with kinase-directed therapies in other cancers. We present cases that highlight some of the key issues in GIST management and afterward discuss both points of consensus and controversial issues in what is now recognized as one of the most common forms of sarcoma.

- **Implications for practice**: The treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) has become sophisticated with the availability of three approved agents in many countries and 15 years of experience with primary and metastatic disease. Important lessons from tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in GIST can be gleaned from this experience and will impact the implementation of similar agents for other cancers.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for local control of small, symptomatic lesions:

- **Marginal excision**: Wide excision is not indicated.

- **Electrodesiccation and curettage**

- **Intralesional chemotherapy**:
	- **Vinblastine**: 0.2 mg/mL solution with a volume of 0.1 mL per 0.5 cm² of lesion.
	- **Bleomycin**: 1.5–3 units/mL solution with a dose of 0.5 unit per 0.5 cm² of lesion (volume given depends on the size of the lesion) every 3–4 weeks until response.

### Granulocytic sarcoma of the small intestine [^111WUZDE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Granulocytic sarcoma is an extramedullary tumor of myeloblasts and/or immature myeloid cells, which can develop at any anatomic site and is often a forerunner to the development of acute myelogenous leukemia. Granulocytic sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract most frequently involves the small intestine and most often presents with abdominal pain and obstruction. Pathologists must consider granulocytic sarcoma in any mass of unknown origin with a diffusely infiltrating population of tumor cells, as the diagnosis is often initially unrecognized, especially in nonleukemic patients. Multiple ancillary modalities are available to assist pathologists in making the correct diagnosis so that appropriate therapy can be initiated.

### Morphological features useful in the differential diagnosis between undifferentiated carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor [^114KPVS8]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2020). Low credibility.

Undifferentiated (sarcomatoid) carcinomas may closely mimic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) due to possible histological and immunohistochemical overlap between these two entities. To avoid unnecessary employment of a wide spectrum of immunohistochemical stainings and molecular genetics, and thus decrease costs, finding simple morphological features to target further investigation of such neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract would be helpful. Five cases classified as undifferentiated (sarcomatoid) carcinomas, with a definite proof of the diagnosis (i.e. the presence of a differentiated carcinomatous component), were retrieved from the archives of several institutions.

For comparison, 84 cases of GIST mutated in KIT or PDGFRA genes served as the control group. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were evaluated for the presence of patterns which might discriminate between sarcomatoid carcinoma and GIST.

- **Lymphatic invasion and entrapment of fat tissue**: Strongly favor the diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma, as they were found in all or almost all cases of undifferentiated carcinoma, but in no GIST.
- **Alternation of low- and high-grade areas**: Formation of angiosarcomatous-like spaces and the presence of yolk sac-like areas were also detected in all cases of undifferentiated carcinoma, but only in 1.2%, 2.4% and 7.2% of the GISTs, respectively.
- **DOG1 negativity**: Found in all cases of undifferentiated carcinoma.

According to this study, the presence of the histological findings listed above should prompt extensive tumor sampling in order to find a differentiated carc.

### Dataset for reporting of gastrointestinal stromal tumours: Recommendations from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) [^116FENCk]. Histopathology (2023). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumours of the gastrointestinal tract and account for a significant proportion of sarcomas. Accurate diagnosis, classification, and reporting are crucial for prognostication and patient management, including the selection of appropriate targeted therapy. We report on international consensus-based datasets for the pathology reporting of biopsy and resection specimens of GISTs. These datasets were developed under the auspices of the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR), a global alliance of major international pathology and cancer organizations.

An international expert panel, which included pathologists, a surgical oncologist, and a medical oncologist, produced a set of core and non-core data items for biopsy and resection specimens. This was based on a critical review and discussion of evidence. All professionals involved were subspecialized soft tissue tumour experts affiliated with tertiary referral centres. Commentary was provided for each data item to clarify its clinical relevance and the rationale for its inclusion as a core or non-core element. Following international public consultation, the datasets, which include synoptic reporting guides, were finalized, ratified, and published on the ICCR website.

These first international datasets for GIST aim to promote high-quality, standardized pathology reporting. Their widespread adoption is expected to improve the consistency of reporting, facilitate multidisciplinary communication, and enhance data comparability, ultimately assisting in the advancement of patient care.

### Unplanned sarcoma excisions: Understanding how they happen [^1138rQ66]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue sarcomas are malignancies that originate from mesenchymal cells. These rare tumors represented 0.7% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2022. Soft-tissue sarcomas typically present with nonspecific symptoms such as a growing painless mass, whereas systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss are rare. In addition, the prevalence of benign soft-tissue tumors vastly exceeds that of sarcomas, which, when combined with their ambiguous presentation, can result in frequent unplanned excisions in the community setting. Noria et al. described the term "unplanned excisions" in the context of soft-tissue sarcomas that were resected without the proper preoperative diagnostic modalities and without the intention to achieve tumor-free margins.

The treatment cornerstone for soft-tissue sarcomas is wide-margin excision of the lesion. Surgical procedures performed without such intent and thoughtful planning, in the context of unawareness about the underlying malignant diagnosis, frequently increase the likelihood of residual tumor and local recurrence. Unplanned excisions tend to occur in a community or nonspecialized sarcoma center setting, where this rare disease is seldom diagnosed or treated. Once the unplanned excision has been performed and the sarcoma diagnosis rendered, the patient ought to be referred for definitive care to a center with experience in malignant soft-tissue tumors. The referred sarcoma specialist, typically an orthopedic oncologist, and the accompanying multidisciplinary team then decide the optimal treatment course.

The patient underwent laparotomy exploration, where a giant whitish, well-encapsulated solid mass was found (as shown in Figure 4), measuring approximately 15 cm in diameter. The mass was not invading nearby organs or structures. It had a posterior attachment to the pelvic retroperitoneum (Figure 5), from which it was completely separated. The completed exploration of the peritoneal cavity showed no other abnormalities. The intraoperative picture suggested an extragastrointestinal retroperitoneal tumor.

### Primary sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine: Very rare and aggressive tumour [^111W93Ai]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the small intestine is a very rare and aggressive variant of small intestinal cancers with poor prognosis. The tumour primarily affects middle-aged and older patients, with a mean age of 57 years at the time of presentation. We report a woman aged 58 years without any relevant medical history, who presented with small intestinal obstruction. She underwent radiologic and endoscopic investigation, showing persistent features of small bowel obstruction. The patient was found to have a small bowel tumour causing the obstruction and underwent surgical excision of the tumour. Pathology revealed malignant neoplasm with sarcomatoid and epithelioid features involving the terminal ileum. The use of immunohistochemical markers helps in a wide range of differential diagnoses. Surgical resection is still considered the best and first-line therapy, with poor response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

### Unusual presentation of a large GIST in an extraintestinal site: a challenging diagnosis dilemma [^117NUwqd]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) was a rare recognized entity until 2000, marking the discovery of an activating mutation of the c-kit tyrosine kinase found in almost all GIST tumours. This allowed for targeting those mutations with a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate.

GIST tumours now represent approximately 3%–5% of all soft tissue sarcomas and 3% of gastrointestinal (GI) tumours. Most GISTs arise from the stomach (50%–70%) and small intestine (20%–30%), including the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Other locations include the large intestine (5%) and the oesophagus in 2%–5% of cases.

Small numbers of extragastrointestinal stromal tumours (EGISTs) have been reported in the literature. Most of these were case reports or cohort analyses, such as the study by Mettinen et al, involving 112 cases, where clinicopathologic correlation and long-term follow-up data of such tumours are scant. Other groups, including FanFing and colleagues' analysis of 114 mesenteric GISTs, have reported EGISTs in other rare sites such as mesenteric locations.

### A guide for the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors [^113Eqai2]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract and are frequently detected on routine endoscopy. Although only approximately 10–30% of GISTs are clinically malignant, all may have some degree of malignant potential. Preoperative determination of malignancy risk can be estimated from tumor size and location, but reliable histopathologic criteria are not currently available. Given such biological uncertainty, accurate diagnosis is essential to differentiate these lesions from other truly benign, subepithelial tumors.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has emerged as an important procedure to secure a tissue diagnosis of a GIST. When encountering GISTs, gastroenterologists are faced with challenging management decisions, especially in the face of small, incidentally discovered lesions. The majority of localized GISTs are managed via surgical resection, although a select few may be observed using serial endoscopic ultrasound examinations. This review provides a general overview of GISTs, with an emphasis on their endoscopic diagnosis, the management of localized disease, and the management of incidentally discovered GISTs.

### Small intestine gastrointestinal stromal tumors [^117DUGLZ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

To review the contemporary management of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), including endoscopy, surgery, and systemic therapy, highlighting the aspects unique to small intestinal tumors.

- **Recent findings**: Tumor size, mitotic count, and site of origin are the three key prognostic factors, with mitotic count being the single strongest predictor of recurrence. Tumors arising in the small bowel have a worse prognosis than those of comparable size and mitotic count arising in other organs. Endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration are key components in the diagnosis of GIST. The role of endoscopy in surveillance and resection remains investigational. Surgery, either open or laparoscopic, is the only curative option, but recurrence rates are high. Adjuvant therapy with imatinib mesylate improves recurrence-free survival rates and may improve overall survival (OS) with longer duration of treatment. Neoadjuvant imatinib may play an important role in the management of patients with locally advanced disease. For patients with advanced disease, first-line imatinib and second-line sunitinib malate have improved progression-free and OS rates. Systemic treatment should be continued life-long or until treatment failure.

Advances in the last decade have dramatically changed the management and prognosis of patients with primary and advanced GIST.

### Sarcomatoid carcinoma of small intestine [^111WdKr1]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Clonal proliferations, both benign and malignant, are usually of one lineage of differentiation, and these are typically based on embryological lines. In general, tumors are of epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation, and pathologists conventionally use these broad lineage separations to diagnose and guide clinicians in the management of tumors. However, biphasic tumors are known to occur and have been extensively reviewed in the medical literature. Of the mixed lineage tumors that show both epithelial and mesenchymal features, there are broadly two different entities: carcinosarcomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas.

- **Carcinosarcomas**: Tumors with two distinct epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations, each with different immunophenotypic characteristics.
- **Sarcomatoid carcinomas**: Represent an epithelial neoplasm that may have derived from a single clonal cell, undergoing an epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Sarcomatoid carcinomas co-express both epithelial (e.g. cytokeratin) and mesenchymal (e.g. vimentin) markers. However, the nomenclature for sarcomatoid carcinoma is still ambiguous and sometimes it is used interchangeably with carcinosarcomas.

A summary of the demographic, surgical, and pathological attributes of sarcomatoid carcinoma in the small intestine, as presented in English-language publications accessible through PubMed since the year 2000, is mentioned in Table 1.

### Histology-tailored approach to soft tissue sarcoma [^113FxG3R]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas are a diverse and heterogeneous group of cancers of mesenchymal origin. Each histological type of soft tissue sarcoma has unique clinical particularities, which makes them challenging to diagnose and treat. Multidisciplinary management of these rare diseases is thus key for improved survival. The role of surgery has been well established, and it represents the cornerstone curative treatment for soft tissue sarcomas.

At the time of writing, local recurrence is the leading cause of death in low-grade sarcomas located at critical sites and distant metastasis in high-grade sarcomas, regardless of the site of origin. Management must be tailored to each individual histologic type. We describe the most common types of extremity, trunk, abdominal, and retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma, along with characteristics to consider for optimized management.

### Sarcomatoid carcinoma of small intestine [^117RqAMN]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In the differential diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma, carcinosarcoma should be considered. However, the malignant cells of sarcomatoid carcinomas co-express both mesenchymal and epithelial markers, while carcinosarcomas are composed of two different cell types that either express mesenchymal or epithelial markers. The malignant cells of our patient co-expressed cytokeratin (epithelial marker) and vimentin (mesenchymal marker), thus this is truly a sarcomatoid carcinoma.

### Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the small intestine: a review of 50 cases from a prospective database [^111mpr3C]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (M-GIST) are rare mesenchymal tumors originating in the wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Previous studies have included limited numbers of patients, and most included malignant and benign cases from throughout the GI tract. We reviewed the experience of a single tertiary cancer care center with M-GIST of the small intestine only.

- **Methods**: A prospective database identified all patients seen from 1989 to 1998. Clinical and pathological data, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. Overall median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 1–176 months).

- **Results**: Fifty patients (31 male, 19 female) were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 55 years. Disease was localized in 11 patients, locally advanced (invasion into adjacent organs/peritoneum) in 24 patients, perforated in 4 patients, multiple primary lesions in 2 patients, and distant metastases in 9 patients. All patients underwent resection, which was complete in 70%. Locoregional recurrence (LR) developed in 43% (median, 25 months), and distant metastases in 59% (median, 21 months) of patients at risk. At last follow-up, 14 patients were alive (6 disease-free), 2 had died disease-free, and 34 had died with the disease. Overall survival (OS) was similar for localized and locally advanced disease; OS also was similar for patients with multiple primaries and distant metastases at diagnosis. Patients were grouped into three stages: (I) patients with localized and locally advanced disease; (II) patients with perforated tumors; and (III) patients with multiple primaries and distant metastases.

In an era of molecular targeted therapy, patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) are living longer and are often followed with imaging. Therefore, it is important for radiologists to be aware of the atypical subtypes of GIST, implications of molecular makeup, its behavior, and the uncommon metastatic sites. The aim of this pictorial review is to illustrate the lesser-known aspects of GIST, including histological and molecular classifications, syndromes associated with GIST, and uncommon metastatic sites.

### Intra-abdominal spindle cell lesions: A review and practical aids to diagnosis [^114zxbHU]. Histopathology (2001). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal spindle cell lesions are uncommon and often present a diagnostic challenge. An important group of such lesions is the gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Other intra-abdominal spindle cell lesions include fibromatosis and various sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. In women, endometrial stromal sarcoma is also considered. Less common lesions are inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, mesenteric spindle cell reactive lesions, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and solitary fibrous tumors. A variety of intra-abdominal tumors of nonmesenchymal origin may have a spindle cell/sarcomatoid morphology; these include sarcomatoid carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and in women, sarcomatoid granulosa cell tumor. Finally, metastatic sarcomas from pelvic or extra-abdominal organs also need consideration. A set of practical aids to the diagnosis of intra-abdominal spindle cell lesions is presented to assist pathologists dealing with such lesions, particularly with regard to the consideration of differential diagnoses.

### Unusual presentation of a large GIST in an extraintestinal site: A challenging diagnosis dilemma [^112oP1m8]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT scan is the investigation of choice for staging and follow-up. MRI may be an alternative, such as for rectal GISTs. Chest CT scan and routine laboratory testing complement the staging workup. Evaluation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake using an FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or FDG-PET-CT/MRI, is useful for early detection of tumor response to molecular-targeted therapy or neoadjuvant therapy.

On imaging, the "embedded organ" sign is a useful and valid tool for identifying the organ of origin. GIST usually shows intense homogeneous enhancement; however, larger lesions show necrosis and appear heterogeneous and hypovascular. The EGISTs still have no typical radiological features and present a non-specific appearance with a wide differential diagnosis, including leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, paraganglioma, schwannoma, and lymphoma. EGIST presenting as a mass in the omentum, peritoneum, or retroperitoneum could be a primary GIST or a metastatic one.

Metastases in GISTs have been reported in 50% of patients. The liver is the organ with the most frequent metastases (65%), followed by the peritoneum (21%). Metastases to lymph nodes, lungs, and bones are considered rare sites. The question in our case is whether it is a primary EGIST or a latent recurrence from a previous small intestinal GIST diagnosed in the past as SMTUMP.

It is noted that small (< 1 cm) incidentally found GISTs behave almost invariably in a benign fashion, while tumors arising from the small bowel, colon, rectum, or mesenter…

### Management of soft tissue sarcomas of the abdomen and pelvis [^112SuuDi]. Colorectal Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas of the abdomen or pelvis are rare tumors that usually arise in the retroperitoneum but may also originate from the gastrointestinal tract or other abdominal organs. The aim of this study was to assess patient outcomes following treatment of these tumors at a tertiary referral center.

- **Patients and methods**: Data on all patients with soft tissue tumors treated under the care of one surgeon between January 1990 and December 2000 were reviewed.

- **Results**: Over the 11-year period, 61 patients underwent 79 operations for a soft tissue sarcoma of the abdomen or pelvis. Macroscopic clearance of the tumor at operation was achieved in 45 (74%) of the 61 patients. For primary tumors, this was 97%; for recurrent tumors, 50%; and for metastases, 33%. The median survival for those undergoing complete resection was 50 months (range 3–238 months, median follow-up 33 months). This compared with a median survival of only 6 months (range 1–127 months) for those who had incomplete resection (P = 0.001). The 5-year survival for patients who had complete resection was 61.5%; however, over one-third of the 5-year survivors have since recurred.

- **Conclusion**: This study confirms that most primary soft tissue sarcomas of the abdomen or pelvis are resectable, and the majority of patients will experience a long disease-free interval following resection.

### Concurrent leiomyosarcoma causing small bowel obstruction in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^113MojvT]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

These differences in management further reinforce the need for careful diagnostic consideration and multidisciplinary discussions for patients presenting with potential neoplastic small bowel obstruction (SBO). If surgery is required, regardless of the suspected underlying pathology, oncological principles are recommended to ensure negative resection margins and adequate sampling of mesenteric nodes for prognostication.

- **Learning points**: Although the gastrointestinal system is the most common site of extra-nodal involvement in lymphoma, some lymphomas are more likely to involve the small bowel (SB) than others. Potential neoplastic SB obstruction requires a broad differential, and, even in patients with known malignancy, second primaries are possible; a multidisciplinary discussion is helpful when considering operative management. Always adhere to oncological resection principles where possible. For sarcoma, a negative resection margin without spillage is essential, while for neuroendocrine tumours and adenocarcinoma, adequate nodal sampling is also required for accurate staging and prognostication.

### Myeloid sarcoma of the small bowel associated with a CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion and inv(16)(p13q22): a case report [^11288Jq5]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

This report describes a case of aleukaemic myeloid sarcoma of the small intestine in a 50-year-old woman presenting with small bowel obstruction. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis of interphase nuclei revealed a split CBFbeta signal, consistent with an underlying inversion of chromosome 16, inv(16)(p13q22). The resultant type A CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR. Immunohistochemistry with the AH107 antibody to the CBFbeta-SMMHC chimeric protein showed strong nuclear staining of the tumour cell nuclei. This represents the first use of this antibody in the diagnosis of this subtype of myeloid sarcoma in the small intestine.

Investigations reveal that no specific blood or serum markers have been identified for this malignancy. In certain cases, imaging studies, cytology, or biopsy may be conducted prior to surgery. In our patient's case, CT imaging revealed a substantial 8 cm mass in the small bowel, compressing the intestine, which led to the decision to proceed with surgical treatment. Pathologic evaluation of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma.

### Unusual presentation of a large GIST in an extraintestinal site: a challenging diagnosis dilemma [^114NrduZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

GIST's particular clinical features, histological and uncommon molecular characteristics have led many to consider separating it from the usual smooth muscle tumors into a specific entity. A striking, uniform immunoreactivity for KIT receptor (CD117) marked such stromal tumors, which was absent in other types of smooth muscle, Schwannian tumors of the GI tract, and other sarcomas of the GI tract. GISTs show morphological and immunophenotypic similarities with intestinal cells of Cajal, a pacemaker system in the GI tract.

The differential diagnosis of GISTs has been significantly facilitated by IHC testing, using a comprehensive and specific panel of antibodies for mesenchymal tumors. Most GISTs (> 90%) show overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (CD117) by IHC; however, a proportion of GISTs (5%) are CD117-negative.

Approximately 70% of GISTs express CD34 and may express smooth muscle actin on IHC. Other commonly used markers include caldesmon, S-100 (a neural cell marker) protein, and keratin, which can be variably immunoreactive in GISTs.

- **Differential diagnosis includes tumors with nervous differentiation**: Gastric schwannomas (intensely positive for S100-protein, but negative for CD117), tumors with fibrous differentiation such as intra-abdominal fibromatosis which affects the stomach (CD117-negative), inflammatory gastric polyp, and inflammatory myofibroblastic pseudo-tumor (both negative for CD117 and CD34). IHC can also exclude the retroperitoneal undifferentiated liposarcoma, and the other two mesenchymal tumors positive for c-KIT.

### Postradiation angiosarcoma of the small intestine: A case report and review of literature [^1132juJp]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Postradiation angiosarcoma is typically a high-grade sarcoma that predominantly occurs in the skin and superficial tissues. Instances of postradiation angiosarcoma originating in the small intestine are rare, with only 11 cases documented in the English-language literature. Herein, we report a case of postradiation angiosarcoma of the small intestine, occurring 9 years after radiotherapy for uterine cervical adenocarcinoma. The patient presented with symptoms indicative of intestinal obstruction. Exploration through laparotomy revealed tumor nodules involving the small bowel. Microscopically, the neoplasm comprised spindled and epithelioid cells, organized in solid aggregates and occasionally forming vascular channels. The diagnosis of angiosarcoma was confirmed through immunohistochemical analysis, showing tumor cell expression of CD31, CD34, and factor VIII-related antigen. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed 10 months after the laparotomy. A diagnosis of postradiation angiosarcoma should be considered for any poorly differentiated neoplasm emerging in a previously irradiated site. Accurate diagnosis hinges on histomorphologic identification of vascular differentiation, reinforced by immunohistochemical expression of endothelial-related markers.

### Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) with a thousand faces: Atypical manifestations and causes of misdiagnosis on imaging [^113X5x3f]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) can lead to emergency situations, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and tumoural rupture with haemoperitoneum or peritonitis. If a GIST grows exophytically to a large size, it is often misdiagnosed as a tumour arising from adjacent organs. Sometimes, the atypical appearance of GISTs on imaging causes diagnostic confusion. In this article, we illustrate a variety of GISTs with atypical presentations and discuss the important diagnostic clues for differentiating GISTs from other lesions.

### Surgery for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the stomach and small bowel: short- and long-term outcomes over three decades [^111zbfi3]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Many studies on gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) derive from tertiary referral centers, but few examine strictly population-based cohorts. Thus, we evaluated the clinical features, surgical treatments, clinical outcomes, and factors predicting the survival of patients with GISTs in a population-based series.

- **Methods**: Patients with GISTs diagnosed at Stavanger University Hospital over three decades (1980–2012) were analyzed. Data were retrieved from hospital records. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier) are presented. A limited number of colorectal GISTs (n = 6) restricted most analyses to those with a gastric or small bowel location.

- **Results**: Among 66 patients surgically treated for GISTs, 60 patients (91%) had either a gastric or a small bowel localization. Females comprised 61%. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range, 15–88). Clinical symptoms were recorded in 43 patients (65%). Complete tumor resection was achieved in 85% of the patients. During follow-up, 6 patients were surgically treated for local recurrence or metastatic disease. The median follow-up time was 6.1 years. At last follow-up, 30 patients (46%) were deceased, 10 of whom died from GISTs. The median overall survival was 10.4 years. For GISTs with a gastric or small bowel location, a 1- and 5-year disease-specific survival of 100% and 96%, and a relapse-free survival of 96% and 78% were observed. Male gender, incidental diagnosis, smaller tumor size, a low mitotic rate, an intact pseudocapsule, low-risk categorization, and an early stage were significant factors.

### Small bowel imaging with MRI [^1172awgL]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved as a powerful tool for the assessment of the small bowel. The strengths of MRI include superb soft-tissue contrast, lack of radiation exposure, and the implementation of fast scanning techniques. Clinically relevant findings, such as inflammation and tumor disease, can be well-depicted. In this article, we describe the techniques of small bowel MRI, including its implementation and clinical outcomes in comparison to other radiological and endoscopic procedures.

### Laparoscopic resection of gastric and small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumors: 10-year experience at a single center [^111518Ph]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Complete curative resection remains the treatment of choice for nonmetastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The safety and feasibility of laparoscopy in the treatment of this disease has been shown; however, the long-term oncologic outcomes of this technique remain unclear.

- **Study design**: An ongoing prospectively maintained database including all laparoscopically resected gastric and small bowel GISTs (n = 116) at Mount Sinai Medical Center from July 1999 to December 2011 was retrospectively analyzed. Recurrence and survival outcomes were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank test.

- **Results**: Tumors were of gastric (77.6%) and small bowel (22.4%) origins. The overall mean tumor size was 4.0 cm (± 2.7 cm), and R0 resection was achieved in 113 (97.4%) cases. The overall perioperative complication rate was 14.7%, with a reoperative rate of 4.3% at 90 days. When comparing gastric with small bowel GISTs, a more acute presentation requiring emergent resections was noted in patients with small bowel GISTs (p = 0.08). However, tumor size, operative data, and perioperative outcomes were comparable in both groups (p = NS). At a median follow-up of 56.4 months (range 0.1 to 162.4 months), the recurrence rate was 7.8% and comparable in both gastric and small bowel GISTs (p = NS). Risk factors for recurrence on univariate analysis were the presence of ulceration/necrosis (p < 0.05) and tumor size > 5 cm (p = 0.05). The overall 10-year survival rate was 90.8%. Gastric and small bowel overall survival rates were similar (90.7% vs. 91.3%, respectively).

### Defining tumor rupture in gastrointestinal stromal tumor [^116M7qVR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

The definitions of tumor rupture in GIST proposed in this work are based on the results of retrospective studies and experience from sarcoma centers, and have been shown to distinguish patients at high risk of recurrence in a restricted number of studies. However, these studies are all retrospective; the number of patients with tumor rupture is comparatively few, and the number within each category is even fewer. The definitions need to be validated in prospective cohorts before widespread adoption. We elected to propose these definitions to collate the various categories of tumor rupture reported in the literature for further study.

### Primary and secondary tumors of the peritoneum: Key imaging features and differential diagnosis with surgical and pathological correlation [^1176i3Ba]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant neoplasms that may occur in many different anatomical sites. The spreading of sarcomas through the peritoneum is known as peritoneal sarcomatosis. The most frequent origin of peritoneal sarcomatosis is malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which commonly spread directly to the peritoneal cavity by extension of the tumor through the serosal surface of the bowel or stomach. Other sarcomas with frequent peritoneal extension are leiomyosarcomas and liposarcomas. In soft tissue and extremity sarcomas, peritoneal spread is unusual and is presumed to occur through a hematogenous route.

Imaging features on CT and MRI consist of solid omental and mesenteric nodular masses with random distribution, mimicking peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, it should be noted that in sarcomatosis, ascites is usually minimal or absent, and peritoneal implants more often show a spherical morphology, with frequent hypervascularity and bulky heterogeneous masses. The primary tumor usually presents as a large mass with heterogeneous contrast uptake and necrotic areas. In the particular case of GISTs, they appear as well-circumscribed tumors arising from the stomach or small bowel wall, with an extraluminal growth and a necrotic center. Liver metastases are frequent, and there is no evidence of lymph node enlargement. This feature may be useful to distinguish them from gastrointestinal NETs, which share similar hypervascular behavior but frequently manifest with regional node involvement.

### Primary small intestine angiosarcoma mimicking Crohn's disease [^112ipYew]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A man in his 40s presented to an emergency department after experiencing worsening abdominal pain for two days. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed circumferential mural thickening and luminal narrowing of the distal ileum, along with upstream dilatation of the small intestine, indicating small intestine obstruction. This prompted an emergency laparotomy, where two lesions in the distal ileum were identified as the source of his bowel obstruction and were resected. Immunohistochemistry of the resected segment revealed a primary small intestine angiosarcoma, acting positively for vascular markers ERG and CD31. A subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed positive mediastinal metastatic lymphadenopathy without organ metastases. Following his surgery, the patient recovered well and was promptly referred to an oncology unit at a specialized health centre for further treatment. Primary small intestine angiosarcoma is a rare entity in which patients present with non-specific symptoms, requiring prompt tissue diagnosis to facilitate multidisciplinary management.

### Diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors: A consensus approach [^1174bKPg]. Human Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

As a result of major recent advances in understanding the biology of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), specifically the recognition of the central role of activating KIT mutations and associated KIT protein expression in these lesions, and the development of novel and effective therapy for GISTs using the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571, these tumors have become the focus of considerable attention by pathologists, clinicians, and patients. Stromal/mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract have long been a source of confusion and controversy regarding classification, line(s) of differentiation, and prognostication. Characterization of the KIT pathway and its phenotypic implications has helped to resolve some, but not all, of these issues. Given the now critical role of accurate and reproducible pathologic diagnosis in ensuring appropriate treatment for patients with GIST, the National Institutes of Health convened a GIST workshop in April 2001 with the goal of developing a consensus approach to diagnosis and morphologic prognostication.

Key elements of the consensus, as described herein, are the defining role of KIT immunopositivity in diagnosis and a proposed scheme for estimating metastatic risk in these lesions, based on tumor size and mitotic count. It is recognized that it is probably unwise to use the definitive term "benign" for any GIST, at least at the present time.

### Intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor [^115Q3gUi]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) scan images of the abdomen show significant findings. Coronal CT contrast images illustrate massive ascites, a diffuse soft tissue thickening of the omentum (indicated by a star), and retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy (indicated by a white arrow).

The immunohistopathological features of omental deposits reveal important details. Microscopic examination shows an undifferentiated small cell tumor dissecting between muscle bundles (Hematoxylin and Eosin, ×400). Immunohistochemical staining with Desmin antibody displays characteristic perinuclear staining of the tumor cells (Desmin, ×400).

Intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor (IDSRCT) is identified as a rare neoplasm, with the mean age of diagnosis at 22 years (range of 6–49 years), and a male to female ratio of 4:1. The tumor typically manifests in the abdominal cavity, infiltrating the omentum with multiple nodular deposits in the peritoneum, diaphragm, splenic hilum, and mesentery of the small and large bowel. Clinically, patients often remain asymptomatic for variable periods before presenting with symptoms such as abdominal pain, distension, constipation, vomiting, and weight loss.

Ultrasound, CT scans, or magnetic resonance imaging can display lesions of varying size, from millimeter-sized lesions to large confluent nodules. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by small round cells that respond positively to immunostaining for epithelial, myogenic, and neurogenic cells. A chromosomal translocation t(11;22) is identified in this tumor. Most cases of IDSRCT present with metastatic disease, where resection remains incomplete, and chemotherapy proves only temporarily effective. The median survival ranges from 17 to 25 months. Other small round cell tumors include…

Regarding the medical management of soft tissue sarcoma, specifically concerning the management of localized disease, the 2021 ERN GENTURIS/ESMO/EURACAN guidelines recommend performing surgery as the standard treatment in all patients with adult-type, localized STSs. Surgery should be performed by a surgeon specifically trained in the treatment of STSs. An en bloc wide excision with R0 margins is suggested as the standard surgical procedure.

### Epithelioid angiosarcoma of the small bowel [^1154PXNH]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Angiosarcoma is a rare soft-tissue neoplasm that occurs most often in the skin and the subcutaneous tissues but very rarely in the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Design**: We report a case of multifocal epithelioid angiosarcoma involving skin and bowel and review the 18 previously reported cases of epithelioid intestinal angiosarcoma.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Our patient presented with weakness from anemia. Two small blue-black nodules were present on the skin. Fecal occult blood tests were positive, but gastroscopy and colonoscopy showed normal results. Enteroscopy revealed small ulcerated nodules in the distal duodenum and the proximal jejunum. Biopsy specimens of skin and duodenal nodules showed epithelioid angiosarcoma.

- **Results**: The intestinal nodules were treated with argon plasma coagulation, but the patient died 6 weeks after diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: The survival rate of intestinal angiosarcoma is poor, and most cases progress rapidly, with a 2-month median survival after diagnosis. Because of the infiltrative and multifocal nature of this malignancy, complete surgical excision is often not possible. Further studies are needed to establish the role of adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy in the treatment of angiosarcoma.

### Soft tissue sarcoma, version 2.2018, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1149NtDb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare solid tumors of mesenchymal cell origin that display a heterogeneous mix of clinical and pathological characteristics. STS can develop from fat, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, and other connective tissues. The evaluation and treatment of patients with STS require a multidisciplinary team with demonstrated expertise in the management of these tumors.

The complete NCCN Guidelines for STS provide recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of extremity/superficial trunk/head and neck STS, as well as intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal STS, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, desmoid tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma. This portion of the NCCN Guidelines discusses general principles for the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of STS of the extremities, superficial trunk, or head and neck; outlines treatment recommendations by disease stage; and reviews the evidence to support the guidelines' recommendations.

### Evaluation and management of small-bowel tumors in the era of deep enteroscopy [^111undig]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, small-intestine tumors are a rare phenomenon, but they are being discovered more frequently with newer diagnostic techniques. Prior studies of the small bowel were limited, making the diagnosis difficult. With the advent of CE and deep enteroscopy, gastroenterologists are finding these tumors at an earlier stage, thereby offering better management options for these patients. Although the incidence of small-bowel tumors has increased, the survival rates have remained the same. This may be a lag-time bias but could be a future area of research in this emerging field.

### Spontaneous perforation of jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Case report and review of literature [^113jedFT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of GIST is based on an index of suspicion, as specific diagnostic signs and symptoms are absent. Chronicity is common, while acute atypical presentations include hemorrhage and perforative peritonitis. Preoperative imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced abdominal computerized tomography (CT) aid in diagnosis. These modalities assess the extent of the tumor, metastases, and involvement of other organs. A dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides better information than CT in the preoperative staging workup. Endoscopy can diagnose gastric GISTs, demonstrating smooth, mucosa-lined protrusion of the bowel wall, which may or may not show signs of bleeding or ulceration. Endoscopic ultrasound with guided fine-needle aspiration is diagnostic for primary lesions in 89% of cases.

However, the relative usefulness of images depends on the site, duration, and suspicion of GIST in patients presenting with undiagnosed abdominal lumps. The decisive diagnosis rests on pathological and immunohistological tests. Histopathologically, GISTs are composed of spindle (70%), epithelioid, and round cells, or an admixture. Similarities with the histological picture of gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma, leiomyoblastoma, and poorly differentiated carcinomas may cause diagnostic dilemmas. Immunohistochemical assays for the CD117 antigen (KIT) are the mainstay for diagnosis.

Diagnosis of asymptomatic GIST with acute presentations like perforation remains elusive. Accordingly, our provisional diagnosis was peptic perforation, as free gas under the diaphragm was noted in an erect abdominal x-ray.

The NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma Guidelines include a subsection about treatment recommendations for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The standard of practice rapidly changed after the introduction of effective molecularly targeted therapies, such as imatinib and sunitinib, for GIST. In response to these changes, NCCN organized a multidisciplinary panel composed of experts in medical oncology, molecular diagnostics, pathology, radiation oncology, and surgery to discuss the optimal approach for the care of patients with GIST at all stages of the disease. The GIST Task Force, composed of NCCN faculty and other key experts from the United States, Europe, and Australia, met in October 2003 and again in December 2006 to expand on the existing NCCN guidelines for gastrointestinal sarcomas and identify areas for future research to optimize our understanding and treatment of GIST.

### Primary extraskeletal osteosarcoma of small bowel mesentery presenting with acute bowel obstruction [^116suVcs]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Extraskeletal osteosarcoma of the small bowel mesentery is an exceedingly rare condition characterized by its aggressive nature and malignant neoplasm of mesenchymal origin, marked by osteoid formation. While the final diagnosis is often made through histopathological analysis, we propose that a prospective radiological diagnosis may be feasible through the careful analysis of densities (ossification) within the mesenteric mass. To our knowledge, there is no literature detailing the radiological approach to making a prospective diagnosis of this condition. We present the 12th case of extraskeletal osteosarcoma worldwide and describe a radiological method that could be useful in prospective diagnosis.

### Radiologic evaluation and staging of small intestine neoplasms [^113ThP55]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The small intestine is an uncommon location for neoplasms in either clinical or radiological practice. Because of its anatomic location and morphology, diagnosing diseases that affect the small intestine poses difficulties. Symptoms are nonspecific, and endoscopy is commonly unsatisfactory. Since early and definite diagnosis is crucial for prompt therapy, radiological imaging plays an essential role. Enteroclysis is the primary and effective radiologic modality in the evaluation of small bowel neoplasms. Conversely, computed tomography should serve as the complementary radiologic method, as well as for staging. In this review, the most common neoplasms of the small intestine and their common radiologic findings are discussed.

### Dedifferentiated gastrointestinal stromal tumor: Recent advances [^11597THb]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. A small minority of GISTs exhibit morphologic and phenotypic changes and differentiate into an unusual phenotype through the process of dedifferentiation. Dedifferentiation can occur either de novo or after prolonged treatment with imatinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor. GISTs can present with various morphologies, including rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. The unusual histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of these tumors can be diagnostically challenging. Therefore, it is essential that pathologists recognize GISTs with unusual morphology and be aware of the dedifferentiation process. This review aims to provide an overview of the morphologic and molecular features of dedifferentiated GISTs. Additionally, we discuss diagnostic dilemmas and recent immunohistochemical markers that are useful in distinguishing dedifferentiated GISTs from other gastrointestinal tumors.

### Unusual presentation of brisk active small bowel bleeding from jejunal GIST [^113DaDc5]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

This case emphasizes the difficulties in diagnosing a patient with brisk active small bowel bleeding and the differential diagnostic process of identifying tumor types preoperatively using imaging information. It underscores the importance of the surgical approach in different scenarios. Despite advancements in small bowel imaging, identifying the source and causes of small bowel bleeding remains challenging, particularly in life-threatening situations. Jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, with small bowel GISTs commonly presenting with GI bleeding. However, brisk or massive bleeding is infrequently reported and poses a significant preoperative diagnostic challenge. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention are essential and can lead to excellent outcomes. Well-planned surgical intervention during emergency operations for gastrointestinal bleeding is integral to effective management.

### Defining tumor rupture in gastrointestinal stromal tumor [^113nuSAQ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Sarcomas are a family of rare mesenchymal neoplasms consisting of over 100 pathologically and genetically heterogeneous tumors, accounting for approximately 1% of all malignancies in adults. Fifteen percent are gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 75% are non-GIST soft tissue sarcomas (STS), and 10% are osteogenic. GIST is the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract, with an estimated incidence of 1 per 100,000 per year. Most GISTs develop in the wall of the digestive tract or hollow viscera and usually show expansive growth into the peritoneal cavity and/or gastrointestinal lumen. Although GIST is initially surrounded by normal gastrointestinal tissue, such as mucosa and serosa, breakdown of these biological barriers, including the so-called pseudocapsule of compressed normal tissue, by tumor proliferation may result in spontaneous rupture, with subsequent dissemination of tumor cells into the peritoneal cavity. Tumor rupture may require emergent surgery and is usually associated with a poor oncologic prognosis.

Although the goal of surgery for localized, resectable disease is a macroscopically complete resection, surgical manipulation with any incision into, or disruption of, the tumor capsule may result in potential dissemination of tumor cells into the peritoneal cavity. The extent of surgery has been described by various terms. The residual (R) tumor classification used in surgical oncology distinguishes macroscopic residual disease, microscopic residual disease at the surgical margins, and margin-negative resection, and applies to all solid tumors.

### The imaging features of gastrointestinal stromal tumours [^1158APUX]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are a rare group of mesenchymal neoplasms that occur predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, GISTs were classified as smooth muscle tumors, referred to as leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, or leiomyoblastomas. However, with the advent of immunohistochemistry, GISTs are now defined by the identification of cKit positivity. This identification is used to select patients with metastatic disease who may respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571. In this pictorial essay, we have attempted to describe the range of imaging findings of GISTs that can suggest a pre-biopsy diagnosis.
