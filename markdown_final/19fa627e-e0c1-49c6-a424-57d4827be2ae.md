## Question

how do you approach a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and alcoholic hepatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach the management of a patient with both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and alcoholic hepatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and prognosis of alcoholic hepatitis. Then, I should confirm HCC diagnosis and stage using imaging-based noninvasive criteria or biopsy when needed. Next, I will assess liver function and performance status to guide therapy. After that, I will convene multidisciplinary tumor board to integrate tumor burden, liver reserve, and comorbidities. Then, I will tailor therapy by stage, balancing cancer-directed treatment with hepatic support. Finally, I will embed addiction treatment, palliative care, and survivorship planning, while addressing surveillance and special scenarios such as noncirrhotic HCC or NAFLD overlap.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the immediate risks. Coexisting HCC with alcoholic hepatitis signals a high short-term mortality risk from AH plus a competing oncologic threat, so I need to triage AH severity with MELD and Maddrey's discriminant function, and I should calculate the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score to stratify risk, while also remembering that MELD alone correlates with early mortality in AH and informs transplant decisions [^111JKxrv] [^117P8dVT].

> I should confirm AH severity and initiate time-sensitive therapy now. If Maddrey's discriminant function is ≥ 32 or MELD is > 20, this indicates severe alcoholic hepatitis and I should consider prednisolone 40 mg daily for 28 days with Lille assessment at day 7 to define response. Nonresponders should stop steroids, and adding IV N-acetylcysteine to steroids improves 30-day survival, so I need to check for contraindications and plan close monitoring for infection and renal failure while providing aggressive supportive care and early nutrition [^116Z9MFz] [^113BEhyg] [^111JKxrv].

> Wait, let me verify prognostic dynamics at day 7. If the Lille score is > 0.45, I should discontinue steroids because futility is high and harms outweigh benefits. If Lille is < 0.45, I should continue steroids to day 28, and if MELD remains high and there is no improvement, I need to escalate early transplant evaluation in carefully selected patients with AH who fail medical therapy, coordinating addiction services simultaneously [^111JKxrv] [^114GNhfw].

> Next, I should review HCC diagnosis and staging while AH is being stabilized. For cirrhotic livers, typical arterial hyperenhancement with portal venous or delayed washout on multiphasic CT or MRI establishes HCC noninvasively; atypical lesions or noncirrhotic contexts may require biopsy and molecular profiling, so I need to ensure high-quality contrast-enhanced imaging and, if needed, discuss tissue acquisition with interventional radiology [^11431mHN] [^111WXjpA].

> Hold on, I should verify the staging framework. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification integrates tumor burden, liver function, and performance status and remains the standard to align treatment allocation with prognosis; however, in patients with ongoing AH, the effective BCLC stage may shift with liver function recovery or decompensation, so I should plan reassessment at defined intervals rather than a one-time label [^111AtnQP] [^113ouS1M].

> I will now examine liver function and performance status because they often drive treatment eligibility more than tumor size. I need to confirm Child-Pugh and MELD, quantify portal hypertension, screen for varices, and document performance status, recognizing that systemic therapy is generally avoided in decompensated cirrhosis outside trials, and that mild impairment (Child-Pugh 7–8) may allow carefully selected systemic therapy in exceptional circumstances [^111qFDFa].

> Let me consider the competing risks before proposing oncologic therapy. Active alcoholic hepatitis and ongoing alcohol use elevate risks of infection, bleeding, and decompensation and may preclude surgery, ablation, TACE, or transplant until stabilized; therefore, I should double-check for contraindications and coordinate aggressive alcohol cessation support, including medications and counseling, to mitigate harm and improve candidacy for curative options [^1146L51E] [^1128dKaW].

> I need to ensure a multidisciplinary team is engaged early. A liver tumor board including hepatology, surgical oncology, transplant surgery, interventional radiology, medical oncology, pathology, addiction medicine, nutrition, and palliative care should review imaging, labs, and biopsy to align a dynamic plan that adapts as liver function and AH inflammation evolve, since HCC outcomes are optimized with coordinated, longitudinal care [^111m2Tek] [^113W5w3M].

> For very early/early stage HCC (single ≤ 5 cm or up to 3 nodules ≤ 3 cm), I should confirm candidacy for resection, ablation, or transplant once AH stabilizes and abstinence is in place. Let me verify surgical candidacy: resection is reasonable with preserved liver function and low portal hypertension; transplant is prioritized when Milan criteria are met and decompensation is present; ablation is an option for small lesions in nonsurgical candidates; and if curative therapy is deferred due to AH, bridging TACE can be considered selectively with caution regarding liver injury [^111AtnQP] [^111j9aks].

> For intermediate stage (multifocal disease without vascular invasion), I should confirm preserved liver function before TACE, because TACE can precipitate liver failure in decompensated patients. In those with ongoing AH, I need to balance oncologic control against hepatic decompensation risk and may favor a staged approach once inflammation improves, documenting expected outcomes and monitoring closely after embolization [^111AtnQP] [^113ouS1M].

> For advanced HCC with macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, I should double-check Child-Pugh and performance status before discussing systemic therapy. Standard first-line regimens include atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or lenvatinib, but in decompensated cirrhosis these are generally contraindicated; if Child-Pugh is A with good performance, I can proceed, and for progression or intolerance, second-line options like regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab can be considered with sequencing by mechanism of action per guidelines [^111yTQWV] [^111qFDFa].

> But wait, what if AH is not improving and the patient is not a transplant candidate. I should confirm goals of care and initiate best supportive care emphasizing symptom control, management of ascites, encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding, while integrating early palliative care to address quality of life and advance care planning; prognosis in decompensated cirrhosis with HCC is often driven more by liver failure than tumor burden, which I must communicate clearly to align interventions with patient preferences [^111AtnQP] [^111j9aks].

> I need to ensure alcohol use disorder treatment runs in parallel with HCC care. Complete abstinence is the most effective disease-modifying intervention for ALD and should start inpatient with withdrawal protocols, continue with naltrexone or acamprosate when appropriate, and be reinforced with behavioral therapy; without sustained abstinence, both AH outcomes and HCC eligibility for curative therapy remain poor, so I should document adherence and coordinate close follow-up with addiction specialists [^112zX6r3] [^1128dKaW].

> Next, I should review surveillance and long-term management. After stabilization, HCC surveillance every 6 months with ultrasound ± AFP is indicated in cirrhosis of any etiology, including alcohol-related disease, and if the patient achieves transplant listing, surveillance intensity should align with transplant center protocols. I also need to remember that patients with NAFLD or MetALD may develop HCC without cirrhosis, though incidence in noncirrhotic NAFLD is generally below cost-effectiveness thresholds for universal surveillance, necessitating individualized risk stratification [^113BU9UN] [^112MhbXq] [^114vWjq1].

> Hold on, I should verify hepatitis co-factors because they alter risk and management. All patients with active HBV or HCV should receive or continue antiviral therapy, including peri-procedural suppression for HBV and DAA therapy for HCV, since viral control reduces HCC risk and recurrence and is endorsed across BSG and EASL guidance for patients undergoing curative therapies [^115GgW3s] [^114841jB] [^112y9a9y].

> I should double-check that I have addressed modifiable risk factors beyond alcohol. Smoking cessation reduces HCC risk, and in NAFLD or MetALD phenotypes, weight loss, glycemic control, and statins should be optimized, with complete alcohol abstinence emphasized because even modest intake can accelerate fibrosis and worsen outcomes in advanced liver disease [^114ZqtRT] [^114soaHr].

> Finally, I need to ensure a dynamic plan with defined checkpoints. Within 1–2 weeks, I should reassess AH response to steroids, infection risk, and MELD trajectory. Within 4 weeks, I should re-stage HCC after any improvement in liver function and revisit candidacy for curative therapy. At 3 months, I should review sustained abstinence, transplant listing status, and adjust oncologic therapy to evolving liver function, maintaining multidisciplinary oversight throughout [^111JKxrv].

In patients with HCC and alcoholic hepatitis, prioritize **abstinence and liver function optimization** because active alcohol use worsens liver failure and limits oncologic options [^1146L51E] [^1128dKaW]. Use the **BCLC staging** and Child-Pugh/MELD to guide therapy, and avoid systemic therapy in decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) [^111AtnQP] [^111qFDFa]. For severe alcoholic hepatitis, give prednisolone with early Lille scoring; add NAC when indicated, and consider early transplant in selected non-responders [^113BEhyg] [^116Z9MFz] [^111JKxrv]. For HCC, use TACE or ablation in Child-Pugh A/B; reserve resection for very select Child-Pugh A patients, and prioritize transplant for those within criteria. Systemic therapy is reserved for Child-Pugh A with good performance status, and all decisions should be made in a multidisciplinary setting with addiction support [^111j9aks] [^117G4cqJ] [^111m2Tek].

## Clinical assessment and staging

- **Diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis**: Clinical diagnosis is based on jaundice, AST/ALT ratio > 1.5, and exclusion of other causes; confirm severity with Maddrey's discriminant function (DF) and MELD, and use Lille score at day 7 to assess steroid response [^117P8dVT] [^111JKxrv].

- **Diagnosis and staging of HCC**: Use multiphasic CT/MRI with contrast washout; biopsy if imaging is inconclusive or for atypical lesions [^11431mHN].

- **Liver function assessment**: Child-Pugh and MELD are essential to stratify risk and guide therapy selection [^113NckxU].

- **Performance status**: Use ECOG to guide treatment intensity and eligibility for systemic therapy [^notfound].

---

## Management of alcoholic hepatitis

### Severe alcoholic hepatitis (DF ≥ 32 or MELD > 20)

- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisolone 40 mg/day for 28 days; stop if Lille > 0.45 at day 7 [^111JKxrv].

- **N-acetylcysteine**: Add IV NAC for 5 days with steroids to improve short-term survival [^116Z9MFz].

- **Early liver transplantation**: Consider in highly selected patients with nonresponse to steroids and no contraindications, using a 6-month sobriety rule with exceptions [^111JKxrv].

---

### Moderate alcoholic hepatitis (DF < 32 or MELD ≤ 20)

Supportive care includes **abstinence**, nutrition, and management of complications; **corticosteroids are not routinely indicated** [^113We9gQ].

---

## Management of hepatocellular carcinoma

### Localized disease (BCLC A)

- **Surgical resection**: For single tumors ≤ 5 cm, Child-Pugh A, and adequate remnant liver volume [^notfound].

- **Liver transplantation**: Milan criteria (single ≤ 5 cm or ≤ 3 ≤ 3 cm) or UCSF expanded criteria [^notfound].

- **Locoregional therapies**: TACE or ablation (RFA/MWA) for unresectable or bridge-to-transplant [^112GCkQd].

---

### Intermediate disease (BCLC B)

Transarterial chemoembolization (**TACE**) is first-line for multifocal disease without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread [^113p1e9X].

---

### Advanced disease (BCLC C)

Systemic therapy with **atezolizumab plus bevacizumab** is preferred for Child-Pugh A with good performance status; lenvatinib or sorafenib are alternatives [^111yTQWV]. Immunotherapy with **immune checkpoint inhibitors** is an option in selected patients with preserved liver function [^116FN6UR].

---

## Integration of management strategies

- **Abstinence from alcohol**: Essential to improve liver function, reduce complications, and expand oncologic options [^1146L51E].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Hepatology, oncology, surgery, radiology, and addiction specialists should coordinate care [^111m2Tek].

- **Sequential or combined therapy**: Consider TACE followed by systemic therapy in selected patients with preserved liver function [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing outcomes

- **Severity of alcoholic hepatitis**: DF, MELD, and Lille score predict short-term mortality [^111e8j6y].

- **Liver function reserve**: Child-Pugh and MELD strongly predict survival and treatment tolerance [^notfound].

- **Tumor burden and stage**: BCLC stage, vascular invasion, and extrahepatic spread drive prognosis [^113ouS1M].

- **Performance status**: ECOG performance correlates with survival and treatment eligibility [^notfound].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Severity of ah** | **Hcc stage** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe (DF ≥ 32) | Localized | - Steroids + NAC <br/> - Early transplant if nonresponder <br/> - TACE or ablation |
| Severe (DF ≥ 32) | Advanced | - Steroids + NAC <br/> - Systemic therapy if Child-Pugh A |
| Moderate (DF < 32) | Localized | - Supportive care <br/> - TACE or ablation |
| Moderate (DF < 32) | Advanced | - Supportive care <br/> - Systemic therapy if Child-Pugh A |

---

Management of HCC with alcoholic hepatitis requires **coordinated care**: treat AH first, restore liver function, and apply BCLC-guided HCC therapy, with abstinence and multidisciplinary input as cornerstones of care [^117G4cqJ] [^111m2Tek].

### Multidisciplinary strategies to improve treatment outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma: a European perspective [^111pmvVe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex disease with a poor prognosis. Incidence and mortality rates are increasing in many geographical regions, indicating a need for better management strategies. Among several risk factors for HCC, the most common are cirrhosis because of chronic hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection and alcohol consumption, obesity, and diabetes. In some patients, combined risk factors present additional challenges to the prevention and treatment of HCC. Screening and surveillance of high-risk populations varies widely by geographic regions, and access to optimal surveillance is critical for early diagnosis. The treatment choice for HCC depends on the cancer stage, patient performance status, and liver function and requires a multidisciplinary approach and close cooperation among specialists for the best patient outcomes. Despite advances in surgical treatments and locoregional therapies, recurrence and liver failure remain significant challenges. The pathogenesis of HCC is a multistep and complex process, wherein angiogenesis plays an important role. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only approved targeted agent for advanced HCC, although promising results have been obtained with other targeted agents and combinations, and the results of ongoing trials are eagerly awaited. Clinical trials with rigorous study designs, including molecular classification and validation of new molecular biomarkers, are required to improve the personalized treatment of HCC. This article provides an overview of HCC and was developed through a review of relevant literature, clinical trial data, and updated clinical guidelines.

Discussion

In this large systematic review and meta-analysis of 61 studies and 94 636 individuals, globally, about 15% of hepatocellular carcinoma were secondary to NAFLD. The highest proportion of NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma occurred in the South-East Asia region, and the lowest in the region of the Americas. The global proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to NAFLD increased over time. Patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma were older, had higher BMI, and had more metabolic comorbidities than patients with hepatocellular carcinoma due to other causes. Nearly 40% of patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma did not have cirrhosis, compared with about 15% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma due to other causes. In addition, only 33% of patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma underwent surveillance before hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis, versus 56% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma due to other causes. These findings have important implications. Because of the absence of cirrhosis, nearly 40% of patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma did not have routine indication for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance before hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis based on current practice guidelines. This probably contributed to the dismal rate of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma, in addition to poor disease awareness. Several studies have shown that NAFLD is severely underdiagnosed in clinical practice and associated with high mortality. In addition, patients with NAFLD are often overweight, which reduces the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect early hepatocellular carcinoma, and alternative methods for hepatocellular carcinoma screening might be required for patients with poor liver visualisation on ultrasound. Better strategies are required to identify non-cirrhotic patients with NAFLD at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma who require surveillance.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma management in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients: applicability of the BCLC staging system [^113p1e9X]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for > 5% of cancers globally, is ranked as the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Cirrhosis is the main risk factor for HCC development. Most cases are associated to chronic hepatitis B and C infection as well as alcohol consumption. In recent years, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has appeared as an important cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and HCC. In the absence of effective surveillance strategies, the stage of presentation is often advanced.

HCC is unique because in addition to cancer stage, the underlying liver function substantially affects prognosis. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system was proposed and has been validated by several groups in the United States and Europe and offers the best stage classification and guidance for HCC treatment allocation.BCLC staging system was developed mainly in European populations in which hepatitis C virus infection was dominant. Validation was also done by Asiatic group where hepatitis B virus is dominant.

This system currently recommends radical therapies [liver transplantation, surgical resection, or percutaneous ablation, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI)] for very early (BCLC stage 0) or early-stage (BCLC stage A) HCC, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for intermediate-stage (BCLC stage B) HCC, sorafenib administration for advanced-stage (BCLC stage C) HCC, and supportive care for end-stage (BCLC stage D) HCC. However, although this staging system was developed using an evidence-based approach, its application can be problematic in NAFLD patients because of different clinical profile of these patients. There are few reports of BCLC application in NAFLD patients.

Evidence has emerged suggesting that the molecular pathogenesis, clinical features, and the prognosis of NAFLD-related HCC may differ from viral-induced HCC. Most of HCC cases are described in cirrhotic patients, but HCC is increasing also in the noncirrhotic setting. These findings suggest that hepatocarcinogenesis may be deregulated in early stages of this disease. Some comparative studies suggest that NAFLD-related HCC patients are older and present with comorbidities that may limit HCC therapy according to recommended guidelines.

The main objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate whether the BCLC staging system and its treatment algorithm are suitable for patients with HCC arising from NAFLD. We also studied clinical characteristics of NAFLD-related HCC, and aspects related to diagnosis, overall survival, and predictors of survival.

Post-SVR lifestyle measures and metabolic risk — evaluation and counseling directives are provided: All patients achieving SVR should undergo evaluation for modifiable risk factors for liver injury, such as alcohol, drug use, fatty liver, and diabetes mellitus. No safe limit for alcohol consumption has been established post-SVR and, therefore, avoidance of significant alcohol intake should be recommended for all patients, and complete abstinence is prudent in patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis; even nonhazardous or low to moderate alcohol intake is associated with an increased risk of liver-related outcomes, and alcohol persists as a risk factor for all-cause mortality after eradication. Diabetes and fatty liver can develop de novo or persist long-term as risk factors for liver fibrosis progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and patients at risk or with a known diagnosis should be advised of the risk of liver-related complications, and continue disease-specific management to optimize weight loss and glycemic control. Available IFN-based data indicate that individuals who achieve SVR may continue to experience a higher mortality rate than the general population, including among noncirrhotic patients with a significant contribution from drug-related causes.

### Epidemiology and management of hepatocellular carcinoma [^114GfoTW]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contemporary clinical practice are becoming increasingly related to sustained virological response after hepatitis C, suppressed hepatitis B virus during treatment, and alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We review the emerging data on the risk and determinants of HCC in these conditions and the implications of HCC surveillance. However, from a public health perspective, active hepatitis C and B continue to drive most of the global burden of HCC. In United States, the age-adjusted incidence rates of HCC in Hispanics have surpassed those of HCC in Asians. Prognosis in HCC is complex because of the competing risk imposed by underlying cirrhosis and presence of malignancy. In addition to tumor burden, liver function and performance status; additional parameters including tumor biopsy, serum markers, and subclassification of current staging systems; and taking into account patterns of tumor progression may improve patient selection for therapy. Advancements in the treatment of HCC have included identification of patients who are most likely to derive a clinically significant benefit from the available therapeutic options. Additionally, the combination strategies of locoregional therapies and/or systemic therapy are being investigated.

### Prospective evaluation of the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in the elderly [^111Sos2v]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

An increasing proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are older than 75 years. Previous studies suggested that ageing does not adversely impact survival but they have the drawback of being retrospective and spanning a prolonged period of time.

Goals

Evaluate management and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in elderly.

Patients and Methods

A multidisciplinary oncology meeting prospectively evaluated all patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Management were standardised according to European and American guidelines. Forty patients older than 75 years were matched with younger patients for tumour extension and liver function. Both groups were compared for the type of treatment and survival.

Results

Male/female ratio was 1.2 as compared to 7 in controls. Cirrhosis was related mostly to hepatitis C virus in elderly, and equally to hepatitis C or B virus and alcohol in controls. Curative treatments were recommended in 55% of elderly and 75% of controls. Treatment actually performed was curative in 25% in elderly as compared to 63% in controls. Median survival (30 months) was identical in both groups.

Conclusion

Despite more restricted access to curative treatments, survival of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is comparable to that of younger patients.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^111yTQWV]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Liver cancer remains a global health challenge, with an estimated incidence of > 1 million cases by 2025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and accounts for ~90% of cases. Infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are the main risk factors for HCC development, although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming a more frequent risk factor in the West. Moreover, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated HCC has a unique molecular pathogenesis. Approximately 25% of all HCCs present with potentially actionable mutations, which are yet to be translated into the clinical practice. Diagnosis based upon non-invasive criteria is currently challenged by the need for molecular information that requires tissue or liquid biopsies. The current major advancements have impacted the management of patients with advanced HCC. Six systemic therapies have been approved based on phase III trials (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab) and three additional therapies have obtained accelerated FDA approval owing to evidence of efficacy. New trials are exploring combination therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-VEGF therapies, or even combinations of two immunotherapy regimens. The outcomes of these trials are expected to change the landscape of HCC management at all evolutionary stages.

### Management of hepatocellular carcinoma, an important cause of death in Japanese autoimmune hepatitis patients [^115kbmUd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent malignancy among primary hepatic cancers, an important cause of death, and is closely associated with chronic hepatitis. A variety of liver disorders can cause HCC, including viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Among these, HCC in autoimmune liver diseases, such as AIH, is conventionally considered rare. The annual carcinogenic rate of AIH is estimated to be 0.19–0.53%, which is lower than that of viral hepatitis (0.37–4.81%). However, the carcinogenic rate has been increasing with prolonged prognosis, and has been reported in 5.1% of patients in Japan. However, there are no established treatment recommendations for HCC in patients with AIH, and prognostic studies are scarce.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are currently the central role in the treatment of HCC, are not recommended for patients with concomitant autoimmune diseases and have not been studied in autoimmune liver diseases, limited to a few case reports on PBC and no case reports on AIH.

This study retrospectively examined the carcinogenic factors, treatment, and prognosis in patients with AIH and examined the current appropriate management of HCC in AIH.

### NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma: immunology and immunotherapy [^111KooDM]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Whereas it is now well established that chronic inflammation is an essential trigger of hepatocyte transformation and carcinogenesis, growing evidence indicates that in the NAFLD setting HCC can develop also in absence of cirrhosis (25%–30%) unlike in other etiologies such as alcoholic liver disease or chronic viral infection. This high incidence could be related to the multifactorial nature of NAFLD, where many risk factors (e.g. genetics, obesity, systemic comorbidities) may synergistically promote tumor initiation. Interestingly, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that NAFLD-related HCC is associated with higher frequency in patients without cirrhosis than patients with HCC with other etiologies (38.5% vs. 14.6%) but also accompanied by other metabolic comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hyperlipidemia; ref.). Of note, this was also reported to relate to lower surveillance rates as compared with other etiologies. However, results of another recent systemic review including 18 studies with a total of 470,404 patients revealed an annual incidence rate of HCC equal to 0.03 per 100 persons in patients with NAFLD without cirrhosis, whereas 3.78 per 100 person-years in patients with cirrhosis. Nevertheless, the authors encountered a high heterogeneity in pooled HCC estimates, only marginally reduced by sensitivity analyses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers and prognostic tools enabling personalized surveillance of patients with NAFLD, also without cirrhosis. Although a plethora of factors was reported to influence the progression of the disease (e.g. genetic, environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle habits), further clinical and experimental studies are required to address this still poorly understood issue. One exemplary factor is certainly represented by the consumption of alcohol in patients with NAFLD. In fact, whereas chronic alcohol consumption represents a major etiology for chronic liver disease and HCC, potential overlapping mechanisms in the context of NAFLD are still poorly defined. Clinical studies showed that alcohol consumption aggravates liver histology and fibrosis progression in patients with NAFLD. However, a few studies also indicate that moderate amount of alcohol intake seems to improve liver steatosis and overall cardiovascular disease, but this beneficial effects seem to depend mainly on the quality of alcohol consumed (e.g. red wine; ref.). Since the social problematic of alcohol consumption tightly relates to diffuse behavioral habits, it is not uncommon that NAFLD diagnosed patients might also experience a history of alcohol intake with widely variable consumption patterns and quality. This might certainly influence the disease progression as well as the risk of developing HCC. Given the systemic impact of alcohol as well as its immunosuppressive effects, more preclinical data and longitudinal clinical studies are required not only to identify possible biomarkers for further patient stratification but also to evaluate the responsiveness to therapy in individuals with these specific metabolic conditions. Finally, it is estimated that about 30% to 40% of patients with NASH develop fibrosis and about 15% of them progress to cirrhosis. It will be thus of highest importance to identify those patients with NASH without advanced fibrosis who are at risk to develop HCC to save resources and costs. In particular, given the large amount of patients with NAFLD worldwide, the surveillance of NAFLD progression to HCC should be optimized and improved in terms of sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. HCC surveillance should be performed in patients with cirrhosis, and progression of fibrosis should be assessed in non-cirrhotic individuals on a regular periodic basis. In this direction novel noninvasive test stratifying patients with NAFLD at risk to develop HCC have been proposed (e.g. FIB4, BARD, and GALAD scores, single-nucleotide polymorphisms analysis; refs.). The combination of classical biomarker detection like α-fetoprotein (AFP) with ultrasound has recently shown increased sensitivity as compared with the use of this noninvasive test alone. A novel intriguing diagnostic potential also emerged by the analysis of microbioma composition, serum lipidomic as well as by the adoption of liquid biopsies (e.g. miRNAs, extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells; ref.), but these methods are still in their experimental stage. The integration of many of these approaches by artificial intelligence algorithms may not only enable individuation of patients at high risk of disease progression but it may also offer more stringent criteria for patients' stratification for individualized therapies.

Benefits of surveillance

Two randomised trials of surveillance are widely cited to support surveillance. These were however performed in the East where the causes of liver disease are different to those in the UK (predominantly HBV); and surveillance was done for both non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the analysis of one of these trials. The second strand of evidence comes from multiple case control studies of people who have already developed HCC. These studies often show a survival benefit for surveillance and this was confirmed in one systematic review with meta-analysisbut not in another systematic review. Very few of these non-randomised studies take lead-time and length bias into account and will therefore overestimate the benefit of surveillance. More recently, observational studies considering the benefits of surveillance in a population with cirrhosis have been done with conflicting reports. These studies used a matched case control design and in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection there was a cancer related mortality reductionbut this was not evident in a mixed aetiology cohort. Consequently, from trial and non-randomised studies there is some uncertainty regarding the benefits of surveillance.

Data from health economic evaluations of surveillance that indicate benefit (at acceptable costs) for the intervention share a number of characteristics that are important when considering its overall effectiveness. First, the incidence of HCC is the critical determinant of the cost-effectiveness of surveillance in patients with cirrhosis. The incidence in non-cirrhotic HBV patients can be lower and surveillance still justified due to the higher chance of providing effective intervention if HCC is diagnosed. Second, all of the published evaluations to date only consider the first treatment after diagnosis of HCC. It is clear that this represents a simplification of the clinical scenario where both multiple treatments and indeed multiple, often metachronous, tumours are frequent. The only cost-effectiveness study done in a UK population indicates benefit (at acceptable cost) of ultrasound based-surveillance in people at high risk of HCC, such as those with hepatitis B virus infection, but not those at lower risk where there is a high risk of competing mortality, notably those with alcohol related liver disease.

INTRODUCTION

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising, especially in younger populations.HCC most commonly develops in the setting of chronic liver disease, in which longstanding inflammatory states predispose patients to malignancy. Although viral hepatitis and alcohol remain the primary etiology of chronic liver disease worldwide, metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is an emerging cause of cirrhosis and HCC in the United States because of an increase in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Surgical treatment provides the best opportunity for cure in patients with HCC provided they are eligible for resection or liver transplantation (LT). Unfortunately, a significant number of patients with HCC is diagnosed at advanced stages, managed with mostly palliative locoregional and/or systemic therapies, which offer symptom relief and disease control but not a cure.

Approximately 50% of patients with HCC receive systemic therapies, and, until recently, the standard of care remained multikinase inhibitors in the first‐line and second‐line settings. In the past 5 years, however, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the management of patients with advanced HCC. The advent of more effective systemic therapies, often paired with locoregional therapies, has facilitated prolonged survival among patients with metastatic as well as locally advanced disease and has allowed for some patients to undergo surgical intervention when radical surgery previously would not have been an option.

Given the complexities and nuances of HCC management, patients are ideally treated in a multidisciplinary setting in which surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, interventional radiologists, as well as hepatologists collaborate to deliver optimal care to achieve optimal outcomes. It also remains critical that treatment paradigms take into consideration patient‐and tumor‐related factors, such as performance status, extent of disease, and liver dysfunction, each of which are primary drivers of morbidity and mortality. In the context of the rapidly evolving surgical and systemic therapeutic landscape and treatment guidelines for HCC, this comprehensive review of multimodal management strategies for patients with HCC provides a valuable resource for all clinicians.

### Multidisciplinary management of hepatocellular carcinoma [^111m2Tek]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. Management algorithms continually are increasing in sophistication and involve application of single and multimodality treatments, including liver transplantation, hepatic resection, ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, radioembolization, and systemic chemotherapy. These treatments have been shown to increase survival times. As many as 75% of patients with limited-stage disease who are given curative therapies survive 5 years, whereas less than 20% of untreated patients survive 1 year. Treatment can be optimized based on the patient's tumor stage, hepatic reserve, and functional status. However, because of the heterogeneity in presentation among patients, a multidisciplinary approach is required to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, involving hepatologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and oncologists. We present each specialist's viewpoint on controversies and advances in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: prevention and therapy [^113JWvYd]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy of the liver and occurs most often in the setting of chronic liver disease. The most common acquired causes for this are chronic viral hepatitis infections (mostly HBV and HCV), and alcohol. Other causes include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-related nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, and biliary diseases. In addition, certain heritable diseases like hemochromatosis and α-1-antitrypsin deficiency can also lead to HCC. Therefore, prevention of HCC can be achieved by preventing and controlling these problems. For treatment, curative modalities are surgical resection and liver transplantation. However, most patients are not candidates for these surgical maneuvers, and outcomes are poor. New therapeutic developments have brought some improvement with both local and systemic disease control.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^1128dKaW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction — epidemiology and key management concepts for alcoholic liver disease emphasize that alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease worldwide and accounts for up to 48% of cirrhosis-associated deaths in the United States. Alcohol is also a frequent co-factor in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection where it accelerates hepatic fibrosis, and individuals with long-term heavy alcohol use remain at risk for advanced liver disease with alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most patients with ALD present after they have developed jaundice or complications of cirrhosis, and identification in primary care at an early stage with subsequent behavioral interventions should thus be encouraged. Few pharmacological advances have been made in ALD management, and to date the most effective therapy to attenuate the clinical course and even reverse liver damage is prolonged alcohol abstinence. Novel non-invasive diagnostic tools and promising pharmacological approaches for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) are still needed, and recent studies suggest that early liver transplantation (LT) can be successfully performed in highly selected patients with AH.

### Distinctive features of hepatocellular carcinoma in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^113zAQB4]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis have been identified as emergent risk factors for this primary liver cancer. Incidence of NAFLD is increasing as a consequence of the epidemic spread of metabolic syndrome, which can result in progressive liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and its complications. Most data about the prevalence and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NAFLD are from a few population and cohort studies; its incidence is increasing and it is likely to become a leading indication for liver transplantation, especially in industrialised countries. In patients with NAFLD, hepatocellular carcinoma can arise in the context of non-cirrhotic liver, suggesting a specific carcinogenic pathway. Pathology studies have also described steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma as a specific histological variant. NAFLD is underdiagnosed as causative liver disease, and patients are often diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in the advanced stage because of the absence of efficient surveillance policies in this patient population. Management of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NAFLD is also complicated by comorbidities, mainly cardiac disease and diabetes, which negatively affect eligibility for radical treatments, including hepatic resection and, especially, liver transplantation. Finally, the effect of hepatocellular carcinoma treatments on postoperative morbidity, mortality, and disease-free survival remains to be precisely defined.

### Rational HCC screening approaches for patients with NAFLD [^11226e2R]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially among those who have cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, but 20–30% of cases of NAFLD-related HCC occur in the absence of advanced fibrosis. The prevalence of NAFLD-related HCC is increasing in most countries worldwide. There are few direct data to support or refute the efficacy or effectiveness of HCC surveillance in NAFLD or to guide its application. We use evidence on surveillance in other conditions and studies on the clinical course of patients with NAFLD to arrive at recommendations for rational approaches to HCC surveillance in this growing cohort of patients. We also outline gaps in research and practice, including opportunities to advance the field.

### New aspects of diagnosis and therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma [^111WXjpA]. Oncogene (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the major cancer killers. It affects patients with chronic liver disease who have established cirrhosis, and currently is the most frequent cause of death in these patients. The main risk factors for its development are hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcoholism and aflatoxin intake. If acquistion of risk factors is not prevented and cirrhosis is established, the sole option to improve survival is to detect the tumor at an early stage when effective therapy may be indicated. Early detection plans should be based on hepatic ultrasonography every 6 months, whereas determination of tumor markers is not efficient. Upon detection of a hepatic nodule, there is a need to establish unequivocal diagnosis, either through biopsy or through the application of non-invasive criteria based on the specific radiology appearance of the tumor: fast arterial uptake of contrast followed by venous washout. Effective treatment for liver cancer includes surgical resection, liver transplantation and percutaneous ablation. These options provide a high rate of complete responses and are assumed to improve survival that should exceed 50% at 5 years. If the tumor is diagnosed at an advanced stage, the sole option that improves survival is transarterial chemoembolization. Ongoing research should further advance the time at diagnosis and identify new and effective options targeting molecular pathways governing tumor progression.

Introduction

Non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common, affecting approximately 25% of the population in many developed countries. The disease ranges from steatosis to non-alcohol-related steatohepatitis (NASH; fat with hepatocyte injury and hepatic inflammation) and can progress to cirrhosis and liver-related complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. Individuals with NAFLD have an increased risk of overall mortality compared with the general population, and common causes of death include cardiovascular disease, malignancy and liver-related complications –. The majority of the estimated 14.1 million individuals with NAFLD in the UK remain undiagnosed and worryingly the prevalence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis is projected to double to 1 million individuals by 2030. Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD in the population, recognition and management of the condition is variable across the UK. One multicentre study from England found a large variability in the primary and secondary care management of NAFLD, with clear deficiencies identified in primary care investigations, fibrosis staging, provision of lifestyle treatments, and assessment and management of cardiovascular risk factors. There is therefore a clear need to improve the holistic management of patients with NAFLD in order to achieve better outcomes.

### Evidence-based diagnosis, staging, and treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [^113ouS1M]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is key to their optimal care. For individuals at risk for HCC, surveillance usually involves ultrasonography (there is controversy over use of biomarkers). A diagnosis of HCC is made based on findings from biopsy or imaging analyses. Molecular markers are not used in diagnosis or determination of prognosis and treatment for patients. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer algorithm is the most widely used staging system. Patients with single liver tumors or as many as 3 nodules ≤ 3 cm are classified as having very early or early-stage cancer and benefit from resection, transplantation, or ablation. Those with a greater tumor burden, confined to the liver, and who are free of symptoms are considered to have intermediate-stage cancer and can benefit from chemoembolization if they still have preserved liver function. Those with symptoms of HCC and/or vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic cancer are considered to have advanced-stage cancer and could benefit from treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Patients with end-stage HCC have advanced liver disease that is not suitable for transplantation and/or have intense symptoms. Studies now aim to identify molecular markers and imaging techniques that can detect patients with HCC at earlier stages and better predict their survival time and response to treatment.

### Advances in resection and transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma [^1131wFS1]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

It would be impossible to summarise all of the significant developments in the surgical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even just over the past year, in a manuscript of this scope. Thus, we have selected topics for discussion that are the subject of current controversy and have attempted to present balanced points of view. Hepatic resection and transplantation are both mature modalities, and for the most part technical advances and improvements in candidate selection are incremental. The ability to readily cure hepatitis C stands out as the most impactful development in the field over recent years, especially in Western countries where hepatitis C has long been the chief aetiology underlying HCC and a predictor of poor outcomes after surgery, but its full implications remain to be clarified. The rising incidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related HCC and what it means with regard to surgical HCC management is an area of great current interest. With advancing technology, non-surgical locoregional treatments are gaining increasing application as potentially curative therapies. In addition, the advances in molecular and genomic assessment of HCC hold promise for personalising treatment and prognostication. The possible role of immunotherapy as an adjuvant to resection is being aggressively investigated. While liver surgery maintains an important role, the care of patients with HCC is more and more a team effort and needs to take place in the context of a well-integrated interdisciplinary programme to achieve the best outcomes for patients.

Staging of hepatocellular carcinoma

The purposes of cancer staging are to accurately predict a patient's prognosis and to determine the appropriate therapeutic intervention(s). As outlined previously, HCC is a somewhat unique tumour: it usually affects patients with underlying chronic liver disease, and both tumour burden and liver function need to be carefully evaluated at the time of the prognostic prediction and the treatment recommendation. Underlying liver disease and dysfunction has a significant impact on the chosen treatment, and may limit life expectancy more than the cancer. Therefore, an optimal staging system for HCC will need to incorporate tumour burden, liver function, as well as the overall functional status of the patient.

Several groups have developed different systems or scores for stratifying patients with HCC. Numerous comparisons have been made, but because the patient selection criteria and the preferred treatments in these published studies vary significantly, no final conclusion about the optimal system has been made. The BCLC classification is endorsed by the European Association for the Study of the Liverand the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and is widely used in Europe and North America, but not in Asia. The classification divides patients with HCC into five stages (0, A, B, C and D) according to pre-established prognostic variables, and allocates recommended therapies.

For the UK population, disease staging according to the BCLC fulfils an important role for prognostication, but the recommended treatment algorithm has been modified (ee section 'Treatment allocation'). The TMN staging system, widely used for other cancers, is less useful in HCC for prognostic stratification and treatment allocation. This is because liver function is not considered, which as outlined is a key factor in defining both prognosis and treatment.

Recommendations: staging of hepatocellular carcinoma

Staging systems for prognostication and treatment allocation for patients with HCC need to incorporate tumour burden, underling liver function and performance status (evidence high; recommendation strong)
The BCLC staging system has been extensively validated and is the most widely used in Europe and the United States. It is recommended for staging and prognostication (evidence high; recommendation strong).

Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma

Introduction

The selection of treatment modality depends as much on the underlying liver function and degree of portal hypertension as on the oncological stage of the tumour, as well as the patient's performance status. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment options apart from liver transplantation are severely restricted. In patients with compensated liver disease, multiple treatment options are potentially available.

Deaths from the majority of cancers are falling globally, but the incidence and mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in the United Kingdom and in other Western countries. HCC is a highly fatal cancer, often diagnosed late, with an incidence to mortality ratio that approaches 1. Despite there being a number of treatment options, including those associated with good medium to long-term survival, 5-year survival from HCC in the UK remains below 20%. Sex, ethnicity and deprivation are important demographics for the incidence of, and/or survival from, HCC. These clinical practice guidelines will provide evidence-based advice for the assessment and management of patients with HCC. The clinical and scientific data underpinning the recommendations we make are summarised in detail. Much of the content will have broad relevance, but the treatment algorithms are based on therapies that are available in the UK and have regulatory approval for use in the National Health Service.

### Management of alcoholic hepatitis [^11331sfT]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

About 5,000 people die each year from chronic liver disease in England and Wales alone. In many patients, the liver injury is due to chronic excessive alcohol consumption and manifests as alcoholic hepatitis (an acute inflammation of the liver), cirrhosis, or alcoholic hepatitis superimposed on a background of cirrhosis. Mild alcoholic hepatitis may be asymptomatic and reversible, but where the hepatitis is more severe, up to 65% of those affected die from it. The incidence of alcoholic hepatitis in the UK seems set to increase with the rise in heavy drinking, particularly among women. Here we review how patients with alcoholic hepatitis should be managed.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma management in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients: applicability of the BCLC staging system [^1128Aey4]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

HCC is the main cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. The BCLC system is the preferred staging system to evaluate patients with HCC as it takes into account the characteristics of the tumor, the degree of liver impairment, and the physical performance. Moreover, it is the only one that links prognosis assessment with treatment recommendation. NAFLD is a well-recognized etiology of HCC. Although clinical profile and hepatocarcinogenesis of these patients may be different from viral hepatitis infected patients, the BCLC could be applied in most cases of HCC arising in the context of NAFLD.

In this study, we characterized the outcome of patients with HCC arising on NAFLD or cryptogenic liver disease. Patients enrolled in a regular surveillance program were more often diagnosed at an early stage. Surveillance in patients with established cirrhosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is part of international recommendations. Recently, a Japanese group observed that in 28% of NAFLD patients, HCC developed in less advanced stages of fibrosis. In the present study, we observed HCC in 4 noncirrhotic patients that were treated with liver resection. However, recommendation of surveillance in this subgroup of patients can not be generalized and must be made with caution because it is estimated that in the United States, NAFLD can affect 30% of the general population.

Recently, 166 new cases were collected over 22 months in the FLIP consortium and the demographic aspects found in our study were similar to this larger database. However, in the FLIP study, 59% patients were symptomatic and consequently BCLC stage C or D, whereas in the present study, 47% were BCLC stage 0 and A. Besides, applicability of the BCLC system was not evaluated in FLIP study. Another difference was the larger proportion of noncirrhotic patients in the FLIP study (43%) compared with 10% in our study. Preliminary data show that almost all noncirrhotic cases occurred in steatohepatitis rather than steatosis alone in both studies.

The majority of studies describing HCC in the context of NAFLD usually focus on risk factors for liver carcinogenesis. Very little information is available on tumor stage and treatment of HCC after diagnosis. Besides, several factors affect the choice of treatment options and as the BCLC staging system is based on clinical and radiologic findings, it is not possible to determine exact stage in some patients.

Background & Aims

Management strategies for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have changed, along with liver allocation policies based on model for end-stage liver disease score. We investigated etiologic-specific trends in liver transplantation in the United States during different time periods.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study, using the United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network registry data, to identify all adult patients registered for liver transplantation in the United States from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2015. For subjects listed with multiple diagnoses, HCC was considered the primary listing diagnosis. To determine whether availability of direct-acting antiviral agents, which began in 2011, affected pretransplant (death or drop-out) and post-transplant outcomes for patients with HCV infection, we compared data from the time periods of 2004 to 2010 and 2011 to 2014. We used competing-risk analysis to compare differences in end points between these periods. Differences between periods in pretransplantation and post-transplantation outcomes were estimated using Kaplan-Maier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. Associations between year of listing and pre-liver transplant outcome, and year of liver transplant and survival after transplant, were examined using the log-rank test. Proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the reliability of the time period effect with potential confounders.

Results

Among 109,018 registrants, 18.5% were registered for liver transplantation because of HCC. In 2015, HCC was the leading diagnosis among registrants (23.9% of registrations) and recipients (27.2% of recipients). Between 2004 and 2015, the ratio of registrants with vs without HCC increased 5.6-fold for patients with HCV infection, 1.9-fold for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 2.7-fold for patients with alcohol abuse, and 10.2-fold for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. After adjusting for covariates, we associated the period of 2011 to 2014 with a decreased probability that HCC registrants would undergo liver transplantation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; P < .0001). The period of 2011 to 2014 also was associated with a decreased probability of drop-out owing to deterioration or death from HCV-induced (HR, 0.90; p = 0.0003), HBV-induced (HR, 0.71; p = 0.002), or alcohol-induced (HR, 0.90; p = 0.01) liver disease, and an increased probability of delisting as a result of clinical improvement in patients with HCV infection (HR, 3.4; P < .0001), HBV infection (HR, 2.3; p = 0.004), or alcohol abuse (HR, 2.2; P < .0001). The period of 2011 to 2014 was associated with a decreased risk of graft loss or death, with the largest effect seen in HCV-infected recipients (HR, 0.76; P < .0001).

Conclusions

HCC was the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States in 2015. Despite this, the probability of liver transplantation decreased the most in registrants with HCC. Pretransplantation and post-transplantation outcomes have improved, particularly in patients with HCV infection.

### Attacking the public health crisis of hepatocellular carcinoma at its roots [^112z8tzw]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer‐related death worldwide with significant mortality rates in the United States. Its strong association with cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) provides a compelling logic for targeted screening and prevention. Despite this, progress in identifying at‐risk individuals and early detection of HCC in these populations has lagged behind treatment advances.

Currently available tools for HCC screening are imperfect. Although HCC surveillance in high‐risk groups is endorsed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), not all organizations share this view. This lack of consensus may undermine widespread adoption of surveillance programs, thus preventing HCC detection at a curable stage. HCC management involves treatments tailored to tumor burden and hepatic reserve, but disparities exist in access to the multidisciplinary teams that should oversee this complex process.

The at‐risk population for HCC is growing in response to the rise in chronic liver disease from alcohol use and NAFLD, and there is an urgency to address these issues. This will require robust research support, particularly in diagnostics and health services delivery. Stakeholders in government and professional organizations must engage to heighten HCC awareness among health practitioners and the community and to improve linkage to care.

In this public policy piece, we examine opportunities for prevention of HCC by focusing on its principal risk factors: viral hepatitis, NAFLD, and alcohol‐related liver disease (ALD). Adoption of the strategies we have highlighted below represents three key action points to reverse the course of this public health crisis:
Awareness and education
Screening and diagnosis
Partnerships and advocacy

The risks of liver cirrhosis and HCC

According to a WHO report, approximately 280 million individuals, or 4.1% of the population aged > 15 years, meet the definition of AUD (alcohol dependence and the harmful use of alcohol). The prevalence is almost the same as the prevalence of hepatitis B, and is four times higher than the prevalence of hepatitis C. Because of the large population — HCC screening (eg, ultrasonography or the measurement of serum tumour marker levels) for all of such patients would lead to huge medical costs — it is necessary to select individuals with a high risk of HCC. In this respect, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends that patients with Child's classification A/B cirrhosis undergo surveillance for HCC using ultrasonography with or without alpha-fetoprotein measurement, every 6 months, and does not recommend the modification of the surveillance strategy based on the 'etiology of liver disease', the strategy of which is almost the same as that recommended by the European Association for the Study of the Liver. Incidentally, the previous AASLD guidelines for the management of HCC suggested that HCC surveillance is cost-effective if the annual incidence of HCC is ≥ 1.5% in patients with cirrhosis. Similar to hepatitis C and hepatitis B, the presence of alcoholic liver cirrhosis is considered to be an important risk factor for the development of HCC. It has been reported that approximately 10%–20% of heavy drinkers develop cirrhosis. Furthermore, several previous studies that have assessed the annual incidence of HCC in patients with alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis have revealed the rate to be 1.9%–2.6%. Thus, it might be appropriate to perform HCC surveillance for patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. However, even when guideline-based surveillance was performed, almost 20%–30% of HCC in patients with cirrhosis were diagnosed at a non-early stage. It is therefore necessary to determine the traits of patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis that increase their risk of HCC and the traits of patients with AUD who show the highest risk of HCC.

Harms of surveillance

In common with all screening and surveillance programmes, there are potential harms. These result from the imperfect nature of the surveillance intervention and can be categorised as a consequence of false negative and false positive investigations. False negative tests, or missed cancers, result in harm as a cancer that is present is not identified and treated. False positive tests result in further downstream investigations, including liver biopsy that can lead to physical and psychological harms. Furthermore, there is the potential for overdiagnosis of HCC which may not contribute to the person's decline but are treated with costs to the individual and to society.

Surveillance in the non-cirrhotic patient with MASLD

While there is agreement about the application of surveillance in patients with MASLD cirrhosis, there is a lack of consensus regarding the value of HCC surveillance in non-cirrhotic MASLD. This is noteworthy and clinically relevant given the growing literature demonstrating a substantial risk of developing HCC in the absence of cirrhosis in MASLD patients compared with patients with other aetiologies of liver disease. However, cohort studies suggest the annual incidence of HCC in non-cirrhotic MASLD falls below the cost effectiveness threshold to justify surveillance. A meta-analysis of 18 studies with 4 70 404 patients found a pooled annual incidence of 0.03 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.07) in non-cirrhotic NAFLD, compared with 3.78 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 2.47 to 5.78) in those with cirrhosis. Current data suggests HCC surveillance is unlikely to be cost effective in non-cirrhotic MASLD, outwith of additional risk stratification criteria.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: clinical frontiers and perspectives [^112GCkQd]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death and is currently the main event leading to death in patients with cirrhosis. Evolving information suggests that the metabolic syndrome with non-alcoholic liver disease may be an important cause of HCC in addition to viral hepatitis and alcohol-induced liver disease. The molecular pathogenesis is extremely complex and heterogeneous. To date the molecular information has not impacted on treatment decisions. Periodic surveillance imaging of patients with cirrhosis is widely practiced, especially because diagnostic, radiographic criteria for early-stage HCC have been defined (including nodules between 1 and 2 cm) and effective treatment is available for tumours detected at an early stage. Worldwide the approach to resection versus transplantation varies depending upon local resources, expertise and donor availability. The criteria for transplantation are discussed, and the controversial areas highlighted with evidence-based recommendations provided. Several approaches are available for intermediate stage disease, including radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolisation and radioembolisation; the rationale for these therapies is buttressed by appropriate outcome-based studies. For advanced disease, systemic therapy with sorafenib remains the option best supported by current data. Thus, while several trials have failed to improve the benefits of established therapies, studies assessing the sequential or combined application of those already known to be beneficial are needed. Also, new concepts are provided in regards to selecting and stratifying patients for second-line studies, which may help explain the failure of prior studies.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115xW1Qo]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk and outcomes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are summarized as follows: a study with a duration of 85.6 ± 54.5 months showed an overall 10-year survival of 81.5%. The current HCC incidence rate among NAFLD patients was determined to be 0.44 (range, 0.29–0.66) per 1,000 person-years. In another study of patients with HCC, 54.9% of the HCC cases were related to HCV, 16.4% to alcoholic liver disease, 14.1% were related to NAFLD, and 9.5% to hepatitis B virus, and it is estimated that the risk for developing HCC in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis is very small.

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^116S2Y8C]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading etiology for chronic liver disease with an immense public health impact and affects > 25% of the US and global population. Up to 1 in 4 NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent data confirm that HCC represents the fifth most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NAFLD has been identified as a rapidly emerging risk factor for this malignancy. NAFLD-associated liver complications are projected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next decade. Despite evidence that NAFLD-associated HCC may arise in the absence of cirrhosis, is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and is associated with lower receipt of curative therapy and with poorer survival, current society guidelines provide limited guidance/recommendations addressing HCC surveillance in patients with NAFLD outside the context of established cirrhosis. Limited data are presently available to guide clinicians with respect to which patients with NAFLD should undergo HCC surveillance, optimal screening tools, frequency of monitoring, and the influence of coexisting host- and disease-related risk factors. Herein we present an evidence-based review addressing HCC risk in patients with NAFLD and provide Best Practice Advice statements to address key issues in clinical management.

Best practice advice 6 — Patients with cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease should be counseled on abstaining from alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking; compared with never smokers, the adjusted meta-relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.37–1.67) for current smokers and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.78–1.60) for former smokers, and smoking accounted for 13% and 9% of HCC globally and in North America, respectively. In pooled data, current smokers had increased risk (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.57–2.20), individuals who quit more than 30 years ago had risk nearly equivalent to never smokers, and e‑cigarettes may turn out to be equally harmful and patients should be counseled to abstain from those as well. For alcohol, population attributable fractions for HCC were 26% and 32% globally and in North America, and epidemiology shows PAF ranging from 13%–32%; a meta-analysis found no significant increased risk for moderate use (< 3 drinks/d) but relative risk 1.16 (95% CI, 1.01–1.34) for heavy drinking (> 3 drinks/d), and another analysis found only heavy drinking (> 50 g/d) associated with increased HCC risk (RR, 2.07 (95% CI, 1.66–2.58)). Additional pooled data found heavy alcohol consumption (> 2 drinks/d) associated with an 87% increased HCC risk, whereas light or moderate alcohol consumption (< 3 drinks/d) was inversely associated; risk from alcohol on death from HCC is attenuated after prolonged (> 10 years) sobriety, and in NASH cirrhosis any alcohol use was an independent risk for cancer (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.6–8.9; p = 0.002).

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^117LTqtE]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent cause of advanced liver disease in Europe and is the leading cause of death among adults with excessive alcohol consumption. There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the risk of ALD. The relative risk of cirrhosis increases in subjects who consume more than 25 g/day. The burden of alcohol-attributable liver cirrhosis and liver cancer is high and is entirely preventable. Health agencies should develop population-based policies to reduce the prevalence of harmful and/or hazardous alcohol consumption and foster research in this field to provide new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Disease progression of patients with ALD is heavily influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis have opened new perspectives in the early detection of advanced ALD in asymptomatic patients. Alcoholic hepatitis, the most severe form of ALD, carries a high short-term mortality (around 30–50% at 3 months). Corticosteroids improve short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis but duration of therapy should be adapted to early response. Liver transplantation is the best option for patients with severe liver dysfunction. However, alcohol relapse after transplantation remains a critical issue and drinking habits of transplanted patients need to be routinely screened.

### The impact of new data in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [^112GGfbK]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, causing 500,000 deaths yearly. The risk factors mostly responsible for the rising incidence of HCC in the Western hemisphere are hepatitis C, alcoholic cirrhosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which most commonly leads to HCC in the setting of cirrhosis. Over the past 30 years, several chemotherapeutic single agents and combinations have been tested in HCC, yet none have demonstrated any improvement in survival. Recently, the multitargeted anti-angiogenic and Raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib has shown a survival advantage as a single agent and improved outcomes in combination with doxorubicin. Other novel agents have also shown intriguing outcomes as single agents (sunitinib) or in combination (bevacizumab and erlotinib). The encouraging results and clinical information gathered in recent trials are generating important clinical questions regarding which patients to treat, how to accommodate concurrent cirrhosis, and which parameters to use to monitor efficacy and the potential benefit from therapy.

RISK FACTORS FOR HCC

More than 90% of HCC cases develop amidst chronic inflammatory liver disease. Cirrhosis, regardless of its etiology, represents the primary risk factor for HCC; and HCC, which has an annual incidence of 1%–6% in the cirrhotic population, is the foremost cause of mortality in this population.

Viral hepatitis is the most common risk factor for HCC. Worldwide, it is estimated that over 350 million people have chronic infections caused by hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), with 80%–90% of these individuals unaware of their infection statusand thus at an unappreciated risk for HCC. In Asia and Africa, approximately 60% of HCC cases are attributable to HBV infection, whereas, in Western regions, this figure remains approximately 20%. Chronic HCV infection is the most prevalent precursor to HCC in regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. Although the majority of cases of HCC are associated with advanced fibrotic liver disease (bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis), HBV‐associated HCC may occur in the absence of advanced fibrosis, an observation that affects screening strategies for patients with chronic HBV disease.

Alcohol‐related liver disease accounts for 20% of HCC casesand is an independent risk factor for HCC. Furthermore, alcohol can enhance the effects of other risk factors, such as viral hepatitis, leading to an earlier onset of liver cancer. Patients diagnosed with HCC because of alcohol have the lowest survival rate compared with those who have HCC caused by other factors (median survival, 6 vs. 8–10 months).

MASH has seen a notable rise in its association with HCC since 2010. Currently, MASH accounts for 15%–20% of HCC cases in Western countries.HCC without cirrhosis occurs more frequently in cases related to MASH compared with other causes. Specifically, 39% of HCC cases associated with MASH arise without cirrhosis, in contrast to 22% for HBV, 6% for HCV, and 9% for alcohol‐related liver disease. For those patients without HBV (see above) in this cohort, HCC without cirrhosis is still most often identified in the milieu of advanced fibrosis. Studies have demonstrated that metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease is more prevalent in men than in women during the premenopausal stage; however, its prevalence is higher in postmenopausal women.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide. NAFLD represents a spectrum of disease that includes simple steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. The numbers of individuals presenting with end-stage complications of NASH, namely decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), are rising, and NASH is rapidly becoming the most common indication for liver transplantation. Yet not all patients within the NAFLD spectrum progress, and for the majority, NAFLD is a benign condition. A key clinical challenge is to identify the proportion of patients who are at high risk of developing advanced liver disease, so that interventions, including the many novel therapies in development, can be targeted to those at greatest need.

Our current understanding of NAFLD epidemiology and progression largely derives from single-centre studies of small- or medium-sized cohorts and meta-analyses of these. These studies, together with emerging data from placebo arms of therapeutic trials, have taught us that patients with existing evidence of progressive disease (e.g. fibrosis) are at risk of further progression to HCC and decompensated cirrhosis, albeit this may reflect a degree of lead-time bias. Such studies often involve formal assessment of well-phenotyped patients at inclusion but are, by design, selective and may not represent the 'real-world' situation for the majority of patients with NAFLD. Paired biopsy data have been reported, although the second biopsy is often performed because of clinical suspicion and not per study protocol, which may bias estimates of progression. Real-world patients are socially and ethnically diverse, have comorbidities and concomitant medications or simply cannot commit to long-term studies or trials and therefore may not be represented by any of these study designs.

Moderate alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is described and management priorities are outlined. Such patients might be classified as having moderate AH (which would be defined as having a MELD ≤ 20 or MDF < 32). Although there is no well-established therapy for these patients, medical attention should focus on the diagnosis of disease, patient education, referral, and interdisciplinary management of these patients with AUD treatment specialists to achieve alcohol cessation. Early detection of "subclinical" ALD and prevention of progression to AC should be a management goal in both the primary care setting as well as in hepatology referrals.

Emerging etiologic risk factors — cirrhosis is the strongest risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is present in over 80% of patients with HCC, and patients with cirrhosis from any etiology typically have a ~2% annual risk of developing HCC. In Sub-Saharan Africa, HCC develops at substantially younger ages (median age 46 y), and projections suggest HCC incidence will double by 2040; this age disparity persists in people who are hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected who emigrate elsewhere, such that more than one-third of persons are < 40 years. Antiviral therapy for HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) also significantly reduces HCC risk, although patients with cirrhosis and possibly those with advanced fibrosis continue to have persistent risk of developing HCC. Alcohol use as a cofactor with other etiologies increases HCC risk as much as 5-fold. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the leading cause of HCC in the absence of cirrhosis, with approximately one-fourth to one-third of NAFLD-related HCC occurring in the absence of cirrhosis.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^116Ug5W1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally and has an incidence of approximately 850,000 new cases per year. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer. The main risk factors for developing HCC are well known and include hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcohol intake and ingestion of the fungal metabolite aflatoxin B1. Additional risk factors such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are also emerging. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC have led to identification of critical driver mutations; however, the most prevalent of these are not yet druggable targets. The molecular classification of HCC is not established, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification is the main clinical algorithm for the stratification of patients according to prognosis and treatment allocation. Surveillance programmes enable the detection of early-stage tumours that are amenable to curative therapies - resection, liver transplantation or local ablation. At more developed stages, only chemoembolization (for intermediate HCC) and sorafenib (for advanced HCC) have shown survival benefits. There are major unmet needs in HCC management that might be addressed through the discovery of new therapies and their combinations for use in the adjuvant setting and for intermediate- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, biomarkers for therapy stratification, patient-tailored strategies targeting driver mutations and/or activating signalling cascades, and validated measurements of quality of life are needed. Recent failures in the testing of systemic drugs for intermediate and advanced stages have indicated a need to refine trial designs and to define novel approaches.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^117G4cqJ]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide and represents a major global health-care challenge. Although viral hepatitis and alcohol remain important risk factors, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is rapidly becoming a dominant cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. A broad range of treatment options are available for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, including liver transplantation, surgical resection, percutaneous ablation, and radiation, as well as transarterial and systemic therapies. As such, clinical decision making requires a multidisciplinary team that longitudinally adapts the individual treatment strategy according to the patient's tumour stage, liver function, and performance status. With the approval of new first-line agents and second-line agents, as well as the establishment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies as standard of care, the treatment landscape of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is more diversified than ever. Consequently, the outlook for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma has improved. However, the optimal sequencing of drugs remains to be defined, and predictive biomarkers are urgently needed to inform treatment selection. In this Seminar, we present an update on the causes, diagnosis, molecular classification, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

NAFLD alcohol intake classification and monitoring — Alcohol use can be an important contributor to fatty liver disease progression and should be quantified in all patients, with intake classified as mild (up to 20 g (women) and 30 g (men) per day), moderate (21–39 g (women) and 31–59 g (men) per day), or heavy (≥ 40 g (women) and ≥ 60 g (men) per day); moderate alcohol use increases the probability of advanced fibrosis, particularly in patients with obesity or T2DM, heavy alcohol consumption accelerates liver injury and fibrosis progression and should be avoided in patients with NAFLD/NASH, and moderate alcohol use (defined broadly as > 20 g/d) has been associated with less improvement in steatosis and AST and lower odds of NASH resolution, with daily alcohol potentially increasing risks for extrahepatic malignancies and HCC and with substantial variability in individual susceptibility and uncertainty about dose thresholds, indicating that the impact of alcohol use characteristics on the natural history of NAFLD/NASH requires further investigation.

### Decreasing mortality among Danish alcoholic cirrhosis patients: a nationwide cohort study [^113vYf8a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clinical management of certain cirrhosis complications has improved over the last two decades. In this study we aimed to examine whether mortality among Danish alcoholic cirrhosis patients has decreased during this period.

Methods

In this historical cohort study we used nationwide hospital data to identify Danish alcoholic cirrhosis patients diagnosed in 1996–1998, 1999–2001, 2002–2004, 2005–2007, 2008–2010, and 2011–2013. We used Cox regression to examine time trends in mortality after cirrhosis diagnosis, adjusting for confounding by age, gender, and prevalence of variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, alcoholic hepatitis, infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, comorbidity, and in-patient status at the time of cirrhosis diagnosis.

Results

We included 22,734 patients (69% men). The adjusted mortality hazard ratio (HR) for patients diagnosed in each period compared with those diagnosed in 1996–1998 was 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92–1.06) in 1999–2001, 1.00 (95% CI: 0.94–1.08) in 2002–2004, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.90–1.04) in 2005–2007, 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88–1.01) in 2008–2010, and finally 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79–0.90) in 2011–2013.

Conclusions

In recent years, mortality among Danish alcoholic cirrhosis patients has decreased.

### Current therapeutic targets for alcohol-associated liver disease [^115zrEpN]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

ALD is a liver disorder induced by chronic excessive alcohol consumption, affecting approximately 3.5% of the global population. The spectrum of ALD encompasses simple steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and the potential development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of ALD involves a complex interplay of factors, including direct cellular damage caused by alcohol and its metabolites, hepatic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and oxidative stress. Additionally, dysbiosis and the subsequent imbalance of gut homeostasis further exacerbate the progression of ALD. While abstinence from alcohol and nutritional support remain the cornerstone of ALD management, increasing evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting various pathological processes, in particular inflammation, cellular oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and strategies to promote liver regeneration and inhibit fibrosis. Moreover, emerging treatment approaches aimed at modulating the gut-liver-brain axis and targeting innate immune cells offer promising new avenues for ALD therapy. For patients with end-stage alcoholic liver disease, liver transplantation remains the only viable option to improve prognosis. This review summarizes the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, natural history, and recent advancements in the therapeutic management of ALD, aiming to provide further insights into the treatment of ALD and improve patient outcomes.

Methodology

A guideline working group was convened. In keeping with the recommendations of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation guideline development protocol, this comprised a multidisciplinary team of national and international experts in the management of HCC, including hepatologists, surgeons, histopathologists, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, oncologists, palliative medicine specialists and clinical nurse specialists. Important topics to be considered within the guideline were defined. Each section was allocated to one or two members of the guideline working group, who were responsible for performing a comprehensive literature review. Recommendations for each section were made based on a review of the most relevant evidence, and were approved by all members of the working group, who met regularly. No formal Delphi voting process was used, but all recommendations achieved consensus after extensive review and discussion. The working group included two patient representatives who had undergone treatment for liver cancer. Both were involved in initial planning, and reviewed the final document to ensure implementation of a patient-focused document. Although both wished anonymity, their contribution is greatly appreciated.

All members of the guideline working group completed conflict of interest forms. No funding was provided to support the development of this document. The level of evidence and the strength of the data for recommendations were adapted from National Cancer Institute(box 1); the strength of the recommendations made are according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system (table 1).

### Alcohol and hepatocellular carcinoma [^116B7Kcs]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

More than 18 million adults in the United States abuse alcohol, a prevalence 5 times higher than that of hepatitis C. Chronic alcohol use of greater than 80 g/day for more than 10 years increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) approximately 5-fold; alcohol use of less than 80 g/day is associated with a nonsignificant increased risk for HCC. The risk for HCC in decompensated alcohol induced cirrhosis approaches 1% per year. The risk does not decrease with abstinence, and HCC can occur in a noncirrhotic liver. Alcohol use in chronic hepatitis C doubles the risk for HCC as compared with the risk in hepatitis C alone. Furthermore, there may be synergism between alcohol and hepatitis C in the development of HCC, and in these patients HCC may occur at an earlier age and the HCC may be histologically more advanced. Studies in the United States and Italy suggest that alcohol is the most common cause of HCC (accounting for 32%-45% of HCC). The mechanisms by which alcohol causes HCC are incompletely understood, but may include chromosomal loss, oxidative stress, a decreased retinoic acid level in the liver, altered DNA methylation, and genetic susceptibility. Alcohol use is increasing in many countries, suggesting that alcohol will continue to be a common cause of HCC throughout the world.

Patient summary

This guideline has been produced on behalf of the British Society of Gastroenterology, to update the previous guideline published in 2003. Since then, many advances in the treatment of liver cancer have been made. This guideline has been written by a team of experts in the management of liver cancer, including hepatologists, liver surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, palliative care physicians and clinical nurse specialists. Patients who have been diagnosed with, and treated for, liver cancer have read the guideline and provided their input. The guideline is intended for healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients with liver cancer.

Primary liver cancer develops from within the liver (as opposed to spread from other sites, or secondary liver cancer). Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common kind of primary liver cancer and originates from the liver cells. There are over 6000 cases of HCC per year in the UK, making it the 18th most common cause of cancer. There are nearly 6000 deaths from HCC each year in the UK, accounting for 3% of all cancer deaths. Since the 1970s, the number of people developing and dying from HCC has increased significantly. This pattern is predicted to continue.

The major risk factor for the development of HCC is chronic damage to the liver, and in particular, cirrhosis. The risk factors for the development of cirrhosis, and therefore also for the development of HCC, are well known and include excess alcohol consumption, infection with viruses such as hepatitis B and C, obesity and diabetes. Many of these causes are related to lifestyle, and implementation of national policies to limit alcohol intake and encourage healthy living could have a real impact in reducing the number of people developing cirrhosis and HCC in the future.

Despite the medical community and policy makers understanding the context in which HCC develops, and there being the potential for treatments that might cure it, survival from this cancer is not good. Only 3 in 10 patients diagnosed with HCC will survive for 1 year or more, and only one in eight will survive more than 5 years. However, if the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage four out of five will survive for more than 1 year.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common histologic type of primary liver cancer, accounting for between 85% and 90% of these malignancies. The overall prognosis of patients with liver cancer is poor, and an understanding of this disease and its risk factors is crucial for screening at-risk individuals, early recognition, and timely diagnosis. Most HCCs arise in the background of chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and chronic excessive alcohol intake. These underlying causes are characterized by marked variations in geography, gender, and other well-documented risk factors, some of which are potentially preventable.

### Improving survival in alcohol-related hepatitis: what's new? [^114GNhfw]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) is the most florid presentation of alcohol-related liver disease and carries a high short-term and long-term mortality rate. Specific treatment options remain inadequate. The current management approach for AH focuses on early identification, careful screening and treatment of infection, as well as identification of those patients who may benefit from corticosteroid therapy based on validated prognostic scoring systems. In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring novel therapies for AH, which may offer alternative treatment options beyond the traditional approaches. Additionally, early liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a promising option in selected cases with growing evidence supporting its role. In this review, we will discuss the current evidence base for the assessment and treatment of AH, and how these advances are shaping practice to improve outcomes in the UK.

### Imaging of alcohol-associated liver disease [^111uBYpW]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) continues to be a global health concern, responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide. Although most individuals who consume alcohol do not develop ALD, heavy drinkers and binge drinkers are at increased risk. Unfortunately, ALD is often undetected until it reaches advanced stages, frequently associated with portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ALD is now the leading indication for liver transplant. The incidence of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early diagnosis of ALD is therefore important in patient management and determination of prognosis, as abstinence can halt disease progression. The spectrum of ALD includes steatosis, steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis, with steatosis the most common manifestation. Diagnostic techniques including ultrasound, CT, and MRI provide useful information for identifying ALD and excluding other causes of liver dysfunction. Heterogeneous steatosis and transient perfusion changes on CT and MRI in the clinical setting of alcohol-use disorder are diagnostic of severe AH. Elastography techniques are useful for assessing fibrosis and monitoring treatment response. These various imaging modalities are also useful in HCC surveillance and diagnosis. This review discusses the imaging modalities currently used in the evaluation of ALD, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and clinical applications.

### Clinical characteristics, surveillance, treatment allocation, and outcomes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11293Dnw]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. With recent advances in the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the burden of hepatocellular carcinoma due to viral hepatitis is declining; however, the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related hepatocellular carcinoma is rising rapidly. Nearly a third of the global population has NAFLD, of whom around 20% harbour non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. – NAFLD is the fastest rising cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA and parts of Europe, and is expected to rise exponentially in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. –

However, data regarding the clinical presentation and outcomes for NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma versus hepatocellular carcinoma due to other causes are conflicted. Several studies reported more advanced disease at presentation and poorer survival among patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma compared with those with hepatocellular carcinoma due to other causes, whereas other studies have reported similar clinical presentation and improved survival. – In addition, it is unclear what proportion of patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma do not have cirrhosis or receive surveillance before a hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis. Previous studies on this topic have been specific to a country, region, or treatment. To our knowledge, a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating the clinical presentation, proportion without cirrhosis, surveillance rates, and overall outcomes between NAFLD-related and non-NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported. Therefore, through a systematic review and meta-analytic approach, we aimed to identify the clinical features, surveillance rates, treatment allocation, and survival outcomes of NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma compared with hepatocellular carcinoma due to other causes.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^112zX6r3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) burden, risk thresholds, and diagnostic principles are outlined as follows: ALD is "a leading cause of preventable liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, including the United States". Harmful drinking "(≥ 3 drinks/d or ≥ 21/wk in men and ≥ 2 drinks/d or ≥ 14/wk in women) is a risk factor for liver damage and ALD". "The diagnosis of ALD requires identification of chronic, harmful alcohol use, by patient report or detection of alcohol biomarkers, and exclusion of other diseases affecting the liver". Management emphasizes that "Treatment of AUD with achievement of sustained abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression and improve long-term outcomes at any stage of ALD", and "Liver transplantation (LT) remains a definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease due to alcohol-associated cirrhosis and/or HCC".

### Primary liver cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^111j9aks]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with early HCC who undergo liver transplant is 44% to 78%. For patients who undergo a liver resection, the OS rate is 27% to 70%. Liver transplant, surgical resection, and ablation offer high rates of complete responses and a potential for cure in patients with early HCC. Unlike most patients with solid tumors, the prognosis of patients with HCC is affected by the tumor stage at presentation and by the underlying liver function. The following prognostic factors guide the selection of treatment: Several treatments for HCC are associated with long-term survival, including surgical resection, liver transplant, and ablation. There are no large, robust, randomized studies that compare treatments considered effective for early-stage disease, nor are there studies comparing these treatments with best supportive care.

Often, patients with HCC are evaluated by a multidisciplinary team that includes hepatologists, radiologists, interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, transplant surgeons, surgical oncologists, pathologists, and medical oncologists. Best survivals are achieved when the HCC can be removed either by surgical resection or liver transplant. Surgical resection is usually performed in patients with localized HCC and enough functional hepatic reserve. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis and a solitary lesion or early multifocal disease, the best option is liver transplant. However, the limited availability of liver donors restricts the use of this approach. Transarterial chemoembolization, multikinase inhibitors, and immunotherapy are noncurative treatments for HCC that improve survival. Table 5 shows the standard treatment options for HCC. Surgical resection Surgery is the mainstay of HCC treatment.

Preoperative assessment includes three-phase helical computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both to determine the presence of an extension of a tumor across interlobar planes and potential involvement of the hepatic hilus, hepatic veins, and inferior vena cava. Tumors can be resected only if enough liver parenchyma can be spared with adequate vascular and biliary inflow and outflow. Patients with well-compensated cirrhosis can generally tolerate resection of up to 50% of their liver parenchyma.

### Recent progress in understanding, diagnosing, and treating hepatocellular carcinoma [^114VhtWU]. CA (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few cancers in which a continued increase in incidence has been observed over several years. As such, there has been a focus on safe and accurate diagnosis and the development of treatment algorithms that take into consideration the unique complexities of this patient population. In the past decade, there have been improvements in nonsurgical treatment platforms and better standardization with respect to the diagnosis and patient eligibility for liver transplant. How to navigate patients through the challenges of treatment is difficult and depends on several factors: 1) patient-related variables such as comorbid conditions that influence treatment eligibility; 2) liver-related variables such as Child-Pugh score; and 3) tumor-related variables such as size, number, pattern of spread within the liver, and vascular involvement. The objectives of this review are to put into perspective the current treatment options for patients with HCC, the unique advantages and disadvantages of each treatment approach, and the evidence that supports the introduction of sorafenib into the multidisciplinary management of HCC.

Treatment of AH — abstinence is a proven benefit. Continued alcohol use in the setting of AH results in increased rates of variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and risk of developing HCC and death. All patients with ALD should be advised to abstain completely from alcohol use, although harm reduction models, which favor alcohol reduction over total abstinence based on a patient's stated goals, may be appropriate in some contexts.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in NAFLD — NAFLD is now considered the third-most common cause of HCC in the United States, and the incidence of NAFLD-related HCC has been shown to increase at a 9% annual rate. Patients with NAFLD-related HCC are older, have a shorter survival time, more often have heart disease, and are more likely to die from their primary liver cancer than other HCC patients. Around 13% of HCC in a Veteran Administration study did not have cirrhosis, and having NAFLD was independently associated with HCC in the absence of cirrhosis.

### Alcoholic hepatitis: diagnosis and management [^117P8dVT]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute-onset jaundice and liver enzyme abnormalities in the setting of long-term heavy alcohol use. High rates of concomitant infections, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is primarily clinical, based on a consensus definition from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Initial workup should include chest radiography and cultures of peritoneal fluid, blood, and urine. Close monitoring for inflammation and organ failure is crucial throughout hospitalization. Laboratory-based prognostic scores, including Maddrey Discriminant Function and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, help determine disease severity and treatment options. Treatment for moderate disease primarily consists of supportive care, including alcohol cessation and nutritional support. Corticosteroids are recommended for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy should be evaluated using the Lille score on day 7 of treatment. Hospital physicians should involve a multidisciplinary team, including substance abuse specialists, gastroenterologists or hepatologists, nephrologists, dietitians, and intensivists, as appropriate. Long-term follow-up should focus on abstinence from alcohol, management of underlying cirrhosis, and evaluation for liver transplantation if indicated. Pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder can aid patients in maintaining abstinence from alcohol. The presence of underlying cirrhosis and continued alcohol use negatively impact long-term prognosis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in AIH

The pooled annual HCC incidence over 25 studies was 0.3% in AIH overall and 1% in patients with cirrhosis; similar to HCC incidence in cirrhosis related to NAFLD but lower than in cirrhosis related to hepatitis B and C, and to alcohol-related liver disease. Lower annual rates (0.14% overall and about 0.5% in cirrhosis) were reported recently in a (mainly European) multicentre cohort.

Annual percentage incidence rates were higher in Asia (0.5% than in North America, Australia and Europe 0.2–0.4%). In Europenearly all patients who develop HCC have cirrhosisbut in Japan, cirrhosis was present in only 58%.HCC in AIH is also associated with older age, male gender, number of relapses and alcohol excess.

The annual incidence of HCC in AIH-related cirrhosis (0.5–1%) falls below the 1.5% per year threshold advocated in AASLDand EASLguidelines as being cost effective for HCC screening. However, these are based on health economic studies predating development of effective therapies for HCC. A recent analysisincorporating potential harms as well as benefits, suggests that HCC surveillance is cost-effective if incidence exceeds 0.4%, which it does in AIH-related cirrhosis. Thus, surveillance should be considered for all cirrhotic patients with AIH.

### Management of patients after treatment of severe alcohol-associated hepatitis [^114e8sty]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease is the leading indication for hospitalization among patients with chronic liver disease. Rates of hospitalization for alcohol-associated hepatitis have been rising over the last 2 decades. Patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis carry significant morbidity and mortality, but there is a lack of standardized postdischarge management strategies to care for this challenging group of patients. Patients warrant management of not only their liver disease but also their alcohol use disorder. In this review, we will discuss outpatient management strategies for patients who were recently hospitalized and discharged for alcohol-associated hepatitis. We will discuss short management of their liver disease, long-term follow-up, and review-available treatment options for alcohol use disorder and challenges associated with pursuing treatment for alcohol use disorder.

Patient summary

The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma can be made on different imaging exams acquired with the intravenous administration of contrast agents, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or sometimes contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). In patients with liver cirrhosis or other high risk factors, hepatic lesions with typical imaging characteristics can be diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma without the need of other exams. Hepatic lesions with atypical imaging characteristics may require additional imaging exams, follow-up over time, or histopathological analysis with biopsy of the lesion. The management of hepatocellular carcinoma is often discussed at multidisciplinary meetings to choose the most appropriate treatment.

### Management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a review and practical guide [^116FN6UR]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Global incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising along with its mortality burden, and more than half of the patients require systemic therapy for advanced disease. There is an ongoing epidemiologic shift in risk factors for HCC from hepatotropic virus-related liver disease to alcohol and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Although a diagnosis of HCC can be made with noninvasive radiologic criteria, tissue biopsy is gaining a role, at least within the realm of clinical trials. Despite advances in targeted therapies, the role of molecular testing in HCC remains unclear. Liver function continues to play a vital role in the management of HCC across all stages. With the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting tumor angiogenesis, the treatment landscape of advanced HCC has evolved considerably in the past decade, leading to improvements in patient outcomes. However, optimal sequencing of these agents is not well defined. There are several ongoing trials evaluating systemic therapies with novel mechanisms of action including adoptive cell therapy. This review aims to provide practicing oncologists with a comprehensive overview of recent developments in systemic therapy for the management of advanced HCC.

Summary

HCC is an important global cause of cancer-related death. In the majority of patients, there are well-characterised and potentially reversible risk factors for its development. If patients are diagnosed at an early stage, treatment options associated with substantial benefit are available. It is particularly frustrating therefore that the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, including in the UK where a significant proportion are diagnosed via the emergency medicine pathway. Regrettably, this reflects a neglect of liver disease and cancer surveillance at a national level. It is pleasing to see this is being addressed in various fora, including the Lancet Commission and the work of charities such as the British Liver Trust.

The major recent therapeutic advances relate to the systemic therapies. The treatment landscape has completely changed for those with advanced-stage disease.

The final message has to be that HCC remains a scourge and a tragedy. A scourge in that survival remains poor, despite the availability of radical treatment options. A tragedy in that the disease is preventable in the majority, at least in principle. It is hoped that national policies will reflect the unacceptability of the current situation.

### Cirrhosis: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^112Awd3N]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. It accounted for 29,165 deaths in 2007, with a mortality rate of 9.7 per 100,000 persons. Alcohol abuse and viral hepatitis are the most common causes of cirrhosis, although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is emerging as an increasingly important cause. Primary care physicians share responsibility with specialists in managing the most common complications of the disease, screening for hepatocellular carcinoma, and preparing patients for referral to a transplant center. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma with imaging studies every six to 12 months. Causes of hepatic encephalopathy include constipation, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, and noncompliance with medical therapy. These should be sought and managed before instituting the use of lactulose or rifaximin, which is aimed at reducing serum ammonia levels. Ascites should be treated initially with salt restriction and diuresis. Patients with acute episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding should be monitored in an intensive care unit, and should have endoscopy performed within 24 hours. Physicians should also be vigilant for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Treating alcohol abuse, screening for viral hepatitis, and controlling risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are mechanisms by which the primary care physician can reduce the incidence of cirrhosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^111YKHvC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Alcoholic liver disease — clinical spectrum, diagnosis, severity, and management highlights are as follows: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications, and most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with limited data on early disease. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. Alcoholic hepatitis presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and, in severe cases, may transition to acute on chronic liver failure with risk for mortality that may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH, and long-term mortality is related to the severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures for hospitalized ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis and may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

### Differences between hepatocellular carcinoma caused by alcohol and other aetiologies [^114PLB22]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease is the third leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide and the leading cause in Europe. Additionally, the recent definition of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease with increased alcohol intake (MetALD) will enrich this population with a more nuanced phenotype, reflecting recent epidemiological trends. In these patients, the hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis is often delayed and less frequently detected through screening programmes. Moreover, at the time of diagnosis, patients with alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma tend to have a poorer general condition, more severely impaired liver function, and a higher prevalence of comorbidities, leading to increased competitive mortality. However, when hepatocellular carcinoma is diagnosed during surveillance programmes in patients with alcohol-related liver disease or MetALD, the rate of allocation to first-line curative treatments is high (56%) and comparable to that of patients with virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma. As a consequence, the aetiology of the underlying cirrhosis cannot be considered an independent prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Instead, prognosis is driven by liver function, general condition, and tumour burden. This underscores the crucial role of early diagnosis through periodic surveillance in patients with alcohol- or MetALD-related cirrhosis.
