## Question

What's the maximum amount of oral ativan someone can get with AUD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum amount of oral lorazepam (Ativan) that can be given to someone with alcohol use disorder, specifically in the context of alcohol withdrawal, and how to approach this safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are treating acute alcohol withdrawal versus prescribing for anxiety or insomnia. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about lorazepam dosing and whether there is a labeled maximum. Next, I will review guideline-based strategies for alcohol withdrawal and how they handle high-dose needs. After that, I need to check for any numeric "caps" in the literature and what to do in benzodiazepine-resistant withdrawal. Finally, I should consider patient-specific modifiers like liver disease, age, and concurrent opioids, and synthesize a practical, safety-focused answer with monitoring and tapering plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the "maximum" depends on why lorazepam is being used. If the question is about treating acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), guidelines endorse benzodiazepines as first-line and allow dose escalation to achieve symptom control, including very large doses in severe cases, whereas if the question is about routine anxiolytic or hypnotic use in AUD outside of withdrawal, guidelines advise against benzodiazepines altogether except for the acute withdrawal episode itself [^115itypM] [^115QrLxg] [^116kRmwk].

> I need to check the FDA labeling next. The Ativan prescribing information indicates a usual adult range of 2–6 mg/day in divided doses, with a labeled range extending from 1–10 mg/day, and it emphasizes individualized dosing and gradual tapering to mitigate withdrawal and adverse effects; importantly, it does not specify a hard maximum dose, which means higher amounts may be used off-label when clinically justified and monitored, particularly in AWS [^1114bAmp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guideline-based AWS care is not about a fixed ceiling but about achieving symptom control safely. ASAM recommends symptom-triggered dosing as preferred when monitoring is available, with fixed-dose tapers or front-loading for severe withdrawal or when monitoring is limited. Doses should be titrated to effect, and clinicians should not hesitate to use large cumulative amounts if needed while watching for over-sedation and respiratory depression, then transition to oral symptom-triggered therapy once the patient is calm and cooperative [^115itypM] [^111k7bX3] [^111tkSHR].

> Wait, let me verify whether any numeric thresholds are described for "very large doses". The ASAM guidance explicitly notes that very large doses may be required to control agitation in AWS and that clinicians should monitor closely for accumulation and respiratory depression; it also describes benzodiazepine-resistant AWS using thresholds such as approximately 40–50 mg diazepam-equivalents within an hour without control, which translates to roughly 8–10 mg lorazepam in that timeframe, underscoring that cumulative totals in the tens of milligrams over 24–72 hours can be appropriate in severe cases with appropriate monitoring [^115itypM] [^114fBzBu] [^111HaPj4].

> I should double-check practical ranges seen in studies and trials. In outpatient AWS, randomized data have used lorazepam in the 6–8 mg/day range on day 1 with taper, and comparative trials have tested up to about 10 mg/day; meta-analyses of symptom-triggered therapy show lower total benzodiazepine exposure on average, but individual patients still require substantially higher amounts when symptoms are severe, reinforcing that patient-level titration — not a universal cap — is the key principle [^115e1ZcT] [^112qX568] [^114LN4Y6].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that change the ceiling and the agent choice. In significant hepatic impairment or alcoholic liver disease, lorazepam is preferred over diazepam or chlordiazepoxide because it is metabolized by glucuronidation without active metabolites, though accumulation and over-sedation still require vigilance. In older adults, start low and go slow due to sensitivity. And in patients on opioids or with high misuse risk, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring given the risk of profound respiratory depression and overdose [^117XXqgt] [^112DgUTi] [^111AmNeM].

> But wait, what if symptoms remain uncontrolled despite escalating doses? I need to ensure we recognize benzodiazepine-resistant AWS and pivot appropriately: reassess the level of care, consider switching agents or adding adjuncts such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproate, and in ICU settings consider dexmedetomidine or propofol as adjuncts. These strategies can reduce benzodiazepine exposure while maintaining control, and they reflect best practice when lorazepam requirements climb into high cumulative ranges without clinical response [^1129qpRX] [^114hFGn5] [^116feKrF].

> I should confirm duration and discontinuation planning, because the "maximum" is not just a dose but also time. Benzodiazepines for AWS should be used short term — typically days, not weeks — and discontinued promptly after stabilization; front-loading can shorten the overall course, and any extended use warrants a gradual taper to mitigate withdrawal and dependence risks, with patient education on hazards of concomitant CNS depressants and instructions to reduce dose if excessive sedation occurs [^115kynVT] [^112U2uE4] [^1114bAmp].

> Putting this together, I need to be precise: there is no fixed maximum oral lorazepam dose for AWS in patients with AUD. Dosing is titrated to clinical effect using symptom-triggered or front-loading strategies, with cumulative totals commonly ranging from standard outpatient amounts up to 10–20 mg/day or more in severe inpatient cases, and occasionally far higher in ICU-managed benzodiazepine-resistant withdrawal, provided there is continuous monitoring for over-sedation, respiratory depression, and accumulation, especially in liver disease or the elderly, and with a plan to taper and discontinue promptly once stabilized [^115itypM] [^112qX568] [^116feKrF] [^114fBzBu] [^117XXqgt].

---

There is **no fixed maximum dose** of oral lorazepam (Ativan) for alcohol withdrawal in patients with AUD; dosing is individualized and symptom-triggered, with typical total daily doses of 2–10 mg [^115e1ZcT] [^112qX568] in divided doses and higher amounts used in severe cases with close monitoring [^115itypM]. For severe withdrawal or delirium tremens, cumulative doses of 20–40 mg/day or more may be required, but clinicians should monitor for oversedation, respiratory depression, and benzodiazepine accumulation, especially in patients with hepatic impairment or the elderly [^115itypM] [^114wBHaV]. Benzodiazepines should be tapered and discontinued promptly after stabilization, and alternatives (e.g. carbamazepine, gabapentin) considered for high-risk patients or those with benzodiazepine use disorder [^112U2uE4] [^111Sonyn].

---

## Recommended dosing strategies

Lorazepam dosing for AWS is guided by symptom severity, patient characteristics, and clinical setting. The **three primary strategies** are:

- **Symptom-triggered dosing**: Preferred approach, dosing based on CIWA-Ar scores [^111k7bX3]; reduces total benzodiazepine exposure and duration of treatment [^114LN4Y6].
- **Fixed-dose regimen**: Scheduled dosing with gradual taper; useful when symptom-triggered dosing is impractical [^111k7bX3].
- **Front-loading**: Rapid control of severe withdrawal with higher initial doses, followed by tapering [^115kynVT].

---

## Typical dosing ranges

| **Clinical scenario** | **Typical lorazepam dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild withdrawal | 1–2 mg PO every 6–8 hours | Adjust based on symptom control |
| Moderate withdrawal | 2–4 mg PO every 6–8 hours | Higher doses may be required |
| Severe withdrawal or delirium tremens | 2–4 mg PO/IV every 1–2 hours until light somnolence achieved | Cumulative doses of 20–40 mg/day or more may be required [^notfound] |
| Elderly or hepatic impairment | 1–2 mg PO in divided doses | Lower initial doses with careful titration [^114wBHaV] |

---

## Maximum dose considerations

There is **no fixed maximum dose** of oral lorazepam for AWS; dosing is individualized to symptom control and safety. Clinicians should titrate to effect, balancing efficacy with risks of oversedation, respiratory depression, and benzodiazepine accumulation [^115itypM]. In severe cases, cumulative doses of 20–40 mg/day or more may be necessary, but close monitoring is essential [^notfound].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Lorazepam, like other benzodiazepines, carries risks — particularly in patients with AUD, including:

- **Respiratory depression**: Especially when combined with other CNS depressants (e.g. opioids, alcohol) [^111AmNeM].
- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: Increased risk of falls, accidents, and delirium [^111ccKRN].
- **Dependence and withdrawal**: High risk of physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation [^113o8XRz].
- **Hepatic considerations**: Lorazepam is metabolized hepatically; impaired liver function increases risk of accumulation and toxicity [^114wBHaV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing**, close monitoring, and tapering strategies:

- **ASAM guidelines**: Recommend symptom-triggered dosing, close monitoring for oversedation, and tapering after stabilization [^115itypM].
- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Emphasize benzodiazepines for moderate-severe withdrawal with adequate monitoring [^111VSZDt].
- **ACG guidelines**: Caution use in patients with alcoholic liver disease due to risk of hepatic encephalopathy [^115fpmrY].

---

## Alternative medications and adjunctive therapies

In patients with high risk of benzodiazepine misuse or those requiring benzodiazepine-sparing strategies, **alternatives include**:

- **Carbamazepine**: Effective in reducing benzodiazepine requirements and withdrawal symptoms [^115e1ZcT].
- **Gabapentin**: Useful adjunct, particularly in outpatient settings [^111Sonyn].
- **Phenobarbital**: Alternative agent, particularly in benzodiazepine-resistant cases [^116unbpE].
- **Dexmedetomidine**: Adjunctive therapy in ICU settings to reduce benzodiazepine requirements [^116feKrF].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing

Several **patient-specific factors** influence lorazepam dosing:

- **Severity of withdrawal**: Higher doses required for severe withdrawal or delirium tremens [^115itypM].
- **Age and hepatic function**: Lower initial doses recommended in elderly or hepatically impaired patients [^114wBHaV].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular, respiratory, or psychiatric comorbidities may necessitate dose adjustments [^114nLb1S].
- **History of benzodiazepine use**: Patients with prior benzodiazepine exposure may require higher doses due to tolerance [^111GFJKH].

---

## Monitoring and safety precautions

Continuous monitoring is essential during **lorazepam** administration for **AWS**. Clinicians should regularly assess sedation, **respiratory status**, and withdrawal severity, and adjust dosing based on clinical response and adverse effects [^115itypM]. Patients and caregivers should be educated about risks, interactions, and the importance of adherence to the tapering plan [^112U2uE4].

---

## Tapering and discontinuation strategies

Benzodiazepines should be **tapered gradually** to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Typical tapers reduce the total daily dose by 25–50% every 1–2 days, with adjustments based on patient response [^1129nofU]. Tapering should be individualized, considering withdrawal severity, patient preference, and clinical judgment [^114tJUcC].

---

There is **no fixed maximum dose** of oral lorazepam for AWS in patients with AUD; dosing is individualized based on symptom severity, patient characteristics, and clinical judgment. Clinicians should balance efficacy with safety, monitor closely for adverse effects, and taper benzodiazepines promptly after stabilization. Alternative medications and adjunctive therapies should be considered for high-risk patients or those with benzodiazepine use disorder.

3) Prioritize three clinical questions for immediate study

Three clinical questions should be top priorities for clinical research focused on SAWS. First, what is the optimal first-line medication for SAWS (e.g. benzodiazepines vs. nonbenzodiazepines)? Second, what is the ideal medication dosing strategy for SAWS (e.g. symptom-triggered vs. front-loading)? The answers to these first two questions would have an immediate impact on patient care and clinical practice. Third, is protocolized and/or bundled care superior to usual care for SAWS? Testing the impact of a standardized best practice "bundle", including items such as electrolyte replacement, intravenous thiamine, addiction counseling, and medications to treat AUD, could be specifically explored. Implementation research including protocolized and/or bundled care should be conducted simultaneously with medication trials by using the broader infrastructure of the proposed clinical trial network to expedite the transfer of knowledge into practice.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115x2gNR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, some will experience significant withdrawal symptoms. Similarly, some patients who have been taking BZDs at a low dose for an intermediate amount of time (e.g. 6 weeks) may not be physically dependent. Defining strict thresholds for the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal is difficult because many factors beyond the dose and duration of BZD use impact risk, including age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, the pharmacological properties of the given BZD, other medication and substance use, and prior history of withdrawal, among others.

Table 3 summarizes the risk of withdrawal by dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. While no direct evidence was found for predicting risk of withdrawal, the CGC agreed that these factors were most salient in the determination. Clinicians should consider this information in the context of each patient's presentation when determining if patients are likely to be physically dependent and tapering is indicated. It should be noted that alprazolam — which is unique in having a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites — tends to be associated with a more rapid onset of physical dependence. Therefore, a taper may be appropriate for patients taking this medication daily, even for a short duration (e.g. 2–4 weeks).

If physical dependence is difficult to determine, clinicians should elicit information from patients regarding any concerns about discontinuation or preferences for tapering. Clinicians should gather information about each patient's likelihood for physical dependence and risk of withdrawal, including asking if they have experienced withdrawal symptoms following missed doses in the past. Clinicians should also ask patients about any past experiences with withdrawal symptoms associated with tapering or discontinuing BZDs, especially adverse events such as seizures. Determining use of alcohol is also important, particularly if patients engage in ongoing daily alcohol use or have experienced severe withdrawal from alcohol or other substances in the past; slower and/or alternate tapering strategies may be indicated in these situations. If SUD may be present, clinicians should consider consulting addiction specialists, when possible.

If physical dependence is unlikely and the decision is made to discontinue the BZD without a taper, clinicians should educate patients about potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms that may occur and encourage patients to report these symptoms. If patients report significant symptoms, clinicians can consider initiating a taper.

### Is phenobarbital an effective treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome? [^116unbpE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder is associated with a variety of complications, including alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), which may occur in those who decrease or stop alcohol consumption suddenly. AWS is associated with a range of signs and symptoms, which are most commonly treated with GABAergic medications.

Clinical Question

Is phenobarbital an effective treatment for AWS?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and three systematic reviews. These studies provided estimates of the effectiveness and safety of phenobarbital for treatment of AWS.

Conclusions

Based on the available literature, phenobarbital is reasonable to consider for treatment of AWS. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for treatment of AWS.

### Symptom-triggered therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114LN4Y6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines are the standard medication class for treating alcohol withdrawal. Guidelines recommend dosing based on objectively measured symptoms (symptom-triggered therapy) rather than fixed dose regimens. However, the superiority of symptom-triggered therapy has been questioned, and concerns have been raised about its inappropriate use and safety. We aimed to assess whether symptom-triggered therapy is superior to fixed dose schedules in terms of mortality, delirium, seizures, total benzodiazepine dose, and duration of therapy.

Methods

A systematic literature search using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Registry through February 2018 was conducted for randomized controlled trials of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome comparing fixed dose benzodiazepine schedules to symptom-triggered therapy. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Outcomes were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I 2 statistic. Strength of evidence was assessed using methods outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Results

Six studies involving 664 patients were included. There were no deaths and only one seizure in each group. Four studies reported delirium, which occurred in 4 out of 164 patients randomized to symptom-triggered therapy compared to 6 out of 164 randomized to fixed dose therapy (odds ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.17–2.47]). Three studies reported duration of therapy, which was 60.4 h less with symptom-triggered therapy (95% CI, 39.7–81.1 h; p < 0.001). Six studies reported total benzodiazepine dosage, which was 10.5 mg in lorazepam-equivalent dosing less with symptom-triggered therapy (95% CI, 7.1–13.9 mg; p = 0.011).

Discussion

Moderate strength evidence suggests that symptom-triggered therapy improved duration of therapy and total benzodiazepine dose in specialized detoxification settings of low-risk patients but the applicability of this evidence in general hospital settings is low. There was insufficient evidence for any conclusions about symptom-triggered therapy for the major outcomes of mortality, seizure, and delirium in any setting.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^113o8XRz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing LOREEV XR and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of LOREEV XR, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of LOREEV XR along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of LOREEV XR after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome

In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

### Pregabalin, tiapride and lorazepam in alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a multi-centre, randomized, single-blind comparison trial [^112qX568]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this trial was to compare lorazepam with non-benzodiazepine medications such as pregabalin and tiapride in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). These drugs were chosen for their inhibitorial effects on the hypersecretion of neurotransmitters usually observed in AWS. Craving reduction and improvement of psychiatric symptoms were the secondary end-points.

Methods

One hundred and ninety subjects affected by current alcohol dependence were considered consecutively: 111 were enrolled and divided into three groups of 37 subjects each. Within a treatment duration of 14 days, medication was given up to the following maximum doses (pregabalin 450 mg/day; tiapride 800 mg/day; lorazepam 10 mg/day). Withdrawal (CIWA-Ar), craving [visual analogue scale (VAS); Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS)], psychiatric symptoms [Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)] and quality of life (QL-index) rating scales were applied.

Results

On the CIWA-Ar score, all the groups showed a significant reduction between times (P < 0.001) with a higher reduction for the pregabalin group (P < 0.01) on items regarding headache and orientation. Retention in treatment was lower in the tiapride group (P < 0.05), while the number of subjects remaining alcohol free was higher in the pregabalin group (P < 0.05). Significant reduction between baseline and the end of the treatment was found in all the groups at the OCDS and the VAS for craving, at the SCL-90-R and QL-index (P < 0.001).

Discussion

All the medications in the trial showed evidence of safety and efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated forms of AWS, with some particular differences. The efficacy of pregabalin was superior to that of tiapride, used largely in research trials and, for some measures, to that of the 'gold standard', lorazepam. Accordingly, pregabalin may be considered as a potentially useful new drug for treatment of AWS, deserving further investigation.

### Alcohol-related seizures [^112cCApm]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The term alcohol-related seizures (ARS) is used to refer to all seizures in the aggregate associated with alcohol use, including the subset of alcohol withdrawal seizures (AWS). From 20% to 40% of patients with seizure who present to an emergency department have seizures related to alcohol abuse. However, it is critical to avoid prematurely labeling a seizure as being caused by alcohol withdrawal before performing a careful diagnostic evaluation. Benzodiazepines alone are sufficient to prevent AWS. The alcoholic patient with a documented history of ARS, who experiences a single seizure or a short burst of seizures should be treated with lorazepam, 2 mg intravenously.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing LOREEV XR and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of LOREEV XR after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112Wp76S]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression; similarly, patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concurrent alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111ccKRN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

BZDs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage a wide range of conditions, including acute conditions (e.g. panic and acute anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, seizures) and common chronic conditions (e.g. anxiety disorders, primary insomnia). These medications are commonly prescribed and represent important therapeutic tools; however, data on long-term safety and efficacy are limited. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of adverse events including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with CNS depressants such as alcohol or opioids. –

Since 2000, fatal overdoses involving BZDs have increased nearly tenfold, often involving the combination of opioids and BZDs. Although prescribing rates for BZDs have fallen since the most recent peak in 2013, in the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 9.1% of US adults reported use of BZDs in the past year, with more than 15% of those reporting BZD misuse. Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults filling BZD prescriptions increased from 4.1 to 5.6%, while the total quantity of BZD prescriptions filled more than tripled, from 1.1 to 3.6 kg lorazepam equivalents per 100,000 adults. Over this time, emergency department (ED) visits related to BZDs also tripled, and BZD-related overdose deaths quadrupled. Since 2013, however, BZD prescriptions dispensed from outpatient and mail-order pharmacies have fallen by approximately 33%.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^114tJUcC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Guideline further highlights the importance of managing expectations of both clinicians and patients. The process of tapering long-term benzodiazepine therapy is often slow and non-linear. Although some patients may have no trouble with a relatively fast taper (e.g. 25% daily dose reduction every 2–4 weeks), others may experience significant challenges even with a much slower taper (e.g. 5% daily dose reduction every 4–6 weeks); patient tolerance of the pace of the taper can also change during the process (e.g. with minimal symptoms at the beginning of the taper (i.e. at higher dose), and substantial challenges at the end of the process, at the "tail-end" of tapering). For some patients, especially those who have been taking benzodiazepines for a long time, the tapering process may last for more than a year. They may need to pause at certain points along the way to adjust to the reduced dose. Sometimes, when withdrawal or other symptoms are intolerable, the patient may need to be maintained on a lower, safer dose of benzodiazepines (or, sometimes, even on the original dose) for an extended period or indefinitely.

A panel of patients with lived experience with tapering benzodiazepine medications were engaged throughout the Guideline development process, providing input on the key clinical questions and outcomes of interest for the systematic review, as well as on the Guideline recommendations and narrative discussion. They emphasized the importance of clinician awareness of heterogeneity in patient response to benzodiazepine tapering, and education on how to manage challenges that may arise. In particular, the patient-advisors expressed the hope that clinicians:
Have awareness of the broad range of potential symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal and the risk for protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can last for months or years after the medication has been discontinued;,
Know how to support patients who require very slow tapers, for example, by using "microdosing" (or "microtapering") strategies with liquid benzodiazepine formulations when needed;
Understand, and help patients understand, the importance of giving time for the brain's GABA receptors to return to homeostasis (e.g. avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives, including other benzodiazepine medications and z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon)).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose range study of dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapy for alcohol withdrawal [^116feKrF]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapy to lorazepam for severe alcohol withdrawal.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Single center; medical ICU.

Patients

Twenty-four adult patients with a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment score greater than or equal to 15 despite greater than or equal to 16 mg of lorazepam over a 4-hour period.

Interventions

Patients received a symptom-triggered Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment protocol with lorazepam and were randomized to dexmedetomidine 1.2 μg/kg/hr (high dose), 0.4 μg/kg/hr (low dose), or placebo as adjunctive therapy for up to 5 days or resolution of withdrawal symptoms.

Measurement and Main Results

High-dose and low-dose groups were combined as a single dexmedetomidine group for primary analysis with secondary analysis exploring a dose-response relationship. The difference in 24-hour lorazepam requirements after versus before study drug was greater in the dexmedetomidine group compared with the placebo group (-56 mg vs -8 mg, p = 0.037). Median differences were similar for high dose and low dose. The 7-day cumulative lorazepam requirements were not statistically different between dexmedetomidine and placebo (159 mg vs 181 mg). Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment or Riker sedation-agitation scale scores representing severe agitation (13% vs 25%) or moderate agitation (27% vs 22%) within 24 hours of initiating study drug were similar for dexmedetomidine and placebo groups, respectively. Bradycardia occurred more frequently in the dexmedetomidine group versus placebo group (25% vs 0%, p = not significant), with the majority of bradycardia occurring in the high-dose group (37.5%). Study drug rate adjustments occurred more often in the dexmedetomidine group compared with the placebo group (50% vs 0%, p = 0.02). Neither endotracheal intubation nor seizure occurred in any group while on study drug.

Conclusions

Adjunctive dexmedetomidine for severe alcohol withdrawal maintains symptom control and reduces lorazepam exposure in the short term, but not long term, when using a symptom-triggered protocol. Monitoring for bradycardia is needed with dexmedetomidine but the occurrence may be lessened with low dose. Further study is needed to evaluate the clinical impact of dexmedetomidine.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114x9Mxg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not prescribe benzodiazepines in outpatient settings for patients with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use, as rapid intervention is not typically available. Use benzodiazepines with caution in patients with a high risk of benzodiazepine diversion, including patients with a current or past benzodiazepine use disorder for the short period of acute alcohol withdrawal. Consider managing the risk by dispensing or prescribing a small number of doses.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116LsUBt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Level of Care Considerations

Recommendation for Level of Care Considerations

5. Although BZD tapering can typically be managed in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient care for BZD tapering when:
Patient presentation indicates an imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use of the BZD medication (e.g. medication interaction, overdose, accidents, falls, suicidality or other self-harm) that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)
Patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions are anticipated to complicate BZD tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)
The patient is experiencing or imminently anticipated to experience severe or complicated BZD withdrawal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

Implementation Considerations
Clinicians should use the risk–benefit assessment to inform decisions regarding level of care.
Most patients who have developed physical dependence to BZDs can complete tapering in outpatient settings. Clinicians should consider inpatient tapering when imminent risks to patient safety cannot be mitigated rapidly with outpatient treatment.
Clinicians should consider prior history of severe or complicated BZD or alcohol withdrawal when determining patients' current withdrawal risk.
If the clinician cannot obtain authorization for inpatient care, they should consider whether attempting an outpatient taper or continuing the medication poses a greater risk.

Rationale

BZD tapering can typically be accomplished in outpatient settings. Although no direct evidence was found regarding level of care decisions for BZD tapering, the CGC agreed that most patients can undergo tapering in outpatient settings. In our systematic review, 42 of the 57 studies included were conducted in outpatient settings. This section of the Guideline details situations where additional support may be required to accomplish BZD tapering. The level of care options for many patients may be limited to outpatient or inpatient settings or, in rare instances, skilled nursing facilities.

Patients with suspected or confirmed SUD or other psychiatric disorders may require additional support, especially if they have had previous unsuccessful attempts to taper from BZDs. These patients may be eligible for a broader range of services, including intensive outpatient treatment, partial hospitalization programs, and residential care within the specialty addiction and mental health treatment systems. Specific considerations for these patients are discussed in " Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders " and " Patients with Co-occurring Psychiatric Disorders".

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (5.1, 7)
The use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Before prescribing LOREEV XR and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (5.2)
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of LOREEV XR after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage (2.4, 5.3)

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113aKWh7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

In 2020, the FDA updated the required Boxed Warning for BZD medications to describe the risks of physical dependence, withdrawal, and BZD use disorder. The associated Drug Safety Communication encouraged prescribers to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of BZD medication, limit the dose and duration to what is needed to achieve the clinical goal, and monitor patients for BZD misuse and BZD use disorder. When prescribing BZDs, clinicians should have a thoughtful strategy for medication management that regularly reassesses the risks and benefits of continued prescribing, as well as a patient-centered plan for tapering the medication when the benefits no longer outweigh the risks (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Outpatient taper management

The risks of BZD use evolve as a patient continues to take the medication. Although most patients taking BZDs as prescribed will not develop BZD use disorder, the risk of physical dependence and BZD use disorder increases with time, particularly in patients who use alcohol or other substances. Long-term BZD use is often associated with more risks than benefits. Significant risks include oversedation and other sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fatal and nonfatal overdose. Despite these known risks, clinicians often encounter patients who have been taking prescribed BZD for years.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113Juwth]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines differ in terms of onset and duration of action, dosing, metabolism, and available formulations, all of which should be considered when selecting a benzodiazepine for the treatment of SAWS in a given patient. Diazepam is a commonly used and studied benzodiazepine for treating alcohol withdrawal, having both enteral and intravenous formulations and a rapid onset of action. However, some patients with AUD have underlying liver dysfunction. Diazepam oxidation and metabolism of active metabolites occurs via the liver, and thus liver dysfunction may prolong drug effects. An alternative medication is lorazepam, which is also well studied, metabolized via hepatic glucuronidation (less commonly impaired), and does not have active metabolites. Chlordiazepoxide, a long-acting benzodiazepine commonly used and studied in specialized addiction settings, allows patients to "self-taper" during the course of treatment, but its use is limited in hospital settings by the lack of an intravenous formulation.

Benzodiazepine Resistance

Despite receiving escalating doses of benzodiazepines, some patients with SAWS do not experience adequate symptom control. Mechanisms of cross-tolerance with alcohol at the GABA A receptor (see ONSin S1) have been implicated to explain this observation. The suboptimal response is often termed "benzodiazepine resistance". In this context, administration of alternative medications as a first-line or adjunctive therapy may achieve faster symptom control than further escalation of benzodiazepine dosing. Although there is no consistent definition of benzodiazepine-resistant SAWS, data suggest a high cumulative dose of a benzodiazepine administered over a short period of time (e.g. 40 mg diazepam-equivalents within 1 h) without resolution of SAWS symptoms characterizes benzodiazepine-resistant physiology. Treatment choices for patients with SAWS that is refractory to benzodiazepines vary widely. Evaluation of benzodiazepine-alternative medications for benzodiazepine-resistant SAWS will be critical to establish whether morbidity associated with standard management approaches (e.g. intubation, prolonged ICU care) can be improved. Specific alternative therapies are detailed in Table 1, including the advantages and disadvantages of each medication and studied doses. Of note, antipsychotics are not included in Table 1, as they have been shown to precipitate or exacerbate seizures and are not considered an alternative therapy.

### Impact of a divided phenobarbital load and taper compared with lorazepam symptom triggered therapy in hospitalized patients [^1147Gxe9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines are the preferred treatment for alcohol withdrawal. Phenobarbital is an alternative in the setting of prescriber expertise or benzodiazepine contraindication.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a phenobarbital dosing strategy aimed at treating a spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms across various patient populations.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients admitted with concerns of alcohol withdrawal between May 2018 and November 2022. Patients were separated into a before-after cohort of lorazepam or phenobarbital. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, escalation of respiratory support, increased level of care (LOC), and incidence of delirium tremens and/or seizures.

Results

Two hundred and seventy-seven patients received lorazepam and 198 received phenobarbital. Hospital LOS was longer in the phenobarbital cohort compared with the lorazepam cohort (6.9 vs 9.3 days). There was no difference in ICU LOS. Level of care increases were fewer in the phenobarbital cohort (4 events vs 19 events). There were higher rates of non-invasive respiratory interventions in the lorazepam cohort and higher rates of mechanical ventilation in the phenobarbital cohort. Utilization of phenobarbital was attributed to a reduction in delirium tremens and seizures.

Conclusion and Relevance

This study is novel because of the broad application of a phenobarbital order set across multiple levels of care and patient admission diagnoses. A risk targeted split load intravenous phenobarbital order set can safely be administered to patients with fewer escalations of care, seizures, delirium tremens, and respiratory care escalation.

### The effects of carbamazepine and lorazepam on single versus multiple previous alcohol withdrawals in an outpatient randomized trial [^115e1ZcT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal in outpatient settings, but they can interact with alcohol, cause motor incoordination, or be abused. This study compared the therapeutic responses of the benzodiazepine lorazepam and the anticonvulsant carbamazepine for the outpatient treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal in terms of patients' previous detoxification histories, and compared the effects of these 2 medications on drinking behaviors in the immediate postdetoxification period.

Design

This was a randomized double-blind trial comparing patient responses to carbamazepine and lorazepam across 2 levels of detoxification histories (0–1 or ≥ 2 previous medicated detoxifications).

Setting

A university medical center substance abuse clinic in Charleston, SC.

Patients

One hundred thirty-six patients in moderate alcohol withdrawal were randomized. Major exclusions were significant hepatic or hematologic abnormalities and use of medications that could alter withdrawal symptoms.

Interventions

Patients received 600–800 mg of carbamazepine or 6–8 mg of lorazepam in divided doses on day 1 tapering to 200 mg of carbamazepine or 2 mg of lorazepam.

Main Outcome Measures

The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised was used to assess alcohol withdrawal symptoms on days 1 through 5 and postmedication at days 7 and 12. Daily drinking was measured by patient report using a daily drinking log and a breath alcohol level with each visit. Side effects were recorded daily.

Results

Carbamazepine and lorazepam were equally effective at decreasing the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. In the post-treatment period, 89 patients drank on at least 1 day; on average, carbamazepine patients drank less than 1 drink per drinking day and lorazepam patients drank almost 3 drinks per drinking day (P = .003). Among those with multiple past detoxifications, the carbamazepine group drank less than 1 drink per day on average and the lorazepam group drank about 5 drinks per day on average (P = .033). Lorazepam-treated patients had a significant rebound of alcohol withdrawal symptoms post-treatment (P = .007) and the risk of having a first drink was 3 times greater (P = .04) than for carbamazepine-treated patients. Twenty percent of lorazepam-treated patients had dizziness, motor incoordination, or ataxia and did not recognize their impairment. Twenty percent of carbamazepine-treated patients reported pruritus but no rash.

Conclusions

Carbamazepine and lorazepam were both effective in decreasing the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal in relatively healthy, middle-aged outpatients. Carbamazepine, however, was superior to lorazepam in preventing rebound withdrawal symptoms and reducing post-treatment drinking, especially for those with a history of multiple treated withdrawals.

### The use of oral phenobarbital loading for the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in an outpatient setting: a case report [^1155CHBZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is most frequently treated with benzodiazepines, but due to their short half-life, tapering prescriptions are frequently required for outpatients, which presents challenges to both clinicians and patients. Our local health system has had significant success treating alcohol withdrawal in the emergency department with phenobarbital loading doses. As patients also present in alcohol withdrawal to our outpatient addictions clinic, we have adapted our emergency department intravenous protocol to a staggered, oral loading protocol for the treatment of mild and moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the community setting. In this case report, we successfully treat a 36-year-old man with mild alcohol withdrawal symptoms using this approach and without requiring a tapering sedative prescription.

### Lorazepam [^114xNL3q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, both used alone and in combination with other CNS depressants may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression. (See PRECAUTIONS Clinically Significant Drug Interactions)

Use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to physical and psychological dependence.

As with all patients on CNS-depressant drugs, patients receiving lorazepam should be warned not to operate dangerous machinery or motor vehicles and that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants will be diminished.

Physical and Psychological Dependence

The use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to physical and psychological dependence. The risk of dependence increases with higher doses and longer term use and is further increased in patients with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse or in patients with significant personality disorders. The dependence potential is reduced when lorazepam is used at the appropriate dose for short-term treatment. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving lorazepam or other psychotropic agents.

In general, benzodiazepines should be prescribed for short periods only (e.g. 2 to 4 weeks). Extension of the treatment period should not take place without reevaluation of the need for continued therapy. Continuous long-term use of the product is not recommended. Withdrawal symptoms (e.g. rebound insomnia) can appear following cessation of recommended doses after as little as one week of therapy. Abrupt discontinuation of product should be avoided and a gradual dosage-tapering schedule followed after extended therapy.

### Single dose phenobarbital in addition to symptom-triggered lorazepam in alcohol withdrawal [^116Bjba5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single parenteral dose of phenobarbital in addition to symptom-triggered lorazepam for the acute management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS).

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of adult patients who presented to the Emergency Department with moderate or severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Patients were included if they received at least 4 mg of lorazepam through the hospital's Alcohol Withdrawal Order Set on hospital day one. Patients who received a single parenteral dose of phenobarbital on hospital day one were compared to those who did not.

Results

Forty patients received phenobarbital and 38 patients received lorazepam only. Median daily lorazepam requirements, disposition, hospital length of stay, and median maximum daily CIWA-Ar scores were not statistically significant different between the groups. Significantly more patients in the phenobarbital group were discharged within three days in comparison to the lorazepam only group (9 patients vs. 2 patients, respectively, p < 0.05). In the lorazepam only group, two patients were intubated, one patient had delirium tremens, and no patients seized. In the phenobarbital group no adverse events were observed.

Conclusions

More patients were discharged within three days if they received a single parenteral dose of phenobarbital on hospital day one, in addition to symptom-triggered lorazepam for the acute management of AWS. Emergency Medicine physicians should consider ordering one parenteral phenobarbital dose on hospital day one to patients presenting with AWS.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^113ffFU1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Appendix N — medications for managing intoxication: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) (first line) are GABAergic and indicated for excitatory symptoms, anxiety/agitation, neuromuscular excitation, and seizures. Initial dosing includes lorazepam 1–2 mg IV based on clinical signs and symptoms and duration of effects; diazepam 5–10 mg PO for less severe symptoms based on patient parameters; and midazolam 5 mg IM or 0.01–0.05 mg/kg IV for acute agitation in adult patients, and redosing frequency and dose should be guided by the degree and duration of the clinical effects of the initial dose. Other considerations note parenteral vs. PO administration based on signs and symptom severity and drug availability (eg, parenteral BZD shortages), and IM administration allows for administration in agitated patients without IV access; lorazepam has very slow IM onset (15–30 min); midazolam has very rapid IV onset, allowing for easy titration, and a relatively fast IM onset; if psychosis is primary symptom, antipsychotics should be considered primarily or adjunctively.

### Benzodiazepines for treatment of patients with delirium excluding those who are cared for in an intensive care unit [^111AUFTw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Current critical care guidelines recommend first and foremost the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioural disturbances associated with delirium but current guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in healthcare settings that ranged from nursing homes and long-term care facilities to any hospital setting except for ICUs, involving adult patients with delirium excluding those with delirium related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Included RCTs had to assess the effect of benzodiazepines, at any dose and given by any route, compared with placebo or another drug intended to treat delirium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We decided whether or not to pool data on the basis of clinical heterogeneity between studies. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We identified only two trials that satisfied the selection criteria. We did not pool the data because of the substantial clinical differences between the trials. In one trial, participants (n = 58) were patients in an acute palliative care unit with advanced cancer who had a mean age of 64 years. All of the participants had delirium, were treated with haloperidol, and were randomised to receive either lorazepam or placebo in combination with it. Due to very serious imprecision, all evidence was of low certainty. We were unable to determine whether there were clinically important differences in the severity of delirium (mean difference (MD) 2.10, 95% CI -0.96 to 5.16; n = 50), length of hospital admission (MD 0.00, 95% CI -3.45 to 3.45; n = 58), mortality from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.02; participants = 58) or any of a number of adverse events. Important effects could not be confirmed or excluded. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode. In the other trial, participants (n = 30) were patients in general medical wards with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who had a mean age of 39.2 years. Investigators compared three drug treatments: all participants had delirium, and were randomised to receive lorazepam, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol. Very low-certainty evidence was identified, and we could not determine whether lorazepam differed from either of the other treatments in the effect on severity of delirium, any adverse event, or mortality from all causes. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode or the length of hospital admission.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no enough evidence to determine whether benzodiazepines are effective when used to treat patients with delirium who are cared for in non-ICU settings. The available evidence does not support their routine use for this indication. Because of the scarcity of data from randomised controlled trials, further research is required to determine whether or not there is a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium in non-ICU settings.

Benzodiazepines are a controversial treatment for anxiety in patients with substance use disorders. Concerns include risk of addiction, overdose, and diversion. But benzodiazepines are among the most effective and well-tolerated treatments for anxiety, and are safe for the majority of patients who take them. Though not appropriate for all cases, particularly in those with an active opioid use disorder, benzodiazepines should be considered as a treatment for patients with substance use disorders after careful weighing of benefits and harms.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

Assessing Risks and Benefits of Continued Benzodiazepine Prescribing

Clinicians should review BZD use frequently for patients who have a history of SUDs, as these individuals are at increased risk of developing SUDs to other substances compared to those without a history of SUD. In addition, patients who use BZDs and have co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD) or OUD are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality because of the cross-tolerance and combined CNS and respiratory depressant effects of these substances. Clinicians should carefully consider these risks when determining the appropriateness of continued BZD prescribing.

Considerations for Benzodiazepine Tapering in Patients with Substance Use Disorder

Abrupt cessation of BZDs is dangerous. The CGC recommends clinicians develop gradual tapering strategies that are individualized based on a patient's response. If more rapid tapering is indicated — for example, due to imminent safety risks or when alternate treatment options have been unsuccessful — clinicians can consider use of very long-acting agents (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents"). Clinicians should consider patients' psychosocial concerns and co-occurring disorders when determining the appropriate timing of BZD tapering.

Tapering can be complicated when patients have been obtaining BZDs from the illicit drug market, where counterfeit pills can include novel synthetic BZDs (e.g. etizolam, flubromazolam). These novel synthetic BZDs have not been well studied and may not be detected with standard drug testing or toxicology assays. The European Union Drugs Agency's New benzodiazepines in Europe – a review provides helpful information on emerging new BZDs. In addition, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) tracks emerging threats related to BZDs. Determining an equivalent BZD dose to begin tapering is complicated when patients are taking BZDs from the illicit drug market. In general, clinicians should titrate the BZD dose to the minimum dose necessary to control a patient's withdrawal symptoms and taper from that point. Clinicians should consider residential treatment if patients need after-hours clinical monitoring or medical management to support safe and effective BZD tapering.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115fGacz]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM benzodiazepine use in alcohol withdrawal — while no particular agent is more effective than another, longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to longer duration of action. If waiting for lab test results or tests are unavailable and the patient has signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. Clinicians should monitor for over-sedation and respiratory depression and discontinue a benzodiazepine prescription following treatment. To manage misuse or diversion in ambulatory settings, prescribe the minimum amount necessary based on stability and visit timing, or consider carbamazepine or gabapentin. In ambulatory settings, benzodiazepines should not be prescribed to patients with even mild adverse events or those at high risk of diversion; risk can be managed by dispensing or prescribing a small number of doses. Patients and caregivers should be educated on drug–drug interactions with other CNS depressants, the risks of combining alcohol and benzodiazepines and the importance of abstinence, the risks of driving or heavy machinery for the first few days, and instructions to reduce dose if drowsiness occurs.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1129qpRX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — when symptoms are not controlled on prescribed medication: First, consider increasing the dose. If over‑sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern, first ensure appropriate level of care. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy should be monitored for signs of response; if patients do not respond as expected, an assessment of nonadherence can be considered. Patients with more severe withdrawal may require larger doses than are typically seen, particularly during early withdrawal, but providing large doses of benzodiazepine can lead to over‑sedation and worse outcomes and these patients should be monitored closely. Second, patients should be reassessed for appropriate level of care and a more intensive level may be needed to monitor and manage major complications. Third, consider switching to a different medication; higher numbers of previous alcohol withdrawal episodes is associated with decreased responsiveness to benzodiazepines, and switching to an alternative medication should be considered. Fourth, if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication; the use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is also appropriate for patients experiencing moderate or severe withdrawal.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression, and patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concomitant alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines may be given but should be used with caution and only in facilities with close monitoring, and patients receiving opioid agonist therapy with concomitant alcohol withdrawal should be admitted and managed in a hospital setting or other setting with the resources to manage increased risk of respiratory depression and other complications. Patients who are using sedative-hypnotic medication are at higher risk of major complications and may exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and require dose adjustment, and these patients should be monitored closely.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — ambulatory benzodiazepine prescribing cautions: In ambulatory management, some situations exist where the risks of benzodiazepines outweigh benefits; in these cases, patients can be offered an alternative medication, and individuals with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use should not be prescribed benzodiazepines because continuous monitoring is lacking. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed with extra caution by dispensing or prescribing a very small number of doses and using more frequent monitoring; even patients at high risk for misuse or diversion, or with current or past benzodiazepine use disorder, can be prescribed benzodiazepines if managed cautiously, and the potential for misuse is limited during the short period of supervised withdrawal.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^112Bsp9o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Initiate LOREEV XR in patients who are being treated with lorazepam tablets, administered three times daily in evenly divided doses (refer to the Prescribing Information of lorazepam tablets for the recommended dosage of lorazepam tablets).

Discontinue lorazepam tablets and administer the first dose of LOREEV XR in the morning the day after the final dose of lorazepam tablets.

The recommended once daily dosage of LOREEV XR is equal to the total daily dose of lorazepam tablets. For example, the recommended dosage for patients who have been receiving lorazepam tablets at a dosage of 1 mg three times daily is LOREEV XR 3 mg once daily in the morning.

The effectiveness of LOREEV XR use for more than 4 months has not been assessed in clinical studies. Healthcare providers should periodically re-evaluate longer term use of LOREEV XR.

2.2 Administration Information

Administer LOREEV XR orally once daily, in the morning, with or without food. Do not crush or chew LOREEV XR.

Swallow LOREEV XR capsules whole or open the capsule and sprinkle the entire contents over a tablespoon of applesauce, followed by drinking water. Consume all the sprinkled LOREEV XR in its entirety, (without chewing) within 2 hours; do not store for future use.

2.3 Dosage Increase for Inadequate Clinical Response

If the clinical response to LOREEV XR is inadequate and a dosage increase in needed, discontinue LOREEV XR and switch to lorazepam tablets to increase the dosage. If an adequate clinical response is achieved with a stable, evenly divided three times daily dosage of lorazepam tablets, resume LOREEV XR once daily dosing with the total daily dose of lorazepam tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.4 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of LOREEV XR

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115itypM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal delirium — benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy and dosing: patients should be sedated to achieve and maintain a light somnolence and benzodiazepines are recommended as first-line agents. When available, medication should be administered intravenously; intermittent IV administration of long- and short-acting medications is acceptable and effective, while continuous IV infusion is considerably more expensive and there is no evidence of therapeutic superiority. Patients receiving repeated high intravenous doses of lorazepam or diazepam should be monitored closely for signs of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis. When treating alcohol withdrawal delirium, use an established dosing protocol as a guide but individualize dosing; intravenous symptom-triggered or fixed-dose front loading is appropriate, and once light somnolence is achieved and patients are calm and cooperative, or if IV medication is not available, shifting to oral symptom-triggered treatment is recommended. Very large doses of benzodiazepines may be needed to control agitation; clinicians should not hesitate to provide such large doses but should keep in mind the possible risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression, and when large doses are used there is risk of accumulation of long-acting benzodiazepine metabolites, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function or the elderly, who should be monitored closely.

### Triazolam [^115Y12b1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe triazolam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of triazolam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking triazolam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when triazolam is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of triazolam, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of triazolam along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to prefer symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing (conducted by trained personnel) at short-term observational settings with continuous monitoring; use front loading while under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as-needed medication as another option. Prefer symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing in inpatient settings; consider using fixed dosing according to a scheduled taper if symptom-triggered treatment cannot be used.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

This is a post hoc analysis of data from TRANSFORM‐2, a 4‐week, flexible‐dose, double‐blind, active‐controlled, multicenter trial of outpatients with TRD who received either esketamine or placebo nasal spray and a newly‐initiated oral antidepressant (Popova et al.).

The study was approved by independent review boards/ethics committees and written informed consent was obtained from all patients (identifier: NCT02418585).

2.2 Patients

TRANSFORM‐2 enrolled outpatients aged 18–64 years with recurrent MDD (per DSM‐5 criteria [American Psychiatric Association,]), without psychotic features, and a total score ≥ 34 on the clinician‐rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (Rush et al.). At the start of screening, eligible participants had documented nonresponse to ≥ 1 but ≤ 5 oral antidepressants based on historical report and the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (Chandler et al.). Per protocol, participants had been adherent to an ongoing oral antidepressant for at least the most recent 2 weeks, which was continued prospectively for 4 additional weeks during a screening/prospective observational phase. Exclusion criteria included moderate‐to‐severe substance or alcohol use disorder within the prior 6 months, obsessive compulsive disorder (current only), and use of a total daily dose of benzodiazepines equivalent to > 6 mg/day of lorazepam. Of note, comorbid anxiety disorders were otherwise not excluded.

Those with nonresponse to their ongoing oral antidepressant and meeting criteria for TRD following the 4‐week screening/prospective observational phase discontinued all current antidepressant treatment(s) and were randomized to 4 weeks of double‐blind treatment, comprised of twice‐weekly, flexible‐dose esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) or placebo nasal spray, each in combination with a newly‐initiated open‐label oral antidepressant taken daily. Dosing of the oral antidepressant followed a fixed titration schedule, and patients were titrated to the maximally tolerated dose per the product label.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114wBHaV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine characteristics, tapering, accumulation, and hepatic considerations: Benzodiazepines are commonly recommended as first-line agents for managing most forms of alcohol withdrawal, and diazepam, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide are the most frequently used in treating alcohol withdrawal. While there is no evidence to show superiority of effectiveness or adverse effects among benzodiazepines, slower-acting agents with long half-lives can be considered preferred in clinical practice, helping provide a smoother course of withdrawal, greater control of breakthrough and rebound signs or symptoms, and greater coverage for preventing breakthrough withdrawal seizures and delirium. For patients on shorter-acting agents, a more gradual taper and more frequent reassessment are advised. Longer-acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, particularly in older patients or those with compromised health; other signs of accumulation include ataxia, confusion, memory impairment, and delirium, and benzodiazepine-associated delirium has been diagnosed by the administration of flumazenil, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, though this protocol was not reviewed by the Guideline Committee. Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function, and in such cases the dose can be reduced or an agent with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used; laboratory tests can help indicate the need to adjust the treatment plan, but treatment should not be delayed while waiting for lab test results or if the test(s) are unavailable at the treatment setting.

### Adjunctive use of ketamine for benzodiazepine-resistant severe alcohol withdrawal: a retrospective evaluation [^117JB6Gz]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

The only other published study utilizing ketamine for alcohol withdrawal in an ICU setting was conducted by Wong et al. Ketamine was utilized as an adjunctive agent for AWS. They evaluated sedation scores, diazepam equivalent requirements pre- and post-ketamine infusion for AWS, and duration of mechanical ventilation. The two studies have notable differences in methodology and results. In our study, all patients received a lorazepam continuous infusion compared with their study utilizing symptom-triggered benzodiazepine therapy. Approximately 83% of patients in the Wong study were BZD resistant. All our patients were BZD resistant since all patients required a lorazepam continuous infusion after failing multiple lorazepam boluses, which increases the potential need for mechanical ventilation. Previously, it has been reported that patients not responding to bolus therapy and requiring continuous sedative infusions may be more severely agitated with an increased length of stay and higher rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The dosing of ketamine utilized between our two studies also differed. Wong et al. reported a median infusion rate of 0.2 mg/kg/h compared with our initial rate of 0.75 mg/kg/h and average maximum daily rate of 1.6 mg/kg/h. These dosing differences could potentially explain the differences in outcomes related to symptom control and BZD reductions. With regard to outcomes, Wong et al. found no difference in alcohol withdrawal or sedation scores within 6 hours of ketamine initiation and demonstrated a non-significant trend in reduction of BZD use at 12- and 24-hours post-ketamine initiation. Our population demonstrated initial symptom control within 1 hour of ketamine initiation with CIWA-Ar scores decreasing below 20 that otherwise remained above 20 despite a lorazepam infusion rate of 14 mg/h. We also found a statistically significant reduction in lorazepam infusion rates at 24 hours. The duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stays were shorter with Wong et al. which may potentially be explained based on different severities as the patients in our study all required continuous lorazepam infusions and could not be controlled with symptom-triggered lorazepam boluses. One plausible explanation for the differences in alcohol withdrawal scores and benzodiazepine reduction seen in our population may be due to the higher dosing strategy. At the time of the study, our institution's sedation guidelines for ketamine as a sedative infusion allowed a maximum dose of 4.5 mg/kg/h, which explains the higher ketamine average maximum dose of 1.6 mg/kg/h. The pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines provide a dosing recommendation of 0.05–0.4 mg/kg/h for ketamine when used for routine ICU sedation. Sedation requirements in AWS are often higher than the routine sedative infusion doses as has been reported with other agents. Ketamine has been used for other indications such as status epilepticus in dosing ranges similar to our study. The dosing of ketamine for alcohol withdrawal remains unknown and therefore extrapolating higher dosing used for other indications may be warranted for severe alcohol withdrawal patients with BZD resistance.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115y5ko4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations – treatment options (5–10) — Patients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting, and persons who are regularly using alcohol or other sedatives but do not meet criteria for a specific substance use disorder should be carefully monitored. The prescribing of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with caution in patients who are prescribed methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder, and while combined use increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. Methadone is recommended for patients who may benefit from daily dosing and supervision in an OTP or for those for whom buprenorphine has been used unsuccessfully in an OTP or OBOT setting. Opioid dosing guidelines developed for chronic pain, expressed in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), are not applicable to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders. Regarding naltrexone, oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence; clinicians should reserve its use for patients who have been unable to comply with special adherence techniques (e.g., observed dosing), and extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, adherence issues. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) should be checked regularly to confirm medication adherence and to monitor the prescribing of other controlled substances.

Discussion

Benzodiazepines have long played a prominent role in the treatment and prophylaxis of AWS and are often regarded as standard of care. This class of medications treats the psychomotor agitation that accompanies AWS and prevents progression from minor to major symptoms. Like ethanol, benzodiazepines stimulate the gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) receptors in the brain resulting in reduced neuronal activity and sedation. Although any benzodiazepine can be used for AWS, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, and diazepam are preferred for their relatively long half-lives, reducing the risk of breakthrough symptoms.

When initiating benzodiazepine therapy, consider the specific agent, route, and dosing-strategy (table 3). For severe, acute AWS, including patients with tremor, use intravenous medication initially. As symptoms abate, patients should be transitioned to oral medication as soon as possible. For patients with mild symptoms, it is appropriate to start with oral administration. Both symptom-triggered benzodiazepine therapy and "front-loading" (rapid, deeper sedation followed by tapering) strategies have been described. The approach used is primarily based on the ability of the patient to cope with mild symptoms of AWS. Patients who are less likely to tolerate any hypertension or tachycardia may benefit from more aggressive initial dosing. In patients with severe symptoms, using a front-loading approach is associated with reduced length of stay compared with symptom-based treatment only. When using a front-loading approach, both diazepam and lorazepam may be used; however, care should be taken with lorazepam as longer onset of action may lead to frequent doses and resultant oversedation. A symptom-triggered approach for patients uses benzodiazepines in conjunction with standardized symptom scales such as CIWA or mMINDS. This approach decreases the total amount of medication administered and the duration of treatment when compared with fixed dosing regimens. Fixed dosing strategies, where benzodiazepines are given at regular intervals, regardless of symptoms, are associated with increased medication administration. Oral benzodiazepines are appropriate for mild symptoms using a symptom-based approach, and acceptable results have been obtained using chlordiazepoxide.

Benzodiazepines — management of agitated postoperative delirium: The prescribing practitioner should not use benzodiazepines as a first-line treatment of the agitated postoperative delirious patient who is threatening substantial harm to self and/or others to treat postoperative delirium except when benzodiazepines are specifically indicated (including, but not limited to, treatment of alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal). When used, treatment with benzodiazepines should be at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration, employed only if behavioral measures have failed or are not possible, and ongoing use should be evaluated daily with in-person examination of the patient (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low). Evidence cited includes a study in which the lorazepam arm was terminated early because of significant adverse effects. Potential harms of this recommendation include withholding treatment for conditions where benzodiazepines are indicated, such as alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1129nofU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine regimens (doses in chlordiazepoxide equivalents) provide severity-based single doses, symptom-triggered dosing, fixed-dose tapers, and front-loading options. Mild withdrawal (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised [CIWA-Ar] < 10) uses 25–50 mg by mouth (PO); moderate (CIWA-Ar 10–18) uses 50–100 mg PO; severe (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19) uses 75–100 mg PO. Symptom-triggered dosing is 25–100 mg PO every 4–6 hours (q4–6h) when CIWA-Ar ≥ 10 with additional doses as needed (PRN). A fixed-dose taper reduces the daily total by 25–50% per day over 3–5 days with PRN doses, using a schedule of Day 1: 25–100 mg PO q4–6h; Day 2: 25–100 mg PO q6–8h; Day 3: 25–100 mg PO q8–12h; Day 4: 25–100 mg PO at bedtime; and optional Day 5: 25 to 100 mg PO at bedtime. A front loading option includes symptom-triggered 50–100 mg PO q 1–2h until CIWA-Ar < 10 or fixed-dose 50–100 mg PO q1–2h for 3 doses.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
The use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing Ativan and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS).
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Ativan after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Ativan or reduce the dosage (DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ativan (lorazepam) is administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available.

The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day.

For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day.

For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime.

For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated.

The dosage of Ativan (lorazepam) should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses.

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Ativan

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Ativan or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider dispensing or prescribing the minimum amount of benzodiazepines required for the given patient's level of stability and timing of their next in-person clinic visit to manage benzodiazepine misuse and diversion risk in outpatient settings. Consider prescribing alternative medications, such as carbamazepine or gabapentin.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1146a48U]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the ambulatory treatment setting should be provided with pharmacotherapy, with benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin appropriate for monotherapy. Providing at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is also appropriate, and if the risk is unknown patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication.

### Treating alcohol withdrawal with oral baclofen: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112KRJwH]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Abrupt cessation of alcohol intake causes habituated drinkers to experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS).

Objective

To determine the effect of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-B agonist baclofen on the course of acute symptomatic AWS.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study.

Setting

Two tertiary-care hospitals in Duluth, Minnesota.

Patients

Inpatient adults admitted for any reason (including AWS) judged to be at high risk for AWS.

Intervention

Inpatients who developed symptoms of AWS received symptom-triggered benzodiazepine treatment using lorazepam by standard protocol, and were randomized to receive baclofen 10 mg or placebo, 3 times per day, orally.

Measurements

AWS severity was assessed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar); lorazepam dose was monitored.

Results

Seventy-nine subjects were enrolled. The 44 subjects who developed symptoms of AWS were randomized to baclofen or placebo. Thirty-one subjects (18 baclofen, 13 placebo) completed 72 hours of assessments, either entirely as inpatients or with outpatient follow-up. The need for high doses of benzodiazepines (20 mg or more of lorazepam over 72 hours) to control AWS was less likely in the baclofen treatment group (1 of 18) than in the placebo-treated group (7 of 13) (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

We found that the use of baclofen was associated with a significant reduction in the use of high doses of benzodiazepine (lorazepam) in the management of symptomatic AWS. The use of low-dose baclofen in the management of AWS deserves further study, as reduced dependence on high-dose benzodiazepines in AWS management could improve patient safety.

Alcohol withdrawal medications note that long-acting benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medications for treating alcohol withdrawal, with dosing approaches including front loading, fixed, and symptom-triggered; symptom severity will help determine the most appropriate dosing regimen, which may be adjusted during the course of treatment, and many jails routinely give one or two doses of benzodiazepine prophylactically (under protocols, with patient-specific orders) to patients at risk for alcohol withdrawal as a low-risk, low-cost, effective preventive measure.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115kynVT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — benzodiazepine front loading — describes front loading as administering a moderate to high dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine to rapidly control withdrawal, noting diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the preferred agents and that this approach is typically used in patients at risk for or experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 19). The guideline states front loading has been shown to reduce the duration of treatment, incidence of withdrawal seizure, and duration of delirium, and that a front-loading regimen can follow a fixed schedule such as 20 mg diazepam PO every 2 hours for 3 doses. It advises clinicians should monitor patients closely during treatment and, if the CIWA-Ar is used with short acting benzodiazepines, assessments should be done promptly in order to prevent seizures due to protocol errors.

### Eliminating the benzos: a benzodiazepine-sparing approach to preventing and treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^116tfAkG]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) represents significant cost to the hospitalized trauma population from a clinical and financial perspective. Historically, AWS has been managed with benzodiazepines. Despite their efficacy, benzodiazepines carry a heavy adverse effect profile. Recently, benzodiazepine-sparing protocols for the prophylaxis and treatment of AWS have been used in medical patient populations. Most existing benzodiazepine-sparing protocols use phenobarbital, while ours primarily uses gabapentin and clonidine, and no such protocol has been developed and examined for safety and efficacy specifically within a trauma population.

Methods

In December of 2019, we implemented our benzodiazepine-sparing protocol for trauma patients identified at risk for alcohol withdrawal on admission. Trauma patients at risk for AWS admitted to an academic Level 1 trauma center before (conventional) and after (benzodiazepine-sparing [BS]) protocol implementation were compared. Outcomes examined include morphine milligram equivalent dosing rates and lorazepam equivalent dosing rates as well as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) scores, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and ventilator days.

Results

A total of 387 conventional and 134 benzodiazepine sparing patients were compared. Injury Severity Score (13 vs. 16, p = 0.10) and admission alcohol levels (99 vs. 149, p = 0.06) were similar. Patients in the BS pathway had a lower maximum daily CIWA-Ar (2.7 vs. 1.5, p = 0.04). While mean morphine milligram equivalent per day was not different between groups (31.5 vs. 33.6, p = 0.49), mean lorazepam equivalents per day was significantly lower in the BS group (1.1 vs. 0.2, p < 0.01). Length of stay and vent days were not different between the groups.

Conclusion

Implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing pathway that uses primarily clonidine and gabapentin to prevent and treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome in trauma patients is safe, reduces the daily maximum CIWA-Ar, and significantly decreases the need for benzodiazepines. Future studies will focus on outcomes affected by avoiding AWS and benzodiazepines in the trauma population.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Ativan concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Ativan than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Ativan, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Ativan is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including Ativan, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse).

Before prescribing Ativan and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of Ativan, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of Ativan along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

Alcohol withdrawal delirium — benzodiazepine management and antipsychotic adjuncts: Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medications to treat patients with delirium because of the favorable therapeutic window, and intermittent IV administration of a long-acting medication or continuous IV infusion of short-acting medication are both effective treatments for alcohol withdrawal delirium. Patients treated with repeated high doses of lorazepam or diazepam require close monitoring due to the rapid onset of action and the risk of accumulation of long-acting benzodiazepine metabolites, which is especially common in patients with impaired hepatic function or among the elderly. If a patient has been delirious longer than 72 hours and has been receiving high doses of benzodiazepines (in the thousands of milligrams), the patient may have developed benzodiazepine-induced delirium, and clinicians should consider reducing the benzodiazepine dose and adding an antipsychotic agent to control agitation and/or confusion. Even if patients are at reduced risk of seizure, antipsychotics should not be used as monotherapy because they lower the seizure threshold; second generation atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone and quetiapine, are preferred, haloperidol, a first generation antipsychotic, is also an appropriate agent, and antipsychotics may also be used in conjunction with benzodiazepines to control severe agitation and hallucinations associated with early alcohol withdrawal delirium.
