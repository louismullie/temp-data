## Question

36 year old male comes to the ER with chest pain. Has Co2 low at 18 and has low Lymphocytes Absolute. Low PTT also what are the possible issues

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the possible issues are for a 36-year-old man with chest pain, low CO2, low absolute lymphocyte count, and low PTT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate life threats and the core chest pain workup. Then, I should verify the significance and implications of each abnormal lab value. Next, I will integrate these findings into a prioritized differential diagnosis. After that, I need to outline a targeted diagnostic plan and management strategy. Finally, I should consider special populations and ensure the reasoning aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence-based pathways [^111da6uC] [^111vcu4i].

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities in any adult with acute chest pain: rule out acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, and tension pneumothorax, because delays in recognizing these are dangerous; I should obtain a focused history, vitals, a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin at presentation and again in 3 hours if symptoms began at least 3 hours earlier, while also anchoring risk stratification to validated clinical decision pathways and the patient's pretest probability [^111vcu4i] [^111da6uC] [^114c8i4S].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of the low CO2 at 18 mmol/L; a bicarbonate around 18 suggests a metabolic acidosis or a compensatory respiratory alkalosis, so I need an arterial or venous blood gas to distinguish these and to check for an anion gap, lactate, and electrolytes, because mixed acid-base disorders and lactic acidosis can accompany sepsis, pulmonary embolism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or toxic ingestions, and they also influence myocardial function and perfusion in suspected ACS [^114wBZVk] [^111vhnmU].

> I should confirm the meaning of low absolute lymphocytes; lymphopenia is common in COVID-19 and correlates with severity, but it is not specific and can also reflect stress, corticosteroid exposure, other viral infections, or immune suppression; in this 36-year-old, I need to check for COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and testing, while remembering that lymphopenia alone cannot diagnose COVID-19 and must be interpreted in clinical context [^116QEMG2] [^111Ge6pq] [^116gPsfC].

> Hold on, I should verify the implication of a low PTT; a shortened PTT is not a classic bleeding marker and instead suggests increased thrombin generation and a hypercoagulable state, which raises concern for thrombosis such as pulmonary embolism or arterial events; I need to check for venous thromboembolism risk factors and consider that a low PTT can be seen with increased factor VIII activity, lupus anticoagulant paradox shortening, or early disseminated intravascular coagulation, so I should pair this with D-dimer, fibrinogen, PT/INR, and platelets before jumping to conclusions [^notfound].

> Let me integrate these findings; the combination of low CO2, lymphopenia, and low PTT in a 36-year-old with chest pain pushes me to prioritize pulmonary embolism given its frequency as a life-threatening cause of pleuritic chest pain and the hypercoagulable signal from a low PTT, while also keeping COVID-19 in mind because lymphopenia is common and COVID-19 itself increases thrombotic risk; I should also keep ACS on the table because chest pain mandates it, but the laboratory pattern is less typical for isolated ACS, and I should not forget aortic dissection or pericarditis depending on pain quality and exam [^111piybs] [^112kotWt] [^116QEMG2] [^111da6uC].

> Next, I should review a targeted diagnostic plan; I will obtain a chest radiograph to screen for alternative cardiopulmonary causes, apply a validated PE decision rule such as Wells or Geneva to guide pretest probability, and if probability is not low, order a D-dimer with concurrent PT/INR, fibrinogen, and platelet count to assess for thrombosis and consumptive coagulopathy; if D-dimer is positive or probability is high, I will proceed to CT pulmonary angiography, and I will test for COVID-19 with PCR given the lymphopenia and current risk; throughout, I will continue the ACS pathway with serial high-sensitivity troponins and ECGs, and if PE is excluded but suspicion for ACS persists, I will consider coronary CT angiography or functional testing based on risk and pretest probability [^116sYTH1] [^111piybs] [^112kotWt] [^114gKMeQ] [^111da6uC].

> I need to ensure management is aligned with findings; if PE is confirmed, I should initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants depending on renal function and bleeding risk, and if COVID-19 is present, I should follow COVID-19 anticoagulation guidance balancing thrombosis and bleeding risks; if ACS is diagnosed, I will manage per guideline-directed medical therapy and consider invasive angiography for high-risk features; if neither PE nor ACS is present, I will broaden to other causes such as pericarditis, musculoskeletal pain, or gastrointestinal etiologies while reassessing the acid-base disturbance and its triggers [^114SdugS] [^111da6uC] [^111vcu4i].

> But wait, what if the patient belongs to a special population that modifies pretest probabilities; in women and some younger patients, ACS symptoms can be underrecognized, so I should maintain vigilance and avoid premature closure, and in patients with sickle cell disease, acute chest syndrome must be actively excluded with chest radiograph, CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, and cultures; in immunocompromised hosts, opportunistic infections including esophageal candidiasis can present with substernal pain and dysphagia, so I should ask about oral thrush and CD4 status when relevant [^114zm27U] [^113xG2ne] [^114mW2Ad].

> I should double-check that my lab interpretation is sound; a low PTT is not benign and should prompt a search for hypercoagulability rather than reassurance about bleeding, and a low CO2 demands an ABG to classify the acid-base disorder and guide urgency; lymphopenia is a severity marker in COVID-19 but is not diagnostic by itself, so I must correlate with exposure risk and PCR results before attributing causality [^114wBZVk] [^116QEMG2].

> In summary, I will proceed with a high-sensitivity troponin-based ACS evaluation, a PE-focused pathway using a validated rule and D-dimer with appropriate imaging, COVID-19 testing given lymphopenia, and early acid-base assessment with ABG and lactate; this integrated approach addresses the most likely and most dangerous causes while preventing anchoring bias and ensuring that each abnormal lab contributes meaningfully to the working diagnosis and management plan [^111da6uC] [^111vcu4i] [^111piybs] [^116QEMG2].

---

The most likely causes of chest pain in a 36-year-old male with low CO2, low lymphocytes, and low PTT are **pulmonary embolism** [^111piybs] or **COVID-19 pneumonia** [^116QEMG2], both of which can cause respiratory alkalosis (low CO2), lymphopenia, and a hypercoagulable state with low PTT [^notfound]. Other considerations include **sepsis** [^111Ge6pq], **myocarditis** [^11114JWJ], and **anxiety-related hyperventilation** [^111vhnmU], but PE and COVID-19 best explain the combined abnormalities. Immediate workup should include **ECG, troponin, D-dimer, chest CT angiography, and COVID-19 testing** to rapidly identify and treat life-threatening causes [^111da6uC] [^111vcu4i].

## Differential diagnosis

Key characteristics of pulmonary embolism and COVID-19 pneumonia:

| **Aspect** | **Pulmonary embolism (pe)** | **Covid-19 pneumonia** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | PE causes ventilation-perfusion mismatch, leading to hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis (low CO2) [^notfound] | COVID-19 causes respiratory alkalosis due to hypoxemia and hyperventilation [^notfound] |
| Lymphopenia | Stress-related lymphopenia is common in acute illness, including PE [^notfound] | A hallmark of COVID-19, correlating with disease severity [^116QEMG2] |
| Low PTT | PE is associated with a hypercoagulable state, which can shorten PTT [^notfound] | COVID-19 induces a hypercoagulable state, shortening PTT [^notfound] |
| Clinical correlation | Pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia are classic PE features [^notfound] | Fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain are common presentations [^notfound] |

---

### Sepsis

Sepsis can cause **respiratory alkalosis** from hyperventilation and hypoxemia [^notfound]. Lymphopenia reflects **immune suppression** and is common in sepsis [^notfound]. A hypercoagulable state in sepsis may also shorten the PTT [^notfound].

---

### Myocarditis

Myocarditis may present with chest pain and **tachypnea**, leading to respiratory alkalosis [^notfound]. Lymphopenia can occur due to **viral infection** or immune-mediated mechanisms [^111Ge6pq]. A hypercoagulable state in myocarditis may also shorten the PTT [^notfound].

---

### Anxiety-related hyperventilation

Anxiety can drive **hyperventilation**, producing respiratory alkalosis with low CO2 [^111vhnmU]. Lymphopenia may be transient and stress-related in anxiety states [^notfound]. A hypercoagulable state has also been described in anxiety, potentially lowering PTT [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

Given the broad differential, a **structured diagnostic approach** is essential:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| ECG, high-sensitivity troponin | Assess for ACS/myocarditis [^111da6uC] [^114gKMeQ] |
| D-dimer | Screen for thromboembolism (PE) [^111piybs] |
| Chest CT angiography | Confirm/exclude PE [^112hd7qK] |
| COVID-19 PCR | Confirm/exclude COVID-19 [^111GTgwm] |
| CBC with differential | Assess lymphocyte count and immune status [^111Ge6pq] |
| Coagulation profile (PT, INR, fibrinogen) | Assess coagulation status [^115yAxUv] |
| Arterial blood gas (ABG) | Confirm respiratory alkalosis and assess oxygenation [^115h7ZhE] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Immediate anticoagulation and supportive care are critical [^notfound].
- **COVID-19 pneumonia**: Supportive care, oxygenation, and anticoagulation per COVID-19 protocols [^114SdugS].
- **Sepsis**: Prompt antibiotics, supportive care, and source control [^notfound].
- **Myocarditis**: Supportive care, monitor for complications, and treat underlying cause [^11114JWJ].
- **Anxiety-related hyperventilation**: Reassurance, breathing techniques, and address underlying anxiety [^notfound].

---

The most likely causes of chest pain in a 36-year-old male with low CO2, low lymphocytes, and low PTT are **pulmonary embolism** or **COVID-19 pneumonia**, with sepsis, myocarditis, and anxiety-related hyperventilation as additional considerations. A structured diagnostic approach — including ECG, troponin, D-dimer, chest CT angiography, and COVID-19 testing — is essential to identify and manage life-threatening conditions promptly [^111da6uC].

### Analysis of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 [^116QEMG2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity and presentation. When admitting patients to the hospital, it is desirable to isolate patients with COVID-19 from those without the disease. However, reliably identifying patients with COVID-19 in the emergency department before hospital admission is often limited by the speed and availability of testing. Previous studies determined a low lymphocyte count is commonly found in patients with COVID-19. We sought to explore the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients presenting to the emergency department requiring subsequent hospitalization who were found to have COVID-19.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on 312 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored.

Results

Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died.

Conclusion

Knowing the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 may help identify patients who are unlikely to have the disease. Additionally, absolute lymphocyte count can be used as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.

### Essential thrombocythaemia first presenting as myocardial infarction in a 36-year-old male [^115LnYJp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm where there is a clonal proliferation of thrombocytes. Whilst most often diagnosed incidentally, it can uncommonly present with arterial thrombosis. This is a case presentation of a 36-year-old male who was diagnosed with ET following myocardial infarction caused by multiple thrombotic emboli. The patient was initially misdiagnosed with viral myopericarditis based on an atypical history of chest pain with a viral prodrome. Reattendance a month later with further chest pain, dynamically raised troponin and ECG changes raised suspicions of ACS. Analysis of blood markers from both admissions showed consistently elevated platelet counts. A CMR scan revealed focal ischaemic scars in multiple cardiac segments consistent with an acute coronary event or coronary embolisation. A subsequent coronary angiography demonstrated minimal coronary artery disease. JAK2 gene V617F mutation was detected, confirming ET. The patient was commenced on pegylated interferon-alpha and dual antiplatelet therapy, and discharged with follow-up.

The Case

An elderly man from central Missouri, USA, came to the emergency department of a local hospital in June (year redacted) reporting 6 days of nausea, anorexia, and fatigue, followed by confusion and shortness of breath with cough. He denied fever, chills, or chest pain. He worked outdoors and had numerous tick exposures. His medical history included diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis; he was taking prednisone, methotrexate, and adalimumab.

On initial examination, he was afebrile (36.6°C), oriented only to year, and wheezed bilaterally on expiration. Laboratory results (Table 1) showed acute kidney injury, transaminitis, and mixed anion-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. Initial complete blood count results showed normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Total leukocyte count was within reference range, but lymphocyte count showed absolute lymphopenia. Troponin I was mildly elevated without electrocardiographic changes. Results of chest radiography and noncontrast computed tomography of the head were unremarkable. He was transferred to a tertiary care center for management of possible acute coronary syndrome and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

†On continuous venovenous hemodialysis.

On post–symptom onset day (PSOD) 8, the patient became febrile (38.9°C) and increasingly confused; we intubated him for airway protection. We empirically prescribed vancomycin, meropenem, ampicillin, and acyclovir for meningoencephalitis, as well as doxycycline for possible ehrlichiosis (Figure 1). We administered a platelet transfusion to complete a lumbar puncture safely. Lumbar puncture results revealed a mildly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein of 56 mg/dL and an unremarkable CSF glucose level of 64 mg/dL. Specimen tubes 1 and 4 cell counts were, respectively, 14 and 0 leukocytes/µL and 158 and 14 red blood cells/µL.

### Haemoptysis as the first presentation of COVID-19: a case report [^112PC2E1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the BAL fluid by means of RT-PCR. Based on the current insights at that time and in accordance with the national guidelines, the patient was started on hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily at day 1, followed by 200 mg twice daily at day 2 to 5) along with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azithromycin (QTc 429 ms before treatment initiation). Remdesivir, tocilizumab and convalescent plasma were not available at that time, except through clinical trials and urgent medical need programs for which the patient did not qualify.

On day four, the patient was subsequently transferred to the COVID-19 respiratory intermediate care unit of our hospital. Upon admission in our centre, the patient was in mild respiratory distress. His temperature was 38.0 °C, blood pressure 107/67 mmHg, heart rate 106 bpm and oxygen saturation on pulse-oximetry 92%, while receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of two litres per minute. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Further physical examination was normal. The white blood cell count was 6070/μL (reference range, 3650–9700/μL), with a lymphocyte count of 730/μL (reference range, 1133–3105/μL). The platelet count was 137,000/μL (reference range, 149,000–319,000/μL), the hemoglobin level 10.1 g/dL (reference range, 12.9–17.3 g/dL), the ferritin level 462 μg/L (peak value: 608 μg/L at day 10) (reference range, 20–280 μg/L), the total bilirubin level 2.1 g/dL (reference range, 0.2–1.3 g/dL), the aspartate aminotransferase level 335 U/L (reference range, 0–37 U/L), the alanine aminotransferase level 360 U/L (reference range, 7–40 U/L) and the C-reactive protein 12.1 g/L (reference range, < 5 g/L). Renal function was normal, as was the coagulation screen with a prothrombin (PT) level of 79% (reference range, 70 to 120), an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 36 s (reference range, 28.9 to 38.1) and D-dimers of 880 ng/mL (reference range < 270 ng/mL). Tests for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens in the urine were negative, as well as leptospirosis serology. Pulmonary hypertension was ruled out by transthoracic echocardiography.

### To bleed or not to bleed? Is that the question for the PTT? [^113GJiwi]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

The activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is the grandchild of the Lee-White whole blood clot time (WBCT). Both tests were developed to assist the diagnostic process for patients who exhibited features consistent with hemophilia, i.e., the pretest probability was extremely high. Probably < 0.1%-1.0% of PTTs ordered in current medical practice fit that indication with the most common indication now being routine admission order; i.e., a pretest probability that is extremely low. The question asked of the PTT has evolved from 'why does this patient bleed?' to 'will this patient bleed?' As the PTT was never intended to answer that question, one must be careful regarding interpretation of results of that test. As many situations not related to hemorrhage are associated with perturbations of the PTT, a prolonged PTT is not strongly predictive of hemorrhage nor does a normal PTT provide shelter against hemorrhagic risk.

### The isolated prolonged PTT [^115GcFLB]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

It is increasingly difficult to choose the proper tests to investigate an abnormal laboratory result, delaying the time to reach the correct diagnosis and increasing the cost of care. A wrong choice may also lead to clinically significant errors, which can be life threatening. To show how errors in test selection occur in routine medical practice, the authors describe an algorithm to evaluate patients with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and a normal prothrombin time. This exercise challenges the commonly held belief that errors in laboratory utilization occur primarily with esoteric and/or genetic testing, rather than in patients with common abnormalities such as a prolonged PTT.

Clinical introduction

A 33-year-old man with no history of coronary artery disease presented to the rapid access cardiology clinic with an episode of atypical anginal chest pain. He had a 15 pack-year history of smoking and a family history of myocardial infarction under the age of 55. Physical examination and exercise ECG testing were unremarkable. On assessment in the cardiology clinic, blood sampling was notable for an elevated high-sensitivity troponin I of 61 ng/L (99% upper reference level, 34 ng/L). A coronary CT angiogram was performed (figure 1).

### A 57-year-old man with a large left pleural effusion [^112JvkQV]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 57-year-old man presented to the ED with altered mental status and severe shortness of breath. He was found to be in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and required admission to the ICU. He reported the following: a 4-month history of progressive shortness of breath; left-sided chest pain; cough productive of brown, foul-smelling sputum; and weight loss. He had an extensive smoking history but had quit 1 year prior. The patient was born in Ethiopia but had been living in the United States for the last 20 years. His last visit to Ethiopia was in 2009, and he denied any other recent travel or exposure to TB. There was no history to suggest immune compromise. He had not seen a physician in many years and never established medical care in the United States.

Mucosal candidiasis diagnosis — adults and adolescents with HIV: Esophageal candidiasis should be suspected in people with low CD4 count who have substernal chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, especially if oral thrush is present, and the diagnosis is often made empirically based on symptoms plus response to therapy; definitive diagnosis requires direct endoscopic visualization of lesions with histopathologic demonstration of characteristic Candida yeast forms in tissue and confirmation by fungal culture and speciation. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is usually diagnosed by clinical presentation with demonstration of characteristic blastosphere and hyphal yeast forms in vaginal secretions on potassium hydroxide preparation; culture confirmation is rarely required but may provide supportive information, and self-diagnosis of vulvovaginitis is unreliable, with microscopic and culture confirmation required to avoid unnecessary exposure to treatment and to assess for other potential pathogens including sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### Differential diagnosis of chest symptoms in the athlete [^111igvRy]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common complaint of athletes in all age groups. In athletes, chest pain is often attributed to "chest tightness", and treatment for bronchospasm is considered. However, the causes of the pain are wide and varied, and the pain is referable to the many organ systems that localize to the thorax. Therefore, when treatment with bronchodilators fails, it becomes important to consider other nonasthmatic causes of the pain. These causes can be organized by system and are explained in this article. Cardiac causes are the most feared and, fortunately, are very rare in the adolescent setting. With a thorough knowledge of etiologies of chest pain, the physician can often make a diagnosis with only a history and a physical exam.

Case presentations

Patient A (SARS-CoV-2 infection and de novo pancolitis) was a 25-year-old male who experienced abdominal cramps and a feeling of raised body temperature (unmeasured) for a period of several days. Suddenly, he developed a fever (> 38.3°C) and complained of headaches with a concurrent increase in abdominal cramps and diarrhea. After 3–4 days, he was admitted to the emergency department because of diarrhea with rectal bleeding. Upon admission, the patient was normothermic (36.8°C), but had mild tachycardia and a stool frequency of seven times a day. Laboratory examination showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 6 mg/l (N: < 5 mg/l), hemoglobin level of 8.6 mmol/l (N: > 8.0 mmol/l), and lymphocyte count of 1.4 × 10⁹/l (N: 1.0–4.0 × 10⁹/l). Initial diagnostic work-up with stool cultures and throat swabs was commenced while he received prophylactic low-molecular weight heparins (LMWH) and empirical antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin under suspicion of a gastrointestinal infection. He was re-evaluated 2 days later and had persistent bloody diarrhea, but without respiratory symptoms or fever (36.1°C). New laboratory examination showed an elevated CRP (18 mg/l) and a lymphocyte count of 1.6 × 10 9 /l. A chest X-ray was performed which showed no abnormalities. Prior stool cultures were negative, while both stool, nose, and throat samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing. The patient was diagnosed with infectious diarrhea of unknown origin (potentially SARS-CoV-2 related) and was discharged from the hospital since his frequency of diarrhea decreased. However, he was soon readmitted because of recurrent bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain and cramps. Similar to the previous evaluation, he had no fever and a chest X-ray was normal. Laboratory examination showed leukocytosis (15.4 × 10⁹/l, N: 4.0–10 × 10⁹/l), thrombocytosis (485 × 10⁹/l, N: 100–400 × 10⁹/l), increased fibrinogen (5.8 g/l, N: 2.0–4.0 g/l), elevated CRP (117 mg/l), and negative serology for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Second testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in nose/throat swabs and viral RNA was found in stools. Endoscopic examination was performed and showed a pancolitis corresponding to a Mayo 3 severity score. Biopsies were taken from the terminal ileum and transverse colon (Figure 1). Pathologic findings from colonic biopsies (consisting of chronically active inflammation with epithelial damage, crypt abscesses, micro-abscesses and focal loss of crypt architecture) were compatible with the diagnosis of UC.

### Clinical characteristics on admission predict in-hospital fatal outcome in patients aged ≥ 75 years with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a retrospective cohort study [^111SHBWT]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic and precise fatality data by age group is needed urgently. This study to delineate the clinical characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 patients aged ≥ 75years and identify the risk factors of in-hospital death.

Methods

A total of 141 consecutive patients aged ≥ 75years who were admitted to the hospital between 12th and 19th February 2020. In-hospital death, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings on admission were obtained from medical records. The final follow-up observation was on the 31st March 2020.

Results

The median age was 81years (84 female, 59.6%). Thirty-eight (27%) patients were classified as severe or critical cases. 18 (12.8%) patients had died in hospital and the remaining 123 were discharged. Patients who died were more likely to present with fever (38.9% vs. 7.3%); low percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2) (55.6% vs. 7.3%); reduced lymphocytes (72.2% vs. 35.8%) and platelets (27.8% vs. 4.1%); and increased D-dimer (94.4% vs. 42.3%), creatinine (50.0% vs. 22.0%), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (77.8% vs. 30.1%), high sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) (72.2% vs. 14.6%), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (72.2% vs. 6.5%; all P < 0.05) than patients who recovered. Male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 13.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 160.1, P = 0.044), body temperature > 37.3°C (OR = 80.5, 95% CI 4.6 to 1407.6, P = 0.003), SpO₂ ≤ 90% (OR = 70.1, 95% CI 4.6 to 1060.4, P = 0.002), and NT-proBNP > 1800ng/L (OR = 273.5, 95% CI 14.7 to 5104.8, P < 0.0001) were independent risk factors of in-hospital death.

Conclusions

In-hospital fatality among elderly COVID-19 patients can be estimated by sex and on-admission measurements of body temperature, SpO 2, and NT-proBNP.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^116QNbp2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Symptoms are the trigger that propel individuals with symptoms suspicious of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to seek emergent care for this potentially life‐threatening condition. After 3 decades of research on sex differences in the symptoms of ACS, ample evidence suggests that although sex differences in symptoms exist, they are modest and do not contribute significantly to risk stratification or provide a rationale for diagnostic testing based on sex. In a large prospective study, we found that only 3 of 13 common symptoms were predictive of a diagnosis of ACS versus non‐ACS. The predictive value of shoulder pain (odds ratio: 2.53 [95% CI, 1.29–4.96] versus 1.11 [95% CI, 0.67–1.85]) and arm pain (odds ratio: 2.15 [95% CI, 1.10–4.20] versus 1.21 [95% CI, 0.74–1.99]) for women were nearly twice that of men. Shortness of breath was predictive of a non‐ACS diagnosis for men only. 1

Scores of authors have found some sex differences in symptoms of ACS, 2, 3 but small differences were usually based on frequency and distribution of symptoms, not the type of symptom. In many studies, statistical significance was reached when sex differences were as small as a few percentage points. Kahn et al 4 found, for example, that men reported chest pain more frequently than women (86.3% versus 81%; P = 0.03). We must distinguish between clinical significance (whether the magnitude of difference is large enough to change clinical care) and statistical significance (which is subject to variability in sampling and measurement) in assessing patients for further intervention. A more critical issue than sex differences in symptoms is likely the magnitude of symptom overlap in individuals ruled in and out for ACS. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms suggestive of ACS are actually experiencing ACS, 5, 6 yet the other 85% of patients look so similar that the same diagnostic testing and resources are required to safely rule them out for ACS. Numerous clinical‐decision aids to assess risk for ACS in the ED have been validated over the years, some with 100% sensitivity. 5 Many of these clinical‐decision or prediction rules have facilitated transfer of low‐risk patients to a chest‐pain or clinical‐decision unit or early discharge from the ED. 7

### Chest pain: when in doubt… [^116PdE1V]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical introduction

A 38-year-old Caucasian man presented with central chest heaviness at rest. There was a history of mild abdominal discomfort but no infective prodrome. There was no antecedent exertional or nocturnal chest pain. The patient had a 26-pack-year history of tobacco smoking and no known comorbidities. Recent social history was unremarkable. Examination and vital signs were normal. An ECG taken with mild residual chest discomfort is shown in figure 1A. High-sensitivity troponin I was 74 ng/L, peaking at 1405 ng/L. Echocardiography demonstrated a structurally normal heart with normal biventricular function. Medical therapy for an acute coronary syndrome was commenced and invasive coronary angiography was performed (figure 1B, C).

### Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia elucidate the syndrome [^1145P51z]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can have a dramatic presentation and often an unfortunate outcome. Each episode has the real potential to result in clinical catastrophe. From the > 100 such patients that we see yearly, patients have been selected to illustrate aspects of HIT such as history, epidemiology, clinical features, and improving treatment strategies. Delayed recognition continues to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of these patients. It is not adequate to just stop heparin therapy even with isolated HIT, therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins is contraindicated, and care must be used not to initiate warfarin therapy early or unopposed. A moderate suspicion for HIT should trigger the institution of therapy with an alternative anticoagulant even before laboratory confirmation. The potential beneficial impact of therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors makes it more important to maintain awareness of and vigilance for this syndrome.

A male individual aged 18 years with no significant past medical history presented with fever, headache, dry cough, and chest pain. On clinical examination, he had tachycardia and hypotension needing intravenous fluid resuscitation and inotropic support. A chest radiograph revealed streaky lung opacities, and he was treated with antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia complicated by septic shock. Significant elevation of cardiac enzymes was noted, and there was a continued need for inotropes to maintain normotension. He also developed intermittent bradycardia, with serial electrocardiograms showing first-degree atrioventricular block, low-voltage QRS complexes, and ST-T wave changes and telemetry demonstrating junctional and ventricular escape rhythm. A complete workup for sepsis and acute myocarditis were performed to find the etiologic agent. Intravenous immunoglobulins were started to treat myocarditis, with eventual clinical improvement. He was eventually diagnosed with an unusual etiology for his illness. He was noted to still have intermittent ventricular escape rhythm on electrocardiograms on follow-up 2 weeks after discharge but continues to remain asymptomatic and in good health.

Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a primary increase in whole-body carbon dioxide stores caused by a positive carbon dioxide balance. This acid-base disorder, if severe, may be life-threatening, therefore requiring prompt recognition and expert management. The case presented highlights the essential features of the diagnosis and management of respiratory acidosis. A brief description of the modifiers of carbon dioxide production, the pathogenesis of respiratory acidosis, and an algorithm for assessment and management of this disorder is included. Key teaching points include the clinical value of both arterial and venous blood gas analyses and the importance of proper recognition of a primary respiratory arrest in contrast to primary circulatory arrest when managing a patient who requires resuscitation from "cardiorespiratory arrest".

### Impact of heparin hemodialysis catheter lock on partial thromboplastin time assays in inpatients on therapeutic intravenous heparin [^1126E77T]. Seminars in Dialysis (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The use of heparin 1000 unit/mL HD catheter lock for patients on therapeutic intravenous heparin anticoagulation can lead to significant supratherapeutic increases in PTT assays that can be seen for up to 6 h after administration of the heparin lock. This supratherapeutic anticoagulation may be associated with a higher bleed risk in surgical patients. In patients receiving therapeutic heparin requiring HD catheter lock, citrate or saline lock may be preferable to heparin lock to avoid undesired supratherapeutic anticoagulation in high‐bleed‐risk patients.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 h prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled-out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischaemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 h that increases in intensity during exercise and inspiration. In addition, he has mild fever and an increasing productive cough over the last 3 days. He is haemodynamically stable and the initial physical examination reveals rales over the base of the right lung. ECG shows T-wave inversion in V3–V6, which were already noted on the ECG performed 3 years ago. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. Your intern is about to order blood cultures (plus legionella and pneumococcus antigen in the urine) and prescribe antibiotics when the hs-cTn T level is reported from the laboratory as elevated. Your intern now asks you if the patient needs treatment for pneumonia, NSTEMI, or both.

### Relative lymphocyte count as an indicator of 3-year mortality in elderly people with severe COPD [^1177szmg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, FEV₁ forced expiratory volume at 1 s, FVC forced vital capacity, FEV₁/FVC Tiffeneau, PaO₂ partial arterial oxygen tension, PaCO₂ partial arterial carbon dioxide tension, MI myocardial infarction. Plus-minus values are means ± SD

a Bodymass index is expressed as weight (kg)/height 2 (m) ratio

Lung function indices were significantly lower in patients with relative lymphocyte count ≤ 20%; the greatest difference was evident in FVC, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value. The FEV1/FVC index did not distinguish between groups because both terms in the ratio had reduced by a comparable extent in the two groups (Table 1).

Ischemic heart disease and previous myocardial infarction were less prevalent in patients with relative lymphocyte count ≤ 20% (group 1), while congestive heart failure, diabetes and chronic cor pulmonare were more prevalent in group 1. Neither arterial blood gases nor pharmacologic therapy distinguished between the groups, except for a slightly higher use of mucolytics by patients with a lymphocyte count > 20% (group 2).

Only one patient was lost at the 36-months follow-up time (he was known to be alive at 25th month follow up) and was censored. Mean follow-up time was 22 months, with 118 deaths. One- and 3-year survival rates were 67 and 42.2%, respectively. Patients died from acute or chronic respiratory failure [34 (27%)], acute myocardial infarction [31 (25%)], stroke [21 (17%)], cor pulmonare [12 (10%)], respiratory infections [10 (8%)], cancer [9 (7%)], sudden death [4 (3%)], or other causes [5 (4%)].

Low relative lymphocyte count at baseline was associated with an increased incidence of death from any causes [58 (68%) vs. 68 (51%); p = 0.0012] (data not shown).

Acute chest pain in sickle cell disease — management and diagnostic evaluation are specified as follows: in patients with sickle cell disease who report acute chest pain, emergency transfer by EMS to an acute care setting is recommended, and in patients with sickle cell disease who report acute chest pain, ACS should be excluded. In supporting text, in patients with sickle cell disease who experience chest pain, ACS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and these patients should be transferred to an acute care setting by EMS when there is clinical suspicion of ACS. For diagnostic workup when acute chest syndrome is a concern, the recommended evaluation includes an ECG, troponin test, complete blood count with white blood cell differential, reticulocyte count, anteroposterior and lateral chest radiograph, and blood and sputum cultures.

Women with chest pain — Most patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain are women, particularly among those ≥ 65 years of age, and women are less likely to have timely and appropriate care. Women may present with accompanying symptoms (eg, nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath) more often than men, yet chest pain remains the predominant symptom among those ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), occurring with a frequency equal to men. Traditional risk score tools and physician assessments often underestimate risk in women and misclassify them as having nonischemic chest pain. In the VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients) study, men and women ≤ 55 years of age were equally likely to present with chest pain, and women were more likely to report ≥ 3 associated symptoms than men.

### Nontraumatic thoracic emergencies [^115mJgyB]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain is one of the most common complaints of patients who present to an emergency department, and accounts for up to 5% of all visits. It also is one of the most complex issues in an emergency setting because, although clinical signs and symptoms often are nonspecific, rapid diagnosis and therapy are of great importance. The chest radiograph remains an important component of the evaluation of chest pain, and usually is the first examination to be obtained. Nevertheless, cross-sectional imaging has added greatly to the ability to characterize the wide constellation of clinical findings into a distinct etiology. This article reviews how the various entities that can present as nontraumatic chest pain can manifest radiographically.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^116A5a9L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Many researchers have reported that upper back pain and fatigue are commonly reported symptoms during ACS, and up to 30% of patients do not experience chest pain. 19, 20 This information is important to consider as we try to differentiate patients who will be ruled in compared with those ruled out for ACS. We found that although chest pain is a sensitive symptom for ACS, it is not very specific (Table). 1 In fact, few other symptoms were sensitive or specific for a diagnosis of ACS. In our multicenter prospective study, we found few symptom differences between patients with and without ACS presenting to the ED. 13 Ferry et al 8 defined chest pain as all descriptors of chest symptoms, including pressure or discomfort. Their rationale was that terms other than pain are "functions of sex‐related language rather than symptom differences in symptom presentation". This is an opinion that is counterproductive to science and accurate assessment of symptoms, which are, by definition, subjective and what the patient says they are.

Table 1
Sensitivity and Specificity of Symptoms for ACS by Sex 1

We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we are at risk of having study results such as those of Ferry et al, 8 that vary from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for ACS.

Clinical Introduction

A 28-year-old man with extensive travel history to developing countries was hospitalised for intermittent sharp chest pains, worst when supine and with inspiration. Two weeks prior to presentation, he had suffered a flu-like illness with a sore throat, which was resolving. Physical examination was notable for mild fever and tachycardia with cervical lymphadenopathy and painful bilateral knee and wrist effusions. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a soft early-peaking systolic murmur over the aortic area with a decrescendo early diastolic murmur along the left sternal edge. There was mild leucocytosis, elevation of serum troponin and acute-phase reactants with an ECG showing sinus tachycardia. Echocardiographic windows were extremely limited but suggested the presence of pericardial effusion and aortic regurgitation. Cardiac MRI was performed (figure 1). Viral, microbiological and autoimmune testing was remarkable only for significant elevation of antistreptolysin-O titres (1450IU rising to 1940IU, normal < 200IU). Pericardiocentesis revealed an exudative effusion, which was negative by cytology and microbiological analysis, including for tuberculosis and fungi.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^114SdugS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and factor Xa.

Subcutaneous LMWH and fixed dosed heparin require laboratory monitoring. For patients on therapeutic UFH, serial monitoring of (PTT; also known as APTT) or factor Xa is suggested. The benefit of monitoring IV heparin once a therapeutic threshold has been exceeded is not well defined.

Anticoagulation Forum and American College of Chest Physicians both recommend monitoring anti-Xa levels to monitor UFH because of baseline artefactual abnormalities in PTT and a potential for heparin resistance. None of the guidelines recommend dosing of LMWHs based on anti-Xa levels given lack of evidence on outcomes for thrombosis or bleeding. Body weight–adjusted doses for LMWH appear safer, which may be particularly effective in overweight patients. Elevated PT or PTT is not a contraindication to thromboprophylaxis in the absence of active bleeding. A platelet count < 25 × 10⁹/L or fibrinogen < 0.5 g/L constitutes a bleeding risk, warranting holding of standard dose VTE prophylaxis, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation should be withheld if platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L or fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L.

The role of serial hemoglobin monitoring in COVID-19 patients on therapeutic anticoagulation is poorly defined.

We found no data from LMICs regarding the diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Speculative explanations for this finding include limited availability of laboratory assays for serological confirmation of HIT, expense associated with using nonheparin anticoagulants, and a lack of awareness of the guidelines.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

A study from Nigeria identified the inability to monitor as a primary reason for reduced clinician adherence to anticoagulation guidelines. In a separate multicenter survey from six southeastern Nigerian tertiary hospitals, most respondents were able to recognize PT and APTT, but not anti-Xa assay, as laboratory monitoring tools for anticoagulation therapy. This finding correlated with heparin and warfarin as the most commonly administered anticoagulants among respondents.

D -dimer testing might not be readily available in some LMICs and likely would incur a higher cost, although specific pricing in various LMIC environments remains unclear. Early COVID-19 studies suggest wide use of these tests in China, an upper middle-income country.

### High-sensitivity troponin elevation in a young woman with typical chest pain: the heart of the matter [^115jGwku]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the era of high-sensitivity troponin, minor elevations are often attributed to noncardiac etiologies. However, in patients who present with characteristic symptoms, any troponin elevation is concerning. We detail a case of a 37-y-old woman who presented to an outside hospital with typical chest pain and had a mild elevation in high-sensitivity troponin. Given her overall stability, she was discharged with outpatient cardiology follow-up. ⁸²Rb PET/CT myocardial perfusion imaging test demonstrated a large, reversible anteroseptal perfusion defect. Coronary angiography revealed severe (80%) stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery treated with a single stent. This case highlights the need to have a high index of suspicion in young people with minor troponin elevations and pursue timely imaging.

### A 44-year-old woman with chest pain and dyspnea [^113jkhba]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome complicated by recurrent pulmonary emboli with subsequent chronic hypoxic respiratory failure (3 L/min oxygen baseline) presented to the ED with 2 to 3 weeks of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain that radiated to the center of her back. These symptoms were accompanied by an increase in her oxygen requirement from 3 L/min to 6 L/min. She also reported nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, and dizziness for the same period. The patient had two prior pulmonary emboli in the same year, which prompted a hypercoagulable workup, ultimately revealing a diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. The second pulmonary embolus occurred while the patient was on coumadin, though achieving a therapeutic international normalized ratio was challenging. At the recommendation of the Hematology Department, she was transitioned to systemic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg twice daily, which was her regimen at the time of admission. The patient confirmed total compliance with her anticoagulation therapy, and she denied any recent travel or long periods of being sedentary. She was up to date on her age-appropriate cancer screening, without any evidence of active malignancy.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain", a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

### Exercise-induced chest pain: an atypical manifestation of eosinophilic esophagitis [^114tDPEu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic-inflammatory immune-mediated disease of the esophagus. The most common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis are dysphagia for solids and bolus obstruction. Approximately half of the patients complain about spontaneously occurring chest pain. However, some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis suffer from, in addition to the described symptoms, exercise-induced chest pain.

Methods and Results

Here we report on several patients presenting with exercise-induced chest pain, with 2 patients presenting exclusively only with this symptom. After a comprehensive evaluation including exclusion of gastroesophageal reflux disease and heart disease, a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis based on endoscopical and histological criteria was unequivocally established. The condition improved rapidly after initiation of a treatment with topical corticosteroids.

Conclusion

Eosinophilic esophagitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with exercise-induced chest pain, particularly in younger male individuals.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111Ge6pq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Laboratory and Radiology Findings

Hemoglobin was 13.6 g/dL, WBC count 5,400/μL, and platelets 320,000/μL, and CD4 count was 594 cells/μL. Creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL. Serum venereal disease research laboratory was negative. Blood culture and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, though the services were available at the hospital, were not requested. Additional blood tests such as C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, and Epstein Barr virus viral load were not available, and the patient was unable to pay for these tests to be performed elsewhere.

Results of the ECG were normal. A Doppler ultrasound scan of the right neck mass showed a 6 cm × 6 cm pseudoaneurysm with a clot in the lumen. A chest radiograph showed a left paratracheal mass in the superior mediastinum causing tracheal deviation to the right. The lung fields were normal, and no other chest pathology was noted on the radiograph (Fig 1).

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation should focus on ruling out life-threatening illnesses such as acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism, which are often not indicated by pain severity. Response to nitroglycerin is not an accurate means of ruling in cardiac chest pain. Patients with diabetes mellitus, women, and older patients more often present with associated nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath. ACS should be considered when patients older than 75 years present with shortness of breath, syncope, mental impairment, or abdominal pain, or if they experience an unexplained fall. Physical examination can sometimes demonstrate life-threatening causes of chest pain, including diaphoresis and tachypnea suggesting ACS, tachycardia and dyspnea suggesting pulmonary embolism, and subcutaneous emphysema suggesting esophageal rupture. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration suggests a noncardiac etiology.

Anatomic testing with CCTA and invasive coronary angiography demonstrates the extent of obstructive disease. Adding a calculation of fractional flow reserve with computed tomography to CCTA provides an estimation of lesion-specific ischemia. Invasive coronary angiography identifies obstructive stenosis and allows revascularization. CCTA has an effective dose of 3 to 5 mSv, compared with 4 to 10 mSv for angiography. CCTA without stenosis or plaque has a warranty period of two years for similar symptom frequency and negative troponin testing. For patients without known CAD at intermediate risk, CCTA is recommended with a negative or inconclusive ACS workup and for patients with a mildly abnormal stress test within the past year. CCTA allows for rapid diagnosis and discharge with similar outcomes as stress testing. CCTA decreases time to diagnosis by 50% compared with nuclear stress testing. Negative stress testing rules out the need for anatomic testing.

Exercise ECG testing and stress echocardiography are most likely to reduce length of stay. Intermediate-risk patients with known CAD and acute chest pain should have blood pressure and cholesterol management maximized before additional testing. CCTA can document CAD progression in patients with previous testing demonstrating nonobstructive lesions. Patients with a history of high-risk CAD or worsening frequency of symptoms who have optimized blood pressure and cholesterol management should be evaluated with invasive coronary angiography. High-risk patients with acute chest pain should receive invasive coronary angiography.

A meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the role of previous chest pain in diagnosing ACS concluded that chest pain that is pleuritic, positional, or reproducible with palpation and not related to exertion is low risk for ACS. Pain that is described as pressure, worse than prior anginal pain, associated with exertion, accompanied by nausea or diaphoresis, and/or radiates to one or both arms/shoulders is higher risk for ACS. 19, 20 Patients with a score of less than 2 have only a 2% chance of having CAD, whereas 43% of patients with a score of 2 or more have CAD, making the test useful for ruling out CAD as a cause of the patient's chest pain.
20. 31, 32 There are no useful physical examination maneuvers or standard tests to establish the diagnosis or to support or rule it out.

A one-week trial of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor is modestly sensitive and specific for GERD, with a 50% reduction in reflux symptoms being moderately accurate for a final diagnosis of GERD. 33 ACS symptoms can often be mistaken for those of GERD; if clinical suspicion is high for ACS, an ECG should be obtained. Less Common, but Important, Diagnostic Considerations PERICARDITIS Pericarditis manifests as a clinical triad of pleuritic chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, and diffuse ECG ST–T-wave changes often preceded by a viral illness. 36 Acute pericarditis should be considered in patients presenting with new-onset chest pain that increases with inspiration or when reclining and is lessened by leaning forward. 36 ECG usually demonstrates diffuse ST segment elevation and PR interval depression. HEART FAILURE Most patients with heart failure present with dyspnea on exertion, although some will present with chest pain.

41 Clinical impression is predictive of heart failure, as is pulmonary edema on chest radiography. 41 Patients with acute dyspnea and one or more of the MICE criteria likely have heart failure and should be evaluated with echocardiography. 42, 43.

### Costochondritis: rapid evidence review… [^112oxpxN]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Costochondritis is a commonly encountered condition in primary care that is characterized by chest wall pain from inflammation in the costochondral joints. It most commonly occurs in adults 40 to 50 years of age. This article reviews the best available patient-oriented evidence for costochondritis. 3, 4 Approximately 1% to 3% of all ambulatory visits in the primary care setting are for chest pain. 5–11Of these, chest wall pain accounts for 20% to 50%. 1, 5–12Costochondritis in particular accounts for 6% to 13%. 6, 10, 11. In emergency departments, chest pain accounts for 9% to 10% of visits, with musculoskeletal causes accounting for 15% to 45% of noncardiac chest pain. 13–15. Treatment PHYSICAL MODALITIES A targeted stretching program under the direction of a physical therapist demonstrated a small reduction in pain among a group of patients who had symptoms for more than one year. 47 Local application of heat is often recommended but lacks evidence from clinical trials.

A period of rest from activities that exacerbate pain is often recommended.
31. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Acupuncture has been used for treatment, but no randomized, controlled studies for effectiveness are available. 49 OTHER TREATMENT In one small prospective observational study, localized ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection at the affected costochondral junction resulted in clinical and sonographic improvements among the convenience-sampled group of nine patients with Tietze syndrome, which had not improved with conservative treatment after at least three months. 50There is inadequate evidence supporting corticosteroid injection specifically for costochondritis, so it should be considered only for patients whose symptoms do not improve with traditional therapies. Prognosis This article updates a previous article on this topic by Proulx and Zryd.

3 Data Sources: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key terms costochondritis, chest pain, chest wall pain, and Tietze's syndrome. Also searched were Essential Evidence Plus, Clinical Evidence, Google Scholar, Trip Database, and the Cochrane database. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also searched.
