Venous insufficiency

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about chronic venous insufficiency management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its pathophysiology. Then, I should classify severity and risk stratify. Next, I will review diagnostic evaluation, especially duplex ultrasound. After that, I will examine conservative therapy, including compression, exercise, and pharmacologic options. Then, I should consider interventional treatments for superficial and deep venous disease, including perforator and iliac outflow issues. Finally, I will integrate special populations, follow-up, and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Chronic venous insufficiency is characterized by impaired venous return with sustained venous hypertension due to valve dysfunction, venous obstruction, or both, leading to reflux and downstream sequelae such as edema, pain, skin changes, and ulcers, with an incidence around 92 per 100,000 person-years in the US and risk factors including prior DVT, obesity, older age, and sedentary lifestyle [^114eiJGq].

> I need to check the severity framework next. The CEAP classification remains the standard for clinical audit and research, and I should pair it with r-VCSS for grading and the Villalta scale when post-thrombotic syndrome is suspected. Wait, let me verify that r-VCSS is indeed the revised version endorsed for severity grading and treatment response assessment, which ESVS confirms, and I should also remember that PTS assessment requires the Villalta scale rather than VCSS alone [^1135zm4N] [^113BS5pe].

> Next, I should review diagnostics, and I must not jump to conclusions without anchoring on imaging. Full lower limb venous duplex ultrasound is the primary modality for diagnosis and treatment planning, and I should confirm that this is a strong recommendation across contemporary guidelines; I also need to ensure I screen for arterial disease with ABI when ulcers are present or when pulses are diminished, because compression can be harmful in significant arterial disease [^113dFEH9] [^114dZ1Qb].

> Now, conservative therapy: compression is the cornerstone, but I should double-check the pressure ranges. For symptomatic CVD, at least 15 mmHg at the ankle is advised, while for edema (CEAP C3) and advanced disease, 20–40 mmHg is recommended. Hold on, I should verify whether higher pressures universally outperform 10–20 mmHg — meta-analytic data suggest 10–20 mmHg is effective and higher may not add benefit for occupational leg symptoms, so I should individualize pressure to tolerance and severity rather than reflexively escalate [^114THCt7] [^115criNf] [^112gSZCT].

> Exercise is often recommended, but wait, let me verify the evidence quality. ESVS advises exercise to reduce venous symptoms, yet Cochrane reviews consistently conclude that evidence is limited and very low certainty, so I should frame exercise as adjunctive with plausible calf-muscle pump benefit while acknowledging uncertainty and encouraging adherence to compression and weight management as higher-certainty pillars [^113ptkmq] [^1154Kg1k] [^116hK4y5].

> Pharmacologic therapy can help selected patients, and I should confirm which agents have supportive guidance. ESVS suggests considering venoactive drugs to reduce symptoms and edema in symptomatic patients not undergoing or awaiting intervention, and I should remember that calcium dobesilate has meta-analytic support for symptom and edema reduction, albeit with low-to-moderate certainty and rare hematologic adverse effects; horse-chestnut seed extract shows signal for edema reduction in some trials, but I need to emphasize heterogeneity and the need for caution pending stronger data [^115DuKfa] [^1158fthe] [^115oY423].

> For superficial venous incompetence, I should confirm first-line interventional therapy. Endovenous thermal ablation is recommended as first choice for great saphenous and small saphenous vein incompetence, with alternatives including ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and, when non-thermal non-tumescent approaches are preferred, cyanoacrylate adhesive closure; hold on, I should verify device selection — ESVS notes device choice is at physician discretion, and network meta-analyses suggest favorable anatomic success with cyanoacrylate, though comparative effectiveness across modern modalities is nuanced and operator-dependent [^115zBEVV] [^114kUZYP] [^1165phB8] [^116GX9RD] [^111AAanC] [^112pmVqn].

> I will now examine indications by CEAP class so I don't overgeneralize. For symptomatic varicose veins without skin changes (C2S), interventional treatment is reasonable. For skin changes (C4–C6), treatment is recommended. But wait, I should verify perforator management — do not treat perforators in most patients with varicose veins without skin changes, yet consider ablation when incompetent perforators are thought significant in advanced skin changes or nonhealing ulcers, ideally alongside superficial ablation rather than in isolation [^116C5YMA] [^115YLkhg] [^11587fZ7] [^112aEPkB] [^111gLNuJ].

> For deep venous disease, I need to ensure I separate reflux from obstruction. In iliac vein outflow obstruction with severe symptoms or ulcers, endovascular stenting is first-line. Let me double-check adjuncts — intravascular ultrasound can guide sizing and lesion assessment, and duplex surveillance at 1 day and 2 weeks post-procedure is advised with ongoing intervals. For extensive axial deep venous reflux, surgical valve repair in specialized centers may be considered after conservative failure, acknowledging low-to-very low certainty evidence and the need for careful patient selection [^113VFrrX] [^114uN3wo] [^113Lu9kY] [^1154z5yS] [^116Z7ha4].

> But wait, what about combined disease and post-thrombotic syndrome nuances. In combined superficial and deep incompetence, treating superficial veins can still be beneficial, and in PTS, below-knee 20–40 mmHg compression is recommended, with consideration of adjuvant intermittent pneumatic compression. I should confirm that these are conditional recommendations and tailor to edema control and symptom response [^116Lz4B9] [^117TyMRK] [^113WCjC4].

> Special populations require tailored counseling, and I need to check each point. Obesity warrants weight-loss advice to improve venous outcomes; older adults have higher prevalence and may need simplified compression strategies to enhance adherence; I should also remember the venous–lymphatic interdependence — advanced CVI often represents combined venous–lymphatic insufficiency, which explains refractory edema and informs expectations with compression and lymphedema therapy [^113jqbUr] [^113Et42T] [^116r6CiT].

> Post-intervention care is easy to overlook, so I should double-check compression protocols. After saphenous ablation or stripping, immediate postprocedural compression is advised, with duration individualized; after sclerotherapy, compression can improve outcomes; for post-thermal ablation, many centers use 20–30 mmHg for about a week, but best practice is to individualize based on edema, pain, and procedural extent; I need to ensure duplex surveillance 1–4 weeks after saphenous trunk treatment and at defined intervals after iliac procedures [^114Mtc65] [^116cQcmH] [^111YeNGT] [^1152GWrp] [^115JM7G4] [^114k3LHZ] [^113Lu9kY].

> Recurrent varicose veins deserve a structured approach, and I should verify options. For symptomatic recurrence without truncal incompetence, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and/or ambulatory phlebectomy are reasonable; for recurrence due to saphenous reflux, endovenous thermal ablation or foam sclerotherapy with or without phlebectomy are appropriate; hold on, I should confirm that these are conditional recommendations aligned with symptom severity and duplex findings [^114WK4JL] [^115qFvA8].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Start with CEAP classification and r-VCSS, obtain duplex ultrasound, and screen for arterial disease when indicated. For C1–C2 disease, prioritize compression, exercise, weight management, and consider venoactive drugs if symptoms persist. For C3–C6 disease, add compression 20–40 mmHg, meticulous skin care, and escalate to superficial venous ablation or sclerotherapy, reserving perforator treatment for selected advanced cases. For suspected iliac obstruction or refractory PTS features, pursue IVUS-guided endovascular stenting in experienced centers. Throughout, embed follow-up duplex and adjust compression to tolerance and response, documenting outcomes with CEAP/r-VCSS to close the loop [^1135zm4N] [^113dFEH9] [^114THCt7] [^115criNf] [^115YLkhg] [^113VFrrX] [^114k3LHZ].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways so I don't overstate uncertain areas. Compression remains the most consistently supported therapy across severities, with pressure tailored to edema and tolerance. Exercise is reasonable and guideline-endorsed but evidence quality is low. Interventional therapy for superficial reflux is highly effective with multiple safe modalities. Deep venous obstruction responds well to stenting in selected patients, whereas deep reflux surgery remains reserved for specialized centers and refractory cases. And structured follow-up with CEAP/r-VCSS and duplex surveillance is essential to sustain outcomes and manage recurrence [^114THCt7] [^115criNf] [^113ptkmq] [^1154Kg1k] [^115zBEVV] [^113VFrrX] [^1135zm4N] [^114k3LHZ].

---

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is best managed with **compression therapy as first-line** [^114THCt7] to reduce edema and symptoms, with **endovenous ablation** for reflux and stenting for obstruction when conservative measures fail [^115zBEVV] [^113VFrrX] [^115MuoNG]. Exercise and weight loss are adjuncts [^113ptkmq] [^113jqbUr]; venoactive drugs may help symptoms but not ulcer healing [^115DuKfa]. Ulcer care requires **compression plus moist dressings** and debridement; surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^114auACD]. Recurrence is common without ongoing compression and risk-factor control, so patient education and adherence are essential [^113SUdYh].

---

## Pathophysiology

CVI arises from **venous valve incompetence**, venous obstruction, or both, causing venous hypertension and reflux [^114eiJGq]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Valvular incompetence**: Primary (congenital) or secondary (post-thrombotic) valve failure causes reflux and venous hypertension [^114eiJGq].

- **Venous obstruction**: Thrombotic or non-thrombotic iliac vein compression (e.g. May-Thurner) impairs outflow, worsening reflux and symptoms [^notfound].

- **Calf muscle pump dysfunction**: Reduced ankle mobility or inactivity impairs venous return, promoting edema and skin changes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and classification

CVI spans **telangiectasias to venous ulcers**; the **CEAP classification** standardizes severity:

| **Ceap class** | **Clinical description** |
|-|-|
| C0 | No visible or palpable signs |
| C1 | Telangiectasias or reticular veins |
| C2 | Varicose veins |
| C3 | Edema without skin changes |
| C4 | Skin changes (pigmentation, eczema) |
| C5 | Healed venous ulcer |
| C6 | Active venous ulcer |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment plus duplex ultrasound** [^113dFEH9] to define reflux and obstruction; additional tests are used selectively:

- **Duplex ultrasound**: First-line to assess reflux, obstruction, and perforator incompetence [^113dFEH9].

- **Venography/IVUS**: For suspected iliac vein obstruction or stent planning [^114uN3wo].

- **Ankle-brachial index (ABI)**: To exclude arterial disease before compression [^114dZ1Qb].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative therapy is foundational, particularly for early disease and as an adjunct to interventions [^114auACD]:

- **Compression therapy**: 20–40 mmHg stockings or bandages reduce edema and symptoms; first-line for C3–C6 [^115criNf] [^114THCt7].

- **Exercise and weight loss**: Improve calf pump function and reduce symptoms [^113ptkmq].

- **Leg elevation**: Reduces edema and improves comfort.

- **Venoactive drugs**: Micronized flavonoids or calcium dobesilate may reduce edema and symptoms but not ulcer healing [^115DuKfa] [^1158fthe].

---

## Interventional and surgical treatments

Interventions are indicated for symptomatic reflux or obstruction refractory to conservative therapy [^115eKBBa]:

- **Endovenous thermal ablation**: First-line for great/small saphenous reflux (radiofrequency or laser) [^115zBEVV] [^114kUZYP].

- **Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy**: Alternative for truncal or tributary reflux, especially when thermal ablation is unsuitable [^1165phB8] [^111yiVYU].

- **Cyanoacrylate closure**: Non-thermal option for great saphenous reflux [^116GX9RD].

- **Perforator vein treatment**: Endovenous ablation or ligation for incompetent perforators with skin changes or ulcers [^112aEPkB] [^111gLNuJ].

- **Deep venous interventions**: Valvuloplasty or stenting for severe deep reflux or obstruction in specialized centers [^1154z5yS] [^11465kga].

---

## Management of venous ulcers

Ulcer care centers on **compression plus local wound measures**:

- **Compression therapy**: 30–40 mmHg stockings or bandages are essential for healing and recurrence prevention [^114auACD].

- **Wound care**: Moist dressings, debridement, and infection control.

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Pentoxifylline or micronized flavonoids may aid healing when added to compression [^116oE8dq].

- **Surgical interventions**: Skin grafting or perforator ablation for refractory ulcers [^111gLNuJ].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

CVI is **chronic and progressive**; recurrence is common without ongoing compression and risk-factor control. Key predictors include severity at presentation, obesity, and post-thrombotic syndrome [^notfound]. Long-term compression and lifestyle changes reduce recurrence and improve quality of life [^114auACD].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Emerging options include **endovenous non-thermal ablation** (e.g. mechanochemical, cyanoacrylate) and biologic agents targeting venous inflammation and remodeling; ongoing trials aim to refine patient selection and durability [^117PLVuy] [^115MuoNG].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Education on compression use, weight control, and activity improves outcomes; **adherence to compression** is critical for symptom control and ulcer prevention [^113SUdYh].

---

CVI management is **multidisciplinary**, with compression as the cornerstone and interventions tailored to reflux or obstruction. Persistent symptoms or ulcers warrant specialist referral for advanced therapies.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, operative techniques, safety, and efficacy outcomes of procedures aimed at correcting deep venous reflux, in patients with chronic venous insufficiency.

Methods

We performed systematic literature searches in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from databases' inception to February 2022. We included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies describing surgical procedures to treat patients with deep reflux due to primary and secondary incompetence, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Proportion meta-analyses were performed for all the efficacy and safety outcomes.

Results

We included 57 studies in the quantitative synthesis: three randomized controlled trials including 252 patients and 54 case series including 4004 patients. Studies included a median of 38 patients, with a mean age of 51 years; 52% of them were males. Forty percent of studies included 2291 patients with primary incompetence, 29% of studies included 595 patients with PTS, and 31% of studies included 1118 patients with both diseases. As for primary incompetence, pooled estimates for all procedures showed an 89% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%-94%) of ulcer healing, 10% (95% CI, 4%-18%) ulcer recurrence, 98% (95% CI, 93%-100%) valve patency, 84% (95% CI, 78%-90%) valve competence, 0.05% (1/1904 patients) pulmonary embolism, 1% (95% CI, 0%-3%) wound infections, 5% (95% CI, 1%-9%) hematoma, 2% (95% CI, 0%-6%) lymphocele, 2% (95% CI, 1%-4%) thrombosis, 85% (95% CI, 74%-94%) pain improvement, 89% (95% CI, 65%-100%) edema improvement, and 85% (95% CI, 73%-93%) lipodermatosclerosis improvement. Patients with PTS showed less favorable outcomes: 82% (95% CI, 71%-91%) of ulcer healing, 18% (95% CI, 5%-36%) ulcer recurrence, 88% (95% CI, 78%-96%) valve patency, 78% (95% CI, 66%-88%) valve competence, no pulmonary embolism, 6% (95% CI, 0%-22%) wound infections, 6% (95% CI, 3%-10%) hematoma, 5% (95% CI, 1%-12%) lymphocele, 7% (95% CI, 1%-16%) thrombosis, 79% (95% CI, 59%-94%) pain improvement, 75% (95% CI, 61%-88%) edema improvement, and 64% (95% CI, 9%-100%) lipodermatosclerosis improvement.

Conclusions

The number of studies included in each meta-analysis are limited, and knowing how this element can affect the statistical power, as well as the absence of comparative control groups, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, deep venous reconstructive surgery for reflux may increase the probability of clinical improvement in patients affected by chronic venous insufficiency. Outcomes appear to be satisfactory even if possible adjunctive procedures may be required over the course of the patient's lifetime. Consequently, a strict follow-up protocol is required to maintain outcomes. Further studies are required to evaluate deep venous reconstructive surgery for reflux particularly as to how it compares with the more recently introduced endovenous approaches.

### Horse-chestnut seed extract for chronic venous insufficiency… [^115oY423]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Therapeutic response to mechanical compression for chronic venous insufficiency is often less than expected because of poor compliance. For this reason, an oral therapy would be desirable. Horse-chestnut seed extract has been studied mainly in Europe as a possible oral therapy for chronic venous insufficiency. It may work by preventing leukocyte activation, which is considered a pathophysiologic mechanism of chronic venous insufficiency. Pittler and Ernst conducted a literature review to evaluate the evidence for or against the use of this compound for venous insufficiency. The findings of the placebo-controlled trials suggested that treatment with horse-chestnut seed extract produced a decrease in lower-leg volume and calf and ankle circumference. Edema provocation before and after the treatment period revealed protective effects against edema. One study demonstrated a 22 percent decrease in the capillary filtration rate in patients who received horse-chestnut seed extract.

Similarly, all five of the randomized control trials against reference medications demonstrated evidence for the effectiveness of horse-chestnut seed extract in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. One trial that compared the herbal medication to compression stockings suggested a therapeutic equivalence, but the authors noted that this trial was not properly blinded, so bias may have affected the results. Data from the studies showed that therapeutic benefit was derived from doses of horse-chestnut seed extract standardized to 100 to 150 mg of escin daily. In two of the placebo-controlled studies, daily doses of 100 mg of escin resulted in a significant reduction in the mean leg volume after two weeks of therapy. In another study, the effects of treatment were noted to persist: at the end of a six-week follow-up period the mean leg volume was not significantly different from that immediately after treatment.

The authors note that many experts remain skeptical about the effectiveness of horse-chestnut seed extract for chronic venous insufficiency. Most of the studies the authors analyzed were from German investigators. Further trials are needed. If further studies substantiate the benefits of horse-chestnut seed extract, its postulated mechanism of action might generate interest in other forms of drug therapy.

### Chronic venous disease. part 2: diagnosis and treatment [^115eKBBa]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a common medical condition that results from venous hypertension of the limbs, leading to significant morbidity. The diagnosis is quite straightforward from patient history and obvious clinical manifestations. In the recent past, the availability of various invasive and noninvasive treatments has assisted in evaluation of such cases. Although compression therapy is the mainstay of management, newer surgical and other interventional techniques are now being considered for patients who do not respond to conventional medical management. The second part of this two-part review article will outline a diagnostic approach in cases of CVD and discuss the management principles encompassing conservative, pharmacological and interventional options.

### The evidence supporting treatment of reflux and obstruction in chronic venous disease [^112t84yT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

On July 20, 2016, a Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee panel convened to assess the evidence supporting treatment of chronic venous disease. Several societies addressed the questions posed to the panel. A multidisciplinary coalition, representing nine societies of venous specialists, reviewed the literature and presented a consensus opinion regarding the panel questions. The purpose of this paper is to present our coalition's consensus review of the literature and recommendations for chronic venous disease.

### Compression stockings and venous function… [^1125VEZu]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Air plethysmography values in patients with and without stockings, subdivided by cause of chronic venous insufficiency; Asterisks indicate P <. 05, which refers to differences between patients with a primary and those with a secondary cause of CVI with stockings on. THE TREATMENT of chronic venous insufficiency traditionally involves the wearing of surgical support compression stockings, intermittent leg elevation, and an exercise program that stimulates the calf muscle pump mechanism. Despite the fact that such a program is successful in greater than 95% of patients when patients are compliant, the exact effect of surgical compression stockings is largely unknown. The amount of blood in the leg is called the venous volume; the rate of filling of the leg during standing is determined by the venous filling time until 90% VV is reached and the venous filling index; the amount of blood ejected from the leg.

In patients in CEAP 4, VV, VFT90, and EV were statistically significantly higher than in patients in CEAP 5. Older patients were found to have statistically greater VV, VFI, VFIS, EF, RV, RVF, and OF. Additionally, the timing of the study influenced RV, with a clear increase in RV noted during the course of the study. Others have addressed the issue of surgical support stockings, exercise, and the changes on APG testing. In 22 patients with superficial venous insufficiency and 9 patients with deep venous insufficiency, the elastic support of thigh-high stockings with the ankle compression targeted at 18 to 27 mm Hg was evaluated.

7 This support resulted in a significant VV reduction in patients with superficial venous insufficiency but not in those with deep venous insufficiency; a significant increase in VFT90 and decrease in VFI in both groups; EV did not change in the group with superficial venous insufficiency but it did change in the group with deep venous insufficiency; and the EF improved in both groups. The RV was decreased by the application of the stockings for superficial venous insufficiency only, while the RVF was reduced in both groups. 7 In another study, lightweight surgical compression decreased reflux and increased EF in women with moderate varicose veins, 12 while in 2 other studies.

### Appropriateness of care in superficial venous disease [^113Lxd19]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic superficial venous disease, including superficial venous insufficiency, superficial venous thrombosis, and aneurysms, are prevalent conditions that affect millions of individuals worldwide. With chronic venous insufficiency specifically, the advent of office-based minimally invasive procedures in recent decades has significantly expanded access to outpatient treatment. However, as venous insufficiency is rarely life- or limb-threatening, the clinical diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment indications should be considered carefully when recommending elective intervention. Appropriateness of care guidelines intend to aid providers and patients in the decision-making process, based on the available evidence in the scientific literature, to select the best care for the patient when treating their superficial venous disease.

### Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency [^115Zb55g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction or a combination of these symptoms, with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It places a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) may be a relatively cheap and efficient way to deliver physiotherapy to people with CVI. This is an update of a review first published in 2019.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 28 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy to no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. disease severity, 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 3.

Adverse Effects

Our secondary outcomes were 1. pain, 2. oedema, 3. leg ulcer incidence and 4. skin pigmentation changes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1126 participants with CVI. Seven studies evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment, one study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis), and one study evaluated balneotherapy versus dryland exercises. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence due to a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, participant-reported outcomes and imprecision. Balneotherapy versus no treatment Balneotherapy compared to no treatment probably results in slightly improved disease severity signs and symptoms scores as assessed by the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS; mean difference (MD) -1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.02 to -0.49; 3 studies, 671 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared to no treatment may improve HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire 2 (CIVIQ2) at three months, but we are very uncertain about the results (MD -10.46, 95% CI -19.21 to -1.71; 2 studies, 153 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The intervention may improve HRQoL at 12 months (MD -4.48, 95% CI -8.61 to -0.36; 2 studies, 417 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if the intervention has an effect at six months (MD -2.99, 95% CI -6.53 to 0.56; 2 studies, 436 participants; low-certainty evidence) or nine months (MD -6.40, 95% CI -13.84 to 1.04; 1 study, 59 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the occurrence of adverse effects. The main adverse effects were thromboembolic events (odds radio (OR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; low-certainty evidence), erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; low-certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study, 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported any serious adverse effects. Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may improve pain scores slightly at three months (MD -1.12, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.88; 2 studies, 354 participants; low-certainty evidence); and six months (MD -1.02, 95% CI -1.25 to -0.78; 2 studies, 352 participants; low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on oedema (measured by leg circumference) at 24 days to three months, but we are very uncertain about the results (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32 cm, 95% CI -0.70 to 1.34; 3 studies, 369 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the incidence of leg ulcers at 12 months, but we are very uncertain about the results (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.14; 2 studies, 449 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may slightly reduce skin pigmentation changes as measured by the pigmentation index at 12 months (MD -3.60, 95% CI -5.95 to -1.25; 1 study, 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy versus melilotus officinalis For the comparison balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis), there was little or no difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but we are very uncertain about the results. The study reported no other outcomes of interest. Balneotherapy versus dryland exercise For the comparison balneotherapy versus dryland exercise, evidence from one study showed that balneotherapy may improve HRQoL as assessed by the Varicose Vein Symptom Questionnaire (VVSymQ), but we are very uncertain about the results (MD -3.00, 95% CI -3.80 to -2.20; 34 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with dryland exercises may reduce oedema (leg volume) after five sessions of treatment (right leg: MD -840.70, 95% CI -1053.26 to -628.14; left leg: MD -767.50, 95% CI -910.07 to -624.93; 1 study, 34 participants, low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

For the comparison balneotherapy versus no treatment, we identified moderate-certainty evidence that the intervention improves disease severity signs and symptoms scores slightly, low-certainty evidence that it improves pain and skin pigmentation changes, and very low-certainty evidence that it improves HRQoL. Balneotherapy compared with no treatment made little or no difference to adverse effects, oedema or incidence of leg ulcers. Evidence comparing balneotherapy with other interventions was very limited. To ensure adequate comparison between trials, future trials should standardise measurements of outcomes (e.g. disease severity signs and symptoms score, HRQoL, pain and oedema) and follow-up time points.

### Medical management of venous ulcers [^116oE8dq]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Venous disease is the most common cause of chronic leg ulceration and represents an advanced clinical manifestation of venous insufficiency. Due to their frequency and chronicity, venous ulcers have a high socioeconomic impact, with treatment costs accounting for 1% of the health care budget in Western countries. The evaluation of patients with venous ulcers should include a thorough medical history for prior deep venous thrombosis, assessment for an hypercoagulable state, and a physical examination. Use of the CEAP (clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology) Classification System and the revised Venous Clinical Severity Scoring System is strongly recommended to characterize disease severity and assess response to treatment. This venous condition requires lifestyle modification, with affected individuals performing daily intervals of leg elevation to control edema; use of elastic compression garments; and moderate physical activity, such as walking wearing below-knee elastic stockings. Meticulous skin care, treatment of dermatitis, and prompt treatment of cellulitis are important aspects of medical management. The pharmacology of chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulcers include essentially two medications: pentoxifylline and phlebotropic agents. The micronized purified flavonoid fraction is an effective adjunct to compression therapy in patients with large, chronic ulceration.

Calcium dobesilate — clinical benefit and safety in chronic venous disease: In adults with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) including CEAP C2, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported calcium dobesilate suggested as more effective than placebo in improving symptoms, with higher efficacy in more severe disease. In adults with chronic venous disease (CVD), a systematic review and meta-analysis of 45 RCTs with a separated analysis of 17 observational studies reported calcium dobesilate the most effective treatment in reducing leg volume. Safety data from a review state the risk of an adverse event with calcium dobesilate is low, with 13 known cases of agranulocytosis, less than incidence in the general population.

### Abstract… [^116UiE3k]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Varicose veins are subcutaneous veins dilated to at least 3 mm in diameter when measured with the patient in an upright position. They are part of a continuum of chronic venous disorders ranging from fine telangiectasias, also called spider veins. 7 Established risk factors for varicose veins include family history of venous disease; female sex; older age; chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, pregnancy, chronic constipation, or a tumor; prolonged standing; deep venous thrombosis causing damage to valves and secondary revascularization; and arteriovenous shunting. 8, 9. Although varicose veins may cause varying degrees of discomfort or cosmetic concern, they are rarely associated with significant complications.

Signs of a more serious underlying vascular insufficiency may include changes in skin pigmentation, eczema, infection, superficial thrombophlebitis, venous ulceration, loss of subcutaneous tissue, and lipodermatosclerosis. Although rare, hemodynamically significant external hemorrhage resulting from the perforation of a varicose vein has been reported. 27 Endovenous thermal ablation is recommended as first-line treatment for nonpregnant patients with symptomatic varicose veins and documented valvular reflux, and need not be delayed for a trial of external compression. 7, 15.

### Medical and surgical therapy for advanced chronic venous insufficiency [^116iXgn6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Venous ulceration is the most serious consequence of chronic venous insufficiency. The disease has been known for more than 3.5 millennia with wound care centers established as early as 1500 bc. Unfortunately, still today it is a very poorly managed medical condition by most physicians despite that a great deal has been learned about the pathogenesis and treatment for venous ulcerations. We find that many wound care clinics treat the wound and not the cause of the problem. In this article, we review the basic pathophysiology of advanced chronic venous insufficiency and review the most up-to-date information with regard to medical therapy and different options of surgical therapy to address the underlying venous pathology responsible for chronic ulcers.

### Nonsurgical management of chronic venous insufficiency [^114eiJGq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic venous insufficiency:

- **Definition**: Chronic venous insufficiency is a medical condition characterized by inadequate venous return over a prolonged period, leading to venous hypertension and related symptoms.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of chronic venous insufficiency involves venous valve dysfunction, venous obstruction, or a combination of both, which result in retrograde blood flow and increased venous pressure.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of chronic venous insufficiency in the US is estimated at 92 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors associated with chronic venous insufficiency include a history of DVT, obesity, advanced age, and a sedentary lifestyle. Other factors such as female sex, living in certain geographical regions, multiparity, and a family history of chronic venous insufficiency have also been associated with an increased risk of developing the condition.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, chronic venous insufficiency presents with symptoms of leg pain, swelling, and skin changes like dermatitis or stasis ulcers. In some cases, varicose veins may also develop.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of chronic venous insufficiency varies widely, ranging from cosmetic issues to severe complications such as skin ulceration and tissue loss.

### Physical exercise for the treatment of non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency [^1154Kg1k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition related to chronic venous disease that may progress to venous leg ulceration and impair quality of life of those affected. Treatments such as physical exercise may be useful to reduce CVI symptoms. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise programmes with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were intensity of disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, and incidence of venous leg ulcer. Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, incidence of surgical intervention, and ankle joint mobility. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included five RCTs involving 146 participants. The studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise programme. The exercise protocols differed between studies. We assessed three studies to be at an overall unclear risk of bias, one study at overall high risk of bias, and one study at overall low risk of bias. We were not able to combine data in meta-analysis as studies did not report all outcomes, and different methods were used to measure and report outcomes. Two studies reported intensity of CVI disease signs and symptoms using a validated scale. There was no clear difference in signs and symptoms between groups in baseline to six months after treatment (Venous Clinical Severity Score mean difference (MD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.02 to 2.26; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), and we are uncertain if exercise alters the intensity of signs and symptoms eight weeks after treatment (MD -4.07, 95% CI -6.53 to -1.61; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in ejection fraction between groups from baseline to six months follow-up (MD 4.88, 95% CI -1.82 to 11.58; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Three studies reported on venous refilling time. We are uncertain if there is an improvement in venous refilling time between groups for baseline to six-month changes (MD 10.70 seconds, 95% CI 8.86 to 12.54; 23 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence) or baseline to eight-week change (MD 9.15 seconds, 95% CI 5.53 to 12.77 for right side; MD 7.25 seconds, 95% CI 5.23 to 9.27 for left side; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in venous refilling index for baseline to six-month changes (MD 0.57 mL/min, 95% CI -0.96 to 2.10; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). No included studies reported the incidence of venous leg ulcers. One study reported health-related quality of life using validated instruments (Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study (VEINES) and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS)). We are uncertain if exercise alters baseline to six-month changes in health-related quality of life between groups (VEINES-QOL: MD 4.60, 95% CI 0.78 to 8.42; SF-36 PCS: MD 5.40, 95% CI 0.63 to 10.17; SF-36 MCS: MD 0.40, 95% CI -3.85 to 4.65; 40 participants, 1 study; all very low-certainty evidence). Another study used the Chronic Venous Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20), and we are uncertain if exercise alters baseline to eight-week changes in health-related quality of life between groups (MD 39.36, 95% CI 30.18 to 48.54; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported no differences between groups without presenting data. There was no clear difference between groups in exercise capacity measured as time on treadmill (baseline to six-month changes) (MD -0.53 minutes, 95% CI -5.25 to 4.19; 35 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise improves exercise capacity as assessed by the 6-minute walking test (MD 77.74 metres, 95% CI 58.93 to 96.55; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Muscle strength was measured using dynamometry or using heel lifts counts. We are uncertain if exercise increases peak torque/body weight (120 revolutions per minute) (changes from baseline to six months MD 3.10 ft-lb, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.22; 29 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between groups in baseline to eight-week change in strength measured by a hand dynamometer (MD 12.24 lb, 95% CI -7.61 to 32.09 for the right side; MD 11.25, 95% CI -14.10 to 36.60 for the left side; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if there is an increase in heel lifts (n) (baseline to six-month changes) between groups (MD 7.70, 95% CI 0.94 to 14.46; 39 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between groups in ankle mobility measured during dynamometry (baseline to six-month change MD -1.40 degrees, 95% CI -4.77 to 1.97; 29 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise increases plantar flexion measured by a goniometer (baseline to eight-week change MD 12.13 degrees, 95% CI 8.28 to 15.98 for right leg; MD 10.95 degrees, 95% CI 7.93 to 13.97 for left leg; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). In all cases, we downgraded the certainty of evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of physical exercise in people with chronic venous disease. Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency, and time), sample size, blinding, and homogeneity according to the severity of disease.

### Surgery for deep venous insufficiency [^116Z7ha4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic deep venous insufficiency is caused by incompetent vein valves, blockage of large-calibre leg veins, or both; and causes a range of symptoms including recurrent ulcers, pain and swelling. Most surgeons accept that well-fitted graduated compression stockings (GCS) and local care of wounds serve as adequate treatment for most people, but sometimes symptoms are not controlled and ulcers recur frequently, or they do not heal despite compliance with conservative measures. In these situations, in the presence of severe venous dysfunction, surgery has been advocated by some vascular surgeons. This is an update of the review first published in 2000.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical management of deep venous insufficiency on ulcer healing and recurrence, complications of surgery, clinical outcomes, quality of life (QoL) and pain.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases, and the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 23 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical treatment versus another surgical procedure, usual care or no treatment, for people with deep venous insufficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We were unable to pool data due to differences in outcomes reported and how these were measured. Outcomes of interest were ulcer healing and recurrence, complications of surgery, clinical changes, QoL and pain.

Main Results

We included four RCTs (273 participants) comparing valvuloplasty plus surgery of the superficial venous system with surgery of the superficial venous system for primary valvular incompetence. Follow-up was two to 10 years. All included studies investigated primary valve incompetence. No studies investigated other surgical procedures for the treatment of people with deep venous insufficiency or surgery for secondary valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for risk of bias concerns and imprecision due to small numbers of included trials, participants and events. None of the studies reported ulcer healing or ulcer recurrence. One study included 27 participants with active venous ulceration at the time of surgery; the other three studies did not include people with ulcers. There were no major complications of surgery, no incidence of deep vein thrombosis and no deaths reported (very low-certainty evidence). All four studies reported clinical changes but the data could not be pooled due to different outcome measures and reporting of the data. Two studies assessed clinical changes using subjective and objective measurements, as specified in the clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathophysiological (CEAP) classification score (low-certainty evidence). One study reported mean CEAP severity scores and one study reported change in clinical class using CEAP. At baseline, the mean CEAP severity score was 18.1 (standard deviation (SD) 4.4) for limbs undergoing external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system and 17.8 (SD 3.4) for limbs undergoing surgery to the superficial venous system only. At three years post-surgery, the mean CEAP severity score was 5.2 (SD 1.6) for limbs that had undergone external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system and 9.2 (SD 2.6) for limbs that had undergone surgery to the superficial venous system only (low-certainty evidence). In another study, participants with progressive clinical dynamics over the five years preceding surgery had higher rates of improvement in clinical condition in the treatment group (valvuloplasty plus ligation) compared with the control group (ligation only) (80% versus 51%) after seven years of follow-up. Participants with stable preoperative clinical dynamics demonstrated similar rates of improvement in both groups (95% with valvuloplasty plus ligation versus 90% with ligation only) (low-certainty evidence). One study reported disease-specific QoL using cumulative scores from a 10-item visual analogue scale (VAS) and reported that in the limited anterior plication (LAP) plus superficial venous surgery group the score decreased from 49 to 11 at 10 years, compared to a decrease from 48 to 36 in participants treated with superficial venous surgery only (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported pain. Within the QoL VAS scale, one item was 'pain/discomfort' and scores decreased from 4 to 1 at 10 years for participants in the LAP plus superficial venous surgery group and increased from 2 to 3 at 10 years in participants treated with superficial venous surgery only. A second study reported that 'leg heaviness and pain' was resolved completely in 36/40 limbs treated with femoral vein external valvuloplasty plus high ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and percutaneous continuous circumsuture and 22/40 limbs treated with high ligation and stripping of GSV and percutaneous continuous circumsuture alone, at three years' follow-up (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We only identified evidence from four RCTs for valvuloplasty plus surgery of the superficial venous system for primary valvular incompetence. We found no studies investigating other surgical procedures for the treatment of people with deep venous insufficiency, or that included participants with secondary valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. None of the studies reported ulcer healing or recurrence, and few studies reported complications of surgery, clinical outcomes, QoL and pain (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Conclusions on the effectiveness of valvuloplasty for deep venous insufficiency cannot be made.

### CHIVA method for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency [^111ab1h1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many surgical approaches are available to treat varicose veins secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. One of the least invasive techniques is the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency method (cure conservatrice et hémodynamique de l'insuffisance veineuse en ambulatoire (CHIVA)), an approach based on venous hemodynamics with deliberate preservation of the superficial venous system. This is an update of the review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of the CHIVA method with alternative therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins.

Search Methods

The Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched the Specialised Register (April 2015), the Cochrane Register of Studies (2015, Issue 3) and clinical trials databases. The review authors searched PubMed (April 2015). There was no language restriction. We contacted study authors to obtain more information when necessary.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the CHIVA method versus any other treatments. Two review authors independently selected and evaluated the studies. One review author extracted data and performed the quantitative analysis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data from the selected papers. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), the number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), and the number of people needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Review Manager 5.

Main Results

No new studies were identified for this update. We included four RCTs with 796 participants (70.5% women). Three RCTs compared the CHIVA method with vein stripping, and one RCT compared the CHIVA method with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. We judged the quality of the evidence of the included studies as low to moderate due to imprecision caused by the low number of events and because the studies were open. The overall risk of bias across studies was high because neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded to the interventions. The primary endpoint, clinical recurrence, pooled between studies over a follow-up of 3 to 10 years, showed more favorable results for the CHIVA method than for vein stripping (721 people; RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.78; I² = 0%, NNTB 6; 95% CI 4 to 10) or compression dressings (47 people; RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; NNTB 3; 95% CI 2 to 17). Only one study reported data on quality of life (presented graphically) and these results significantly favored the CHIVA method. The vein stripping group had a higher risk of side effects than the CHIVA group; specifically, the RR for bruising was 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.76; NNTH 4; 95% CI 3 to 6) and the RR for nerve damage was 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.38; I² = 0%; NNTH 12; 95% CI 9 to 20). There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding the incidence of limb infection and superficial vein thrombosis.

Authors' Conclusions

The CHIVA method reduces recurrence of varicose veins and produces fewer side effects than vein stripping. However, we based these conclusions on a small number of trials with a high risk of bias as the effects of surgery could not be concealed and the results were imprecise due to low number of events. New RCTs are needed to confirm these results and to compare CHIVA with approaches other than open surgery.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of endovascular and surgical revascularization for patients with chronic lower extremity venous insufficiency and varicose veins [^1122BAc7]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic lower extremity venous disease (LECVD) is twice as prevalent as coronary heart disease, and invasive therapies to treat LECVD accounted for an estimated $290 million in Medicare expenditures in 2015. Despite increasing use of these invasive therapies, their comparative effectiveness is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of treatments for patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) with lower extremity varicosities and/or lower extremity chronic venous insufficiency/incompetence/reflux. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant English-language studies published from January 2000 to July 2016. We included comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with > 20 patients and observational studies with > 500 patients. Short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes of placebo, mechanical compression therapy, and invasive therapies (surgical and endovascular) were included. Quality ratings and evidence grading was performed. Random-effects models were used to compute summary estimates of effects.

Results

We identified a total of 57 studies representing 105,878 enrolled patients, including 53 RCTs comprised of 10,034 patients. Among the RCTs, 16 were good quality, 28 were fair quality, and 9 were poor quality. Allocation concealment, double blinding, and reporting bias were inadequately addressed in 25 of 53 (47%), 46 of 53 (87%), and 15 of 53 (28.3%), respectively. Heterogeneity in therapies, populations, and/or outcomes prohibited meta-analysis of comparisons between different endovascular therapies and between endovascular intervention and placebo/compression. Meta-analysis evaluating venous stripping plus ligation (high ligation/stripping) compared with radiofrequency ablation revealed no difference in short-term bleeding (odds ratio [OR] = 0.30, 95% CI -0.16 to 5.38, P = 0.43) or reflux recurrence at 1–2 years (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.37–1.55, P = 0.44). Meta-analysis evaluating high ligation/stripping versus endovascular laser ablation revealed no difference in long-term symptom score (OR 0.02, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.23, P = 0.84) or quality of life at 2 years (OR 0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.25, P = 0.50).

Conclusions

The paucity of high-quality comparative effectiveness and safety data in LECVD is concerning given the overall rise in endovascular procedures. More high-quality studies are needed to determine comparative effectiveness and guide policy and practice.

### Treatment of chronic venous disorder: a comprehensive review [^115MuoNG]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous disorder (CVD) is highly prevalent vascular disorder affecting up to 45% of the general population, with clinical manifestations ranging from teleangiectasias to venous leg ulcers (VLUs). We examined the currently available data in order to provide an updated, comprehensive review on treatment options of CVD. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials, and OpenGrey databases for relevant articles in English published until November 2020. Compression treatment is the mainstay of conservative treatment. Pharmacological treatment can provide significant symptomatic relief and hence it should be considered as part of conservative treatment. Transcutaneous Lacer treatment (TCL) is a safe and effective alternative option to sclerotherapy for treatment of C1 stage. High ligation and stripping (HL/S), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) systems and non thermal non tumescent ablation (NTNT) systems are safe and efficacious first-line options for treatment of saphenous insufficiency. Interventional treatment of co-existing incompetent perforator veins (IPVs) is not supported by contemporary evidence. Regarding deep venous insufficiency (DVI), treatment of symptomatic femoroiliocaval occlusive venous disease refractory to conservative treatment with percutaneous transluminal venoplasty stenting has produced encouraging results.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115RzPWy]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study selection, data extraction and analysis

We included systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to the following criteria: (a) study population of elderly (≥ 70 years) with venous insufficiency and swollen legs without recent (≤ 2 years) deep vein thrombosis; (b) evaluating the preventive effects of European standard compression stockings class 2 or 3; (c) compared to a different class of compression stockings, other interventions to promote venous backflow or no intervention; (d) assessed on thrombosis, leg ulcer and mobility (primary outcomes) or other health related outcomes such as pain, discomfort, quality of life or post-thrombotic syndrome (secondary outcomes). Compliance was not defined as an outcome in the original protocol, but following feedback, we included compliance as a secondary outcome post hoc.

Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of records identified by the search. Records appearing to meet the inclusion criteria and those with insufficient details were obtained in full text. Two reviewers independently assessed the full text publications according to a pre-defined inclusion form. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

The first author (KTD) described the included trials with regard to population, intervention, comparison, outcome and main results in tables. Another reviewer (HTM) checked the extracted information. Two reviewers (KTD, HTM) independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Risk of Bias assessment tool.

We conducted meta-analysis in Review Manager (RevMan5.3) software, when studies were sufficiently similar in terms of design, population, interventions and outcomes. We calculated relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random effects model to account for pooling effects due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies. Double-data entries were performed. We planned to do subgroup analysis based on population and degree of compression, but due to the small number of studies, this was not feasible.

We assessed the quality of the evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The assessment involves within-study risk of bias, directness of evidence, inconsistency of effect estimates (heterogeneity), precision of effect estimate and risk of publication bias. The GRADE assessment indicates the extent to which we can have confidence in the effect estimate. Confidence of the effect estimates were described as high, moderate, low and very low (Table 1).

The recognition of lower extremity venous disease as a significant cause of morbidity and lower quality of life, afflicting up to 25% of Western populations, has led to rapid and drastic improvements in treatment options as well as an increasing awareness of the disease. Superficial venous disease, a frequent medical problem encountered in clinical practices, is now a common reason for referral to providers offering a spectrum of interventions. Venous guidelines have been set forth by the American Venous Forum and Society for Vascular Surgery covering simple spider veins to chronic venous ulcerations. (Gloviczki et al.

### Diagnosis and treatment of venous stasis ulcers… [^114dZ1Qb]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Because of the increasing obesity and longevity of the U. S. population, the incidence of chronic venous insufficiency and venous stasis ulcers is sure to rise. Weingarten reviews state-of-the-art management of these ulcers. Venous stasis disease most commonly occurs in patients with obesity, congestive heart failure or diabetes. Ulcers often begin during the working years, adding lost productivity costs to the already substantial direct medical costs of treating this disease. The typical signs of chronic venous insufficiency include pedal edema, varicose veins and skin hyperpigmentation. Stasis ulcers most commonly occur at the medial malleolus, but any part of the lower limb can be involved. Patients with stasis ulcers typically note pain at the ulcer site and heaviness in the limb caused by edema. Within the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers related to venous stasis are less common ulcers resulting from arterial insufficiency, vasculitic disease or skin malignancy.

Noninvasive measurement of arterial function by use of a blood pressure cuff and Doppler probe to assess the ankle-brachial index is an effective method of screening for arterial insufficiency. Biopsy of any nonhealing ulcer can guide the physician in the choice of antibiotic and exclude the possibility of vasculitis or skin malignancy. Diuretics are commonly used in the treatment of venous insufficiency but are generally ineffective without the concomitant use of compressive dressings. Antibiotic use should be based on tissue culture of the wound. The most important intervention is effective compression of the edematous limb. The Unna boot, when properly applied, is a time-honored treatment but cannot be used if there is a large amount of wound drainage. Newer technologies for management of venous stasis ulcers follow those used in the care of diabetic ulcers.

Topically applied compounds containing various growth factors have been helpful in some studies. Ligation of refluxing veins near the ulcer site or split-thickness skin grafting has been used in the most refractory cases.

### Compression therapy for occupational leg symptoms and chronic venous disorders-a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112gSZCT]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Leg discomfort and oedema are commonly attributed to a venous disorder (CVD) or chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and treated with compression hosiery. The pressure needed to achieve clinical benefit is a matter of debate.

Design

We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared stockings exerting an ankle pressure of 10–20mmHg with placebo or no treatment and with stockings exerting a pressure of more than 20mmHg.

Methods

RCT were retrieved and analysed with the tools of the Cochrane Collaboration. Each study was reviewed independently. Subjective dichotomous and continuous factors and objective findings were pooled for statistical treatment.

Results

Eleven RCT fulfilled the predefined criteria. They included 1453 randomised subjects, 794 healthy people exposed to various forms of stress, 552 patients with a chronic venous disorder or chronic venous insufficiency and 141 patients after varicose vein surgery. Over all, compression with 10–20mmHg had a clear effect on oedema and symptoms as compared with < 10mmHg pressure, placebo stockings, or no treatment (p < .0001). No study showed a difference between 10–20 and > 20mmHg stockings.

Conclusions

Despite important methodological heterogeneity and sometimes sub-standard reporting the meta-analysis suggests that leg compression with 10–15mmHg is an effective treatment for CVD. Less pressure is ineffective and higher pressure may be of no additional benefit.

### Chronic venous insufficiency and venous leg ulceration [^1155x5XJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Venous ulcers are the most common form of leg ulcers. Venous disease has a significant impact on quality of life and work productivity. In addition, the costs associated with the long-term care of these chronic wounds are substantial. Although the exact pathogenic steps leading from venous hypertension to venous ulceration remain unclear, several hypotheses have been developed to explain the development of venous ulceration. A better understanding of the current pathophysiology of venous ulceration has led to the development of new approaches in its management. New types of wound dressings, topical and systemic therapeutic agents, surgical modalities, bioengineered tissue, matrix materials, and growth factors are all novel therapeutic options that may be used in addition to the "gold standard", compression therapy, for venous ulcers. This review discusses current aspects of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic assessment, and current therapeutic options for chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulceration. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2001;44:401–21.)

Learning Objective

At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the 3 main types of lower extremity ulcers and should improve their understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic assessment, and current therapies for chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulcers.

### CHIVA method for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency [^1155CtM3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Many surgical approaches are available to treat varicose veins secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. One of the least invasive techniques is the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency method (in French 'cure conservatrice et hémodynamique de l'insuffisance veineuse en ambulatoire' (CHIVA)), an approach based on venous hemodynamics with deliberate preservation of the superficial venous system. This is the second update of the review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of the CHIVA method with alternative therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 19 October 2020. We also searched PUBMED to 19 October 2020 and checked the references of relevant articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CHIVA to other therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and selected studies, extracted data, and performed quantitative analysis from the selected papers. A third author solved any disagreements. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), and the number of people needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The main outcomes of interest were the recurrence of varicose veins and side effects.

Main Results

For this update, we identified two new additional studies. In total, we included six RCTs with 1160 participants (62% women) and collected from them eight comparisons. Three RCTs compared CHIVA with vein stripping. One RCT compared CHIVA with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. The new studies included three comparisons, one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and endovenous laser therapy. We judged the certainty of the evidence for our outcomes as low to very low due to inconsistency, imprecision caused by the low number of events and risk of bias. The overall risk of bias across studies was high because neither participants nor personnel were blinded to the interventions. Two studies attempted to blind outcome assessors, but the characteristics of the surgery limited concealment. Five studies reported the outcome clinical recurrence of varicose veins with a follow-up of 18 months to 10 years. CHIVA may make little or no difference to the recurrence of varicose veins in the lower limb compared to stripping (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 5 studies, 966 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether CHIVA reduced recurrence compared to compression dressing (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; 1 study, 47 participants; very low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to clinical recurrence compared to RFA (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 5.53; 1 study, 146 participants; low-certainty evidence) and endovenous laser (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; 1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found no clear difference between CHIVA and stripping for the side effects of limb infection (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 studies, 746 participants; low-certainty evidence), and superficial vein thrombosis (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.17; 4 studies, 846 participants; low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may reduce slightly nerve injury (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98; NNTH 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; 4 studies, 846 participants; low-certainty evidence) and hematoma compared to stripping (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.97; NNTH 11, 95% CI 5 to 100; 2 studies, 245 participants; low-certainty evidence). For bruising, one study found no differences between groups while another study found reduced rates of bruising in the CHIVA group compared to the stripping group. Compared to RFA, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma, but may cause more bruising (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28; NNTH 8, CI 95% 5 to 25; 1 study, 144 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to endovenous laser, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma. The study comparing CHIVA versus compression did not report side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There may be little or no difference in the recurrence of varicose veins when comparing CHIVA to stripping (low-certainty evidence), but CHIVA may slightly reduce nerve injury and hematoma in the lower limb (low-certainty evidence). Very limited evidence means we are uncertain of any differences in recurrence when comparing CHIVA with compression (very low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence compared to RFA (low-certainty evidence), but may result in more bruising (low-certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence and side effects compared to endovenous laser therapy (low-certainty evidence). However, we based these conclusions on a small number of trials with a high risk of bias as the effects of surgery could not be concealed, and the results were imprecise due to the low number of events. New RCTs are needed to confirm these results and to compare CHIVA with approaches other than open surgery.

"Cost-effectiveness of VLU prevention is difficult to rigorously prove" due to trial size and heterogeneity in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). "Adequate compression in a compliant patient with C1–4 disease and the use of evidence-based therapies for treatment with prevention of DVT recurrence should go a long way toward decreasing the incidence of VLU". However, "there is a knowledge gap as to whether adequate compression and skin care or, alternatively, surgical intervention for superficial venous incompetence prevents progression to another clinical disease level, specifically from C4 to C6".

### Management of chronic venous insufficiency in older adults [^113Et42T]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) develops as a consequence of valvular incompetence or venous obstruction over time and can significantly impair quality of life. Its prevalence and burden are highest among older adults, as the physiological changes of aging predispose to the onset and progression of CVI. We present an overview of the evaluation and management of CVI in older adults, with a focus on superficial venous disease. Current treatment modalities for superficial venous disease and their outcomes in older adults are discussed.

### Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency [^117X9vAr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction, or a combination of these with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It can result in a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options or therapies for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) is a relatively cheap option and potentially efficient way to deliver physical therapy for people with CVI.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Clinical Trials.gov trials register to August 2018. We searched the LILACS and IBECS databases. We also checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy with no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed studies retrieved by the search strategies. Both review authors independently assessed selected studies for complete analysis. We resolved conflicts through discussion. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, obtaining additional information. For binary outcomes (leg ulcer incidence and adverse events), we presented the results using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes (disease severity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, oedema, skin pigmentation), we presented the results as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We included seven randomised controlled trials with 891 participants (outpatients in secondary care). We found no quasi-randomised controlled trials. Six studies (836 participants) evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment. One study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis) (55 participants). There was a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, imprecision and inconsistency, which downgraded the certainty of the evidence. For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison, there probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptom score as assessed using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (MD -1.66, 95% CI -4.14 to 0.83; 2 studies, 484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably resulted in a moderate improvement in HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CVIQ2) at three months (MD -9.38, 95% CI -18.18 to -0.57; 2 studies, 149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nine months (MD -10.46, 95% CI -11.81 to -9.11; 1 study; 55 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 12 months (MD -4.99, 95% CI -9.19 to -0.78; 2 studies, 455 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in HRQoL between balneotherapy and no treatment at six months (MD -1.64, 95% CI -9.18 to 5.89; 2 studies, 445 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably slightly improved pain compared with no treatment (MD -1.23, 95% CI -1.33 to -1.13; 1 study; 390 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect related to oedema between the two groups at 24 days (MD 43.28 mL, 95% CI -102.74 to 189.30; 2 studies, 153 participants; very-low certainty evidence). There probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in the incidence of leg ulcers (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.48; 2 studies, 449 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably a reduction in incidence of skin pigmentation changes in favour of balneotherapy at 12 months (pigmentation index: MD -3.59, 95% CI -4.02 to -3.16; 1 study; 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). The main complications reported included erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), thromboembolic events (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study; 59 participants; low-certainty evidence), with no clear evidence of an increase in reported adverse effects with balneotherapy. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. For the balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis) comparison, we observed no clear difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This single study did not report on the other outcomes of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified moderate- to low-certainty evidence that suggests that balneotherapy may result in a moderate improvement in pain, quality of life and skin pigmentation changes and has no clear effect on disease severity signs and symptoms score, adverse effects, leg ulcers and oedema when compared with no treatment. For future studies, measurements of outcomes such as disease severity sign and symptom score, quality of life, pain and oedema and choice of time points during follow-up must be standardised for adequate comparison between trials.

### Physical exercise for the treatment of non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency [^116hK4y5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common disease that causes discomfort and impairs the quality of life of affected persons. Treatments such as physical exercise that aim to increase the movement of the ankle joint and strengthen the muscle pump in the calf of the leg may be useful to reduce the symptoms of CVI.

Objectives

To assess and summarise the existing clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (May 2016). In addition, the CIS searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) and trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise with no exercise programmes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results and selected eligible studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We summarised and double-checked details from included studies. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, but obtained no further information.

Main Results

We included two trials involving 54 participants with CVI. Many of our review outcomes were not reported or reported by only one of the two studies. The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both studies but using different scales; we were therefore unable to pool the data. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups whereas the second reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group. In one study, increases in change in ejection fraction compared with baseline (mean difference (MD) 4.88%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16 to 6.60; 30 participants; P < 0.00001), half venous refilling time (MD 4.20 seconds, 95% CI 3.28 to 5.12; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) and total venous refilling time (MD 9.40 seconds, 95% CI 7.77 to 11.03; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) were observed in the exercise group compared with the control group. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups with regard to quality of life or ankle range of motion. Although muscle strength assessed by dynamometry at slow speed did not differ between the two groups in this study, variable peak torque at fast speed was lower in the control group than in the exercise group (2.8 ± 0.9 compared with -0.3 ± 0.6, P < 0.03). The incidence of venous leg ulcers, incidence of surgical intervention to treat symptoms related to CVI and exercise capacity were not assessed or reported in either of the included trials. We rated both included studies as at high risk of bias; hence, these data should be interpreted carefully. Due to the small number of studies and small sample size, we were not able to verify indirectness and publication bias. Therefore, we judged the overall quality of evidence as very low according to the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence available to assess the efficacy of physical exercise in people with CVI. Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency and time), sample size, blinding and homogeneity according to the severity of disease.

### Treatment of chronic venous insufficiency in Latin America [^112FgD2n]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Venous disease is common in Latin America, with an estimated 68.11% prevalence of chronic venous disease. The diverse social, political, and economic characteristics of the many nations that make up Latin America mean that different conditions affect how these diseases are diagnosed and treated, which may differ markedly from the way they are treated by the health care systems of the United States and Europe. Our goal was to review the current state of treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in Latin America.

Methods

This is a narrative review of the medical literature on the subject and synthesizes sometimes fragmentary information on CVI across a large and diverse region.

Results

CVI represents an unmet medical need in Latin America. Conservative treatments, such as compression stockings, may be used at first, and there are nonpharmacologic and complementary and alternative medicine approaches in use. Endovenous approaches, such as endovenous thermal ablation, have largely replaced surgical interventions. In Europe and the United States, such procedures are mainly carried out in ambulatory facilities, whereas they are mainly performed in the hospital in Latin America.

Conclusions

Recent strong economic growth in Latin America and improvements in social security and health care suggest that innovative approaches to chronic venous disease and CVI will be implemented.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^114XmjwQ]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg — this introductory page outlines the scope and evidence approach, stating that the American College of Phlebology prepared a summation document reflecting evidence-based recommendations from the Gloviczki paper and other current studies, with additional guidance based on ACP expert consensus where research is sparse yet therapy is considered standard of care. It notes that ultrasound, endovenous ablation devices, foam sclerotherapy and tumescent anesthesia have moved treatment from the operating room to office or radiology settings and that medical necessity policy for chronic venous disease (CVD) has become fragmented and inconsistent across the U.S. The authors suggest that evidence based medical necessity should not vary greatly by geography or insurer and introduce the concept of "medically significant venous insufficiency" or "evidence-based medical significance". They state that medical evidence should determine the definition of medically significant venous insufficiency using a combination of CEAP and VCSS classifications and propose that payers retain this evidence-based definition while choosing whether it becomes a "covered benefit" or a "non-covered benefit", with medical necessity guidelines to follow in summary format.

### Current management of venous ulceration [^112VTiPv]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

It has been estimated that chronic venous insufficiency affects 10 to 35 percent of the entire U.S. population and that 4 percent of people older than 65 have active venous ulcers. The high prevalence of the disease results in an annual expenditure of more than 1 billion dollars a year to the U.S. health care system. To have a rational approach toward patients with venous ulcers, it is important to understand the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of the disease process, in order to initiate appropriate treatment and prevent venous ulcer recurrence.

### Network meta-analysis to compare venaSeal with other superficial venous therapies for chronic venous insufficiency [^112pmVqn]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared different interventions for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) management, but mixed comparison of these interventions is lacking. The aim of this network meta-analysis was to compare VenaSeal closure system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), mechanochemical ablation, sclerotherapy, and surgery for management of CVI to achieve anatomic success (complete closure of treated vein within 6 months after intervention) as the primary outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQoL; EuroQol-5 Dimension, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire), Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), pain scores, and adverse events as secondary outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review of journal databases was undertaken, and RCTs between January 1996 and September 2018 comparing different treatment options were included. Risk of bias and quality of publications were assessed using the Cochrane bias tool; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used for study selection and reporting. Twenty RCTs comprising 4570 patients were analyzed. Data for anatomic success, VCSS, HRQoL, pain score, and adverse events were extracted and analyzed using mixed treatment comparison in a network meta-analysis. A Bayesian fixed or random effects model was selected for analysis. Rank probability graphs were generated for various treatments and corresponding ranks obtained to estimate their probability of being best. Relative treatment effects were calculated in terms of log odds ratios for anatomic success and adverse events. Mean difference was calculated for VCSS, HRQoL, and pain score.

Results

For the primary outcome measure (anatomic success), VenaSeal system had the highest probability of being ranked first (P = 0.980); RFA was ranked second (P = 0.365), EVLA third (P = 0.397), surgery fourth (P = 0.290), mechanochemical ablation fifth (P = 0.695), and sclerotherapy sixth (P = 0.982). For secondary outcome measures, VenaSeal system ranked third for VCSS (P = 0.332), fifth for EuroQol-5 Dimension (P = 0.420), and third for Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (P = 0.300). Although, VenaSeal system was slightly inferior to some of the other interventions for HRQoL, the 95% credible interval of log odds ratio indicated insufficient evidence for any concrete conclusion to be drawn. VenaSeal system ranked first in reduction of postoperative pain score from baseline (P = 0.690) and was lowest in occurrence of adverse events (P = 0.650). Odds of occurrence of adverse events was 3.3 times in the sclerotherapy arm, 2.7 times in the EVLA arm, 1.6 times with surgery, and 1.1 times with RFA vs VenaSeal system arm.

Conclusions

VenaSeal system is a promising therapeutic option for anatomic success at 6 months, with fewer occurrences of adverse events (wound and groin infection, pulmonary embolism) in CVI patients compared with other interventions in this study. Additional economic analysis including cost-effectiveness analysis would provide interesting perspectives on real-world insights to patients, payers, and providers.
