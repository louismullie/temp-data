## Question

What is the recommended initial sildenafil dose for erectile dysfunction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended initial sildenafil dose for erectile dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling actually states for standard adult dosing. Then, I should verify whether the label uses explicit "start" language and identify exceptions for hepatic or renal impairment. Next, I will review major guidelines (AUA, EAU) to ensure alignment with best practice. After that, I should check how clinical trials operationalize the initial dose and how to titrate. Finally, I need to consider key safety counseling such as nitrates, cardiovascular risk, and vision/hearing warnings before summarizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the FDA dosing language for ED. The SPL entry lists sildenafil 50 mg taken approximately 1 hour before sexual activity, with a maximum of 100 mg per day; the SPL labels this as "maintenance", but functionally this is the default dose used at initiation in most adults with ED, taken on an as‑needed basis rather than scheduled daily dosing [^114xYUWu]. Wait, let me verify whether "initial" is explicitly stated elsewhere in the FDA materials; I need to check special‑population sections because they often say "start at" a lower dose, which implies that 50 mg is the standard starting point in the general population [^1148HtG9] [^111HhjaS] [^116CrvkC] [^116N2pcw].

> Hold on, I initially thought the FDA label explicitly said "start at 50 mg", but in this SPL it is framed as "maintenance"; I should confirm via the impairment sections. The FDA labeling explicitly instructs to "start at 25 mg" for ED in hepatic impairment (Child‑Pugh A or B, and also C where listed) and in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), which by contrast supports 50 mg as the practical initial dose for typical adults without those impairments; so my earlier assumption about explicit "start at 50 mg" needs to be corrected to "default initial dose used in practice is 50 mg", anchored by the special‑population "start at 25 mg" language [^1148HtG9] [^111HhjaS] [^116N2pcw] [^116CrvkC].

> Next, I should review guideline concordance. The AUA recommends offering PDE5 inhibitors and titrating the dose to optimal effect, which fits starting at the conventional 50 mg and adjusting based on response and tolerability; the EAU emphasizes PDE5 inhibitors as first‑line therapy and highlights that incorrect use or inadequate information is a major cause of treatment failure, reinforcing a standard approach with appropriate counseling rather than starting unnecessarily low in most patients [^117DtUMB] [^114eqZHH] [^113qGcLa].

> I will now examine how trials operationalize the initial dose. A large multicenter open‑label study started all men at 50 mg and then optimized; satisfaction rose from 75% after the first phase to 86% after dose optimization, supporting 50 mg as a practical starting point with subsequent titration; a network meta‑analysis also found strong efficacy at 50 mg with dose‑related adverse events, again supporting 50 mg as the effective initial dose for most patients with later adjustment as needed [^115EVE1k] [^117AF6Tv].

> Let me think about special populations where I must start lower. I should confirm the FDA recommendations: start at 25 mg for hepatic impairment (Child‑Pugh A or B, and where specified C) and for severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min); while age alone is not listed as mandating reduction, in frail older adults or those at higher hypotension risk it is reasonable to consider starting at 25 mg and titrating carefully, although the mandatory reductions are driven by hepatic and severe renal impairment per label [^1148HtG9] [^111HhjaS] [^116N2pcw] [^116CrvkC].

> Next, I should review titration and timing. The dose may be increased to 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg based on efficacy and tolerability, with a maximum of 100 mg once daily, typically taken about 1 hour before anticipated sexual activity; onset can be earlier in some patients, with randomized data showing successful intercourse as early as 14–20 minutes in prior responders, but counseling to dose roughly an hour before activity is prudent and label‑concordant [^114xYUWu].

> I need to ensure key safety counseling. Sildenafil is contraindicated with any form of organic nitrates because of profound hypotension risk; patients must not co‑administer other PDE5 inhibitors, and they should be counseled to seek urgent care for sudden vision loss (possible NAION) or sudden hearing loss; postmarketing reports include serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events often in patients with underlying risk factors and sometimes temporally associated with sexual activity, so shared decision‑making around baseline cardiovascular risk is essential; additive blood pressure effects with antihypertensives are usually modest, but I should double‑check alpha‑blocker co‑administration and stagger dosing as clinically indicated to mitigate symptomatic hypotension [^1179DQLF] [^111GQbms] [^113Q9QyU].

> But wait, what if nonresponse occurs despite an appropriate starting dose? I should confirm that education on correct timing, sexual stimulation requirement, and allowance for multiple attempts is provided, as misuse is a common cause of failure; both AUA and EAU emphasize instruction and titration, and clinical data show that customized instructions and dose optimization after an initial 50 mg phase improve satisfaction and outcomes substantially, reducing apparent "treatment failures" due to technique rather than pharmacology [^117DtUMB] [^113qGcLa] [^115EVE1k].

> Bottom line, I should synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation: For most adult men with ED, the recommended initial sildenafil dose is 50 mg taken as needed approximately 1 hour before sexual activity, with titration to 100 mg or down to 25 mg based on efficacy and tolerability, not exceeding 100 mg once daily; start at 25 mg in hepatic impairment (Child‑Pugh A/B/C where specified) and in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), and consider 25 mg initially in frail older adults at higher hypotension risk; ensure strict avoidance of nitrates and provide robust usage counseling to optimize response [^114xYUWu] [^1148HtG9] [^111HhjaS] [^116N2pcw] [^116CrvkC] [^1179DQLF] [^117DtUMB] [^113qGcLa].

The recommended starting dose of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction is **50 mg taken approximately 1 hour before sexual activity** [^114xYUWu] [^notfound]. Adjust the dose based on efficacy and tolerability [^117DtUMB]: **increase to 100 mg** if needed [^114xYUWu], or **decrease to 25 mg** if adverse effects occur or in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [^116CrvkC] [^111HhjaS]. The **maximum recommended dose is 100 mg per day**, and sildenafil **should not be used with nitrates** due to the risk of severe hypotension [^114xYUWu] [^1179DQLF] [^113Q9QyU].

---

## Recommended starting dose

- **Standard initial dose**: 50 mg orally [^114xYUWu], taken approximately 1 hour before sexual activity [^111ezzMs].

- **Maximum frequency**: Once daily [^114xYUWu].

- **Maximum dose**: 100 mg per day [^114xYUWu].

---

## Dose adjustments

Increase to **100 mg** if the initial 50 mg dose is ineffective and well tolerated [^114xYUWu] [^115EVE1k]. Decrease to **25 mg** if adverse effects occur or in patients with renal [^116CrvkC] or hepatic impairment [^111HhjaS] [^1148HtG9].

---

## Special considerations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | 25 mg | Reduced clearance of sildenafil [^116CrvkC] |
| Hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B) | 25 mg | Reduced hepatic metabolism [^111HhjaS] [^1148HtG9] [^116N2pcw] |
| Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) | 25 mg | Increased sensitivity to PDE5 inhibitors [^114xYUWu] |

---

## Contraindications and precautions

**Contraindications** include concurrent use of nitrates or nitric oxide donors due to the risk of severe hypotension [^113Q9QyU] [^1179DQLF]. **Precautions** include cardiovascular disease, hypotension, recent stroke or myocardial infarction, retinitis pigmentosa, or severe hepatic impairment [^1179DQLF] [^111GQbms].

---

## Patient counseling and instructions

- **Timing**: Take sildenafil approximately 1 hour before sexual activity [^111ezzMs].

- **Sexual stimulation**: Required for effectiveness [^1125QmuQ] [^113qGcLa].

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: A trade-off network meta-analysis [^117AF6Tv]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major health care problem worldwide, and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) are the pharmacological treatment of choice. However, the optimal PDE5I for ED treatment remains unknown.

- **Objective**: To investigate trade-offs between efficacy and adverse events for various PDE5Is in treating ED.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. Databases such as Medline, Scopus, reference lists from relevant articles, and systematic reviews were searched. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing at least one PDE5I for treating ED with placebo or another PDE5I.

- **Evidence synthesis**: We included 82 trials (47,626 patients) for efficacy analysis and 72 trials (20,325 patients) for adverse event analysis. In the trade-off analysis of starting dosages, sildenafil 50 mg had the greatest efficacy but also had the highest rate of overall adverse events. Tadalafil 10 mg had intermediate efficacy but had the lowest overall rate of all adverse events. Vardenafil 10 mg and avanafil 100 mg had similar overall adverse events compared to sildenafil 50 mg but exhibited markedly lower global efficacy. Udenafil 100 mg had similar global efficacy to tadalafil 10 mg, but its overall adverse event rates were higher.

- **Conclusions**: This study represents the first trade-off analysis of the different PDE5Is currently available. For individuals who prioritize high efficacy, sildenafil 50 mg appears to be the treatment of choice. Men wishing to optimize tolerability should consider taking tadalafil 10 mg or may choose to switch to an alternative option.

### Caverject impulse [^111H7kVY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage for erectile dysfunction**: Erectile dysfunction of vasculogenic, psychogenic, or mixed etiology should begin with an initial dose of 2.5 mcg of CAVERJECT IMPULSE administered intracavernously as recommended [see Dosage and Administration 2.4]. If there is a partial response at this dose, an additional 2.5 mcg may be administered within 1 hour. During the titration process, no more than two doses should be given within a 24-hour period. If further titration is needed, increase the doses in increments of 5 to 10 mcg, with at least 24 hours between doses. The optimal dose should produce an erection suitable for intercourse, not exceeding 1 hour in duration. The patient must remain in the healthcare provider's office until complete detumescence occurs. Titration can be repeated as necessary until the optimal dose is achieved. Doses greater than 60 mcg are not recommended.

- **Erectile dysfunction of pure neurogenic etiology (spinal cord injury)**: Start with a dose of 1.25 mcg of alprostadil using CAVERJECT. If there is a partial response, another dose of 1.25 mcg may be given within 1 hour. No more than two doses should be administered during the initial titration within a 24-hour timeframe. For additional titration, a dose of 5 mcg should be administered at least 24 hours later. The optimal dosage should facilitate an erection suitable for intercourse without exceeding a duration of 1 hour. The patient must remain under healthcare supervision until full detumescence is observed. As with other etiologies, repeat the titration as necessary to determine the optimal dose, not exceeding 60 mcg.

- **Maintenance dosage**: Appropriate maintenance dosing should be determined based on the established effective dose during the titration phase.

### A prospective study of the beneficial effects of dose optimization and customized instructions on patient satisfaction with sildenafil citrate (Viagra) for erectile dysfunction [^115EVE1k]. Urology (2006). High credibility.

Our objective was to assess the effects of customized instructions and dose optimization on treatment satisfaction and improvement in erectile function (EF) with sildenafil citrate in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) who had not been previously treated with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. This 8-week, multicenter, open-label, flexible-dose (25, 50, or 100 mg sildenafil) study included two phases.

- **Study design**: During phase 1, patients took 50 mg sildenafil and followed the sildenafil sample package instructions. In phase 2, the sildenafil dose could be adjusted based on efficacy and tolerability, and investigators provided additional customized instructions.

- **Primary efficacy variable**: The satisfaction rate was defined as patients responding "very" or "somewhat" satisfied to the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) Question 1. Other efficacy assessments included the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the percentage of successful sexual intercourse attempts.

Of 1109 men (mean age, 54 ± 13 years) treated, 867 completed the study. In phase 1, 75% of patients were very or somewhat satisfied with treatment. The mean EF domain score on the IIEF increased from 14.3 at baseline to 23.5, and 79% of sexual intercourse attempts were successful. In phase 2, 53% of patients increased their sildenafil dose to 100 mg, and 2% decreased to 25 mg. Satisfaction with sildenafil increased to 86%, 91% of sexual intercourse attempts were successful, and the mean IIEF EF domain score increased to 25.7.

### Oral sildenafil citrate (viagra) for erectile dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of harms [^111uvhgG]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To summarize and compare evidence on harms in sildenafil- and placebo-treated men with erectile dysfunction (ED), a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using an electronic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and Cochrane CENTRAL. The rates of any adverse events (AEs), the most commonly reported AEs, withdrawals because of adverse events, and serious adverse events were ascertained and compared between sildenafil and placebo groups. The results of men with ED were stratified by clinical condition(s). Statistical heterogeneity was explored, and meta-analyses based on the random-effects model were also performed.

A total of 49 RCTs were included. Sildenafil-treated men had a higher risk for all-cause AEs (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.76), headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances compared with placebo-treated men. The magnitude of excess risk was greater in fixed- than in flexible-dose trials. The rates of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events did not differ in sildenafil vs. placebo groups. A higher dose of sildenafil corresponded to a greater risk of AEs. The increased risk of harms was observed within and across clinically defined specific groups of patients.

There was a lack of RCTs reporting long-term (> 6 months) harms data. In short-term trials, men with ED randomized to sildenafil had an increased risk of all-cause any AEs, headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances. The exploration of different modes of dose optimization also highlighted these risks.

### Achieving treatment optimization with sildenafil citrate (Viagra) in patients with erectile dysfunction [^113hkdin]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Since its approval in 1998, sildenafil citrate (Viagra) has been shown to be efficacious in over 100 clinical trials involving more than 8000 men with erectile dysfunction (ED). In clinical practice, however, many men do not continue long-term use of sildenafil for a variety of reasons; thus, six different aspects of optimizing treatment with sildenafil are described here.

- **Intercourse success rates**: Considered a reflection of real-world effectiveness, assessed in 1276 patients with ED. Results indicated that the cumulative probability of achieving intercourse success with sildenafil increased with the number of attempts, reaching a plateau after approximately eight attempts.

- **Comprehensive disease management approach**: Included a medical history, physical examination, educational material about ED, modifications of risk factors/lifestyle changes, and counseling, which resulted in successful intercourse in 74% of 111 patients taking sildenafil.

- **Survey among primary care physicians**: Revealed that almost 50% did not routinely question their patients about ED symptoms, although it is known that most patients would prefer their physician to take the initiative.

- **Reeducation and counseling**: Overall, 55% of 137 men who were previously not successful with sildenafil became successful after reeducation and counseling. This included information on patient and partner expectations, how to properly take the drug, titration to maximum dose, and a minimum trial of eight attempts for efficacy assessment.

- **Comorbidities and medication**: Many men with ED have underlying comorbidities or take multiple medications that are risk factors.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^113wPEa9]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Tadalafil results for continuous efficacy outcomes are summarized with average results for the percentage of successful attempts at intercourse, the erectile function domain score, and the change in the erectile function domain score from baseline consistently available for a 20 mg fixed dose. However, these results were based on data from 109 men or fewer using 10 mg or less. The combined data for 10 mg and 20 mg fixed doses are reported as 10/20.

Results for dichotomous variables of efficacy and adverse events indicate that the number needed to treat (NNT) for improved erections was 1.9 for both the 20 mg fixed dose and the combined 10 plus 20 mg analysis. Improved erections were reported in 75% of 1651 men on tadalafil compared to 24% on placebo, with an NNT of 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.1).

Combining all information on 10 mg and 20 mg doses, all-cause and lack of efficacy withdrawals were lower with tadalafil than with placebo, with NNTp values of 15 (8.8 to 46) and 24 (14 to 69), respectively. However, adverse event withdrawals were higher with tadalafil than with placebo, with a number needed to harm (NNH) of 52 (29 to 260).

Particular adverse events were reported by 600 to 1800 men and were generally higher with tadalafil than with placebo, except for serious adverse events, which were less frequent with tadalafil.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114zqX7B]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

There was generally no information on intervals between dosing and the timing of intercourse, either for the speed of onset of effect or duration of effect. Table 10 shows the only consistent information concerning the timing of intercourse, from four studies comparing tadalafil 20 mg with placebo. The majority of attempts and successful attempts occurred within four hours, and about 90% within 12 hours. Success rates with tadalafil 20 mg and placebo did not differ, regardless of the timing of intercourse. No other studies provided useful information relating to the timing of intercourse after dosing.

### Minimal time to successful intercourse after sildenafil citrate: Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111ezzMs]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To determine the minimal time to successful intercourse after taking sildenafil citrate for erectile dysfunction (ED).

- **Methods**: Male patients with ED (mean age 60 years; mean ED duration 7.0 years) who were successfully treated with sildenafil (100 mg) for 2 months or longer were randomized to sildenafil (n = 115) or placebo (n = 113) for 4 weeks of double-blind treatment. Using a stopwatch, patients recorded the time needed to obtain an erection hard enough for sexual intercourse after taking the study drug at least 2 hours after eating.

- **Results**: Within 14 and 20 minutes of sildenafil dosing, 35% and 51% of sildenafil-treated patients, respectively, versus 22% and 30% of placebo-treated patients, respectively, had an erection that led to successful intercourse (P < 0.05 for both). The median time to erection leading to successful intercourse after sildenafil dosing was 36 minutes compared with 141 minutes for placebo.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, slightly more than one half of a population of prior sildenafil responders achieved an erection that led to successful sexual intercourse within 20 minutes of sildenafil administration, suggesting that the onset of action of sildenafil can be less than 30 minutes in men with ED.

### Pharmacology and drug interaction effects of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors: Focus on alpha-blocker interactions [^113Q9QyU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, three phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor agents are available worldwide for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED): sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Each of these agents is effective across a broad range of etiologies, including vasculogenic ED in men. Because the PDE5 enzyme is found within the vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of systemic arteries and veins, PDE5 inhibitors are mild vasodilators associated with small (and, in general, clinically insignificant) decreases in blood pressure.

However, these three agents are contraindicated in patients receiving organic nitrates due to the synergistic decrease in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) in the presence of organic nitrates. The duration of interaction between a PDE5 inhibitor and nitrate administration depends on the specific drug being studied. For instance, the interaction between sildenafil or vardenafil and nitroglycerin is no longer observed by 24 hours. A preliminary study with sildenafil and sublingual nitroglycerin suggested the interaction is no longer observable by 4 hours. In contrast, the interaction between tadalafil and nitroglycerin dissipates by 48 hours after tadalafil administration, consistent with the longer elimination half-life of the drug.

When PDE5 inhibitors are administered to patients with hypertension who are taking most antihypertensive agents (e.g. beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics), there are usually small additive decreases in blood pressure without a significant increase in adverse events.

### Modern pharmacotherapy for erectile dysfunction: evolving concepts with central and peripheral acting agents [^1127vFxY]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for men experiencing erectile dysfunction has undergone dramatic advances over the past five years with the introduction of an effective oral agent. Sildenafil has increased the pool of couples seeking treatment for this important health issue as well as expanding the numbers of physicians treating it. Research into the growing field of erectile dysfunction is expanding at a rapid pace. Independent investigators worldwide now regularly contribute to our body of scientific knowledge. Novel oral therapies targeted at specific points along the erectile cascade are undergoing pre-clinical and early phase registration trials with the promise of rapid action, extended duration of responsiveness, and an improved side effect profile.

In this review, we have highlighted recent information on the next generation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and summarized the evolving research into centrally acting agents, which may lead to effective combination therapy.

### Understanding erectile dysfunction medication preference studies [^116pmCkZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The existence of three phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors has resulted in an increase in the marketing of these drugs. This has led to a shift in focus from scientifically rigorous endpoints, such as efficacy and adverse event profiles, to patient preference.

Recent findings suggest that although no consensus currently exists regarding the correct methodology for preference studies, some basic guidelines should be adhered to. These include: (1) the double-blinding of drug administration; (2) non-biased drug administration instructions; (3) an adequately conducted crossover study; (4) comparison of equivalent doses; (5) standardized preference assessment; (6) declaration of patient demographics; and (7) rigorous statistical analysis. These factors are discussed in light of the three published preference studies.

In the final analysis, it remains unclear how preference studies impact clinician decision-making when confronted by a patient with erectile dysfunction.

### Management of sildenafil treatment failures [^114o1jcA]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Although oral type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors are considered first-line therapy for most causes of erectile dysfunction due to their high efficacy, ease of use, and acceptable safety profile, some individuals fail to respond, mainly due to end-organ failure. This communication reviews the management of sildenafil failures in light of recent advances.

- **Recent findings**: Sildenafil failures can be attributed to either lack of efficacy or side effects, with issues potentially involving the physician, patient, and the patient's partner. Physicians may contribute to sildenafil failure and discontinuation due to inadequate instructions, lack of adequate follow-up, suboptimal dosing, insufficient trial period, and inadequate clarification of safety issues. Studies have shown that progression of endothelial dysfunction and diminished cavernosal smooth muscle content are recognized organic factors that cause end-organ dysfunction and ultimately lead to treatment failure.

- **Summary**: Proper counseling, medication optimization, and modifying associated risk factors can provide success in men who initially failed sildenafil therapy for erectile dysfunction. Other treatment modalities that may be considered when sildenafil failure occurs include vacuum devices, intraurethral and intracavernosal administration of vasoactive drugs alone or combined with sildenafil. Penile prosthesis implantation is considered a last resort if all first-line and second-line therapies fail.

### Practice patterns in sildenafil prescribing [^111zXWE8]. Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

This study explores the incorporation of sildenafil into the treatment of common conditions such as psychosexual and erectile dysfunction (ED).

- **Methods**: The 2002 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were analyzed for visits where sildenafil was prescribed. Patient, visit, and provider characteristics for these visits were compared between those that documented a presenting complaint or diagnosis consistent with ED and those without documentation consistent with ED.

- **Results**: Of visits by men 30 years or older receiving sildenafil, 50% had no documented presenting complaint or diagnosis consistent with ED. No significant differences were found between those prescribed sildenafil with or without a reason for visit or diagnosis of ED based on age, race, or payment type. Individuals with more visits in the last 12 months were significantly less likely to have a recorded diagnosis consistent with ED. Urologists documented ED significantly more often than physicians in family medicine, internal medicine, and other specialties.

- **Conclusions**: Sildenafil is being prescribed at a significant number of visits without documentation of a reason for visit or diagnosis consistent with psychosexual or erectile dysfunction.

### New treatments for erectile dysfunction [^111LrZQs]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an increasingly common problem, affecting up to 30 million American men. This largely results from increased risk factors and an aging population. ED is now also recognized as a marker for cardiovascular disease, and the ED patient should be thoroughly evaluated for coexisting vascular disease. The pathophysiology of ED is becoming better understood, largely as a result of the development of new therapies. Once the underlying processes are known, more selective targeting of these will lead to novel "designer drugs".

### An update on new oral PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction [^114LHhf4]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The management of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been revolutionized by the discovery of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, which have been commercially available for more than a decade and are the first-line therapeutic option for men with ED. Sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil were approved by the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. FDA for the treatment of ED due to their high efficacy rates and favorable safety profiles. However, despite the successful treatment of more than 50 million patients with ED worldwide using these PDE5 inhibitors, certain men — particularly those with severe neurologic damage, diabetes mellitus, or severe vascular disease — remain resistant to the currently available drugs and require more invasive treatments, such as intracavernosal injection therapy.

Partly as a consequence of these limitations, research into alternative therapeutic approaches continues. This includes the development of new PDE5 inhibitors, centrally acting pharmaceutical agents, and the application of molecular technologies such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate patient preference between tadalafil and sildenafil [^113AtnE5]. European Urology (2004).

To assess patient preference for erectile dysfunction treatment between sildenafil and tadalafil, each drug was administered with its respective dosing instructions. The study also evaluated patient preference for dosing instructions during tadalafil therapy.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover study consisting of four treatment arms. Due to differing dosing instructions for sildenafil and tadalafil, a unique methodology using sham placebo arms was employed to maintain blinding. To assess drug preference, 219 patients were randomized to receive either sildenafil 50 mg or tadalafil 20 mg, with dosing instructions reflecting their respective product profiles. To assess dosing instruction preference during tadalafil therapy, 46 patients were randomized to tadalafil 20 mg with either tadalafil or sildenafil dosing instructions. After 12 weeks, patients crossed over to the alternate treatment.

- **Dosing instruction preference**: After 4 weeks of each treatment, all patients following sildenafil dosing instructions were offered the opportunity for an upward dose titration. In a double-blind manner, patients who requested this received additional capsules. To mimic clinical practice, only 35% of patients taking sildenafil in each treatment period and country received additional double-blind active medication.

- **Treatment selection**: Following the crossover treatment period, patients chose their preferred double-blind treatment, along with dosing instructions, for the 12-week extension period.

### The efficacy of sildenafil citrate following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: temporal considerations [^111rhvEf]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction is a recognized complication of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Sildenafil citrate is a well-known management strategy for erectile dysfunction and has been found to be efficacious across a wide spectrum of comorbidities, including post-radiation erectile dysfunction. This study aimed to define the efficacy of sildenafil citrate in patients with erectile dysfunction following radiation therapy for prostate cancer and assess the impact of the interval after radiation on the success of this therapy.

Baseline and follow-up data on 110 patients presenting with erectile dysfunction secondary to radiation for prostate cancer were obtained. A total of 68 patients underwent 3-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation (CRT), while 42 underwent brachytherapy (BT) without androgen deprivation. All patients were considered to have erectile dysfunction after radiotherapy, as assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and they were prescribed sildenafil citrate. The mean time ± SD between the completion of radiation therapy and the initiation of sildenafil was 8 ± 4 months. The response to sildenafil was assessed using the IIEF questionnaire. Within and between group comparisons were conducted at three time points: less than 12 months, 13 to 24 months, and 25 to 36 months following the completion of radiation therapy.

The respective response rates in men who underwent BT/CRT at the three time points of less than 12, 13 to 24, and 25 to 36 months were 76%/68%, 54%/46%, and 44%/38%, respectively. Mean IIEF erectile function doma

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 as a pharmacologic target in erectile dysfunction [^1125QmuQ]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The scientific rationale of pharmacologically inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) is reviewed. Published literature on the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway for penile erection and on PDE5 inhibition using sildenafil as the model for pharmacologic PDE5 inhibition are assessed. The key second messenger in the mediation of penile erection is cGMP. PDE5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the corpus cavernosum, and cGMP is its primary substrate. Therefore, in men with ED, elevation of cGMP in corpus cavernosal tissue via selective inhibition of cGMP-specific PDE5 is a means of improving erectile function at minimal risk of adverse events. This approach is validated by the clinical efficacy and safety of sildenafil, the pioneering drug for selective PDE5 inhibitor therapy for ED.

Sildenafil exhibits inhibitory potency against PDE5 and a tenfold lower dose-related inhibitory potency against rod outer segment PDE6, the predominant phosphodiesterase in the phototransduction cascade in rods. Thus, its pharmacologic profile is predictable, with a close correlation between pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Clinically, sildenafil improves erectile function in a large percentage of men with ED. The most common adverse events are due to PDE5 inhibition in vascular and visceral smooth muscle; similar adverse events are expected during therapeutic use of all PDE5 inhibitors. As free sildenafil plasma concentrations approach concentrations sufficient to inhibit retinal PDE6, usually at higher therapeutic doses, transient effects may occur.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors in male sexual dysfunction [^115NnRDP]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors are preferred by most men for the oral treatment of erectile dysfunction. In many guidelines, this therapy is recommended as first-line treatment due to its convenience, high efficacy, and low rates of side effects. Sildenafil was the first drug introduced for erectile dysfunction treatment in 1998. Recently, two new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and tadalafil, received approval in the European Union, with U.S. approval expected this year.

Sildenafil has proven to be a very effective medicinal product. Initial studies indicate that vardenafil and tadalafil have demonstrated efficacy comparable to that of sildenafil. However, fewer data are available evaluating the adverse effects of vardenafil and tadalafil, particularly regarding their long-term use and effects in high-risk groups. Interestingly, vardenafil and tadalafil display higher potency than sildenafil. Furthermore, tadalafil has been associated with an erectogenic potential lasting for more than 24 hours, allowing patients the possibility of engaging in sexual activity more than once following a single drug administration.

In the future, the new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and tadalafil, in addition to sildenafil, will play an important role in managing erectile dysfunction, contingent upon the patient's health profile.

### Timing of dose relative to sexual intercourse attempt in previous sildenafil citrate users treated with tadalafil [^1129vQGy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, has an extended period of effectiveness, up to 36 hours, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The study evaluated changes in behavior of long-term sildenafil users by assessing the timing of dose relative to sexual intercourse attempts during treatment with sildenafil and tadalafil.

This open-label study was conducted in men with ED and a history of at least six weeks of prior sildenafil use in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Patients continued sildenafil treatment for four weeks, then switched to tadalafil for eight weeks. Timing of sexual intercourse attempt relative to dose was assessed through patient diaries for the final four weeks of each treatment period. Patients continued their treatment of choice in an extension period.

A total of 2,760 men (mean age 54.4 years) with a median duration of prior sildenafil use of 474 days were enrolled. Significant increases in median time from dose to intercourse attempt were observed when changing treatment from sildenafil citrate (1.21 hours) to tadalafil (3.25 hours; P < 0.05). The frequency of intercourse attempts more than four hours after dose was considerably higher during the tadalafil assessment period compared to the sildenafil assessment period. Similar daily cycles of frequency of dosing and intercourse attempts were observed in all study periods and were characteristic of patient behavior.

### A 4-year update on the safety of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) [^115qjgFr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for erectile dysfunction. Despite its established safety profile, concern about its cardiovascular safety persists among some physicians and the general public. This concern has stemmed primarily from sporadic reports of adverse events published in the literature and sensationalized by the media. However, the only absolute contraindication for sildenafil is the use of nitrates. Because sildenafil has been on the market for 4 years and under clinical investigation for even longer, we can now evaluate its long-term safety in men who have been taking the drug for several years.

- **Reassessing the overall safety profile**: We reassess the overall safety profile of sildenafil by reviewing the initial controlled clinical trials and open-label studies. We present new data from patients who have been exposed to sildenafil for up to 4.5 years. We also evaluate the results from independent postmarketing studies.

- **Cardiovascular-specific results**: We review the cardiovascular-specific results from the clinical trials, long-term extension, and postmarketing studies.

- **Effects on the visual system**: We review the specific effects on the visual system based on findings from studies conducted during drug development and post marketing.

### Psychosocial outcomes and drug attributes affecting treatment choice in men receiving sildenafil citrate and tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study [^114PCRjg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) and tadalafil are efficacious and well-tolerated treatments for erectile dysfunction (ED), preference studies have shown that patients may favor one medication over the other.

- **Aim**: To determine whether psychosocial outcomes differed when men with ED received tadalafil compared with sildenafil.

- **Main outcome measures**: Measures included a treatment preference question, Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (PAIRS), and Drug Attribute Questionnaire.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, open-label, crossover study. After a 4-week baseline, men with ED (N = 367; mean age = 54 years; naïve to type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy) were randomized to receive tadalafil for 12 weeks followed by sildenafil for 12 weeks, or vice versa (8-week dose optimization/4-week assessment phases). During dose optimization, patients started with 10 mg tadalafil or 25 or 50 mg sildenafil and could titrate to their optimal dose (10 or 20 mg tadalafil; 25, 50, or 100 mg sildenafil). Medications were taken as needed. Patients completing both 12-week periods chose which medication to continue during an 8-week extension.

- **Results**: Of 291 men completing both treatment periods, 71% (N = 206) chose tadalafil and 29% (N = 85) chose sildenafil (P < 0.001) for the 8-week extension. When taking tadalafil compared with sildenafil, men had higher mean endpoint scores on PAIRS Sexual Self-Confidence (tadalafil = 2.91 vs. sildenafil = 2.75; P < 0.001) and Spontaneity (tadalafil = 3.32 vs. sildenafil = 3.17; P < 0.001) Domains.

### Vardenafil [^113YcJzZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Vardenafil was evaluated in four major double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel design, multicenter trials in 2,431 men aged 20 to 83 (mean age 57 years; 78% White, 7% Black, 2% Asian, 3% Hispanic, and 10% Other/Unknown). The doses of vardenafil in these studies were 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. Two of these trials were conducted in the general erectile dysfunction (ED) population, and two in special ED populations (one in patients with diabetes mellitus and one in post-prostatectomy patients). Vardenafil was dosed without regard to meals on an as-needed basis in men with ED, many of whom had multiple other medical conditions. The primary endpoints were assessed at 3 months.

The primary efficacy assessment in all four major trials was conducted using the Erectile Function (EF) Domain score of the validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire and two questions from the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP): the ability to achieve vaginal penetration (SEP2) and the ability to maintain an erection long enough for successful intercourse (SEP3).

In all four fixed-dose efficacy trials, vardenafil showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the EF Domain, SEP2, and SEP3 scores compared to placebo. The mean baseline EF Domain score in these trials was 11.8 (scores range from 0 to 30, where lower scores represent more severe disease). Vardenafil (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) was effective in all age categories (< 45, 45 to < 65, and ≥ 65 years) and was also effective regardless of race (White, Black).

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^115zvtRd]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Withdrawal from studies for any cause — whether due to a lack of effect or adverse events — was commonly reported. However, the number of men experiencing at least one adverse event and the occurrence of severe adverse events were recorded in only a minority of trials. Serious adverse events were documented more frequently in tadalafil and vardenafil trials than in sildenafil trials, potentially reflecting the recency of the studies. The use of a cut-off level for reporting individual adverse events limited the available information for these outcomes.

Analysis of the individual PDE-5 inhibitors showed that the two top doses, including dose-optimization schedules, had very similar efficacy across all three interventions. This consistency justified pooling information from the two top doses.

Using this strategy to compare the three PDE-5 inhibitors demonstrated remarkable consistency among them, based on the available data for any commonly reported outcome. Absolute rates for placebo varied little, indicating no major difference between patients studied. The only exception to this was for withdrawals, where tadalafil and vardenafil studies exhibited higher withdrawal rates with both placebo and PDE-5 inhibitor compared to sildenafil. There was no obvious reason for this discrepancy. It was perhaps surprising that sildenafil compared well with tadalafil and vardenafil, given the greater number of conditions studied, the wider geographical spread, and that tadalafil and vardenafil studies employed a form of enriched enrollment. Overall, sildenafil offered the most information and showed a trend towards better efficacy and lower withdrawal rates.

### Therapeutic effectiveness and patient satisfaction after 6 months of treatment with tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil: Results from the erectile dysfunction observational study (EDOS) [^114S5nKV]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

This observational study was conducted across Europe to assess health outcomes in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) who took tadalafil, sildenafil citrate (sildenafil), or vardenafil HCl (vardenafil) for six months.

- **Methods**: Therapy effectiveness and patient satisfaction were evaluated using established and new questions on erectile function. Behavioral, psychological, and relationship outcomes were assessed using the short form of the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (SF-PAIRS).

- **Results**: In nine European countries, across 904 sites, 8047 patients were enrolled, and 94% (7560) selected either tadalafil (5315), sildenafil (1252), or vardenafil (993) for treatment at baseline. Of the 7560, 3998 (52.9%) took the same drug for six months. Baseline characteristics across the three treatment groups were comparable: mean age approximately 56 years, moderate or severe ED, and mean International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain score about 13. Tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil were therapeutically effective and improved patient satisfaction in the 40–58% of men who completed six months of a single therapy. Patients taking tadalafil consistently had numerically higher levels of therapeutic effectiveness and satisfaction compared with patients who took sildenafil or vardenafil. The three cohorts had statistically significant changes from baseline in response to SF-PAIRS, and there were significant differences in favor of tadalafil among cohorts in the Time Concerns domain.

- **Conclusion**: In a large observational study that mimics a routine clinical setting, tadalafil demonstrated numerically higher levels of therapeutic effectiveness and patient satisfaction compared to sildenafil or vardenafil.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^115T5SUa]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Combining all information on 10 mg and 20 mg with dose-optimized regimens, adverse event outcomes were reported in 1,000 to 2,400 men and were generally higher with vardenafil than with placebo, except for serious adverse events which were not different; men with at least one adverse event were not commonly reported in these trials. The lowest (worst) number needed to harm (NNH) was 8.0 (6.9 to 9.6) for men reporting flushing. Headache was the most commonly reported individual adverse event in 15% of men taking vardenafil, followed by flushing reported in 13% and rhinitis in 7.9%. The majority of trials reported that adverse events were mostly mild or moderate and frequently transient.

- **Comparing different treatments**: Continuous outcomes are compared in Table 8, which documents the number of trials and patients for which the consistently reported outcomes were available, together with the weighted mean result for both placebo and the top doses plus dose-optimized regimens of individual PDE-5 inhibitors. There was remarkable consistency. For instance, the percentage of successful attempts at intercourse with placebo varied narrowly between 23% and 28%. The three PDE-5 inhibitors had success rates of 65% for sildenafil, 62% for tadalafil, and 59% for vardenafil. The final erectile function domain score and change from baseline were highly consistent for both placebo and PDE-5 inhibitors.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111ofutQ]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

How useful is this method of indirect comparison of equivalent doses of PDE-5 inhibitors? It is clearly superior to examining the inadequate information from direct comparisons, and to any superficial examination of individual trials, which are each subject to the random play of chance. Large collections of data from high-quality, valid trials are less subject to the vagaries of chance than smaller individual studies. While large direct comparisons may be better, evidence shows that when large amounts of trial data exist, direct comparisons yield no different result from indirect comparisons. Further investigation of differences between comparable doses would require access to detailed clinical trial reports to report outcomes available but not published.

More important than direct or indirect comparison of different PDE-5 inhibitors is the question of the utility of outcomes. With over 12,000 men in clinical trials over a decade, it is surprising that there is no consensus on what constitutes a useful outcome and how it should be reported. Individual patient analysis of clinical trial data illustrates how standard trials could be better reported, and this approach has already been applied to PDE-5 inhibitors.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114tjSqo]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

The other major difference was in the reporting of outcomes of studies, which varied greatly between the three PDE-5 inhibitors. Common outcomes were responses to a global question about improved erections ("Has the treatment you have been taking over the past four weeks improved your erections?") and scores and changes in scores for the erectile function domain. Some outcomes were frequently reported in trials of one treatment but not others. For example, final scores and changes from baseline for IIEF questions 3 and 4 were reported for most sildenafil trials, but not for tadalafil or vardenafil trials.

There were clear differences in the philosophy of reporting of efficacy and harm, principally between the first PDE-5 inhibitor, sildenafil, and the subsequent ones, tadalafil and vardenafil. We could find no explanation for this, nor any philosophical discussion about the clinical and practical importance of different outcomes. Few studies provided an estimate of how many men had outcomes approximating erections sufficiently rigid for penetration followed by successful intercourse. This simple pragmatic outcome is more relevant to affected men, their partners, and their professional advisers than an average movement on a scale like IIEF, which itself comprises a number of different questions.

Useful outcomes, like the number of men in whom the proportion of successful attempts at sexual intercourse was more than 40% or 60% or more, known to be recorded in clinical trial reports for sildenafil, were almost never reported in published papers.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^115NPifd]. The Journal of Urology (2018). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of the literature using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases (search dates 1/1/1965 to 7/29/17) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction. Evidence-based statements were based on the strength of the evidence graded as A, B, or C, and were designated as Strong, Moderate, and Conditional Recommendations, with additional statements presented as Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions.

- **Results**: The American Urological Association has developed an evidence-based guideline on the management of erectile dysfunction. This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm.

- **Conclusions**: Using the shared decision-making process as a cornerstone for care, all patients should be informed of all treatment modalities that are not contraindicated, regardless of invasiveness or irreversibility, as potential first-line treatments. For each treatment, the clinician should ensure that the man and his partner have a full understanding of the benefits and risks/burdens associated with that choice.

### Treatment strategy for "non-responders" to tadalafil and vardenafil: a real-life study [^112FE6Bx]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To develop and test a step-wise treatment strategy for erectile dysfunction "non-responders" to tadalafil and vardenafil, a study was conducted.

- **Material and methods**: Two groups, tadalafil-treated (TG) and vardenafil-treated (VG), each consisting of 100 consecutive patients complaining of non-response to treatments, were enrolled in a three-phase study. Phase 1 involved identifying inadequate use and rechallenging patients after providing detailed usage instructions. In Phase 2, true non-responders received new instructions based on the drugs' pharmacologic profiles. For TGs, doses were taken at least 2 hours before intercourse; VGs were dosed only in a fasted state. Remaining non-responders entered Phase 3: continuous administration of 20 mg tadalafil every other day, or 20 mg vardenafil every day for 2 weeks. Efficacy was assessed through positive responses to two questions: "Were your erections rigid, and did they last long enough to have successful intercourse?" and "Do you want to repeat your prescription?"

- **Results**: In the tadalafil group, inappropriate use was recognized in 32 patients; 14 (43.75%) responded after adequate instruction. In Phase 2, 32 of 86 patients (37.2%) who timed intercourse at least 2 hours after dose intake responded. In Phase 3, 6 of 86 patients (11.1%) responded to continuous administration. The overall salvage rate was 52 of 100 (52%). In the vardenafil group, inappropriate use was identified in 38 patients; 12 (31.58%) responded after appropriate instruction. In Phase 2, 22 of 88 patients (25%) responded to dosing in a fasted state. In Phase 3, 12 of 66 patients (18.2%) responded to daily dosing. The overall salvage rate was 46 of 100 (46%).

- **Conclusions**: Following the proposed treatment strategy showed improvements in response rates for both tadalafil and vardenafil groups, suggesting that tailored patient instructions and dose timing can enhance treatment efficacy for "non-responders".

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114cmtLu]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

We sought randomised trials of three PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) with placebo or active comparator in men with erectile dysfunction of any causation. Previous systematic reviews were used to source trials or trial data, supplemented by electronic searches of PubMed (to June 2005) and the Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2005) using drug names and randomised trial as keywords.

For a trial's inclusion, it had to be randomised and double-blind, involve one of the three oral PDE-5 inhibitors in men with erectile dysfunction, be conducted in a home setting, last three weeks or longer, have a minimum of ten men per group, and report useful information on efficacy or adverse events. Abstracts were read, and potentially useful reports were retrieved in full paper copy. Decisions on inclusion or exclusion were made by consensus. No information was taken from posters or abstracts, and studies were read carefully to avoid including duplicate material. Studies were scored for reporting quality using a common method utilising reporting of randomisation, blinding, and withdrawals. The maximum score possible was 5 points, and no study could be included with fewer than 2 points.

Information extracted from studies included the number of men studied, the cause of erectile dysfunction, and the country where the study was performed. Any type of outcome was initially extracted from the studies, in continuous or dichotomous form, and with any dispersion information available. Outcomes could be reported in tables, in graphs, or in text. The following outcomes were sought particularly:

### Sildenafil [^111GQbms]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sildenafil, marketed for both pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and erectile dysfunction. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Cardiovascular events**: In postmarketing experience with sildenafil at doses indicated for erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, have been reported in temporal association with the use of the drug. Most of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, with some occurring shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported hours to days after use with sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these or other factors.

- **Nervous system**: Seizure and seizure recurrence.

- **Ophthalmologic**: Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Positive effect of counseling and dose adjustment in patients with erectile dysfunction who failed treatment with sildenafil [^115XCG1q]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Many patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) discontinue sildenafil use due to perceived treatment failure. This study examined whether counseling and maximal dosing (100 mg) could enhance treatment compliance and potentially improve outcomes.

Patients were recruited via newspaper advertisements and referred to five ED centers nationwide. Their previous experiences with sildenafil were documented. After receiving a detailed explanation of the drug's nature and action, participants were invited to join the study. Instructions on drug use were provided during each visit, where four 100 mg sildenafil tablets were dispensed. Treatment outcomes were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire after taking 4 and 8 tablets. At two ED centers, a short video with sexual counseling content was shown between visits.

The study cohort consisted of 220 patients aged 27–88 years. Most reported receiving limited or no instructions on drug use when sildenafil was first prescribed. A significant increase in IIEF erectile function domain scores (EFDS) was observed between visits 1, 2, and 3, with mean scores of 10.96 ± 0.40, 16.73 ± 0.51, and 17.82 ± 0.55, respectively. By the end of the study, 23.6% of patients achieved normal erectile function. Treatment success was most influenced by age and initial ED severity.

Counseling and dose adjustment were directly influential in achieving an excellent response to a second trial of sildenafil in patients.

### British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines on the management of erectile dysfunction in men-2017 [^114Ck5cL]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2018). High credibility.

This document updates the 2008 British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM) guidelines.

- **Aim**: The primary aim is to provide up-to-date guidance for U.K. and international health care professionals managing male sexual dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Source information was obtained from peer-reviewed articles, meetings, and presentations. A search of Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Reviews was conducted using search terms such as "hypogonadism", "eugonadal or hypogonadism or hypogonadal or gonadal", and "low or lower testosterone", starting from 2009 with a cut-off date of September 2017.

- **Outcomes**: This update offers evidence-based statements and recommendations for clinicians.

- **Results**: Expert guidance for health care professionals managing male sexual dysfunction is included.

- **Clinical translation**: U.K. management has been largely influenced by non-evidence guidance from National Health Service departments, primarily based on providing access to care limited by resources. The 2008 BSSM guidelines have been widely quoted in U.K. policy decision-making.

- **Conclusions**: There is now overwhelming evidence that erectile dysfunction is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. Therefore, newly presenting patients should be thoroughly evaluated for cardiovascular and endocrine risk factors, which should be managed accordingly. Measurement of fasting serum glucose, lipid profile, and morning total testosterone should be considered mandatory in all newly presenting patients. Patients attending their primary care physician with chronic cardiovascular disease should be asked about erectile dysfunction.

Vardenafil

Results for continuous efficacy outcomes for vardenafil are detailed below. Average results for the percentage of successful attempts at intercourse, the erectile function domain score, and changes in the erectile function domain score from baseline were consistently available for the optimised dose, and for some trials with fixed doses. Combined data for 10 mg and 20 mg fixed doses and dose-optimised regimens are reported (10/20).

- **Dichotomous variables of efficacy and adverse events**: Results are shown in Table 7. The analysis combined dose-optimised regimens with the 20 mg fixed dose since the majority of patients on dose-optimised regimens used 20 mg.

	- **Summary of dichotomous outcomes for vardenafil**:
		- NNT is in standard font, NNTp in bold, and NNH in bold italic. No NNT/NNTp/NNH was calculated unless there was a statistically significant difference.

For efficacy, the number needed to treat (NNT) for improved erections was consistently 2.0 for all doses above 5 mg, indicating comparable efficacy and justifying the combination of those doses. Combining all data on 10 mg and 20 mg with dose-optimised regimens, improved erections were reported in 71% of the 2,856 men on vardenafil and 22% on placebo. The NNT was 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 2.2).

When considering all data on 10 mg and 20 mg with dose-optimised regimens, both all-cause and lack of efficacy withdrawals, in approximately 500 to 2,300 men, were lower with vardenafil than with placebo. The NNTp values were 7.7 (6.0 to 11) and 11 (9.0 to 16), respectively. Adverse event withdrawals remain incompletely reported.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111ejDpg]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

All studies provided background information on participants. Typically, men had to have a history of erectile dysfunction of at least three to six months, and the average age was generally mid-50s or older. Some studies had enriched enrollment, where previous unsuccessful treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor was an exclusion criterion. This applied to five of eight tadalafil studies and six of seven vardenafil studies [see Additional file 1], but none of the sildenafil studies. One vardenafil study included only men previously unresponsive to sildenafil.

Studies almost always documented that the PDE-5 inhibitor was to be taken as needed, with a maximum of one treatment a day, and included additional instructions for sildenafil and vardenafil, specifying that the dose be taken about an hour before intercourse. Some studies provided information on the number of doses actually taken. Many dose-optimized studies reported the proportion of men on the maximum dose at the end of the study, which was always over 50% and typically 60–80%. Trial duration was typically four to 12 weeks, with 12 weeks being the most common duration.

- **Conditions causing erectile dysfunction**: A number of different conditions were studied. All three PDE-5 inhibitors had a similar proportion of men with mixed aetiology (organic, psychogenic, or mixed) and diabetes. Erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy was studied for tadalafil and vardenafil, but not sildenafil; none of a number of studies of sildenafil after prostatectomy could be included, mainly because they were not randomised.

### Sildenafil: From angina to erectile dysfunction to pulmonary hypertension and beyond [^114SyiYC]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2006). Low credibility.

In less than 20 years, the first selective type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor, sildenafil, has evolved from a potential anti-angina drug to an on-demand oral treatment for erectile dysfunction (Viagra), and more recently to a new orally active treatment for pulmonary hypertension (Revatio). Here we describe the key milestones in the development of sildenafil for these diverse medical conditions, discuss the advances in science and clinical medicine that have accompanied this journey, and consider possible future indications for this versatile drug.

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in erectile dysfunction: The proper drug for the proper patient [^1137F5N7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common multidimensional disorder affecting men worldwide. Physical illness, reaction to life stresses, or an unhappy couple relationship can influence clinical outcome. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are recognized as efficacious and well-tolerated, serving as the first-line treatment for ED. Sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are the most widely used and studied PDE5 inhibitors. Data acquired during a routine diagnostic workup for ED should be considered when choosing the best PDE5 inhibitor for the individual patient, creating an individualized treatment plan, and moving beyond "experience-based" subjective opinion and unfounded ideas regarding currently available drugs.

- **Aim**: As the process of matching a given patient's profile to any selected PDE5 inhibitor often relies more on a physician's personal convictions than on solid evidence, the aim of this review is to identify the main clinical, demographic, and relational factors influencing the choice of the PDE5 inhibitor to be used for the treatment of ED.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search and treatment guidelines were evaluated systematically.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main clinical, cultural, and demographic factors to be considered for the treatment of ED have been identified.

- **Results**: Main factors influencing the choice of treatment for ED have been described. A short list of items may help in choosing the right PDE5 inhibitor for different patients in daily clinical practice.

### Efficacy, safety, and use of sildenafil in urologic practice [^112y1sbV]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy, side effects, renewal patterns, and other relevant practice issues of sildenafil use in urologic practice after its approval and release for public use, consecutive male patients with erectile dysfunction were evaluated by one urologist. Sildenafil was prescribed when appropriate, and patients were monitored at two follow-up visits: the first at 3 to 4 months and the second at 3 to 8 months (6 to 12 months after the initial prescription). At these follow-up visits, patients completed a questionnaire assessing their improvement in erectile function, satisfaction with sildenafil, and expectations. Data were collected on side effects, medical history, tablets taken, subsequent treatment in cases of sildenafil failure, and renewal patterns.

Results showed that 164 and 82 patients were evaluated at the first and second follow-up visits, respectively. Patients used a mean of 1.2 to 1.4 tablets per week. An improvement in erection was noted in 68.2% of patients at the first follow-up visit and in 80.5% at the second follow-up visit. Sildenafil was renewed by 62% of patients at the first follow-up and by 78% at the second follow-up. For those who did not renew, a lack of efficacy was the most frequent reason cited. Intracavernous injection therapy was the most common treatment after sildenafil failure, followed by penile implants.

In conclusion, sildenafil is an effective and safe drug for treating erectile dysfunction, as evidenced by patient outcomes at both follow-up visits.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^113A1ecY]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

The first stage was a detailed analysis of outcomes for each intervention, followed by a comparison between interventions where there was sufficient information to make the comparison valid. To make comparisons between different interventions, similar outcomes and similar intensities of intervention have to be compared in similar patients. Only those outcomes with a reasonably high and consistent reporting frequency were available for comparison.

- **Individual analyses: sildenafil**: Results for continuous efficacy outcomes for sildenafil are shown in Table 4. Average results for percentage successful attempts at intercourse, for the erectile function domain score, and for the change in the erectile function domain score from baseline were consistently available for the optimised dose, and for some trials with a fixed dose. Combined data for 50 mg and 100 mg fixed doses and dose optimised regimens are reported (50/100).

Results for dichotomous variables of efficacy and adverse events for sildenafil are shown in Table 5. Here, data were available for most studies. The analysis combined dose-optimised regimens with 100 mg fixed dose, since the bulk of patients on dose-optimised regimens were on 100 mg.

NNT is given in standard font, NNTp in bold, and NNH in bold italic. No NNT/NNTp/NNH was calculated unless there was a statistically significant difference. For efficacy, the NNT for improved erections was the same at 1.9 for all doses.

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^112pULpa]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for erectile dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend offering the following interventions:

- **Discontinuation of medication**: Discontinue drugs associated with erectile dysfunction, such as α-blockers, or drugs causing anorgasmia, such as SSRIs. It is important to recognize that dopaminergic therapy can have both negative and positive effects on this symptom.

- **Phosphodiesterase inhibitors**: Consider offering sildenafil, 50–100 mg, 1 hour before sex for patients with Parkinson's disease and erectile dysfunction.

- **Alternative medications**: Consider offering other drugs such as tadalafil, 10 mg, 30 minutes to 12 hours before sex, or vardenafil, 10 mg, 1 hour before sex as alternative choices.

- **Apomorphine**: Consider administering apomorphine injections 5–10 minutes before sex as an alternative option in some patients.

- **Intracavernous injections**: Consider administering intracavernous injections of papaverine or alprostadil in selected patients.

### Results of a World Health Organization scoping of sexual dysfunction-related guidelines: What exists and what is needed [^1168VrJR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Treatment recommendations for men vs women**:
	**Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Guideline**: American Urological Association. Evaluation and Diagnosis: "Men presenting with symptoms of ED should undergo a thorough medical, sexual, and psychosocial history; a physical examination; and selective laboratory testing".

	- **Process of care for the identification of sexual concerns and problems in women**: International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health. Engaging with the patient (Step 1 of 4): "The first step is to elicit a narrative description of the problem and its effect on the patient's life, emotional state, and relationships. The goal is to help the patient discover and describe her distress, her functional impairment, and the effect the problem is having on her life".

Across recommendations, 48% included some form of evidence assessment. An additional 10% were considered "clinical principles", meaning "best practices" agreed upon by clinicians, independent of whether there was evidence; for example, counseling men that erectile dysfunction can be associated with cardiovascular disease and other underlying conditions. The remaining 42% of recommendations were based on "expert opinion", representing consensus built from the experience, training, and judgment of clinicians developing the guideline.

### Oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and hormonal treatments for erectile dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HveZe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common male sexual disorder. The relative benefits and harms of pharmacologic therapies for ED, as well as the value of hormonal testing in men with ED, are uncertain.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the efficacy and harms of oral phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and hormonal treatments for ED, and assess the effect of measuring serum hormone levels on treatment outcomes for ED.

- **Data sources**: English-language studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, AMED, and SCOPUS through April 2009. Trial reference lists also were scanned.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of oral PDE-5 inhibitors and hormonal treatment for ED, and observational studies reporting measurement of serum hormone levels, prevalence of hormonal abnormalities, or both in men with ED.

- **Data extraction**: Two independent reviewers abstracted data on study, participant, and treatment characteristics; efficacy and harms outcomes; and prevalence of hormonal abnormalities.

- **Data synthesis**: Data, primarily from short-term trials (≤ 12 weeks), indicate that PDE-5 inhibitors were more effective than placebo in improving sexual intercourse success (69.0% vs. 35.0%). The proportion of men with improved erections was significantly greater among those treated with PDE-5 inhibitors (range, 67.0% to 89.0%) than with placebo (range, 27.0% to 35.0%). The PDE-5 inhibitors were associated with increased risk for any adverse events compared with placebo (for example, relative risk with sildenafil, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.53 to 1.93]).

### British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines on the management of erectile dysfunction [^11247Gur]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

UK primary care physicians are required to follow authoritative endorsed guidelines as part of their terms of service. The major influence on the management of erectile dysfunction in primary and secondary care between 1999 and 2007 has been the Department of Health's "guidance on good practice", a non-evidence-based document, essentially defining patients who qualify for government-funded treatment.

- **Aim**: To provide clinically based guidelines relevant to UK primary and secondary healthcare professionals in their daily practice.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of seven UK experts, including two primary care physicians from the British Society for Sexual Medicine, met for two full-day meetings between September 2006 and April 2007. Each member was allocated disease areas related to their specialty. Feedback and approval of all sections among panel members were facilitated by the chairman. Source information was obtained from peer-reviewed articles, meetings, and presentations. Articles were chosen from electronically searching the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase for randomized controlled clinical trials and graded according to the level of evidence.

- **Results**: Patient-reported sexual activity, satisfaction with sexual activity (Male Sexual Health Questionnaire), and treatment expectations were evaluated. Additionally, urologists' subjective assessments of the importance given by their patients to erectile dysfunction and the timing proposed for starting ED treatment were considered. After the second full-day meeting in January 2007, the final version was approved by panel members and made available for healthcare professionals.

- **Initial titration in physician's office**: Erectile dysfunction of vasculogenic, psychogenic, or mixed etiology involves starting dosage titration at 2.5 mcg of alprostadil. If a partial response is observed, the dose may be increased by 2.5 mcg to 5 mcg and then in increments of 5 to 10 mcg, based on erectile response, until the dose that produces an erection suitable for intercourse, without exceeding a duration of 1 hour, is achieved. If there is no response to the initial 2.5-mcg dose, the second dose may be increased to 7.5 mcg, followed by increments of 5 to 10 mcg. The patient must remain in the physician's office until complete detumescence occurs. If there is no response, the next higher dose may be administered within 1 hour. If there is a response, a minimum 1-day interval is required before administering the next dose.

- **Erectile dysfunction of pure neurogenic etiology (spinal cord injury)**: Dosage titration should begin at 1.25 mcg of alprostadil. The dose may be increased by 1.25 mcg to 2.5 mcg, followed by an increment of 2.5 mcg to a dose of 5 mcg, and then in 5-mcg increments until a suitable erection for intercourse, not exceeding a 1-hour duration, is achieved. The patient must stay in the physician's office until complete detumescence occurs. If there is no response, the next higher dose may be administered within 1 hour. If there is a response, a minimum 1-day interval is required before the subsequent dose.

### Do food and dose timing affect the efficacy of sildenafil? A randomized placebo-controlled study [^112hENwc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Sildenafil citrate has been used worldwide by men with erectile dysfunction. The prescribing information for sildenafil suggests ingestion 1 hour before sexual activity and also notes reduced maximum plasma concentration and delayed time to maximum concentration following ingestion with a high-fat meal. The clinical impact of co-ingestion of food and these factors has never been evaluated.

- **Aim**: To determine, using a naturalistic study design, whether sildenafil taken 1 hour before or during a meal compared with usual ingestion 30–60 minutes before sexual activity affects efficacy or patient satisfaction.

- **Methods**: After a 1–2-week washout, 48 men (29–79 years old), currently satisfied with sildenafil, followed each of four regimens:
	1. (A) Sildenafil 1 hour before a meal and placebo 30–60 minutes before planned coitus vs.
	2. (B) Placebo 1 hour before a meal and sildenafil 30–60 minutes before coitus; and
	3. (C) Sildenafil during a meal and placebo 30–60 minutes before coitus vs.
	4. (D) Placebo during a meal and sildenafil 30–60 minutes before coitus.

	Subjects were not instructed to change their regular dietary habits during the course of the study.

- **Main outcome measures**: Change from baseline in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Erectile Function (EF) domain score, responses to Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) questions 2 (erection sufficient for penetration) and 3 (erection sufficient to complete intercourse), and measures of patient preference and satisfaction.

- **Results**: Mean changes in IIEF-EF domain scores were 11.4 for regimens A and B and 11.2 for C and D.

### The efficacy of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) in clinical populations: an update [^111DnrcR]. Urology (2002). High credibility.

Although certain risk factors are known to be associated with erectile dysfunction (ED), the demographic and ED characteristics of the population of men with ED are quite diverse. We examined results from randomized trials of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) to ascertain if efficacy differed across various subgroups of men with ED. In addition, we reviewed findings from long-term extension studies and published accounts of sildenafil use in clinical practice. This review aimed to determine whether effectiveness is maintained with long-term sildenafil treatment and if effectiveness in the clinical practice setting is consistent with that reported in clinical trials.

Data were pooled from 11 double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose (taken as needed) studies to assess the efficacy of sildenafil in men (aged 23 to 89 years) with ED of broad-spectrum etiology who were not receiving concomitant nitrate therapy. Efficacy evaluations included the International Index of Erectile Function, a global efficacy question ("Did treatment improve your erections?"), and a patient-recorded event log of sexual activity. Significantly improved erectile function was demonstrated for sildenafil compared with placebo for all efficacy parameters analyzed. Over 95% of patients reported that they were satisfied with the treatment.
