## Question

Best doac for dvt

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is best for treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are comparing DOACs to warfarin or to each other. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about choosing among DOACs. Next, I will examine head-to-head evidence and indirect comparisons for efficacy and safety. After that, I need to consider special populations and practical factors that might favor one DOAC over another. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation and outline a decision framework, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too strong before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. The highest-quality evidence and contemporary guidelines establish DOACs as first-line therapy for acute VTE, including DVT, because they are at least as effective as warfarin and reduce major bleeding, with the added benefits of fixed dosing and no routine monitoring, so the real question is not DOAC versus warfarin but which DOAC to choose among apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban [^65c9cd7a] [^cfe153f3] [^dd897b46].

> Wait, let me verify guideline positions on picking a specific DOAC. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guideline explicitly states there is insufficient evidence to recommend one DOAC over another for DVT/PE, and the CHEST 2021 guideline similarly recommends DOACs as a class without specifying a preferred agent, so there is no guideline-endorsed "best" DOAC across all patients [^de088e92] [^cfe153f3].

> I will now examine head-to-head and indirect comparative data. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are no large randomized head-to-head trials comparing DOACs directly in DVT, so most comparisons are indirect or from meta-analyses. An adjusted indirect comparison suggested apixaban might have lower major bleeding than dabigatran and edoxaban, but this is hypothesis-generating and not definitive, and I should be cautious about overinterpreting it [^bf0d99f7]. A broader meta-analysis across VTE trials showed DOACs as a class reduce major bleeding versus VKAs with similar efficacy, reinforcing class benefits rather than establishing superiority of a single agent [^f3a22570].

> Let me consider practical and safety nuances that could sway the choice. Apixaban is dosed twice daily, which may improve pharmacokinetic stability and forgiveness with missed doses, whereas rivaroxaban offers once-daily dosing after an initial 15 mg twice-daily load, which some patients prefer; however, a systematic review of QD versus BID regimens found no global difference in efficacy or major bleeding, so frequency alone should not drive the choice [^3562e556]. I should also confirm renal dosing: all DOACs require dose adjustments in renal impairment, but apixaban and edoxaban have more forgiving profiles in severe CKD, while rivaroxaban and dabigatran are less attractive as GFR declines, which can matter in older adults or those with chronic kidney disease [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations where one DOAC might be favored. In cancer-associated thrombosis, updated guidance supports factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) over LMWH in selected patients, though I need to ensure there is no high gastrointestinal bleeding risk, in which case LMWH remains preferred; this is a scenario where a specific DOAC class may be favored, but still not a single "best" agent [^ff0de661] [^2349f095]. In antiphospholipid syndrome, VKAs are preferred over DOACs due to higher recurrence risk with DOACs, so I should not recommend a DOAC there [^8caaec20]. In obesity, data are limited and mixed; some observational signals suggest higher recurrence with standard-dose DOACs in very high BMI, so if I initially think DOACs are contraindicated in obesity, wait, that overstates it — they are not absolutely contraindicated, but I should individualize and consider VKA or adjusted-dose strategies in select cases [^notfound].

> I need to check bleeding risk profiles and net clinical benefit. Across phase 3 programs, DOACs reduce major bleeding by roughly 30–40% versus VKAs while maintaining noninferior efficacy, and this class advantage is consistent in older adults and those with moderate renal impairment, supporting the general preference for DOACs when no contraindication exists [^f3a22570] [^5bfa2b68]. But wait, what if a patient has very high bleeding risk or is on interacting medications? In that case, I should reconsider agent selection and dosing, and in some cases VKA with careful INR monitoring may be safer, underscoring that "best" is context-dependent [^c38df8bc].

> Let me synthesize a bottom line. There is no single "best" DOAC for DVT that applies universally; guideline bodies endorse the class and do not rank agents, and head-to-head superiority data are lacking. Therefore, the "best" DOAC is the one that matches the patient's renal function, bleeding risk, comorbidities, pill burden preference, cost/access, and potential drug interactions, with apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban all being reasonable first-line options in appropriate patients [^de088e92] [^cfe153f3] [^65c9cd7a].

> I should double-check my decision framework before concluding. A practical approach is to default to a factor Xa inhibitor if no special circumstances apply, then tailor: choose apixaban if bleeding risk is high or renal function is borderline, rivaroxaban if once-daily dosing is strongly preferred and renal function allows, edoxaban if renal function is modestly impaired and once-daily dosing is desired, and dabigatran if there is a specific rationale or patient preference, while avoiding DOACs in antiphospholipid syndrome and adjusting doses for renal function and drug interactions; this aligns with guideline neutrality and the available comparative and safety data [^de088e92] [^cfe153f3] [^f3a22570].

---

There is **no single "best" DOAC** for DVT because apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban have similar efficacy and safety profiles [^f3a22570] [^4cc38e82]. Guidelines recommend choosing based on patient-specific factors such as renal function, bleeding risk, drug interactions, and patient preference [^de088e92] [^cfe153f3]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are often preferred for their convenience (no initial parenteral therapy), while dabigatran and edoxaban require a short course of LMWH initially [^c38df8bc]. Overall, **DOACs are preferred over warfarin** for most patients due to lower bleeding risk and greater convenience [^65c9cd7a] [^5bfa2b68].

---

## Comparative efficacy and safety

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that DOACs are **non-inferior to warfarin** for preventing recurrent VTE, with a favorable bleeding profile [^f3a22570] [^4cc38e82]. Key findings include:

- **Recurrent VTE**: DOACs have similar rates of recurrent VTE compared to warfarin (approximately 2.0% vs 2.2%) [^f3a22570].
- **Major bleeding**: DOACs significantly reduce major bleeding compared to warfarin (relative risk 0.61, 95% CI 0.45–0.83) [^f3a22570] [^4cc38e82].
- **Intracranial bleeding**: DOACs have lower rates of intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin [^f3a22570].

---

## Specific DOACs and their clinical considerations

| **Doac** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Practical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Apixaban | Non-inferior to warfarin | Lower major bleeding; no routine lab monitoring | BID dosing; no initial parenteral therapy |
| Rivaroxaban | Non-inferior to warfarin | Lower major bleeding; no routine lab monitoring | QD dosing; no initial parenteral therapy |
| Dabigatran | Non-inferior to warfarin | Lower major bleeding; no routine lab monitoring | Requires initial parenteral therapy (LMWH) |
| Edoxaban | Non-inferior to warfarin | Lower major bleeding; no routine lab monitoring | Requires initial parenteral therapy (LMWH) |

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the American Society of Hematology (ASH), and the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) consistently recommend DOACs as **first-line therapy** for acute DVT in the absence of contraindications [^cfe153f3] [^dd897b46] [^0b8476a5]. They emphasize individualized selection based on patient-specific factors, including:

- **Renal function**: Dose adjustments are required for renal impairment [^c6b5fb98].
- **Bleeding risk**: Assess and mitigate bleeding risk factors [^ef3c7222].
- **Drug interactions**: Consider potential interactions with concomitant medications [^cc102c57].
- **Patient preference**: Incorporate patient preferences and adherence considerations [^97b7313f].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Cancer-associated thrombosis**: DOACs are increasingly used, with emerging evidence supporting their efficacy and safety compared to traditional LMWH regimens [^389844c1] [^ff0de661].
- **Renal impairment**: Apixaban is preferred in severe renal impairment due to its lower reliance on renal clearance [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Standard dosing is generally effective, but careful monitoring and individualized assessment are recommended [^f3a22570].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing DOAC choice

- **Age**: Older patients may benefit from agents with lower bleeding risk and simpler dosing regimens [^f3a22570].
- **Comorbidities**: Consider renal function, hepatic impairment, and cardiovascular comorbidities [^c6b5fb98].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Daily routine, travel, and adherence considerations may influence the choice of once-daily versus twice-daily dosing [^3562e556].
- **Cost and insurance coverage**: Affordability and access can significantly impact adherence and long-term outcomes [^97b7313f].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no single "best" DOAC** for DVT; the choice should be individualized based on patient-specific factors. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are often preferred for their convenience and favorable safety profiles, while dabigatran and edoxaban are also effective options requiring initial parenteral therapy. DOACs are generally preferred over warfarin due to lower bleeding risk and greater convenience, but the final decision should be made collaboratively with the patient, considering clinical context and preferences [^65c9cd7a] [^5bfa2b68].

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^4cc38e82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a clot forms in the deep veins, most commonly of the leg. It occurs in approximately one in 1000 people. If left untreated, the clot can travel up to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Previously, a DVT was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors, which have characteristics that may be favourable compared to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or dose adjustment and few known drug interactions. DOACs are now commonly being used for treating DVT: recent guidelines recommended DOACs over conventional anticoagulants for both DVT and PE treatment. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2015. It was the first systematic review to measure the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the treatment of DVT. This is an update of the 2015 review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of DVT.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 1 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with a DVT, confirmed by standard imaging techniques, were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor compared with conventional anticoagulation or compared with each other for the treatment of DVT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), recurrent DVT and PE. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, major bleeding, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and quality of life (QoL). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified 10 new studies with 2950 participants for this update. In total, we included 21 RCTs involving 30,895 participants. Three studies investigated oral DTIs (two dabigatran and one ximelagatran), 17 investigated oral factor Xa inhibitors (eight rivaroxaban, five apixaban and four edoxaban) and one three-arm trial investigated both a DTI (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban). Overall, the studies were of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis comparing DTIs to conventional anticoagulation showed no clear difference in the rate of recurrent VTE (odds ratio (OR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.65; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.66; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.29 to 6.02; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.59; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; 1 study, 2489 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). DTIs reduced the rate of major bleeding (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89; 3 studies, 5994 participants; high-certainty evidence). For oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation, meta-analysis demonstrated no clear difference in recurrent VTE (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; 13 studies, 17,505 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; 9 studies, 16,439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.02; 6 studies, 15,082 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.27; 7 studies, 15,166 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.14; 9 studies, 10,770 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis showed a reduced rate of major bleeding with oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89; 17 studies, 18,066 participants; high-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current review suggests that DOACs may be superior to conventional therapy in terms of safety (major bleeding), and are probably equivalent in terms of efficacy. There is probably little or no difference between DOACs and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent VTE, recurrent DVT, pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality. DOACs reduced the rate of major bleeding compared to conventional anticoagulation. The certainty of evidence was moderate or high.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^6ed178d6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a clot forms in the deep veins, most commonly of the leg. It occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 people. If left untreated, the clot can travel up to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Previously, a DVT was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, two forms of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. The new drugs have characteristics that may be favourable over conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or re-dosing and few known drug interactions. To date, no Cochrane review has measured the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the treatment of DVT.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of DVT.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (last searched January 2015). We searched clinical trials databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies and the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which people with a DVT confirmed by standard imaging techniques, were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor for the treatment of DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LR, JM) independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the third review author (PK). We performed meta-analyses when we considered heterogeneity low. The two primary outcomes were recurrent VTE and PE. Other outcomes included all-cause mortality and major bleeding. We calculated all outcomes using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 11 randomised controlled trials of 27,945 participants. Three studies tested oral DTIs (two dabigatran and one ximelagatran), while eight tested oral factor Xa inhibitors (four rivaroxaban, two apixaban and two edoxaban). We deemed all included studies to be of high methodological quality and low risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was graded as high as the outcomes were direct and effect estimates were consistent and precise, as reflected in the narrow CIs around the ORs. Meta-analysis of three studies (7596 participants) comparing oral DTIs with standard anticoagulation groups showed no difference in the rate of recurrent VTE (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.49), recurrent DVT (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.58), fatal PE (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.27 to 3.70), non-fatal PE (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.90) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13). However, oral DTIs were associated with reduced bleeding (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98). Meta-analysis of eight studies (16,356 participants) comparing oral factor Xa inhibitors with standard anticoagulation demonstrated a similar rate of recurrent VTE between the two treatments (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07). Oral factor Xa inhibitors were associated with a lower rate of recurrent DVT (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98). However, this was a weak association, heavily dependent on one study. The rate of fatal (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.03), non-fatal PE (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28) and all-cause mortality (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.23) was similar between the two treatment groups. Oral factor Xa inhibitors were also associated with reduced bleeding (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.76). None of the included studies measured post-thrombotic syndrome or health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

NOACs such as DTIs and factor Xa inhibitors may be an effective and safe alternative to conventional anticoagulation treatment for acute DVT.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment and long-term prevention of venous thrombo-embolism [^00213125]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) specifically target factor IIa or Xa and represent a major step forward in the treatment of acute- and long-term prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE). They are at least as effective and as safe as conventional therapy (heparins and vitamin-K inhibitors) and have practical advantages, such as fixed dosing and no need for laboratory monitoring. These antithrombotic agents introduce a new paradigm for the day-to-day management of VTE. Direct oral anticoagulants should streamline the management of most patients with VTE and will facilitate care in the outpatient setting. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how to select specific DOACs for particular profiles of patients, and the optimal management of bleeding complications is evolving.

### Does aspirin prevent venous thromboembolism? [^c8d431da]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE; deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) is a well-established cause of morbidity and mortality in the medical and surgical patient populations. Clinical research in the prevention and treatment of VTE has been a dynamic field of study, with investigations into various treatment modalities ranging from mechanical prophylaxis to the direct oral anticoagulants. Aspirin has long been an inexpensive cornerstone of arterial vascular disease therapy, but its role in the primary or secondary prophylaxis of VTE has been debated. Risk-benefit tradeoffs between aspirin and anticoagulants have changed, in part due to advances in surgical technique and postoperative care, and in part due to the development of safe, easy-to-use oral anticoagulants. We review the proposed mechanisms in which aspirin may act on venous thrombosis, the evidence for aspirin use in the primary and secondary prophylaxis of VTE, and the risk of bleeding with aspirin as compared with anticoagulation.

### Anticoagulation beyond 3 to 6Months: what does the data tell Us? [^ec733b61]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are at risk for a recurrent event. This is particularly true of patients with idiopathic events or events related to low risk triggers. In these patients extending anticoagulation beyond 3 to 6months may be warranted. Using clinical risk, biomarker analysis and risk stratification protocols we can make the best recommendations to patients with respect to the risks and benefits of ongoing therapy. Trials demonstrating benefit from low-dose aspirin for secondary prophylaxis may provide an option for patients in whom ongoing anticoagulation is deemed unsafe. In addition, recent introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants have expanded options for secondary prophylaxis for preventing venous thromboembolism recurrence.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: recent advances in oral anticoagulation therapy [^cc102c57]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical data on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as practical considerations when using these products.

Data Sources

Searches of PubMed and Google Scholar for VTE, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and relevant drug international nonproprietary names were conducted. Additional online searches were conducted for prescribing information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant articles on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban for the management of VTE compared with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; published between 1966 and December 2015) were reviewed and summarized, together with information on dosing, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and drug-drug interactions.

Data Synthesis

The DOACs have the potential to circumvent many of the disadvantages of VKAs. At a minimum, they greatly increase the available therapeutic options, thus providing a greater opportunity for clinicians to select a management option that best fits the needs of individual patients. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk and require careful consideration of a number of clinical issues to optimize safety and efficacy.

Conclusions

The emergence of DOACs for the management of thromboembolic disorders represents a paradigm shift from oral VKAs. The DOACs provide similar efficacy and improved safety in selected patients as compared with VKAs. Clinicians treating VTE need to be familiar with the intricacies involved in using these agents, including the appropriate dose selection for the relevant indication, avoidance of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, and consideration of dose adjustments in specific clinical situations, such as organ dysfunction.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^dd897b46]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs in ∼1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, corresponding to ∼300000 to 600000 events in the United States annually.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about treatment of VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 28 recommendations for the initial management of VTE, primary treatment, secondary prevention, and treatment of recurrent VTE events.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, use of an international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 over a lower INR range for patients with VTE who use a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for secondary prevention, and use of indefinite anticoagulation for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE. Conditional recommendations include the preference for home treatment over hospital-based treatment for uncomplicated DVT and PE at low risk for complications and a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over VKA for primary treatment of VTE.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of venous thromboembolic disease [^d3bfe136]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation is the treatment of choice in the management of venous thromboembolic disease. This approach is applied to reduce mortality and the risk of recurrences and associated complications. Standard therapy for non-oncologic patients has traditionally been based on parenteral anticoagulation followed by vitamin K antagonists. However, this approach has many limitations.

Methods

The aim of this manuscript was to critically review current evidence on the use of direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of venous thromboembolic disease by analyzing the specific characteristics of each drug.

Results

Direct oral anticoagulants have many advantages over standard therapy. While they are equally effective as standard therapy for reducing the possibility of recurrence of venous thromboembolic disease, they carry a lower risk of major bleeding.

Conclusions

Direct oral anticoagulants are an attractive alternative to standard therapy for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

### The history and historical treatments of deep vein thrombosis: toward the era of new anticoagulants [^add5facc]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease. In a previous review published in 2013 we provided a comprehensive history of DVT management, with particular emphasis on treatments that were later introduced or abandoned. At that time the history of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) was still emerging and we chose not to delve into this topic at that point. Twelve years later, DOACs have become the standard of care for DVT treatment, revolutionizing management by simplifying therapy while also influencing the intensity and duration of anticoagulant treatment. This new historical review focuses on aspects of DVT treatment that were not covered previously, including the quest of the development of safer and more user-friendly alternatives to older anticoagulants, the evolving history of anticoagulant treatment duration and intensity, as well as how studies have influenced the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines. Though great successes have been achieved, this review will highlight that anticoagulation philosopher's stone has yet to be found, if ever found. Nevertheless, recent data on inhibitors of Factor XI/XIa might suggest that we are approaching closer to safer anticoagulants. Looking ahead, in the absence of possibility for a single universal treatment for DVT, the future of DVT treatment will probably lie both on the development of newer anticoagulants but also on the development of artificial intelligence which could offer individualized treatment.

### Evidence-based therapies for pharmacologic prevention and treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism [^a3265ce3]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant mortal and morbid disease. The major risks have not changed and many patients present with unprovoked VTE disease. Prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients depends on comprehensive risk factor assessment, with an individual risk score. Proper and timely prophylaxis with mechanical, pharmacologic, or both is then effective. Treatment of VTE with parenteral anticoagulation followed by either a direct oral anticoagulant or warfarin is standard to reduce risk of VTE recurrence and death. Selected cases of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis may be treated by pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, but more data are needed before this is standard of care.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common, potentially lethal condition with acute morbidity.

Objective

To review the etiology of VTE and the 3 phases of VTE treatment: acute (first 5–10 days), long-term (from end of acute treatment to 3–6 months), and extended (beyond 3–6 months).

Evidence Review

Cochrane reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials, as well as other clinical trials for topics not covered by the former, were reviewed. Literature searches using broad terms were used to find meta-analyses published in the last 15 years. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy Guidelines was used to supplement the literature search. Guidelines from specialty organizations were consulted when relevant. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health was searched for relevant cost-effectiveness studies. We also searched our own literature database of 8386 articles for relevant research.

Findings

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) along with with vitamin K antagonists and the benefits and proven safety of ambulation have allowed for outpatient management of most cases of DVT in the acute phase. Development of new oral anticoagulants further simplifies acute-phase treatment and 2 oral agents can be used as monotherapy, avoiding the need for LMWH. Patients with PE can also be treated in the acute phase as outpatients, a decision dependent on prognosis and severity of PE. Thrombolysis is best reserved for severe VTE; inferior vena cava filters, ideally the retrievable variety, should be used when anticoagulation is contraindicated. In general, DVT and PE patients require 3 months of treatment with anticoagulants, with options including LMWH, vitamin K antagonists, or direct factor Xa or direct factor IIa inhibitors. After this time, decisions for further treatment are based on balancing the risk of VTE recurrence, determined by etiology of the VTE (transient risk factors, unprovoked or malignancy associated), against the risk of major hemorrhage from treatment. Better prediction tools for major hemorrhage are needed. Experience with new oral anticoagulants as acute, long-term, and extended therapy options is limited as yet, but as a class they appear to be safe and effective for all phases of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

The mainstay of VTE treatment is anticoagulation, while interventions such as thrombolysis and inferior vena cava filters are reserved for limited circumstances. Multiple therapeutic modes and options exist for VTE treatment with small but nonetheless important differential effects to consider. Anticoagulants will probably always increase bleeding risk, necessitating tailored treatment strategies that must incorporate etiology, risk, benefit, cost, and patient preference. Although great progress has been made, further study to understand individual patient risks is needed to make ideal treatment decisions.

### Temporal changes in long-term outcomes of venous thromboembolism from the warfarin era to the direct oral anticoagulant era [^577f4f59]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, is a common disease accounting for major global morbidity and mortality, and the annual incidence of acute VTE is 1 to 2 cases per 1000 people. In anticoagulation therapies as a mainstay of treatment for VTE, available oral anticoagulants have been only vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) including warfarin in the past decades; however, several randomized clinical trials have shown that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) could be safe and effective alternatives to VKAs. After the introduction of DOACs for VTE, DOACs have become widely used in daily clinical practice due to ease of use, less interaction with food and other drugs, and the benefit of potentially lower bleeding risk than warfarin. The latest guidelines for VTE recommend DOACs as preferable oral anticoagulants.,

This dramatic progress in the pharmacologic development could change the management strategies for VTE, which might lead to changes in clinical outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials have included highly selected populations who might not be broadly representative of the real‐world practice including those patients who are older and have severe renal dysfunction and advanced cancer. There have been limited data on whether these changes from the warfarin era to the DOAC era could lead to improvement in the long‐term clinical outcomes in real clinical practice, which could be important for understanding the unmet needs even in the DOAC era. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate changes in the clinical characteristics, management strategies, and long‐term outcomes of patients with VTE using data from the 2 large series of observational studies of VTE enrolled in the warfarin era and the DOAC era.

### Use of the direct oral anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thromboembolism [^daaf3ead]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

In the past 2 decades, the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as alternatives to the standard therapy (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists [VKA]), for the acute and extended treatment of venous thromboembolism. The DOACs have a more favorable pharmacologic profile and a predictable anticoagulant response and, therefore, have the potential to overcome some of the limitations associated with the use of VKA. Several ongoing registries are evaluating the use of the DOACs in routine clinical practice and will provide additional information in less selected patient populations.

### Medical management of venous thromboembolic disease [^279f939f]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic disease (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) are common disorders with serious morbid and mortal complications. Given the varied modes of presentation, a high clinical index of suspicion in patients at risk must exist among physicians. Standard therapy has consisted of intravenous unfractionated heparin and overlapping administration of an oral Vitamin K antagonist, commonly Warfarin. Although an effective strategy, many practical limitations exist, including the need for prolonged hospitalization, frequent laboratory monitoring for anticoagulant effect, and erratic dose-response curves. Recently, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparins have emerged as safe and effective alternatives for unfractionated heparin. Appropriate patients may be treated with low-molecular-weight heparins and oral Warfarin entirely as outpatients, with similar efficacy and risk of recurrent thromboembolic events and hemorrhage. Thrombolytic therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with iliofemoral venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism resulting in hemodynamic compromise or obstructing significant pulmonary vasculature. Risks of serious hemorrhagic side effects including intracranial hemorrhage, along with the added economic burden, have limited widespread acceptance of thrombolytic therapy as primary treatment. Emerging oral direct thrombin inhibitors and other novel agents stand to move the treatment of patients with venous thromboemboli to even greater levels of safety and efficacy.

### Off-label use of direct oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin for left ventricular thrombi… [^9cb1fd80]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective To compare the outcomes associated with DOAC use and warfarin use for the treatment of LV thrombi. Design, Setting, and Participants A cohort study was performed at 3 tertiary care academic medical centers among 514 eligible patients with echocardiographically diagnosed LV thrombi between October 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019. Follow-up was performed through the end of the study period. Exposures Type and duration of anticoagulant use. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinically apparent SSE. Results. Conclusions and Relevance In this multicenter cohort study of anticoagulation strategies for LV thrombi, DOAC treatment was associated with a higher risk of SSE compared with warfarin use, even after adjustment for other factors. These results challenge the assumption of DOAC equivalence with warfarin for LV thrombi and highlight the need for prospective randomized clinical trials to determine the most effective treatment strategies for LV thrombi.

For example, dabigatran etexilate used for thromboprophylaxis of mechanical heart valves demonstrated higher rates of both ischemic stroke and bleeding. 15 In spite of this finding, there is growing enthusiasm about the use of DOACs by both patients and clinicians owing to their ease of administration, absence of. a requirement for international normalized ratio monitoring, and freedom from dietary restrictions, among other factors that may improve patient quality of life. 16, 17 Perhaps because of these perceived advantages, there is a persistent clinical interest in the application of DOACs to conditions such as LV thrombi. 18 Accordingly, we sought to assess the association between the use of DOACs for the treatment of LV thrombi and embolic outcomes, using warfarin as a reference, as part of the Retrospective Evaluation of DOACs and Vascular Endpoints of Left Ventricular Thrombi observational study.

The present multicenter, retrospective study of patients with echocardiographically diagnosed LV thrombi is the largest of its kind to date, to our knowledge. Among the key findings was that DOAC treatment was associated with an increased risk of SSE events compared with warfarin use, even after adjustment for other factors. Prior SSE was also associated with SSE events. Of the 421 patients treated with an oral anticoagulant, 185 used an off-label DOAC for at least part of their treatment course.

### Direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes… [^edd96abc]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Six trials that included 29 667 patients were identified. The primary efficacy end point risk was significantly lower in patients who were treated with DOAC as compared with APT alone. The risk of the primary efficacy end point was significantly lower in patients who were treated with DOAC in addition to APT as compared with those who were treated with APT alone, with no evidence of heterogeneity. Figure 2 summarizes risks of the primary efficacy and safety end points with DOAC in addition to APT as compared with APT alone in studies that reported outcomes that were stratified by type of ACS. Among patients presenting with STEMI, DOAC in addition to APT resulted in a significantly lower risk of the primary efficacy end point as compared with patients who were treated with APT alone, with no evidence of heterogeneity. With respect to the individual components of the primary efficacy end points, DOAC in addition to APT was associated with a trend toward a risk reduction for cardiovascular death, a significant risk reduction for myocardial infarction, and no differences for stroke (OR, 0.
81. In this meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of DOAC in addition to background APT for secondary prevention in patients with ACS, investigating the differences in treatment effects according to ACS type. Several clinical trials have evaluated the effect of DOAC in ACS, mainly using them in addition to dual APT with aspirin and clopidogrel. A favorable effect was achieved only with low-dose regimens of rivaroxaban in the ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 trial. Published Online: February 7, 2018. doi: 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.5306

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^84f8d381]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a clot can travel from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, up to the lungs. Previously, a pulmonary embolism was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. Recently, however, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. The new drugs have characteristics that may be favourable over conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or re-dosing and few known drug interactions. To date, no Cochrane review has measured the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment (minimum duration of three months) of pulmonary embolism.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (last searched January 2015). Clinical trials databases were also searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which patients with a pulmonary embolism confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor for the long-term (minimum duration three months) treatment of pulmonary embolism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LR, JM) independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the third author (PK). We used meta-analyses when we considered heterogeneity low. The two primary outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism. Other outcomes included all-cause mortality and major bleeding. We calculated all outcomes using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials with a total of 7897 participants. Two studies tested oral DTIs (dabigatran) and three studies tested oral factor Xa inhibitors (one rivaroxaban, one edoxaban and one apixaban). Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of oral DTIs and standard anticoagulation in preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.04; two studies; 1602 participants; high quality evidence), recurrent venous thromboembolism (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.66; two studies; 1602 participants; high quality evidence), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.13; two studies; 1602 participants; high quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.68; two studies; 1527 participants; high quality evidence). For oral factor Xa inhibitors, when we combined the three included studies together in meta-analyses, there was significant heterogeneity for recurrent pulmonary embolism (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.56; two studies; 4509 participants; I² = 58%; moderate quality evidence). The oral factor Xa inhibitors were no more or less effective in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.15; three studies; 6295 participants; high quality evidence), DVT (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32; two studies; 4509 participants; high quality evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.70; one study; 4817 participants; moderate quality evidence) or major bleeding (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.62; two studies; 4507 participants; high quality evidence). None of the studies measured quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate to high quality evidence suggests that there are no differences between DOACs and standard anticoagulation for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism, for the outcomes recurrent pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism, DVT, all-cause mortality and major bleeding.

### Treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis [^771dbf23]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The treatment of distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not clearly established. Distal DVT can either be treated with anticoagulation, or monitored with close follow-up to detect progression to the proximal veins (above the knee), which requires anticoagulation. Proponents of this monitoring strategy base their decision to withhold anticoagulation on the fact that progression is rare and most people can be spared from potential bleeding and other adverse effects of anticoagulation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatment interventions for people with distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 February 2019. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of distal DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), DVT and major bleeding and follow up ranged from three months to two years. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs reporting on 1239 participants. Five trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months versus no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods. Anticoagulant compared to no intervention or placebo for distal DVT treatment Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reduced the risk of recurrent VTE during follow-up compared with participants receiving no anticoagulation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.77; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 3%; high-certainty evidence), and reduced the risk of recurrence of DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.67; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect on risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.59; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in major bleeding with anticoagulation compared to placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.62; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 26%; low-certainty evidence). There was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in the group treated with anticoagulants (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.07 to 10.46; 2 studies, 322 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was one death, not related to PE or major bleeding, in the anticoagulation group. Anticoagulation for three months or more compared to anticoagulation for six weeks for distal DVT treatment Three RCTs of 736 participants compared three or more months of anticoagulation with six weeks of anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with a VKA for three months or more reduced the incidence of recurrent VTE to 5.8% compared with 13.9% in participants treated for six weeks (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.68; 3 studies, 736 participants; I² = 50%; high-certainty evidence). The risk for recurrence of DVT was also reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 48%; high-certainty evidence), but there was probably little or no difference in PE (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.19 to 5.88; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in major bleeding events (RR 3.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 32.35; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.42; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 1%; low-certainty evidence) between three months or more of treatment and six weeks of treatment. There were no reports for overall mortality or PE and major bleeding-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found a benefit for people with distal DVT treated with anticoagulation therapy using VKA with little or no difference in major bleeding events although there was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding when compared to no intervention or placebo. The small number of participants in this meta-analysis and strength of evidence prompts a call for more research regarding the treatment of distal DVT. RCTs comparing different treatments and different treatment periods with placebo or compression therapy, are required.

### It's time for head-to-head trials with direct oral anticoagulants [^c5c0584a]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become the recommended first choice anticoagulant agent for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in non-cancer patients and are increasingly prescribed worldwide. They have not only intrinsic advantages, such as rapid onset of action and wide therapeutic windows, but also a lower risk of major, intracranial and fatal bleeding in VTE patients compared to vitamin K antagonists. Even though DOACs are often referred to as uniform drug class, there is growing evidence that each DOAC has a specific risk profile. Indirect comparisons and retrospective cohort studies suggest that apixaban may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding than other DOACs, but there are no head-to-head trials with DOACs. Therefore, current guidelines do not recommend one DOAC over another and the choice of a specific DOAC is mainly based on physician and patient preferences, reimbursement and availability. Retrospective cohort studies and VTE registries are important to identify potential differences in efficacy and safety between DOACs; but they are methodologically too limited to inform the optimal choice of oral anticoagulant agent. Randomized controlled trials are crucial to inform sound treatment recommendations, because proper randomization is the key to unprejudiced treatment allocation and minimization of unmeasured and unknown confounding. Given increasing evidence of differences in safety profiles of DOACs from indirect comparisons and observational studies, it's time for head-to-head trials with DOACs.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^8caaec20]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, initial management, provoked thrombosis, ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering adjusted-dose VKAs (target INR 2.5, with an overlapping period of parenteral anticoagulation) rather than DOACs for the treatment phase in patients with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome receiving anticoagulant therapy.

### Direct oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for acute venous thromboembolism: evidence from phase 3 trials [^f3a22570]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

In the last 4 years, 6 phase 3 trials including a total of 27,023 patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). To aid the clinician in assessing the amount of information, we address frequently raised clinical questions in a review of combined trial results. We included the phase 3 trials that compared dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban with VKA therapy in patients with acute symptomatic VTE. Recurrent VTE occurred in 2.0% of DOAC recipients compared with 2.2% in VKA recipients (relative risk [RR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–1.06). Treatment with a DOAC significantly reduced the risk of major bleeding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45–0.83). In parallel, intracranial bleeding, fatal bleeding, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred significantly less in DOAC recipients. The efficacy and safety of DOACs were consistent in patients with pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, a body weight ≥ 100 kg, moderate renal insufficiency, an age ≥ 75 years, and cancer. In conclusion, DOACs and VKAs have similar efficacy in the treatment of acute symptomatic VTE, a finding that is consistent in key clinical subgroups. Treatment with a DOAC significantly reduces the risks of major bleeding.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^004f0331]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a clot can migrate from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, to the lungs. Conventional treatment of PE used unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. DOACs have characteristics that may be favourable to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. This review reports the efficacy and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment of PE (minimum duration of three months). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of PE.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 March 2022. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with a PE confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor compared with a conventional anticoagulant or compared with each other for the long-term treatment of PE (minimum duration three months).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent PE, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and health-related quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified five additional RCTs with 1484 participants for this update. Together with the previously included trials, we have included ten RCTs with a total of 13,073 participants. Two studies investigated an oral DTI (dabigatran) and eight studies investigated oral factor Xa inhibitors (three rivaroxaban, three apixaban, and two edoxaban). The studies were of good methodological quality overall. Meta-analysis showed no clear difference in the efficacy and safety of oral DTI compared with conventional anticoagulation in preventing recurrent PE (odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 2.04; 2 studies, 1602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.66; 2 studies, 1602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), DVT (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.13; 2 studies, 1602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and major bleeding (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.68; 2 studies, 1527 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level for imprecision due to the low number of events. There was also no clear difference between the oral factor Xa inhibitors and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent PE (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.29; 3 studies, 8186 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 8 studies, 11,416 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), DVT (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25; 2 studies, 8151 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.70; 1 study, 4817 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and major bleeding (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.41; 8 studies, 11,447 participants; low-certainty evidence); the heterogeneity for major bleeding was significant (I² = 79%). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate and low because of imprecision due to the low number of events and inconsistency due to clinical heterogeneity. None of the included studies measured health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence shows there is probably little or no difference between DOACs and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent PE, recurrent VTE, DVT, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. The certainty of evidence was moderate or low. Future large clinical trials are required to identify if individual drugs differ in effectiveness and bleeding risk, and to explore effect differences in subgroups, including people with cancer and obesity.

### Benefits and harms of direct oral anticoagulation and low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^ca4fb1f4]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Benefits

In 25 trials involving 30 230 patients, 235 patients (0.78%) had symptomatic venous thromboembolism; in 61 studies involving 40 588 patients, 100 patients (0.25%) had a symptomatic pulmonary embolism; in 13 studies involving 4343 patients, 42 patients (0.95%) had symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis; and in 38 studies involving 32 338 patients, 173 (0.53%) had symptomatic deep vein thrombosis of any extension. Table 1 and tables S3-S5 show the results of the network meta-analysis on symptomatic venous thromboembolism, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and symptomatic proximal and deep vein thrombosis of any extension, for all comparisons. The certainty of the evidence was high that all of the active treatments probably reduced symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared with no active treatment (table 1, fig S4). Direct oral anticoagulants were associated with a significant (P = 0.02) reduction in symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared with low dose LMWH (odds ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.89), but not compared with high dose LMWH (0.93, 0.51 to 1.71); the certainty of the evidence was moderate. We found no significant difference between the network options on symptomatic pulmonary embolism; the certainty of the evidence was low to moderate (table S3). Direct oral anticoagulants, but not LMWH at low or high doses, was superior to no active treatment on symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis of any extension; the certainty of the evidence was low to high, depending on the comparison (tables S4-S5).

### Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: current therapy [^f8042350]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis are the two most important manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is the third most common life-threatening cardiovascular disease in the United States. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of VTE treatment. Most patients with deep venous thrombosis or low-risk pulmonary embolism can be treated in the outpatient setting with low-molecular-weight heparin and a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or direct-acting oral anticoagulants. Inpatient treatment of VTE begins with parenteral agents, preferably low-molecular-weight heparin. Unfractionated heparin is used if a patient is hemodynamically unstable or has severe renal insufficiency, high bleeding risk, hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are an alternative; however, concerns include cost and use of reversing agents (currently available only for dabigatran, although others are in development). If warfarin, dabigatran, or edoxaban is used, low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin must be administered concomitantly for at least five days and, in the case of warfarin, until the international normalized ratio becomes therapeutic for 24 hours. Hemodynamically unstable patients with a low bleeding risk may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. An inferior vena cava filter is not indicated for patients treated with anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend anticoagulation for a minimum of three months. Special situations, such as active cancer and pregnancy, require long-term use of low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin. Anticoagulation beyond three months should be individualized based on a risk/benefit analysis. Symptomatic distal deep venous thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulation, but asymptomatic patients may be monitored with serial imaging for two weeks and treated only if there is extension.

### Direct oral anticoagulants and cancer-associated VTE: good for all, or just some? [^610ce018]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity in patients with cancer. Therefore, tailoring anticoagulation is of utmost importance to decrease the risk of recurrent VTE while minimizing the risk of bleeding. Direct oral anticoagulants have been recently compared with low-molecular-weight heparin for the management of acute cancer-associated thrombosis. Although direct oral anticoagulants are a welcome addition, clinicians need to incorporate clinical characteristics, drug-drug interactions, and patient preference in decision making.

### Six monthstwo years of oral anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis. the PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial [^7610ceaf]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

The most important limitation is the small sample size of the study due to the premature discontinuation of study enrollment decided by the steering committee. This decision respected the safety committee's recommendations based on the slow recruitment rate, rendering attainment of the expected sample size unrealistic. However, all patients included had a complete follow up and our relative risk reduction estimates are consistent with those reported in our previous study in patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism and other studies. – Another limitation is that the primary outcome included two different outcome measures that may not be clinically equivalent, as the case-fatality rate of recurrent deep-vein thrombosis is inferior to that of major bleeding. However, the advantage of the composite end-point is to provide a net benefit estimate encompassing the two main complications of venous thrombosis management (i.e. recurrent thrombosis and bleeding). In this setting, our results were essentially driven by a strong increase in the risk of recurrence that was unlikely to be offset by the risk of bleeding. Furthermore, a D-dimer-guided strategy was not used in our study, but this was not recommended when we designed the protocol and is still considered controversial. Lastly, extended therapy was evaluated using warfarin, not with direct oral anticoagulants. Our results suggest that patients such as ours require continued treatment. Whether direct oral anticoagulants, at full or low dose, – could constitute an effective and safe alternative to warfarin or could be tailored according to patients' risk factors (including elevated D-dimer levels), will need further investigation.

In conclusion, after a first episode of unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis initially treated for 6 months, the major benefit of an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin on the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Extended therapy did not modify the clinical presentation of recurrence, i.e. mostly unprovoked non-fatal proximal deep-vein thrombosis. Whether these findings apply to direct oral anticoagulants remains to be determined.

### The use of oral anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events in an ED [^9102a097]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease spectrum that ranges from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to pulmonary embolism (PE). Rapid diagnosis and treatment of VTE by emergency care providers are critical for decreasing patient mortality, morbidity, and the incidence of recurrent events. Recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend initial treatment with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux overlapped with warfarin for a minimum of 5 days for the treatment of VTE in most cases. Warfarin monotherapy is thereafter continued for 3, 6, or 12 months. These guidelines were published before the approval of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs), and they have yet to be updated to reflect these new treatment options. For some patients, TSOACs, which act by directly inhibiting factor IIa or factor Xa, may provide safer, more convenient alternatives to warfarin. Their advantages include ease of use, reduced monitoring requirements, and lower bleeding risk than traditional therapy. Additionally, clinical trials have established noninferiority of TSOACs to warfarin for the prevention of recurrent VTE. These trials have demonstrated that TSOACs exhibit similar or lower bleeding rates, particularly intracranial bleeding rates compared with warfarin. Anticoagulation therapy with TSOACs may allow early discharge or outpatient management options for low-risk patients with DVT and PE. This review addresses the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of VTE, outcomes of VTE risk assessment, key efficacy and safety data from phase 3 clinical trials for the various TSOACs for the treatment of DVT and PE, and the corresponding considerations for clinical practice.

### Evaluation of oral anticoagulants for the extended treatment of venous thromboembolism using a mixed-treatment comparison, meta-analytic approach [^cf3118e2]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Target-specific oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran) are widely available for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Although analyses comparing these agents to placebo or warfarin exist, direct comparisons of these agents for extended VTE treatment have not been conducted. Therefore, this network meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of VKA and target-specific oral anticoagulants for extended VTE treatment using a mixed-treatment comparison, meta-analytic approach.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search of EMBASE and MEDLINE was conducted to identify relevant randomized, controlled trials published in English between 1960 and November 2013. Eligible studies investigated the extended use (≥ 6 months) of oral anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and/or warfarin [conventional or low dose]) and placebo in patients with confirmed VTE. Search terms included extension or extended treatment or therapy, venous thromboembolism (or VTE), deep vein thrombosis (or DVT), pulmonary embolism (or PE), and anticoagulant or anticoagulant agent. Key articles were cross-referenced for additional studies. The efficacy end points evaluated were recurrent VTE or death from any cause, DVT, and nonfatal pulmonary embolism PE. Tolerability end points included major bleeding and nonmajor or clinically relevant bleeding. The data were screened, evaluated, and entered into statistical software to generate direct and indirect comparisons of the various anticoagulants across each study. The data are reported as rate ratios and 95% credible intervals.

Findings

Ten trials were analyzed and aggregated, representing data from > 14,000 patients. With respect to efficacy end points, no statistically significant between-treatment differences in the composite end point of VTE or death, nonfatal PE, or DVT were found. Major bleeding was significantly greater with warfarin versus apixaban (rate ratio, 4.24; credible interval, 1.28–25.0), and the risk for major bleeding varied somewhat with warfarin and greatly with rivaroxaban. The assessment of nonmajor or clinically relevant bleeding did not identify any meaningful differences between these agents.

Implications

The majority of the data represented in this study were derived from noninferiority trials. In the present meta-analysis, efficacy end points in the extended treatment of VTE with apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, warfarin (conventional and low dose), and placebo were not significantly different. Elevated bleeding risks were identified with rivaroxaban and warfarin; however, the wide credible intervals with rivaroxaban prevent the interpretation of these increased risks.

### Acute treatment of venous thromboembolism [^5bfa2b68]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

All patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) should receive anticoagulant treatment in the absence of absolute contraindications. Initial anticoagulant treatment is crucial for reducing mortality, preventing early recurrences, and improving long-term outcome. Treatment and patient disposition should be tailored to the severity of clinical presentation, to comorbidities, and to the potential to receive appropriate care in the outpatient setting. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in fixed doses without laboratory monitoring are the agents of choice for the treatment of acute VTE in the majority of patients. In comparison with conventional anticoagulation (parenteral anticoagulants followed by vitamin K antagonists), these agents showed improved safety (relative risk [RR] of major bleeding, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.83) with a similar risk of recurrence (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77–1.06). Vitamin K antagonists or low molecular weight heparins are still alternatives to DOACs for the treatment of VTE in specific patient categories such as those with severe renal failure or antiphospholipid syndrome, or cancer, respectively. In addition to therapeutic anticoagulation, probably less than 10% of patients require reperfusion by thrombolysis or interventional treatments; those patients are hemodynamically unstable with acute pulmonary embolism, and a minority of them have proximal limb-threatening deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The choice of treatment should be driven by the combination of evidence from clinical trials and by local expertise. The majority of patients with acute DVT and a proportion of selected hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism can be safely managed as outpatients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), represents a common cardiovascular disease, affecting 1–2 per 1000 individuals per year worldwide. Timely diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulant treatment is critical as historical studies have reported mortality rates up to 30% when acute VTE is left untreated. To prevent thrombus progression and early recurrences once a diagnosis of VTE is established, anticoagulant treatment begins with an initiation phase that lasts for 5–21 days, depending on the anticoagulant regimen selected, and is continued for at least 3 months (i.e. the treatment phase). After completion of the treatment phase, the decision to continue anticoagulation is driven mainly by the estimated risk of recurrent VTE. Current guidelines advise to consider continuation of anticoagulant therapy among patients with major persistent risk factors (e.g. cancer or antiphospholipid syndrome) or when VTE occurs in the absence of transient risk factors (i.e. unprovoked VTE).

Although anticoagulant therapy is highly effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, this comes at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of major bleeding is greatest during the initial 3 months of treatment with an estimated incidence of 2%, and a case fatality rate of 11.3%, comparable to the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE. For patients who receive anticoagulant drugs for more than 3 months, the reported risk of major bleeding is 1.3–2.2 per 100 patient‐years (reaching a 5‐year cumulative risk of 6.3%) with a case fatality rate of 5.1%–12% in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). This risk is considerably lower when patients are treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approximating 0.72–1.6 events/100 patient years, while evidence on cumulative risks beyond 24 months are still sparse. These numbers highlight the importance of harm‐to‐benefit assessment of long‐term anticoagulant treatment, for which the risk of VTE recurrence is weighed against the risk of bleeding. In addition, identification of potentially modifiable bleeding predictors may provide physicians tools to diminish an individual patient's bleeding risk during follow‐up.

### Treatment of proximal deep-vein thrombosis with the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban (BAY 59–7939): the ODIXa-DVT (oral direct factor Xa inhibitor BAY 59–7939 in patients with acute symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis) study [^854a9aaa]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

An effective and safe oral anticoagulant that needs no monitoring for dose adjustment is urgently needed for the treatment of diseases that require long-term anticoagulation. Rivaroxaban (BAY 59–7939) is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor currently under clinical development.

Methods and Results

This randomized, parallel-group phase II trial in patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis explored the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 10, 20, or 30 mg BID or 40 mg once daily compared with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID followed by vitamin K antagonist. Each treatment was administered for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was an improvement in thrombotic burden at day 21 (assessed by quantitative compression ultrasonography; ≥ 4-point improvement in thrombus score) without recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism or venous thromboembolism-related death. The primary safety end point was major bleeding during 12 weeks of treatment. Outcomes were adjudicated centrally without knowledge of treatment allocation. The primary efficacy end point was achieved in 53 (53.0%) of 100, 58 (59.2%) of 98, 62 (56.9%) of 109, and 49 (43.8%) of 112 patients receiving rivaroxaban 10, 20, or 30 mg BID or 40 mg once daily, respectively, compared with 50 (45.9%) of 109 patients treated with enoxaparin/vitamin K antagonist. There was no significant trend in the dose-response relationship between rivaroxaban BID and the primary efficacy end point (P = 0.67). Major bleeding was observed in 1.7%, 1.7%, 3.3%, and 1.7% of patients receiving rivaroxaban 10, 20, or 30 mg BID or 40 mg once daily, respectively. There were no major bleeding events with enoxaparin/vitamin K antagonist.

Conclusions

Results of this proof-of-concept and dose-finding study support phase III evaluation of the orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, because efficacy and safety were apparent in the treatment of proximal deep-vein thrombosis across a 3-fold range of fixed daily dosing.

### Pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^b8c25c49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is based on antithrombotic therapy, initially with parenteral administration of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for five to seven days, then subsequent long-term therapy with oral vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin). Pentasaccharides are novel anticoagulants that may be favourable over standard therapy due to their predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a harmful effect of heparins, appears to be rare during treatment with pentasaccharides.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and harms of pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (22 March 2017) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2) (searched 22 March 2017). We searched clinical trials databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies and the reference lists of relevant articles for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which people 18 years of age or older with a DVT confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive a pentasaccharide (fondaparinux, idraparinux, or idrabiotaparinux) for the treatment of DVT in comparison with standard therapy or other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data characterising the included trials according to the methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and employed the GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of the evidence. The main primary outcome for efficacy was recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the main primary outcome for harm was major and clinically relevant bleeding. Since our outcomes were dichotomous, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We combined the effects of different comparisons through a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials of 6981 participants comparing pentasaccharides with standard therapy or other pentasaccharides. The quality of the evidence varied depending on the outcome and was judged as of moderate to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to risk of bias or imprecision, or both. Two studies evaluated fondaparinux, at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg, plus vitamin K antagonist in comparison with standard therapy. A meta-analysis of these two studies showed no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.47; 2658 participants); moderate-quality evidence. The frequencies of major bleeding were similar between interventions in the initial period of treatment (approximately five days) (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.44; 2645 participants) and at three months' follow-up (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; 2645 participants). We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate. One study (757 participants) compared idrabiotaparinux (3.0 mg) with idraparinux (2.5 mg) and demonstrated no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at six months' follow-up (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at six-month follow-up was less frequent in participants receiving idrabiotaparinux versus participants treated with idraparinux (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71); low-quality evidence. The effect of an initial treatment with LMWH followed by three months of idraparinux (10 mg) showed no clear difference from standard therapy for risk of recurrent VTE (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.90; 263 participants); very low-quality evidence; one study. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. The frequency of major and other clinically relevant bleeding at three months' follow-up ranged from 2% to 15% in participants receiving LMWH and increasing doses of idraparinux of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg. When dosage groups were combined, there was no clear difference in major plus other clinically relevant bleeding or in major bleeding alone between the idraparinux treatment group and the standard therapy group (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.40; 659 participants; RR 3.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 28.19; 659 participants, respectively); very low-quality evidence. One study (2904 participants) compared idraparinux (2.5 mg) to standard therapy. There was no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at three months' follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.48); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at three months of follow-up appeared to be similar in the idraparinux group and the standard therapy group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.47); very low-quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that the effects of fondaparinux at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg plus vitamin K antagonist are similar in terms of recurrent VTE and risk of major bleeding compared with standard treatment for DVT. Low-quality evidence suggests equal efficacy of idraparinux at 2.5 mg and the equimolar dose of 3.0 mg of idrabiotaparinux with regard to recurrent VTE, but a higher frequency of major bleeding was observed in participants treated with idraparinux. We judged evidence on the effectiveness of idraparinux compared with standard therapy, with or without initial treatment with LMWH, and on associated bleeding risk to be low to very low quality, therefore we have very limited confidence in the estimated effects. The observed similar effectiveness in terms of recurrent DVT and harmful effects in terms of bleeding risk with fondaparinux plus vitamin K antagonist compared to standard treatment for DVT suggest that it may be an alternative to conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of DVT in certain circumstances.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Each database was searched from its inception date to 5 April 2012. Conference abstracts were included in our search. The retrieved articles were examined to eliminate potential duplicates or overlapping data. No limits or language restriction were applied during the search. The search string was: #1. (rivaroxaban OR BAY 59–739) OR (apixaban or BMS-562247-01) OR (edoxaban OR DU-176b) OR (betrixaban OR PRT054021) OR (darexaban OR YM150) OR LY-517717 OR GW813893 OR TAK-442 OR PD0348292; #2.

We also hand searched the references of relevant articles for additional clinical trials not identified by the electronic search and contacted experts. Finally we searchedfor information on clinical trials that were terminated but unpublished.

Study selection

One reviewer (BDF) performed the database search and initial screening of titles and abstracts. Two investigators (BDF, AS) independently carried out full text screening of all eligible articles. We included a study if participants were patients with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism (that is, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both) objectively diagnosed with standard imaging techniques; the intervention was treatment with a novel oral anticoagulants with or without initial treatment with heparin; the comparison group was treatment with vitamin K antagonists always with initial treatment with heparin; the outcome was recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, bleeding, or all cause mortality; and it was a randomised controlled trial. Though the direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran was withdrawn from the market in 2006 because of concerns over hepatotoxicity, we elected to include these data for completeness.

### New anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism in women [^b5802ae0]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective diagnosis and treatment are important in optimizing clinical outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), and anticoagulants are the mainstay of treatment. Traditionally, anticoagulant therapy involves parenteral anticoagulants, overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists. Recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including the Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, have been developed to address limitations associated with traditional anticoagulant therapy. DOACs have recently been approved for the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Successful phase III trials have demonstrated their efficacy for the treatment of DVT and PE, with a potentially improved safety profile. Recent evidence suggests that women bleed more compared to men when treated with DOACs for VTE without differences in treatment efficacy. Future clinical trials should include outcomes stratified by sex, and should investigate the clinical impact of this sex-related safety difference.

### Anticoagulants for thrombosis prophylaxis in acutely ill patients admitted to hospital: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^a2ab2471]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Interventions and comparators

We assessed low dose low-molecular-weight heparin, intermediate dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low dose unfractionated heparin, intermediate dose unfractionated heparin, standard dose direct oral anticoagulants, pentasaccharides, coumarins, heparinoids, platelet inhibitors, placebo, and no intervention. The interventions low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin were categorised as low or intermediate dose according to a priori defined cut-offs that were based on summary of product characteristics and clinical trials dosing regimens (table 1). We assumed that intervention effects within either of the dose strata were interchangeable with respect to benefits and harms. We originally planned to distinguish between different doses of direct oral anticoagulants and different intensities of coumarins, but no such trials were identified. Additionally, placebo and no intervention were assessed as separate nodes in the network. The remaining interventions were assessed on a class level, regardless of dose. In two small randomised controlled trials where weight adjusted doses were used, we classified the trial according to the dose that was judged to be used most frequently.

Outcomes

We collected data for four co-primary outcomes: all cause mortality, symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and serious adverse events. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism was a composite of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was accepted when objectified by radiological imaging or autopsy, regardless of anatomical location. If only deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was reported, we used that value for the venous thromboembolism estimate. In randomised controlled trials that screened for deep vein thrombosis but did not specify which events were symptomatic, the deep vein thrombosis count was excluded from the venous thromboembolism outcome. Major bleeding and serious adverse events were defined according to the criteria used in the individual trials. The timing of all outcome assessments was 90 days or any reported timing closest to 90 days.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two reviewers (BDF and AS) independently extracted data on to a computer spreadsheet, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Extracted data included first author, year of publication, study design, characteristics of patients, length of follow-up, drug and drug loading, and maintenance protocol. The efficacy endpoint was recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, as defined by the study protocol. Safety endpoints were major bleeding and all cause mortality. Major bleeding was defined uniformly across the studies (fatal bleeding, bleed into critical site, fall of ≥ 20 g/L haemoglobin, or requirement for transfusion of two or more units of blood), whereas non-major bleeding was defined heterogeneously. If a study was designed as a dose finding study, we extracted data only for the dose that was used in subsequent clinical trials. Each study was graded for potential bias into low, high, and unclear according to the Cochrane Collaboration handbook.

Results

Study characteristics

Our search identified 1781 studies of interest, after removal of duplicates (fig 1). Most studies were eliminated during screening as the indication for anticoagulation was not acute venous thromboembolism. After we reviewed 20 full text articles, nine studies with over 16 000 patients were suitable for data extraction and pooled analysis. The trials evaluated two factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban (four randomised controlled trials, n = 8709) and apixaban (one trial, n = 258)) and two direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran (two trials, n = 5107) and ximelagatran (two trials, n = 2627)). Four studies were phase II dose finding studies and five were phase III studies powered for non-inferiority against vitamin K antagonists. The length of follow-up ranged from two weeks to 12 months.

Rivaroxaban

Two small phase II studies (EINSTEIN-Dose and ODIXa) looked at rivaroxaban in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and were primarily concerned with imaging endpoints, though the endpoints of interest for our study were also reported. The main phase III studies were performed by the EINSTEIN investigators in a pair of open label non-inferiority studies. The EINSTEIN-DVT study enrolled 3449 patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and excluded patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism. The EINSTEIN-PE study recruited 4832 patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism with or without symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. After the phase II studies, the EINSTEIN investigators chose to load rivaroxaban at 15 mg twice a day for two weeks followed 20 mg four times a day for the remainder of the study. The rivaroxaban patients typically received one to two doses of low molecular weight heparin before starting rivaroxaban, whereas the patients randomised to vitamin K antagonists received low molecular weight heparin concurrently for five days or more, until the target international normalised ratio was achieved.

Apixaban

A single published phase II study (Botticelli study) looked at apixaban in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis. This formed the basis for an ongoing clinical trial of apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (NCT00643201). In a similar design to the rivaroxaban studies, the patients in the apixaban arm did not receive a full course of low molecular weight heparin.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism is a common condition that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The mainstay of treatment has been initial use of parenteral anticoagulants followed by longer term use of oral vitamin K antagonists. While the vitamin K antagonists are effective at preventing propagation and recurrence, they are also associated with an increased risk of bleeding and the need for laboratory monitoring. In addition, they have potential for multiple drug-drug interactions, which are often clinically important because of their narrow therapeutic index. In the past decade two classes of novel oral anticoagulants have been developed: direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Factor Xa inhibitors prevent cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin, whereas the direct thrombin inhibitors prevent thrombin from cleaving fibrinogen. These agents have been extensively studied for prophylaxis of acute venous thromboembolism, long term anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndromes. The role of the novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism has also been investigated in several randomised controlled trials, which were typically designed and powered to show non-inferiority to vitamin K antagonists in terms of recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism and risk of bleeding. These trials were limited in size and yielded inconclusive or conflicting results. Furthermore, the results have yet to be incorporated in a meta-analysis, which can reduce the amount of uncertainty surrounding the treatment effects. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism to obtain a better estimate of the benefits and risks of the different novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists.

### Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^65c9cd7a]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism, constitute a major global burden of disease. The diagnostic work-up of suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism includes the sequential application of a clinical decision rule and D-dimer testing. Imaging and anticoagulation can be safely withheld in patients who are unlikely to have venous thromboembolism and have a normal D-dimer. All other patients should undergo ultrasonography in case of suspected deep vein thrombosis and CT in case of suspected pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulants are first-line treatment options for venous thromboembolism because they are associated with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists and are easier to use. Use of thrombolysis should be limited to pulmonary embolism associated with haemodynamic instability. Anticoagulant treatment should be continued for at least 3 months to prevent early recurrences. When venous thromboembolism is unprovoked or secondary to persistent risk factors, extended treatment beyond this period should be considered when the risk of recurrence outweighs the risk of major bleeding.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: challenging cases [^c6b5fb98]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose and only a subset deemed to be at risk of drug accumulation was given a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way that they were tested in the trials, but for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain. One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are thought to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. A second is patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### Who should get long-term anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism and with what? [^7d01f844]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

After an initial 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians and patients face an important question: "Do we stop anticoagulants or continue them indefinitely?" The decision is easy in some scenarios (eg, stop in VTE provoked by major surgery). In most scenarios, which are faced on a day-to-day basis in routine practice, it is a challenging decision because of uncertainty in estimates in the long-term risks (principally major bleeding) and benefits (reducing recurrent VTE) and the tight trade-offs between them. Once the decision is made to continue, the next question to tackle is "Which anticoagulant?" Here again, it is a difficult decision because of the uncertainty with regard to estimates of efficacy and the safety of anticoagulant options and the tight trade-offs between choices. We conclude with the approach that we take in our clinical practice.

### Six monthstwo years of oral anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis. the PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial [^bc4c538e]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a high risk of recurrence after short-term oral anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 6 months. – Current guidelines suggest indefinite anticoagulation in these patients, although this is supported by only a moderate level of evidence.

Extending anticoagulation beyond 6 months of therapy is highly effective in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism as long as treatment is maintained, but exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding proportionate to treatment duration.

Only a few randomized trials have followed patients during a substantial period (up to 1 or 2 years) after stopping anticoagulation to determine whether or not the benefit of extended anticoagulant therapy is maintained. –, In a recent randomized trial comparing an additional 18 months of warfarin with placebo after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism initially treated for 6 months, we confirmed that the benefit of extended therapy was not maintained during a 2-year follow-up period after discontinuing anticoagulation. However, although the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism after an unprovoked pulmonary embolism has been reported to be close to that observed after an unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis, there is evidence that the case-fatality rate of recurrence is about 4-fold higher after pulmonary embolism than after deep-vein thrombosis. Consequently, findings concerning unprovoked pulmonary embolism might not apply to patients with unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis.

We therefore conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis given an initial 6-month course of oral anticoagulant therapy, to assess the benefits and risks of an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin versus placebo during the study treatment period and during the 24 months following treatment discontinuation. A further aim was to compare the therapeutic effect of an additional 18 months of treatment in patients presenting unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis with that observed in the PADIS-PE trial.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f28f183e]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral anticoagulants are commonly used for the treatment of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and for stroke prevention among patients with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk of stroke. For several decades, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), primarily warfarin, were the only available oral anticoagulants, and hence the experience of using them is significant. However, VKA use has drawbacks including a narrow therapeutic window that warrants frequent monitoring of the international normalized ratio, drug interactions with numerous medications, and food interaction with vitamin K–rich food. Meanwhile, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed to overcome these limitations. DOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are oral anticoagulants approved for use for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in several cardiovascular indications.VTE among patients with SCD is associated with a 2 to 4 times increase in mortality risk compared with patients with SCD without VTE. Nevertheless, the evidence guiding the management of VTE in SCD specifically in terms of the anticoagulant of choice is scarce. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this important question. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate DOAC effectiveness and safety in SCD.

### Trends in the use of oral anticoagulants for adults with venous thromboembolism in the US, 2010–2020 [^f8a6e4c8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), was categorized by the US Surgeon General as a major public health problem in 2008. This condition affects approximately 1 to 2 per 1000 people in the US annually, with the incidence increasing markedly with age. Approximately 28% of individuals die within 30 days of the VTE episode and 36% of individuals die within 1 year of the VTE episode, with PE having a much higher incidence than DVT. The mainstay of treatment for the prevention of VTE recurrence is anticoagulation, with either oral or parenteral agents.

Although warfarin was the main oral anticoagulant used for decades in patients with VTE, several direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for secondary prevention of VTE in the 2010s (rivaroxaban in 2012, dabigatran and apixaban in 2014, and edoxaban in 2015). A few studies evaluating the prescribing patterns of oral anticoagulants (OACs) found a rapid uptake of these newer agents, especially rivaroxaban and apixaban, among patients in the US, attributed to DOACs' lower bleeding risk, convenient dosing schedules, reduced need for laboratory test monitoring, and comparable or superior efficacy to warfarin. Most of these studies have been conducted among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or patients with any indication. However, not all patients prescribed OACs for secondary prevention of VTE are recommended to receive lifelong anticoagulation. The 2016 guidelines proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)and the 2020 guidelines proposed by the American Society of Hematology (ASH), recommend that the duration of anticoagulation depend on whether the initial VTE event was provoked by the presence of certain clinical risk factors or was idiopathic, as well as dependent on patients' risk of bleeding.

Our study aimed to understand the use patterns of OACs prescribed for the secondary prevention of VTE in routine clinical practice. Specifically, we focused on describing the characteristics of patients with VTE initiating different OACs (warfarin and DOACs), characterizing the trends over time of OAC initiation among patients with VTE, and assessing adherence and persistence to OAC therapy, with evaluation of patterns and reasons for treatment modification such as discontinuation and switching between different OACs.

Key Points for Practice
- In-hospital and home treatment of PE provide similar outcomes, although home treatment of DVT produces better outcomes.
- After primary DOAC treatment for three to six months, decisions for indefinite anticoagulation depend on risk factors associated with initial VTE.
- When VTE is unprovoked or associated with chronic factors, indefinite anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE with a slightly increased risk of major bleeding. Initial Management of VTE TREATMENT SETTING Treating VTE at home often produces better outcomes than treating in the hospital. In patients with uncomplicated DVT, treating at home reduces the likelihood of PE development. The risk of a subsequent DVT is also less. Mortality and bleeding rates with DVT are similar between treatment settings. For patients with clinically stable PE, home treatment produces outcomes similar to those with hospital treatment.

MEDICATION Although direct oral anticoagulant treatment has similar effects on mortality and subsequent VTE risk as vitamin K antagonists, the risk of major bleeding is lower using DOACs. DOAC treatment appears to reduce cost by eliminating monitoring requirements. Patients who have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or morbid obesity, or who have had bariatric surgery, are poor candidates for DOAC treatment. No particular DOAC is recommended. After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered. For unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation with a DOAC reduces recurrent PE and DVT, although with an increase in major bleeding. Although aspirin reduces long-term VTE risk, anticoagulation is more effective.

Aspirin does not definitively reduce bleeding risk compared with anticoagulants but does increase the risk of recurrent PE and recurrent DVT. Limited study suggests that indefinite treatment with lower doses of DOACs does not reduce bleeding and recurrent VTE compared with standard dosing.

### Indirect treatment comparison of new oral anticoagulants for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism [^bf0d99f7]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been compared to a parenteral anticoagulant/oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of NOACs for this indication.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search through November 2013 for randomized trials that evaluated treatment of acute VTE with a NOAC including rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban. Trials had to report at least one of the following outcomes of interest: mortality, recurrent VTE, recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or major bleeding. Included trials were evaluated for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We performed an adjusted indirect comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of NOACs, reporting relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome.

Results

Six trials (n = 27,069) met inclusion criteria, one each evaluating apixaban and edoxaban and two trials each evaluating rivaroxaban and dabigatran. Risk of bias was low for all trials. NOACS did not differ significantly in the risk of mortality, recurrent VTE, recurrent PE or recurrent DVT. Dabigatran increased major bleeding risk compared to apixaban [RR 2.69 (1.19 to 6.07)] as did edoxaban compared to apixaban [RR 2.74 (1.40 to 5.39)].

Conclusion

Although NOACs do not appear to differ in the efficacy of treating acute VTE, data suggests apixaban to be the safer than some of its competitors.

### Venous thromboembolism [^10ce8925]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, comprising both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a chronic illness that affects nearly 10 million people every year worldwide. Strong provoking risk factors for venous thromboembolism include major surgery and active cancer, but most events are unprovoked. Diagnosis requires a sequential work-up that combines assessment of clinical pretest probability for venous thromboembolism using a clinical score (eg, Wells score), D-dimer testing, and imaging. Venous thromboembolism can be considered excluded in patients with both a non-high clinical pretest probability and normal D-dimer concentrations. When required, ultrasonography should be done for a suspected deep vein thrombosis and CT or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy for a suspected pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first-line treatment for almost all patients with venous thromboembolism (including those with cancer). After completing 3–6 months of initial treatment, anticoagulation can be discontinued in patients with venous thromboembolism provoked by a major transient risk factor. Patients whose long-term risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism outweighs the long-term risk of major bleeding, such as those with active cancer or men with unprovoked venous thromboembolism, should receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment. Pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is generally warranted in patients undergoing major orthopaedic or cancer surgery. Ongoing research is focused on improving diagnostic strategies for suspected deep vein thrombosis, comparing different DOACs, developing safer anticoagulants, and further individualising approaches for the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism.

### Treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and / or pulmonary embolism: efficacy and safety of non-VKA oral anticoagulants in selected populations [^edddead7]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), presents a large clinical burden. Prompt, effective and sustained anticoagulation is vital because of the risk of recurrent events, including life-threatening PE, and complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Dual-drug standard therapy is effective; however, parenteral low molecular weight heparin, coupled with routine coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), presents challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants provide a simplified option for VTE treatment. Phase III studies have investigated rivaroxaban and apixaban as single-drug approaches, and edoxaban and dabigatran in conjunction with initial heparin therapy. These agents demonstrated non-inferiority to standard therapy, and most showed significant reductions in major bleeding. However, clinical information is limited in patient subgroups, e.g. fragile patients or patients with renal impairment or cancer, who may be at higher risk of bleeding and/or VTE. A prespecified pooled analysis of the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies (8281 patients), undertaken to evaluate clinical outcomes with rivaroxaban versus standard therapy, confirmed the non-inferiority of rivaroxaban, with significant reductions in major bleeding and fewer intracranial and retroperitoneal bleeding events. Consistent efficacy and safety were observed with rivaroxaban, irrespective of fragility, cancer or clot severity. The introduction of the non-VKA oral anticoagulants and approval of rivaroxaban in the EU, US and Canada for the treatment and secondary prevention of DVT and PE offer the potential for improvements in effective care across a broad spectrum of patients with VTE.

### How we diagnose and treat deep vein thrombosis [^8429fe94]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires both clinical assessment and objective testing because the clinical features are nonspecific and investigations can be either falsely positive or negative. The initial step in the diagnostic process is to stratify patients into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories using a validated clinical model. When the clinical probability is intermediate or high and the venous ultrasound result is positive, acute symptomatic DVT is confirmed. Similarly, when the probability is low and the ultrasound result is normal, DVT is ruled out. A low clinical probability combined with a negative D-dimer result can also be used to rule out DVT, thereby obviating the need for ultrasonography. In contrast, when the clinical assessment is discordant with the results of objective testing, serial venous ultrasonography or venography is required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of DVT. Once a patient is diagnosed with an acute DVT, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the agent of choice for initial therapy and oral anticoagulant therapy is the standard for long-term secondary prophylaxis. Therapy should continue for at least 3 months; the decision to continue treatment beyond 3 months is made by weighing the risks of recurrent thrombosis and anticoagulant-related bleeding, and is influenced by patient preference. Screening for associated thrombophilia is not indicated routinely, but should be performed in selected patients whose clinical features suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state. Several new anticoagulants with theoretical advantages over existing agents are undergoing evaluation in phase 3 studies in patients with venous thromboembolism.

### Warfarin versus direct oral anticoagulants for patients needing distal deep vein thrombosis treatment [^b85b2f55]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Great interest exists in standardizing the anticoagulant choice for patients requiring treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis (DDVT). In the present multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the outcomes of patients with DDVT who had been treated with warfarin vs direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; ie, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran).

Methods

Queries were built for the TriNetX database (TriNetX LLC, Cambridge, Mass), a federated network of healthcare organizations across the United States that provides de-identified patient data through aggregated counts and statistical summaries. International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, diagnostic codes were used to identify eligible patients. Data from January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2020 were reviewed. Statistical analyses, including propensity matching, were performed using TriNetX's internal software. The inclusion criterion was treatment with either warfarin or a DOAC started within the first 24 hours of diagnosis of an isolated thrombosis of the following veins: anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal, or calf muscular veins. The exclusion criteria were a history of an adverse reaction to anticoagulant agents, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection, thrombophilia, mechanical heart valve, chronic proximal DVT (PDVT) and/or DDVT, and 6-month history of the following: acute PDVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), or anticoagulant usage. The outcomes measured included the incidence of mortality, PE, PDVT, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major bleeding within 6 months after initiating anticoagulation therapy.

Results

In a cohort of 6509 patients, 1570 were treated with warfarin and 4939 were treated with a DOAC drug. After propensity matching for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, the DOAC cohort had a significantly lower incidence of PE (1.795% vs 3.590%; P = 0.0020) and major bleeding (7.949% vs 10.513%; P = 0.0134). Differences in the incidence of mortality, PDVT, myocardial infarction, and stroke were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Before the present study, no strong evidence was available to suggest an optimal treatment modality for DDVT requiring anticoagulation therapy. The data from the present study suggest that patients receiving DOACs for the treatment of DDVT will have significantly lower rates of progression to PE and a lower incidence of major bleeding compared with patients receiving warfarin. This suggests that DOACs are superior to warfarin for treatment of DDVT.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1c18ae00]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have quickly become attractive alternatives to the long-standing standard of care in anticoagulation, vitamin K antagonist. DOACs are indicated for prevention and treatment of several cardiovascular conditions. Since the first approval in 2010, DOACs have emerged as leading therapeutic alternatives that provide both clinicians and patients with more effective, safe, and convenient treatment options in thromboembolic settings. With the expanding role of DOACs, clinicians are faced with increasingly complex decisions relating to appropriate agent, duration of treatment, and use in special populations. This review will provide an overview of DOACs and act as a practical reference for clinicians to optimize DOAC use among common challenging scenarios. Topics addressed include (1) appropriate indications; (2) use in patients with specific comorbidities; (3) monitoring parameters; (4) transitioning between anticoagulant regimens; (5) major drug interactions; and (6) cost considerations.

### Clinical outcomes of direct oral anticoagulants vs warfarin for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^8be0581f]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common condition and a leading cause of sudden death. The primary treatment of VTE entails administering anticoagulation therapy for a period of 3 to 6 months during the acute active phase of thrombosis. Some patients may benefit from extending anticoagulation treatment duration beyond this initial treatment period, and current guidelines have recommended extended duration of anticoagulation treatment for selected patients, such as those with chronic persistent risk factors for VTE or if the VTE event occurred in the absence of a transient reversible risk factor (ie, unprovoked VTE).

Options for extended treatment include vitamin K antagonists (predominantly warfarin) and the more recently developed direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors. DOACs have been associated with lower bleeding risk than warfarin during the initial treatment phase of VTE. Less is known about the comparative outcomes of different anticoagulant options when used for extended VTE prevention, particularly beyond 12 months. Moreover, trials of DOACs for VTE excluded specific subgroups of patients, including those with chronic kidney disease or high bleeding risk. Because extended anticoagulation is associated with elevated bleeding risk, particularly in older patients, examining outcomes in these subgroups is important. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of DOACs vs warfarin when used for the extended treatment of VTE, and assess whether there was heterogeneity of treatment outcomes by age, kidney function, and baseline bleeding risk.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1e95623c]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease associated to significant morbidity and mortality.

Materials and Methods

We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed clinical outcomes with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban) for treatment of acute VTE. We used MEDLINE and CENTRAL, clinical trials registers, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies to identify randomised clinical trials of DOAC compared with conventional treatment [parenteral anticoagulant followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA)] for acute VTE. Two investigators independently extracted data. Relative risk of recurrent VTE, bleeding events, deaths and a net clinical endpoint (composite of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and death) were estimated using a random effect meta-analysis (RevMan software).

Results

Six trials including 27,127 patients were selected. The risk of recurrent VTE was similar with the DOAC and standard treatment (relative risk 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.06). The DOAC reduced the risk of major bleeding in comparison with standard treatment (0.62, 0.45 to 0.85) (absolute risk difference, -0.6%; 95% confidence interval -1.0% to -0.3%), but there was heterogeneity across trials in the relative risk of bleeding. No between treatment differences were found in the relative risk of all-cause mortality (0.98, 0.84 to 1.14). The DOAC and conventional treatment differed on the net clinical endpoint (0.85, 0.75 to 0.97). Subgroup analyses in relevant subgroups (index pulmonary embolism, heparin lead-in, age, gender, renal function, presence of cancer), as well as sensitivity analyses, were consistent with the main analysis.

Conclusions

The DOAC seem as effective as, and probably safer than standard treatment of acute VTE. The relative efficacy and safety of the DOAC was consistent across a wide range of patients.

### Twice-or once-daily dosing of direct oral anticoagulants, a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3562e556]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have similar half-lives, but the dosing regimen varies between once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). For some prescribers, the QD regimen improves compliance. Others prefer BID regimens to promote better stability of plasma concentrations, particularly in the event of missed doses. Limited level of evidence provides guidance about the best treatment strategy. The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effect of QD vs. BID administration of DOACs in major orthopedic surgery (MOS), non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review up to April 2020. We included phase II clinical trials comparing DOAC QD vs BID with same daily dose. We extracted data for the occurrence of major thrombosis (proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) and major hemorrhage (ISTH criteria and recommendations of the European Medicines Agency for surgical patients). Relative risks (RR) were combined using a fixed and random effects weighted meta-analysis.

Results

Twelve randomized, controlled, phase II trials were included (10,716 patients), representing 24 dosing regimen comparisons of apixaban, darexaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, letaxaban, and dabigatran. There was no difference for major thrombotic event (RR BID/QD = 1.06, 95%IC 0.86–1.30) nor for major bleeding (RR BID/QD = 1.02, 95%IC 0.84–1.23) between the BID vs QD regimens, without heterogeneity (I² = 0%).

Conclusion

Our study does not support a global difference in term of efficacy and safety of the BID and QD regimens of DOAC in MOS, NVAF, VTE and ACS.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^97b7313f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant management and are becoming the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in AF and VTE prophylaxis and treatment, and the list of other indications is expanding. There are many factors that will affect appropriate efficacy and safety end points when prescribing DOAC therapy, and this review aims to address these scenarios. Patient comorbidities must be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant. It is now recognized that routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function, signs/symptoms of bleeding, and parameters of compliance should be considered for all patients. Clinicians should incorporate patient preferences, clinical outcomes data, patient characteristics, and quality‐of‐life considerations when recommending an anticoagulant. Cost can play a critical role in this decision, with DOAC affordability for individual patients varying based on medication benefit copayment tiers. As the future of anticoagulant therapies continues to evolve, DOACs will remain a critical therapy for preventing thrombotic events.

### Using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in cancer and other high-risk populations [^c122412c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The major practical advantage of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, over vitamin K antagonists is their fixed dosing without the need for laboratory monitoring. With the recent, rapid introduction of the DOACs for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians are now faced with various questions regarding the efficacy and safety of these compounds overall and in specific high-risk populations. The collective evidence from 6 large clinical trials involving 27,000 patients has demonstrated that DOACs are as effective as vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in preventing recurrent VTE while being associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding. These findings are consistent in subgroups of patients with pulmonary embolism, the elderly, and those patients with a high body weight or moderate renal insufficiency, making these agents suitable for a broad spectrum of patients with VTE. DOACs are also an attractive treatment option in patients with VTE and concomitant cancer, thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, but the currently available clinical data is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of DOACs in these settings. Several studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of DOACs in these high-risk populations are underway.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^389844c1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Determining the optimal anticoagulant remains a clinical challenge. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for CAT treatment. We systematically searched databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DOACs and LMWH in patients diagnosed with CAT. Efficacy outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). Safety outcomes comprised total bleeding, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), and all-cause mortality. We calculated incidence risk ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on administered DOAC type. We identified 10 RCTs with 4713 participants (mean age 64.63 years, 50.58% male), including 2390 receiving DOACs and 2323 receiving LMWH. Compared to LMWH, the DOACs group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of VTE (IRR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.79). Total bleeding (IRR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.80;1.50) and mortality (IRR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.89;1.12) did not differ significantly. Sensitivity analyses of studies with > 100 participants and 6-month follow-up were consistent with overall results. In conclusion, DOACs were more effective than LMWH in reducing the risk of recurrent VTE and DVT in patients with CAT, with comparable safety profiles. The improved efficacy of DOACs positions them as a potentially advantageous therapeutic option for this patient population. Further research is warranted to optimize DOAC use in different cancer types and patient subgroups.

### Benefit of anticoagulation for the treatment of lower extremity superficial venous thrombosis [^47200504]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the lower extremity is an acute disorder characterized by thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins. This most commonly affects varicose veins but can also occur in patients with nonvaricose veins, who may have an underlying condition such as a malignant disease or thrombophilia. It is important to be aware that SVT confers a significant risk for the development of the more serious and debilitating condition of deep venous thrombosis and the potentially life-threatening condition of pulmonary embolism. Recognition of SVT, determination of appropriateness of therapy, and institution of timely therapy are paramount to prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in properly selected patients. The objective of this evidence-based summary was to provide clinically applicable information from the current literature and guidelines regarding the best treatment options for SVT. There are no randomized trials that compare the efficacy and outcomes of newer therapies, such as the novel oral anticoagulants and endovenous ablation, with traditional therapies, such as traditional anticoagulant and surgery exclusion, in the treatment of SVT.

### Aspirin plus rivaroxaban versus rivaroxaban alone for the prevention of venous stent thrombosis among patients with post-thrombotic syndrome: the multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label ARIVA trial [^6904a32c]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Deep vein thrombosis is the most common clinical manifestation of venous thromboembolism, affecting ≈2 per 1000 individuals per year. Deep vein thrombosis causes significant morbidity during its acute phase and leads to functional complications months after the initial diagnosis. Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is the most frequent long-term complication of proximal deep vein thrombosis, occurring in up to 50% of patients with iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis treated with standard anticoagulation and compression stockings. – PTS contributes to substantial individual burden, leading to long-term morbidity, persistent discomfort, and impaired quality of life for affected patients, often resulting in a reduced ability to perform daily activities. –

Compression stockings, exercise and physical therapy, wound care, and long-term anticoagulant treatment may relieve the symptoms related to the presence PTS and stabilize the disease. – However, no medical treatment was proven effective to reverse PTS, leading to a regression of subjective limitations and symptoms. Recanalization of chronically occluded iliac veins with stent placement has been shown in a randomized trial and multiple single-arm studies to restore blood flow and to alleviate functional limitations associated with PTS. – Several aspects of venous stent placement require further investigation, including the optimal antithrombotic strategy.

Currently, there is no agreement on the optimal antithrombotic strategy to prevent venous stent thrombosis. As a result, existing guidelines, consensus documents, and surveys provide varied and inconsistent recommendations on antithrombotic treatment after venous stent placement, particularly concerning the use of antiplatelet agents. Most previous studies used vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants after stent placement, and some studies used low-molecular-weight heparins for several weeks before the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy.– In the Swiss venous stent registry, rivaroxaban was the most frequently used oral anticoagulant. An observational study suggested that antiplatelet treatment as an add-on therapy may improve patency rate compared with anticoagulation alone.

The ARIVA trial (Aspirin Plus Rivaroxaban Versus Rivaroxaban Alone for the Prevention of Venous Stent Thrombosis in Patients With PTS; EudraCT 2019-001723-12, NCT04128956) investigated whether combining aspirin with the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban was superior to anticoagulation with rivaroxaban alone in preventing stent thrombosis within the first 6 months after stent placement in patients with PTS.

### Treatment of venous thromboembolism with new anticoagulant agents [^03aaa690]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease associated with high risk for recurrences, death, and late sequelae, accounting for substantial health care costs. Anticoagulant agents are the mainstay of treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The recent availability of oral anticoagulant agents that can be administered in fixed doses, without laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment, is a landmark change in the treatment of VTE. In Phase III trials, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban (antifactor Xa agents), and dabigatran (an antithrombin agent) were noninferior and probably safer than conventional anticoagulation therapy (low-molecular-weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists). These favorable results were confirmed in specific patient subgroups, such as the elderly and fragile. However, some patients, such as those with cancer or with intermediate- to high-risk pulmonary embolism, were underrepresented in the Phase III trials. Further clinical research is required before new oral anticoagulant agents can be considered standard of care for the full spectrum of patients with VTE.
