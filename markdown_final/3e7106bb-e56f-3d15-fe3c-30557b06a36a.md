## Question

Are there specific patient populations where empirical treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea is more strongly recommended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which patient populations should receive empiric treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea, and under what circumstances that approach is most strongly recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that empiric therapy is reserved for high-risk patients unlikely to return for follow-up. Then, I should verify which populations consistently meet that threshold across guidelines. Next, I will examine sex-specific considerations, especially undertreatment in women versus overtreatment in men. After that, I need to check special scenarios like sexual assault, abortion care, and coinfection. Finally, I will integrate antimicrobial stewardship and summarize a practical, prioritized list with caveats and alternatives like expedited partner therapy and rapid diagnostics.

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: empiric treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea is indicated when the patient is at high risk for infection and unlikely to return for follow-up, balancing the harms of untreated disease against the risks of overtreatment and resistance. This is explicitly stated in CDC guidance and echoed in ED-focused reviews and primary care analyses, and it anchors all subsequent decisions [^5d7040ef] [^4893a838] [^b97c0cd3].

> Now, I should identify the populations where this risk–benefit calculus most clearly favors empiric therapy. Men who have sex with men are repeatedly emphasized for empiric treatment when symptomatic or when follow-up is uncertain, given high prevalence, frequent extragenital infections, and substantial reinfection risk. This is reflected in CDC treatment guidance for urethritis and in screening recommendations that endorse at least annual testing with more frequent screening when risk persists, which operationally supports empiric treatment in many symptomatic MSM encounters [^5d7040ef] [^c4da958c] [^d5039aed].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of coinfection because that materially changes the threshold for empiric co-treatment. Historical STD clinic data show that among patients treated for gonorrhea, chlamydia coinfection is present in about 20% of men and 42% of women, which is why guidelines have long supported empiric chlamydia treatment when treating gonorrhea unless chlamydia has been excluded. This remains a strong rationale for empiric dual therapy in high-prevalence settings or when follow-up is uncertain [^27f4f23e] [^b6a8d4ab].

> I need to check sex-specific patterns in emergency departments because undertreatment in women is a recurring theme. Meta-analytic ED data show females are roughly 3.5 times more likely to be undertreated despite similar or higher clinical stakes, whereas males are more often overtreated. This disparity, coupled with the high burden of asymptomatic infection in women and the risk of PID, supports a lower threshold for empiric treatment in women with risk factors who are unlikely to return, while still applying stewardship guardrails [^136f4e77] [^246ad4c8] [^3481ba39].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios where empiric therapy is specifically recommended regardless of routine screening logic. Sexual assault survivors should receive presumptive treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea because adherence to follow-up is poor and the consequences of untreated infection are significant. Similarly, in abortion and pregnancy loss care, empiric treatment is recommended when there is high suspicion or a known untreated infection, and care should not be delayed while awaiting results, given risks of ascending infection and complications [^fa00bfeb] [^be04b5fd] [^0d11ee09].

> Let me consider adolescents and young adults more broadly. The USPSTF gives a B recommendation for routine screening of sexually active women 24 years or younger and older women at increased risk, reflecting high prevalence and proven benefit in reducing PID. While this is screening rather than empiric treatment per se, it signals a population where empiric therapy is reasonable when risk is high and follow-up is uncertain, and pediatric guidance similarly supports annual screening in sexually active adolescents, reinforcing a lower threshold for empiric treatment in high-risk youth who may be lost to follow-up [^369b84b6] [^a11b8cad] [^cd9ced6c].

> I should double-check the role of expedited partner therapy because it changes the calculus for empiric management of contacts. EPT is recommended when partners cannot or will not access timely care, with evidence showing about a 20% reduction in chlamydia reinfection and about a 50% reduction in gonorrhea reinfection. In MSM, shared decision-making is advised due to limited data and the potential for other STIs, but EPT remains a key harm-reduction strategy that can substitute for empiric treatment of the index patient when partner management is the bottleneck [^6f2e0e40] [^971c0a3e] [^dcd3f37c].

> But wait, what if we overgeneralize empiric treatment to all high-risk patients? I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is front and center. The 2021 CDC update moved to ceftriaxone monotherapy for gonorrhea due to rising azithromycin resistance, and it advises adding doxycycline only if chlamydia is not excluded. This means empiric dual therapy should be targeted, not reflexive, and clinicians should avoid empiric treatment when follow-up is reliable and testing can guide therapy, especially in low-prevalence or low-risk populations [^c089ba2d] [^b6a8d4ab].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized list, and I will keep checking each claim against guidelines as I go. Empiric treatment is most strongly supported for MSM with symptoms or uncertain follow-up, for sexual assault survivors, for patients with known or high suspicion of gonorrhea where chlamydia coinfection is plausible, for women with risk factors and poor follow-up reliability, and for adolescents and young adults in high-prevalence settings with limited linkage to care. Conversely, empiric treatment should generally be avoided in low-risk, asymptomatic patients with assured follow-up, and in settings where rapid NAAT can obviate the need for presumptive therapy [^5d7040ef] [^fa00bfeb] [^b6a8d4ab] [^369b84b6] [^dbd3f0f7].

> I should confirm practical implementation details so the recommendations are actionable. When empiric therapy is chosen, use ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once for gonorrhea, with 1 g if body weight is 150 kg or more, and add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days if chlamydia has not been excluded. Arrange test-of-cure for pharyngeal gonorrhea at 7–14 days, and retest all patients at about 3 months to detect reinfection. These steps align with current CDC guidance and help mitigate overtreatment and resistance risks [^b6a8d4ab] [^0bf0deb5] [^0cb0f9fa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ED-wide empiric strategies. I initially thought EDs should broadly empirically treat all high-risk patients, but the meta-analytic data showing high overtreatment in men and undertreatment in women argue for more nuanced, sex-specific protocols and investment in rapid diagnostics or reliable callback systems to reduce both errors. Shared decision-making and EPT can further optimize outcomes when follow-up is uncertain [^136f4e77] [^c51429be] [^dbd3f0f7].

Empiric treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea is most strongly recommended for **high-risk patients who are unlikely to return** for follow-up, including symptomatic men with urethritis, men who have sex with men (MSM), and patients with known exposure to these infections [^5d7040ef] [^6f2e0e40]. It is also indicated for **sexual assault survivors** [^fa00bfeb] and for **pregnant patients with high suspicion** of infection or known exposure, given the risks of untreated infection and poor follow-up adherence [^be04b5fd]. Empiric treatment should be guided by local epidemiology and patient risk factors, with testing performed when feasible and follow-up arranged to confirm infection and ensure partner management [^a11b8cad] [^0cb0f9fa].

---

## Populations where empiric treatment is strongly recommended

### Symptomatic patients at high risk

- **Symptomatic men with urethritis**: Men presenting with urethral discharge, dysuria, or other symptoms consistent with urethritis should receive empiric treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia if they are at high risk and unlikely to return for follow-up [^5d7040ef].

- **Men who have sex with men (MSM)**: MSM are at increased risk for gonorrhea and chlamydia, including extragenital infections. Empiric treatment is recommended when there is high suspicion of infection and follow-up is uncertain [^c4da958c].

- **Patients with known exposure**: Individuals with known recent exposure to gonorrhea or chlamydia should receive empiric treatment, particularly if they are unlikely to return for follow-up or if testing is delayed [^32ec29cd].

---

### Sexual assault survivors

For sexual assault survivors, **presumptive treatment** is recommended because compliance with follow-up is poor. The CDC recommends empiric treatment for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas for female survivors, and for chlamydia and gonorrhea for male survivors [^fa00bfeb].

---

### Pregnant patients

In pregnancy, **high suspicion or known exposure** warrants empiric treatment because untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea can cause significant maternal and neonatal complications, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal infection. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting test results [^be04b5fd] [^d5039aed].

---

## Populations where empiric treatment may be considered

### Asymptomatic patients at high risk

Asymptomatic patients at high risk may be considered for empiric treatment when **follow-up is unlikely** or access to care is limited, such as in underserved populations or those with barriers to healthcare access [^5d7040ef] [^b97c0cd3].

---

### Patients in resource-limited settings

In resource-limited settings, **limited access to testing and follow-up** may necessitate empiric treatment based on clinical judgment and local epidemiology [^69310380].

---

## Populations where empiric treatment is generally not recommended

Empiric treatment is generally not recommended for **low-risk, asymptomatic patients** with reliable access to follow-up care, given the potential for overtreatment, antibiotic resistance, and unnecessary side effects [^7b0e727b] [^ff2c2265].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Population** | **Empiric treatment recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic men with urethritis | Yes | High likelihood of infection; complications if untreated [^5d7040ef] |
| MSM | Yes | High prevalence; extragenital infections common [^c4da958c] |
| Known exposure | Yes | High risk of infection; prevent complications [^32ec29cd] |
| Sexual assault survivors | Yes | Poor follow-up; significant complications [^fa00bfeb] |
| Pregnant patients with high suspicion | Yes | Significant maternal and neonatal complications [^d5039aed] |
| Asymptomatic, low-risk patients | No | Overtreatment; resistance; unnecessary side effects [^7b0e727b] |

---

## Conclusion

Empiric treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea is most strongly recommended for **high-risk patients who are unlikely to return** for follow-up, including symptomatic men with urethritis, MSM, patients with known exposure, sexual assault survivors, and pregnant patients with high suspicion of infection. Empiric treatment should be individualized based on patient risk factors, local epidemiology, and likelihood of follow-up, with testing performed when feasible and follow-up arranged to confirm infection and ensure partner management [^5d7040ef] [^a11b8cad].

USPSTF clinician implementation — screening intervals and treatment notes that in the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach is to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result, and that chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics; because treatment varies by patient and antibiotic resistance for gonorrhea is increasing, clinicians are encouraged to consult the most up-to-date guidance on treatment from the CDC.

Supporting evidence — scope and accuracy findings state that the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review that evaluated the benefits and harms of screening in all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons; key differences from the prior review were combining all populations into a single analytic framework, evaluating the accuracy of risk stratification and screening strategies for identifying persons at increased risk, and focusing diagnostic accuracy on anatomical site-specific testing; because treatments were previously determined effective and well established, the review did not include a review of treatments. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections; convincing evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active women at increased risk; and inadequate evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active men at increased risk. In asymptomatic individuals, 3 studies with 76 136 participants using a risk score reported an area under the curve of 0.64 to 0.73, and one study showed that age (younger than 22 years) alone had accuracy similar to that for the use of more extensive risk criteria.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia infections remain a significant public health concern with most cases occurring in adults younger than 25 years old. Diagnosis relies on nucleic acid amplification testing as this is the most sensitive and specific test. Treatment with doxycycline or ceftriaxone is recommended for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively. Expedited partner therapy is cost-effective and acceptable by patients as a means to reduce transmission. Test of cure is indicated in persons at risk for reinfection or during pregnancy. Future directions include identifying effective strategies for prevention.

Gonorrhea screening effectiveness and target populations — The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in its current or previous reviews. Based on indirect evidence, early detection and treatment of gonorrhea in pregnant women at increased risk for infection may decrease morbidity from infection-related obstetric complications, whereas in women not at increased risk there is a low prevalence of infection and universal ocular prophylaxis in newborns is effective and well established; accordingly, the USPSTF concluded that the net benefit of screening for gonorrhea in pregnant women who are not at increased risk for infection is small. The USPSTF found little evidence on the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in men or low-risk women, noting prevalence in these groups is low and the majority of genital gonococcal infections in men are symptomatic, and it found no studies comparing the effectiveness of testing for concurrent STIs or using different screening approaches.

Clinical Question

Dermatologists diagnose and treat sexually transmitted infections with varying frequency, and have an opportunity to monitor at-risk individuals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. What are the recommended screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and women in the United States?

Bottom Line

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

Expedited partner therapy (EPT) for chlamydia and gonorrhea — definition, indications, evidence, and MSM considerations — is described as "a harm-reduction strategy and the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of persons with diagnosed chlamydia or gonorrhea… by providing medications or prescriptions to the partners at allowable by law". Unless prohibited, "medical providers should routinely offer EPT to patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure that all of a patient's sex partners from the previous 60 days will seek timely treatment", and "If the patient has not had sex during the 60 days before diagnosis, providers should offer EPT for the patient's most recent sex partner". Implementation favors medication in hand: "Providing patients with packaged oral medication is the preferred approach… " Evidence includes three U.S. trials showing more partners treated and reductions in reinfection; across trials, "reductions in chlamydia prevalence at follow-up were approximately 20%, and reductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50% at follow-up". For trichomoniasis, "Existing data indicate that EPT also might have a role…; however, no partner management intervention has been reported to be more effective than any other", and "No data support use of EPT in the routine management of patients with syphilis". Among men who have sex with men (MSM), "Data are limited", and HIV risk has been observed: "5% of MSM have a new diagnosis of HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal or chlamydial infection", therefore "shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended". Additionally, "All persons who receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, particularly MSM, should be tested for HIV, and those at risk for HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP".

CONCLUSIONS

In this meta‐analysis of adult patients tested for gonorrhea/chlamydia in U.S. EDs, we found significant sex differences in empiric antibiotic treatment and large discordances between empiric antibiotic treatment and laboratory test results. These findings highlight an urgent need to develop strategies to address sex disparities and improve the accuracy of empiric antibiotic treatment for gonorrhea/chlamydia in ED settings.

INTRODUCTION

Despite the leveling of rates in the past years, the burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States remains high, with a reported 2.4 million cases of chlamydia (CT), gonorrhea (GT), and syphilis in 2023 and persistent demographic disparities. Curable bacterial STIs, such as Neisseria gonorrhea or Chlamydia trachomatis, left untreated, can cause significant reproductive health problems for females. As government funding for STI clinics has declined, emergency departments (EDs) have become increasingly important locations for STI care.ED patients are also at higher risk for testing positive, with patients who rely on the ED for usual care being more likely to test positive for CT than those with outpatient care.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends empiric treatment for GC and CT for patients who are at high risk for infection and unlikely to return for a follow‐up. Consequently, EDs frequently use an empiric treatment approach for STIs because results are generally unavailable until after discharge. However, the emergence of multidrug‐resistant GT in the United States, has raised concerns about empiric treatment and antibiotic stewardship, necessitating up‐to‐date analyses to inform STI management practices reflexive to the unique practice environment of the ED.

Studies have identified sex‐based differences in STI management in EDs at a local level, with males often receiving empiric treatment more frequently than females. However, there have been no meta‐analyses examining ED STI treatment rates by laboratory confirmation or sex. The last systematic review on ED STI management included data only through 2010. Laboratory‐confirmed results provide critical validation of empiric antibiotic treatment decisions and help quantify the rates of potential overtreatment and undertreatment, which are key to addressing sex‐based disparities in ED care. Given changes in STI treatment guidelines and epidemiological trends, this descriptive meta‐analysis aims to update the prior literature by evaluating the frequency of empiric treatment and its discordance with laboratory‐confirmed GC/CT results in U.S. EDs. We further examine how these outcomes vary by patient sex. This study addresses a gap in the literature by providing pooled national estimates of overtreatment and undertreatment by sex, which have not previously been systematically reviewed.

### Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^ce782fca]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia rates have risen to record-high levels in the United States over the past decade. Because these infections are often asymptomatic, effective clinical management relies on screening of asymptomatic patients, particularly women younger than 25 years and men who have sex with men. If undetected and untreated, gonorrhea and chlamydia can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain and can facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission. Primary care providers need to be aware of recent changes in recommended treatments for both infections.

### Sex disparities in Chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment in U.S. adult emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2cd2eb2c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS

The strength of this meta‐analysis lies in its extensive, high‐quality clinical data set, which encompasses a large cohort of individuals tested and treated across various EDs in the United States. Additionally, the study addresses sex‐specific differences in empiric treatment, a critical gap in the existing literature on STI management in ED settings that can inform policy and clinical changes regarding how EDs treat empiric STIs.

This study has limitations in cross‐study comparisons common to meta‐analyses of prevalence studies, including limited geographic diversity, the heterogeneity of study populations, and variation in the treatment time frame. First, there was high heterogeneity in the pooled prevalence estimates, as indicated by the I² value of over 95%. However, this is in keeping with similar literature, as prevalence meta‐analyses frequently have higher I² values — a recent review of meta‐analyses in prevalence studies reported a median I² of 97%. Due to inconsistent sex‐specific data reporting across studies, some subgroups (e.g. male‐only) a few studies, which limited the ability to calculate heterogeneity statistics such as I². This limited data constrained our ability to fully explore sources of heterogeneity via meta‐regression or more granular subgroup analyses. Next, none of the included studies were from the West, a region that, together with the South, reports the highest STI rates. None of the studies specifically focused on patients from rural regions, and it is unclear how many patients included in the studies might have originated from rural areas before seeking care. Rural populations often face unique barriers to STI care, such as limited access to EDs and diagnostic facilities, which could lead to higher undertreatment rates.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^be04b5fd]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia — care at the time of abortion: We recommend clinicians (1) test and treat patients empirically for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the time of abortion if there is high suspicion of infection; (2) treat the patient if they have a known diagnosis of gonorrhea or chlamydia but have not received treatment, or (3) provide routine screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia for patients under 25 years and others at increased risk based on the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, and, if positive, treat according to CDC guidelines; clinicians should not delay abortion while awaiting diagnosis or treatment (GRADE 1C).

### An assessment of population-based screening guidelines versus clinical prediction rules for Chlamydia and gonorrhea case finding [^f98ff4b4]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Much remains to be learned regarding the epistemology and utility of guidelines and clinical prediction rules (CPR), as well as the extent to which knowledge about risk at a population level might be pertinent to any given patient in terms of case finding accuracy. In the current paper, we offer an empirical examination that juxtaposes population-based guidelines and CPR for sexual health decision-making.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed electronic medical records from asymptomatic patient visits involving tests for chlamydia or gonorrhea between 2000 and 2012 at nine publicly funded STI clinics in British Columbia to compare the case-finding accuracy for infection risk under two scenarios: (1) if the population had been screened using the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea; or (2) if the population has been screened using a CPR. Performance metrics evaluated included the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

Results

In total, 35,818 individuals met the study inclusion criteria. The overall infection rate was 3.0%. Using the PHAC guidelines, the discriminatory performance of using any versus no risk factors and counts of risk factors were: AUC = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.54–0.56 and AUC = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.63–0.66, respectively. The model used to derive the CPR demonstrated good discrimination (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.71–0.74).

Conclusions

The current paper provides empirical evidence that demonstrates that population-based guidelines may not necessarily be a perfect fit for application at the individual level. Thus, we recommend risk estimation algorithms for use in sexual health services and programs.

### Sex disparities in Chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment in U.S. adult emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1000e54a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We conducted a systematic review of seven databases initially on February 26, 2021, and updated this search on January 31, 2025. This systematic review and meta‐analysis followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) guidelines and was preregistered (accessible via PROSPERO registration #241429). A health sciences informationist (JS) conducted searches in the following databases: Medline (OVID), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCOHost), PsycInfo (Proquest), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), Embase (Elsevier), Scopus (Elsevier), and Web of Science (Clarivate). Searches were performed for U.S.‐based studies published from February 1, 2010, onward. The United States is the location for this review because the CDC recommendations for empiric treatment of STIs primarily pertain to the United States and because practice patterns in the United States may differ from those in other countries. The starting date, February 1, 2010, was selected because that date was the end date of the last known published ED STI treatment review. The initial search was conducted in Medline and included a combination of MeSH terms (medical subject headings) and keywords in the following concept areas: (1) GT and CT; (2) treatment, screening, diagnosis, testing, and antibiotics; and (3) ED. The other database searches were translations of the primary Medline search. Citations for the initial search were exported into EndNote X9 and deduplicated. Citations for the search update were deduplicated in Covidence. The complete searches are available in the Methods S1 of the supplement.

Inclusion criteria

We included studies reporting GC or CT testing and treatment in U.S. EDs, including randomized control trials, nonrandomized experimental studies, population‐based observational studies, and cohorts. Inclusion was limited to peer‐reviewed publications published after 2010. We did not include gray literature — conference proceedings, thesis papers, abstracts — or articles without original data, studies with incomplete data on STI treatment, or studies for which the infection was not laboratory‐confirmed. We also did not include studies conducted exclusively in pediatric ED settings because clinical practices and physician training in pediatric EDs differ from adult EDs.

### Chlamydia trachomatis among patients infected with and treated for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States [^27f4f23e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For two decades, treatment guidelines for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have recommended empirical co-treatment for chlamydia when patients are treated for gonorrhea. Because the epidemiology of and diagnostic testing for STDs have changed over time, co-treatment may no longer be needed as a clinical or public health strategy.

Objective

To assess the prevalence of chlamydia among patients at STD clinics who are infected with and treated for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and to determine whether co-treatment recommendations are still justified.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of data from a multisite study.

Setting

Five public STD clinics (Baltimore, Maryland; Denver, Colorado; Long Beach, California; Newark, New Jersey; and San Francisco, California), July 1993 through October 1995.

Patients

3885 heterosexual patients (2184 men and 1701 women) who agreed to participate in a trial of counseling interventions and had conclusive results from diagnostic tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia performed routinely as part of the trial.

Measurements

Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis as determined by polymerase chain reaction.

Results

Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 20% (95% CI, 16% to 24%) of 411 men and 42% (CI, 35% to 50%) of 151 women with laboratory-confirmed N. gonorrhoeae. Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 19% (CI, 15% to 22%) of 410 men and 35% (CI, 28% to 43%) of 154 women with treatment indications for gonorrhea who would not otherwise have been treated for chlamydia: chlamydia prevalence among these patients was significantly higher than among patients without treatment indications for either gonorrhea or chlamydia: 7% in men and 9% in women (relative risk, 2.58 [CI, 1.92 to 3.47] and 4.12 [CI, 3.05 to 5.57], respectively).

Conclusion

The frequent presence of chlamydia among patients at STD clinics who received treatment for gonorrhea, including sex partners of gonorrhea-infected patients, supports continuing current recommendations for co-treatment.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^3481ba39]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — biological understanding and clinical presentation: Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women, untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility, and infection may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children; accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea. In men, gonococcal infections are more commonly symptomatic compared with women, and serious complications from infection are less common in men.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^207104c5]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations — gonorrhea and chlamydia actions in abortion care: We recommend clinicians (1) test and treat patients empirically for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the time of abortion if there is high clinical suspicion, (2) treat the patient if they have a known diagnosis of gonorrhea or chlamydia but have not received treatment, or (3) provide routine annual screening for gonorrhea.

### Empiric treatment of sexually transmitted infections in a pediatric emergency department: are we making the right decisions? [^635cb02c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Limited recommendations address empiric versus delayed treatment of pediatric patients for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study investigates how frequently empiric STI treatment correlated with subsequent positive test results in an urban, high-risk pediatric emergency department (PED).

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on patients 18 years and younger who presented to an urban PED and had testing for Neisseria gonorrhea (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT).

Results

The positivity rate for STI among the 198 patients who met inclusion criteria was 28%. In 130 patients (66%), providers' management decision regarding use of empiric antibiotics correlated with subsequent test results. 45 patients (23%) received unnecessary antibiotics. Of the 23 patients (12%) who were positive for STI, but did not receive treatment, 43% (10) had difficulties with followup.

Conclusions

Providers in high-risk pediatric populations with unreliable patient follow-up should consider having a low threshold for empiric treatment. Development of clinical decision rules and/or strategies to improve patient follow-up may help optimize empiric STI treatment decisions in the PED.

### Sex disparities in Chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment in U.S. adult emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^136f4e77]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Empiric antibiotic treatment for gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia (CT) is common in U.S. emergency departments (EDs) due to the delayed availability of test results. Local studies have identified sex-based disparities in sexually transmitted infection (STI) care, with females potentially receiving less empiric treatment than males. This study evaluates how STI treatment aligns with laboratory-confirmed results to quantify potential overtreatment and undertreatment rates and investigates sex differences for these outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a preregistered (PROSPERO #241429) systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between January 2010 and January 2025 in U.S. EDs, excluding studies conducted exclusively in pediatric settings. Searches were performed in Medline, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Data from 19 studies encompassing 32,593 tested patients were analyzed using a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates. Primary outcomes included GC/CT positivity, empiric treatment rates, and discordance between treatment and test results stratified by sex.

Results

Overall GC/CT positivity was 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12%-16%): 11% (95% CI 8%-14%) in females and 25% (95% CI 23%-26%) in males. Antibiotics were given to 46% (95% CI 38%-54%) of patients: 31% (95% CI 24%-37%) of females and 73% (95% CI 65%-80%) of males. Among patients with negative test results, 38% (95% CI 30%-47%) received antibiotics (i.e., potential overtreatment): 27% (95% CI 20%-34%) of females and 64% (95% CI 55%-73%) of males. Conversely, 39% (95% CI 31%-46%) of laboratory-positive patients did not receive antibiotics (i.e., potential undertreatment): 52% (95% CI 46%-57%) of females and 15% (95% CI 12%-17%) of males.

Conclusions

Significant sex-based disparities exist in ED empiric antibiotic treatment for GC/CT. Females were 3.5 times more likely than males to be potentially undertreated. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to reduce disparities and improve treatment accuracy. Interpretation is limited by study heterogeneity and incomplete sex-specific data.

### Treatment of Chlamydia and gonorrhea in primary care and its patient-level variation: an American family cohort study [^1e2cadbe]. Annals of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the 2 most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections in the United States. Nonadherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment guidelines remains a concern. We examined how well chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment in primary care settings adhered to guidelines.

Methods

We used electronic health records from the PRIME registry to identify patients with diagnosis codes or positive test results for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea from 2018 to 2022. Outcomes were the first dates of antibiotic administered within 30 days after a positive test result for the infection. Descriptive statistics were calculated for patient sociodemographic characteristics. We used a multivariate parametric accelerated failure time analysis with shared frailty modeling to assess associations between these characteristics and time to treatment.

Results

We identified 6,678 cases of chlamydia confirmed by a positive test and 2,206 cases of gonorrhea confirmed by a positive test; 75.3% and 69.6% of these cases, respectively, were treated. Females, individuals aged 10–29 years, suburban dwellers, and patients with chlamydia-gonorrhea coinfection had higher treatment rates than comparator groups. Chlamydia was infrequently treated with the recommended antibiotic, doxycycline (14.0% of cases), and gonorrhea was infrequently treated with the recommended antibiotic, ceftriaxone (38.7% of cases). Time to treatment of chlamydia was longer for patients aged 50–59 years (time ratio relative to those aged 20–29 years = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.12–2.30) and for non-Hispanic Black patients (time ratio relative to White patients = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.33).

Conclusions

Guideline adherence remains suboptimal for chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment across primary care practices. Efforts are needed to develop interventions to improve quality of care for these sexually transmitted infections.

### Sex disparities in Chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment in U.S. adult emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bc731526]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This GC/CT treatment meta‐analysis in U.S. EDs reveals substantial discordance between empiric treatment practices and final laboratory results, resulting in high levels of potential undertreatment and overtreatment of STIs. Results also demonstrate large sex differences in empiric treatment, with females more frequently undertreated. Females tested for GC/CT were approximately half as likely to receive empiric antibiotics and 3.5 times more likely to be undertreated than males. These findings underscore critical sex disparities in empiric antibiotic treatment in EDs, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address the undertreatment of females for STIs.

A key contributor to these discrepancies is the inherent delay in laboratory test results, which are often not available during the ED visit. This time lag reduces the applicability of laboratory‐based criterion standard diagnostics for real‐time ED decision making, necessitating reliance on clinical judgment. Consequently, clinicians must navigate uncertainty which may inadvertently contribute to overtreatment and undertreatment. Patients' health outcomes are negatively impacted by this reduced diagnostic accuracy.

Second, there were comparatively limited data on males. Only one study included data on male patients, compared to eight for female patients. Many articles did not provide sex‐specific results on GC/CT prevalence or treatment, limiting our ability to analyze sex differences across all studies. The overrepresentation of females in included studies may amplify observed undertreatment rates and limit insights into male‐specific treatment practices.

Third, this analysis focused primarily on treatment administered during the ED visit and had limited data on treatment during ED follow‐up (e.g. via telephone callbacks), the inclusion of which would have reduced the apparent undertreatment rates. Moreover, data on follow‐up treatment outside of ED visits were not reported and could have also reduced the undertreatment rates. In patients without laboratory‐confirmed infection, recent exposure may have occurred within the window before laboratory detection, making empiric treatment appropriate even if not confirmed by laboratory results. Data did not differentiate between genital and extragenital GC/CT diagnoses, which is crucial for managing STIs, especially among men who have sex men. However, national administrative claims data demonstrate that extragenital diagnoses are infrequently made in EDs, so it is unlikely that these data included any substantial proportion. Lastly, the studies had limited specification on whether the included populations were symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients likely receive less empiric treatment; thus, pooling the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients may show higher than expected undertreatment rates.

### Gonococcal infections among adolescents and adults… [^61bdd978]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g ceftriaxone should be administered. Although clinical data confirm that a single injection of ceftriaxone 250 mg is > 99% effective in curing anogenital gonorrhea of circulating isolates; in older clinical studies, cefixime cured 97. 5% of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections. Providers should ask their patients with urogenital or rectal gonorrhea about oral sexual exposure; if reported, pharyngeal testing should be performed. Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM in a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg. For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g ceftriaxone should be administered.

If chlamydial infection is identified when pharyngeal gonorrhea testing is performed, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. No reliable alternative treatments are available for pharyngeal gonorrhea. For persons with an anaphylactic or other severe reaction to ceftriaxone, consult an infectious disease specialist for an alternative treatment recommendation. Patients with suspected treatment failures should first be retreated routinely with the initial regimen used, with the addition of doxycycline if chlamydia infection exists, because reinfections are more likely than actual treatment failures. However, in situations with a higher likelihood of treatment failure than reinfection, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing before retreatment. 885, 886, 895*).

Persons with suspected treatment failure after treatment with the alternative regimen should be treated with ceftriaxone 500 mg as a single IM dose or as a single dose with or without an antichlamydial agent on the basis of chlamydia infection status.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^639ec9f9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Gonorrhea — Routine screening for N. gonorrhoeae on an annual basis is recommended for all sexually active females aged < 25 years. Extragenital screening (pharyngeal or rectal) can be considered for females through shared clinical decision-making based on reported behaviors and exposure. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and consult local public health authorities to identify groups more vulnerable to gonorrhea based on local prevalence. Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening, on the basis of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, for asymptomatic sexually active young males who have sex with females only. Screening for gonorrhea, including pharyngeal or rectal testing, should be offered to YMSM at least annually. Providers might consider opt-out chlamydia and gonorrhea screening for adolescent and young adult females during clinical encounters, and cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that opt-out chlamydia screening might substantially increase screening, be cost-saving, and identify infections among patients who do not disclose sexual behavior.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation — sexually transmitted infection screening and timing — states: We recommend clinicians (1) test and treat patients empirically for gonorrhea and chlamydia when (a) they are at increased risk of infection, (b) present with a known diagnosis of gonorrhea or chlamydia but have not received treatment, or (3) provide routine annual screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia for patients under 25 years and others at increased risk based on the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations; clinicians should not delay abortion while awaiting diagnosis or treatment (GRADE 1C). We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis before abortion (GRADE 1C).

### Sex disparities in Chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment in U.S. adult emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f70a50ce]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sex differences in empiric antibiotic treatment for GC/CT may stem from epidemiologic trends, disease etiology, and clinician biases. Males, particularly those who are gay and bisexual, have higher rates of GC and syphilis. They are more likely to present with symptomatic GC, potentially leading to higher empiric treatment rates due to higher clinician pretest probabilities, as demonstrated in our results. Conversely, females may be more frequently tested for GC/CT in the ED due to a broader differential diagnosis in patients with lower abdominal or pelvic complaints, increasing the denominator of those tested. But due to lower test positivity rates and because females are often asymptomatic, they may receive lower empiric treatment rates. Implicit and explicit sex biasesmay also drive some of these disparities. These biases may result in less medical treatment for females overall; for example, one ED prospective cohort study found that females were up to 25% less likely than males to receive opioids for acute abdominal pain. Addressing biases through clinician awareness is one approach that may facilitate improved treatment equity.

Despite the rationale for these sex‐based treatment differences, sex disparities in sexual and reproductive health care have serious negative consequences for females. Untreated females face an increased risk of HIV and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and infant death. Considering the grave reproductive health implications for females, addressing undertreatment in females must be a clinical and public health priority.

Practice and policy implications and solutions

Given these gaps in empiric treatment practices, this study highlights the need for interventions to align STI treatment with laboratory‐confirmed outcomes. Implementing rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in EDs could reduce discordance between empiric treatment and laboratory results. RDTs yield test results during the ED visit and improve the clinical accuracy of treatment, decrease antimicrobial usage, and reduce ED return rates. While RDTs can cost an ED more than a standard laboratory test, they may reduce costs by saving clinicians timeand length of stay for patients in the ED. While RDTs for GC/CT are not yet widely used in EDs, new technologies now available for use in EDs, offer expansion opportunities. RDTs may not only improve treatment accuracy overall, but also reduce undertreatment in females, and mitigate sex‐based disparities by reducing subjective decision making, a particularly challenging approach to empiric treatment when considering STIs are often asymptomatic. Future studies should evaluate how RDT implementation affects disparities in treatment between males and females and their relationship to empiric antibiotic treatment.

Developing a SDM approach might mitigate the potential overtreatment of STIs in EDs. SDM is already employed in the ED for situations such as CT scans for renal colic. In patients with reliable contact mechanisms and at EDs with clear follow‐up protocols, SDM could be used with clinical gestalt to decide whether to empirically treat in the ED or defer until laboratory confirmation is available after the ED visit. Depending on local ED workflows and system capacity, this aftercare option may be provided by routine telephone follow‐up "callbacks". The viability of delaying treatment until laboratory‐confirmation is supported by studies reporting ED callback success ranging between 53% and 93%, and a reduction in STI undertreatment from an average of 67% to 16%. Future research could investigate SDM's role in ED antibiotic stewardship for STIs.

The high proportion of potentially undertreated ED patients presents an opportunity to improve STI care during telephone follow‐up callbacks. During a callback, an ED clinician typically reports the positive STI finding and either prescribes medication or advises the patient to return to the ED for treatment. Another opportunity during this call is STI partner management. Expedited partner therapy (EPT), the evidence‐basedpractice of treating unseen partners of patients with STIs, is little used in EDs. Although the CDC has endorsed EPT for nearly two decades, variation in state laws meant it only recently became permissible or potentially allowable in all U.S. states. Thus, offering EPT in an ED callback for STIs is a readily attainable intervention to increase treatment and reduce STI reinfections. Additionally, HIV prevention medication, PrEP, has recently been recommended by the CDC for an expanded number of populations and indications, with STIs being a recognized risk factor for HIV seroconversion. This STI callback setting also presents a natural opportunity for EDs to consider PrEP education and initiation in settings with good linkage to community partners, especially considering the underrecognized role EDs can play in HIV preventionand ED patients' interests in starting PrEP.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0d70d27a]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — research needs and gaps: Studies on assessing risk and for whom screening may be most effective are a high priority, and studies evaluating the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic men to reduce infection complications and transmission or acquisition of other STIs are also needed. Studies are needed to better understand the benefits and harms of screening specific populations at risk such as men who have sex with men, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and persons with nonbinary gender identity. Prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea is highest in the American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander persons, and studies providing information on differential access and effective prevention strategies for persons in these groups may help reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Studies with direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening pregnant persons, testing extragenital sites, dosing for concurrent STIs, and screening intervals would help provide more information for practice.

While reducing undertreatment is critical to preventing complications from untreated infections and reducing the spread of STIs, overtreatment also carries consequences. Overuse of empiric antibiotics increases the risk of adverse reactions, contributes to antimicrobial resistance, exposes patients to unnecessary medication side effects, and when considering the nursing tasks involved in intramuscular ceftriaxone, diverts resources from other patients. Balancing these risks in the absence of STI laboratory results requires consideration of the patient's risk factors and, in certain cases, shared decision making (SDM) on patients' ability to follow‐up. These considerations may be challenging to accomplish in time‐constrained ED settings and highlight the pressing clinical and public health need for implementing rapid STI tests for STIs to the ED.

This meta‐analysis builds on previous findings of discordance between empiric treatment and laboratory results in EDs. A 2013 database review of 1877 visits by females aged 14–21 at an academic ED of a Children's Hospital found that over half were potentially overtreated based on clinical judgment. Our findings show a lower rate of potential overtreatment (38%), likely due to the inclusion of older age groups with lower STI incidence. The most recent comprehensive review of ED STI treatment before this meta‐analysis, published in 2013, found wide variation in potential undertreatment at 38%–84% of general patients. We found potential undertreatment at the lower end of the range at 39%, which may reflect a change in practice, such as an increase in patients receiving treatment for STIsversus a more narrow screening selection.

### Non-empirical management of asymptomatic Chlamydia and gonorrhoea reduces unnecessary antibiotic use fivefold: a before and after study [^7b0e727b]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In 2019, informed by favourable patient and provider acceptability surveys and concerns about antimicrobial resistance, Sydney Sexual Health Centre stopped routinely providing empirical antibiotic treatment to asymptomatic contacts of Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) and Neisseria gonorrhoea (gonorrhoea). We aimed to assess if this policy change had any negative impact on patient outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective file review of people who presented as asymptomatic contacts of chlamydia and gonorrhoea cases before and after the policy change was conducted. Data on infection type, test results and treatment were extracted. For contacts who tested positive and were treated non-empirically, additional data were reviewed including sexual activity and symptom or complication development between testing and treatment, time from testing to notification and treatment and loss to follow-up.

Results

Of 1194 asymptomatic sexual contacts of chlamydia or gonorrhoea, most tested negative to both infections (814, 68%). All contacts with a positive result who were not treated empirically were notified of their result and 173 (99%) were treated within a mean time of 5 days. More contacts were overtreated in 2018 (n = 355, 58%) under the empirical treatment model compared with 2019 (n = 58, 11%, p ≤ 0.001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of contacts who tested positive and were treated (p = 0.111) or developed symptoms (p = 0.413) before and after the policy change and no contacts who were treated non-empirically developed complications of pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis or proctitis between testing and treatment.

Conclusion

In this population, a switch from empirically treating all asymptomatic contacts to treating only those who tested positive significantly reduced antibiotic overuse with minimal adverse outcomes. Our findings support results-directed treatment for asymptomatic sexual contacts of chlamydia and gonorrhoea.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^e14e8474]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

Update of previous U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening for chlamydia (2007) and gonorrhea (2005).

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections in asymptomatic patients from studies published since its last reviews. The USPSTF also considered evidence from its previous recommendations and reviews.

Population

This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant women.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. (I statement).

Potential overtreatment

Figure 4 presents the forest plot of pooled proportions by sex for ED patients empirically treated for GC/CT among those without a laboratory‐confirmed diagnosis. The overall proportion of patients receiving empiric antibiotic treatment for GC/CT without a laboratory‐confirmed diagnosis was 38% (95% CI 30%–47%). Subgroup analysis showed that the proportion was substantially lower in females, at 27% (95% CI 20%–34%), compared with males, at 64% (95% CI 55%–73%). This indicates that females were approximately twofold less likely than males to receive potential overtreatment.

### Update on the management of gonorrhea in adults in the United States [^fd7c3034]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported notifiable disease, is an important cause of cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The selection of appropriate therapy for gonorrhea (i.e., safe, highly effective, single dose, and affordable) is complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobial therapies. This article reviews the key questions and data that informed the 2006 gonorrhea treatment recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Key areas addressed include the criteria used to select effective treatment for gonorrhea, the level of antimicrobial resistance at which changing treatment regimens is recommended, the epidemiology of resistance, and the use of quinolones, cephalosporins, and other classes of antimicrobials for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^eca113d0]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences including increased risk of acquisition of the others, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus‐2 as well as adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes, and cervical cancer risk. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or experiencing poverty, the very groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs). Current U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single‐dose, point‐of‐care treatment strategy, novel to the U.S. but evidence‐based and consistent with international guidelines, to address existing deficiencies in availability of inexpensive and accurate point‐of‐care diagnosis, and substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow‐up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

Confirmed/among tested (test positivity)

Figure 2 shows the pooled prevalence for laboratory‐confirmed GC/CT among all ED patients tested. The overall prevalence of GC/CT was 14% (95% CI 12%–16%). Subgroup analysis shows the prevalence was substantially lower among females, at 11% (95% CI 8%–14%), compared with males, who had a prevalence of 25% (95% CI 23%–26%). Thus, females were approximately twofold less likely than males to test positive for GC/CT.

The overall proportion of patients receiving empiric antibiotic treatment for GC/CT was 46% (95% CI 38%–54%). Subgroup analysis by sex demonstrates that the proportion was substantially lower in females, at 31% (95% CI 24%–37%), compared with males, who had a proportion of 73% (95% CI 65%–80%). Thus, females were approximately twofold less likely than males to receive empiric antibiotic treatment for GC/CT.

### Routine treatment versus selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with Chlamydia: a before-and-after study [^59b28df8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are increasing in many regions around the world, highlighting their continued significance as a global public health challenge. Each year, there are 374 million new cases of STIs, with an estimated 128.5 million cases of Chlamydia trachomatis, making it the most common bacterial STI globally. International guidelines on managing chlamydia contacts vary. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment for sexual partners within 60 days of symptom onset or chlamydia diagnosis, and even beyond 60 days for the most recent partner. British guidelines recommend empirical treatment for male cases with urethral symptoms and for contacts within 4 weeks; for all other cases, contacts within the last 6 months should be treated. Although many international guidelines emphasize the importance of testing and confirmatory diagnostics for chlamydia contacts, they continue to recommend presumptive treatment.

Concerns over antimicrobial resistance in STIs have been increasing. Although antibiotic resistance in chlamydia is relatively uncommon, the overprescription and misuse of antibiotics such as doxycycline and azithromycin may foster resistance in other pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium, as well as non-STI bacteria. Recent studies have shown that N gonorrhoeae has developed significant resistance to azithromycin, leading to treatment challenges. Similarly, M genitalium demonstrates increasing resistance to azithromycin, complicating treatment options. The widespread use of these antibiotics in non-STI cases, such as respiratory infections, may further contribute to resistance in non-STI bacteria. Considering that antimicrobial resistance is one of the top global public health threats, driven largely by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, the selective treatment approach aimed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Thus, there is a need to revisit the management of contacts to optimize the use of antibiotics and support antimicrobial stewardship.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^27eaf6ac]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Women who seek care and can follow up at sexual health clinics and primary care offices are different than many from disadvantaged groups for whom there may be only one opportunity to address their symptoms when seen in the ED. Empirical treatment of vaginitis carries risks of overtreatment, although use of a single‐dose regimen would minimize stewardship concerns for collateral adverse antibiotic effects. Further, overall treatment effectiveness must be considered in the context of a woman's specific circumstances and needs, such as CDC‐endorsed empirical EPT treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and in the case of sexual assault, for which compliance with follow‐up visits is acknowledged to be poor.

For women with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis, particularly in EDs where point‐of‐care NAAT testing is not available, we believe empirical treatment with 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole for BV and TV and 150‐mg single‐dose fluconazole for Candida should be offered through shared decision making. Reliance on microscopy testing poses a substantial risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment with subsequent persistent symptoms, additional health care visits, and risk of transmission. Alternatively, if the patient believes she can comply, the CDC‐recommended second‐day 2‐g tinidazole dose or 7‐day 500‐mg twice‐daily metronidazole regimen can also be prescribed empirically to treat BV and TV, and women with a history of recurrent or persistent Candida infection can be prescribed a Day 4 and 7 fluconazole dose. Whether empirical or microscopy/point‐of‐care NAAT‐directed treatment is provided, follow‐up should be recommended for patients whose symptoms persist beyond 1 week, at which time further diagnostic testing can be considered.

The citations were screened independently by a minimum of two screeners from the author team (EC, MM, CP, EC, RP), according to the following levels of screening: (1) abstract involved GC/CT and U.S. adult EDs; and (2) study manuscript included data on GC/CT prevalence and treatment and GC/CT test using a nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Disagreements were resolved in consensus with the study's senior author (RS).

We prepared data extraction sheets using Microsoft Excel. Three reviewers (MM, EC, RP) independently reviewed all included studies and extracted the data onto separate data sheets. The data extraction results were then compared, and disagreements were resolved via group discussion with the study's senior author until consensus was reached. We originally planned to separate data by CT only and GC only, but combined them into CT/GC because most articles did not differentiate. Included studies reported outcomes by patient sex (biological classification). Therefore, we use "sex" throughout this article to refer to male and female categories.

Our main outcomes were proportions defined as follows: (A) confirmed GC/CT among tested, i.e. test positivity: (laboratory‐confirmed positive patients)/(all tested patients); (B) empiric antibiotic treatment: treated patients/all tested patients; (C) ED patients receiving empiric treatment without laboratory‐confirmed GC/CT, i.e. potential overtreatment: (treated patients with laboratory‐confirmed negative)/(all patients laboratory‐confirmed negative); (D) ED patients with laboratory‐confirmed GC/CT without empiric treatment, i.e. potential undertreatment: (untreated patients with laboratory‐confirmed positive)/(all patients laboratory‐confirmed positive).

We contacted the corresponding authors of all included studies one time via email to request missing data, clarify unclear data, or confirm data extractions. One author responded with changes, confirming that 549 patients were tested (instead of 547, as published). All other data were extracted directly from published manuscripts. We manually searched the references of a previously published STI treatment in the ED review articleand the references of the final articles to ensure our search strategy included all relevant articles. This process did not identify any additional articles that fit our inclusion criteria.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^15b25b40]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — potential preventable burden and harms note that chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in men but may result in urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis; uncommon complications include reactive arthritis and disseminated gonococcal infection; urogenital positivity among men who have sex with men was 6% for chlamydia and 7% for gonorrhea across 11 jurisdictions in 2019; infections at extragenital sites are typically asymptomatic; and these infections may increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. Potential harms of screening include false-positive or false-negative results as well as labeling and anxiety. Current practice data indicate that a review of claims from 4296 patients (2000 to 2003) found a large proportion of patients with high-risk sexual behaviors did not receive STI or HIV testing during their visit, and billing codes for 1074 high-risk patients showed men were less likely than women to be tested for chlamydia (20.7% vs 56.9%) and gonorrhea (20.7% vs 50.9%), but more likely to be tested for HIV (79.3% vs 38.8%) and syphilis (39.1% vs 27.6%).

RESULTS

The database search identified 2619 articles included for screening. Of these, 260 were included for full‐text review (see Figure 1). Nineteen studies comprising 32,593 ED patients tested for STIs met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. All 19 studies, screened using the risk‐of‐bias JBI tool were included (Table S1 for risk‐of‐bias tool, Table S2 for individual study scores).

FIGURE 1
PRISMA diagram for study inclusion. STI, sexually transmitted infection.

Table 1 summarizes patient and study characteristics for each of the 19 included studies, all deemed to be of sufficient methodological quality by the JBI tool. Regarding the study populations, eight included only female patients,10 both female and male patients, and one male patientsonly. One study specified a population of pregnant patients; none of the other studies specified pregnancy status. Whether the study population was symptomatic or asymptomatic was largely unspecified. Most studies (14/19) included patients based on laboratory testing for GC/CT without specifying the rationale for such testing (e.g. general STI screening versus assessment). Six studies specified that the population included patients who presented with genitourinary symptoms or received a pelvic examination. Regarding the timing of treatment, most studies only noted antibiotic treatment during the period of the ED visit. However, nine included data on patients who received follow‐up by ED staff, during which they may have been contacted to return to the ED for treatment. Time periods for follow‐up were mostly unspecified, with periods ranging from 7 days to 2 weeks.

Descriptive characteristics of studies and the risk‐of‐bias assessment.

Nearly all (15/19) of the studies were in urban areas, and most (15/19) were from academic EDs. Most studies (13/19) were from the Midwest, five from the South, and one from Northeast. Six studies were published in 2015 or before. Thirteen studies were published in 2016 or later. Seven studies had a population size of less than 500, and 12 studies had a population size greater than 500.

### Patterns of empiric treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in an underserved population [^b97c0cd3]. Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Appropriate treatment of chlamydia trachomatis (CT) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is important. Much of this treatment is empiric, and most research on treatment patterns has been conducted in emergency department settings. Few studies have focused on CT treatment in outpatient primary care settings, especially among underserved populations. We aimed to study patterns of empiric CT treatment in an urban safety net clinic.

Methods

We examined electronic health records from all patients in whom a CT lab test was completed between January 1 and December 31, 2007 (n = 1,222). We manually reviewed charts to confirm patient demographics, CT testing, STI symptoms, known exposure, empiric treatment, test results, and follow-up. We then conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to study patterns of and characteristics associated with receiving empiric treatment. We also assessed follow-up for non-treated patients with positive tests.

Results

Among 488 patients who presented with STI symptoms and who were tested, 181 (37.1%) were empirically treated. In multivariate analyses, women with symptoms had significantly lower odds of receiving empiric treatment, as compared with men. Of the 1,222 patients tested, 75 had a positive CT laboratory test; seven (9.3%) of these patients did not receive empiric treatment and had no documented posttest treatment.

Conclusions

A minority of patients with STI symptoms were empirically treated. Outpatient clinicians should consider whether a patient meets guidelines for empiric STI treatment; this decision should take into account the feasibility of prompt follow-up. This may be especially important in women presenting with STI symptoms.

### Adherence to CDC recommendations for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea-STD surveillance network, United States, 2016 [^d671d91e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea, the sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is the second most common notifiable disease in the United States after chlamydia; 468,514 cases were reported to state and local health departments in 2016, an increase of 18.5% from 2015 (1). N. gonorrhoeae has progressively developed resistance to most antimicrobials used to treat the infection (2). As a result, CDC recommends two antimicrobials (250 mg of ceftriaxone [IM] plus 1 g of azithromycin [PO]) for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea to improve treatment efficacy and, potentially, to slow the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. To monitor adherence to the current CDC-recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea, CDC reviewed enhanced data collected on a random sample of reported cases of gonorrhea in seven jurisdictions participating in the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) and estimated the proportion of patients who received the CDC-recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea, by patient characteristics and diagnosing facility type. In 2016, the majority of reported patients with gonorrhea (81%) received the recommended regimen. There were no differences in the proportion of patients receiving the recommended regimen by age or race/ethnicity; however, patients diagnosed with gonorrhea in STD (91%) or family planning/reproductive health (94%) clinics were more likely to receive this regimen than were patients diagnosed in other provider settings (80%). These data document high provider adherence to CDC gonorrhea treatment recommendations in specialty STD clinics, indicating high quality of care provided in those settings. Local and state health departments should monitor adherence with recommendations in their jurisdictions and consider implementing interventions to improve provider and patient compliance with gonorrhea treatment recommendations where indicated.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) — diagnosis and initial testing — uses inflammation indicators such as "Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine or microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF"; in settings without Gram/MB/GV microscopy, men meeting these criteria "should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAATs" and, when no criteria are present, empiric treatment is "recommended only for those at high risk for infection who are unlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation or test results". When microscopy is unavailable, first-void urine testing is acceptable and "microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF has a high negative predictive value". For etiologic testing, "All men who have suspected or confirmed NGU should be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea by using NAATs", "M. genitalium testing should be performed for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after initial empiric treatment", and "Testing for T. vaginalis should be considered in areas or among populations with high prevalence, in cases where a partner is known to be infected, or for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after initial empiric treatment".

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^40079da2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Continued support of gonorrhea prevention and control efforts remains fundamental, and preventing antibiotic resistance is crucial. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ceftriaxone indicate that a 500 mg dose in an average-weight U.S. adult achieves sufficiently high serum levels for an adequate duration to eradicate infection, even with wide pharmacokinetic variability. The high frequency of pharyngeal gonorrhea with substantial underscreening and the increased understanding of wide individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability has contributed to the recommendation for the increased ceftriaxone dose. These recommendations also include a test-of-cure for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea to ensure eradication or detection of a possible treatment failure.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance affects gonorrhea treatment recommendations and other STIs. CDC recommends ceftriaxone monotherapy for treatment because N. gonorrhoeae remains highly susceptible to ceftriaxone, azithromycin resistance is increasing, and prudent use of antimicrobial agents supports limiting their use. Continuing to monitor for emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures will be essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^a11b8cad]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidance is as follows: The CDC recommends annual chlamydia and gonorrhea testing in all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women at increased risk of infection, and it also recommends screening for both infections in pregnant women younger than 25 years and in older pregnant women at increased risk for infection during their first prenatal visit and again during their third trimester if risk remains high. The CDC recommends that clinicians consider screening for chlamydia in sexually active young men in high-prevalence areas and populations, recommends annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at appropriate anatomical sites of exposure in men who have sex with men with more frequent screening if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners, and recommends screening transgender individuals on the basis of their sexual practices and anatomy. Because of high rates of STIs in persons entering correctional facilities, the CDC recommends chlamydia and gonorrhea screening at intake in correctional facilities in women 35 years or younger and in men younger than 30 years, and because of the high likelihood of reinfection it recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infections 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated. ACOG endorses the CDC's recommendations that clinicians annually screen all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women at risk for chlamydia and gonorrhea, recommends that all pregnant women be tested for chlamydia early in pregnancy with a repeat test in the third trimester for women with risk factors, and recommends testing for gonorrhea in pregnant women 25 years or younger or for women living in an area where gonorrhea is common. The AAFP follows the 2014 USPSTF chlamydia and gonorrhea screening recommendations, and AAP recommendations align with the CDC guidelines.

Chlamydia screening benefits and pregnancy outcomes — The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed 4 trials and concluded that screening was associated with reduced risk of PID vs no screening. The USPSTF previously found fair-quality evidence that treatment of chlamydial infection during pregnancy is associated with improved outcomes for infants and mothers, and cohort screening studies at the first prenatal visit in pregnant women with a total of 11 544 participants at increased risk for infection found treatment was associated with significantly lower rates of preterm delivery, early rupture of membranes, and infants with low birth weight compared with no treatment or treatment failure. The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia in men or low-risk women and found no studies on the benefits of screening women, including pregnant women, who are not at increased risk for infection.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^5d7040ef]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Men evaluated in settings in which Gram stain or MB or GV smear is unavailable who meet at least one criterion for urethritis (i.e. urethral discharge, positive leukocyte esterase test on first void urine, or microscopic examination of first-void urine sediment with ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF) should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAATs and treated with regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.

If symptoms are present but no evidence of urethral inflammation is present, NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae might identify infections. Persons with chlamydia or gonorrhea should receive recommended treatment, and sex partners should be referred for evaluation and treatment. If none of these clinical criteria are present, empiric treatment of men with symptoms of urethritis is recommended only for those at high risk for infection who are unlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation or test results. Such men should be treated with drug regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.

Nongonococcal Urethritis

NGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have various infectious etiologies. C. trachomatis has been well established as an NGU etiology; however, prevalence varies across populations and accounts for < 50% of overall cases (,–). M. genitalium is estimated to account for 10%–25% of cases, and T. vaginalis for 1%–8% of cases depending on population and location. Other etiologies include different bacteria, such as Haemophilus species, N. meningitidis, HSV, and adenovirus. However, even when extensive testing is performed, no pathogens are identified in approximately half of cases.

Gonorrhea — management of sex partners and expedited partner therapy (EPT): Recent sex partners (sexual contact < 60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment; if the last potential sexual exposure was > 60 days before onset or diagnosis, the most recent partner should be treated. When partner-management strategies are impractical or access to prompt care is limited, EPT can be delivered. For EPT, treatment of the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose is recommended if concurrent chlamydial infection has been excluded; if a chlamydia test result has not been documented, the partner may be treated with a single dose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day for 7 days, and if adherence with multiday dosing is a concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered. Because effectiveness data are limited among men who have sex with men (MSM), shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of symptoms, if present.

### Management of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States: summary of evidence from the development of the 2020 gonorrhea treatment recommendations and the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infection treatment guidelines [^b6a8d4ab]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all first-line recommended therapies, making gonococcal antimicrobial resistance a major public health concern given limited antibiotic options currently and an even smaller antimicrobial development pipeline. Since the release of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines, azithromycin, part of the 2015 dual-drug treatment regimen, has had a rapid rise in resistance. The 2020 CDC Gonorrhea Treatment Recommendations and the 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Treatment Guidelines were developed weighing the priorities of treating the individual, protecting the population, and preventing antimicrobial resistance.

Methods

Gonorrhea subject matter experts (SME) generated 8 key questions and conducted a literature review of updated data from 2013 to 2019 on gonorrhea antimicrobial resistance, treatment failures, clinical trials, and other key topics. More than 2200 abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were thoroughly reviewed. SMEs also evaluated N gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance data from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP).

Evidence

Although there have been reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures internationally, GISP data suggest that ceftriaxone minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have remained stable in the United States, with < 0.1% exhibiting an "alert value" MIC (> 0.25 mcg/mL). However, GISP documented a rapid rise in the proportion of isolates with an elevated MIC (≥ 2.0 mcg/mL) to azithromycin-nearly 5% in 2018. At the same time, new pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data are available, and there is greater recognition of the need for antimicrobial stewardship.

Summary

The 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines now recommend 500mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly once for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea at all anatomic sites. If coinfection with chlamydia has not been excluded, cotreatment with doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 7 days should be added. Few alternative therapies exist for persons with cephalosporin allergies; there are no recommended alternative therapies for N gonorrhoeae infection of the throat.

Other Management Considerations

To minimize disease transmission to sex partners, persons treated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen and resolution of symptoms if present. To minimize risk for reinfection, patients also should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their sex partners have been treated. Persons who receive a diagnosis of chlamydia should be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. MSM who are HIV negative with a rectal chlamydia diagnosis should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

Test of cure to detect therapeutic failure (i.e. repeat testing 4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for nonpregnant persons treated with the recommended or alternative regimens, unless therapeutic adherence is in question, symptoms persist, or reinfection is suspected. Moreover, using chlamydial NAATs at < 4 weeks after completion of therapy is not recommended because the continued presence of nonviable organisms can lead to false-positive results.

A high prevalence of C. trachomatis infection has been observed among women and men who were treated for chlamydial infection during the preceding months (,–). The majority of posttreatment infections do not result from treatment failure but rather from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved education and treatment of sex partners. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID and other complications among women. Men and women who have been treated for chlamydia should be retested approximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment.

A retrospective study was conducted on female patients who were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea. The purpose of the study was to determine if any factors predict empiric therapy at the index visit. Of 911 patients enrolled in the study, 100 were found to have positive DNA screens and 54 were given empiric therapy. A logistic regression was used to test the ability of age, ethnicity, DNA probe result and provider type (physician or midlevel provider), to predict empiric treatment. DNA probe result and provider type were the only 2 factors that were found to predict empiric therapy. A subsequent analysis using a Cochran-Mantel-Hanszel test to control for DNA probe result revealed that the provider type remained the only variable that predicted empiric treatment.

Screening Recommendations

STI screening among MSM has been reported to be suboptimal. In a cross-sectional sample of MSM in the United States, approximately one third reported not having had an STI test during the previous 3 years, and MSM with multiple sex partners reported less frequent screening. MSM living with HIV infection and engaged in care also experience suboptimal rates of STI testing. Limited data exist regarding the optimal frequency of screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis among MSM, with the majority of evidence derived from mathematical modeling. Models from Australia have demonstrated that increasing syphilis screening frequency from two times a year to four times a year resulted in a relative decrease of 84% from peak prevalence. In a compartmental model applied to different populations in Canada, quarterly syphilis screening averted more than twice the number of syphilis cases, compared with semiannual screening. Furthermore, MSM screening coverage needed for eliminating syphilis among a population is substantially reduced from 62% with annual screening to 23% with quarterly screening. In an MSM transmission model that explored the impact of HIV PrEP use on STI prevalence, quarterly chlamydia and gonorrhea screening was associated with an 83% reduction in incidence. The only empiric data available that examined the impact of screening frequency come from an observational cohort of MSM using HIV PrEP in which quarterly screening identified more bacterial STIs, and semiannual screening would have resulted in delayed treatment of 35% of total identified STI infections. In addition, quarterly screening was reported to have prevented STI exposure in a median of three sex partners per STI infection. On the basis of available evidence, quarterly screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis for certain sexually active MSM can improve case finding, which can reduce the duration of infection at the population level, reduce ongoing transmission and, ultimately, prevalence among this population.

Preventive screening for common STIs is indicated for all MSM. The following screening recommendations summarize published federal agency and USPSTF clinical prevention guidelines for MSM and should be performed at least annually.

HIV Infection

HIV serologic testing is indicated if HIV status is unknown or if HIV negative and the patient or their sex partner has had more than one sex partner since the most recent HIV test.

Syphilis

Syphilis serologic testing is indicated to establish whether persons with reactive tests have untreated syphilis, have partially treated syphilis, or are manifesting a slow or inadequate serologic response to recommended previous therapy.

### Evaluation of the performance of a point-of-care test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^dbd3f0f7]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the last several years, there have been sustained increases in rates of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/NG) in the United States as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since 2013, the rate of chlamydia infection has increased by 25%, while the rate of gonococcal infection has increased by 74% despite the availability of highly sensitive and specific laboratory-based molecular diagnostic tools for detection of these sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This increase is concerning because these STIs can increase HIV transmissionand have the potential to increase rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and tubal factor infertilityamong untreated women. These preventable sequelae of untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea infections are estimated to cost the US health care system billions of dollars per year.

These increases in rates, despite national recommendations, for at least annual screening of women younger than 25 years, men who have sex with men, and people taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis, coincide with reductions in funding for STI control programs and specialized STI clinical services. As a result of the reduced capacity of STI clinics to provide services that include screening, primary care professionals are expected to cover the gap in services. However, according to the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, at least one-half of women in the eligible age range who have an encounter with the health care system are not screened per CDC guidelines.

Further exacerbating our inability to control these STIs is the current reliance on either patients returning to receive treatment after laboratory test results are available or patients receiving treatment based on epidemiologic prediction of the best treatment based on clinical signs and patient-reported symptoms. In the first case, there are delays of usually 7 to 10 days between the initial office visit and treatment based on laboratory test results, which introduces the potential during that interval for infections to be transmitted to sexual partners and provides an opportunity for the development of PID. To avoid these outcomes, many practices, including STI clinics and emergency departments, provide epidemiologic treatment, or syndromic management, for chlamydia and gonorrhea. This practice can lead to undertreatment and overtreatment of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Treating for chlamydia or gonorrhea when the organisms may not be present should be discouraged for good antibiotic stewardship.

Harms are characterized as 'small to none'. The USPSTF assessment states 'Moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit' and 'Moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit', whereas there is 'Insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men', and 'Evidence is inadequate that screening men reduces infection complications and transmission or acquisition of either disease or HIV'.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^ec8cbe1d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Screening

Screening at-risk women for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recommended in the United States because infections are frequently asymptomatic; robust data exist on risk for sequelae from untreated infections; effective treatment is readily available; and, for chlamydia, data from a randomized trial demonstrated decreased risk for PID in persons screened and treated. M. genitalium meets only 1 of these criteria: infections are frequently asymptomatic (≈30%–60% in clinic populations). Data on the risk for sequelae from untreated M. genitalium infections in women are less robust than data for chlamydia. Prospective studies of sequelae in women are limited, challenging our ability to infer cause. No evidence of adverse sequelae in men exists, although such data are sparse. Given the high rates of macrolide resistance and the advent of fluoroquinolone treatment failures, effective treatment is not readily available for all infected persons (see section on antimicrobial therapies). Finally, randomized controlled trials evaluating whether screening and treatment of M. genitalium infections could prevent PID and perinatal complications are costly; to date, none have been undertaken despite the articulated need. Some population subgroups have higher risk for PID, and screening and treatment in those subgroups might yield greater benefit, but this possibility has not been assessed.

Benefits of Screening for M. genitalium

Screening and effectively treating asymptomatic persons for M. genitalium could theoretically reduce transmission and population-level prevalence. However, reductions in prevalence after implementing screening programs for sexually transmitted infections do not always occur, as demonstrated by increasing chlamydia prevalence in the United States. This increase has been offset by some declines in PID, although PID rates have slightly increased in recent years. If identified infections could be effectively treated while minimizing the selection of resistance, screening could reduce the likelihood of transmitted resistance, leading to subsequent reductions in the population-level prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

Harms of Screening for M. genitalium

If asymptomatic infections do not cause sequelae, screening and treating will result in unnecessary antibiotic exposure. On an individual level, antibiotics might disrupt a person's microbiota and lead to other health conditions, and adverse effects associated with antibiotics are occasionally serious. On a population level, more widespread antibiotic use speeds the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, and multidrug-resistant M. genitalium infections are often refractory to treatment. Anecdotal reports suggest that treatment-refractory infections can lead to anxiety and depression that would not occur in the absence of screening. Consistent with earlier assessments, screening asymptomatic persons for M. genitalium is not recommended in the 2021 CDC Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^971c0a3e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence supporting EPT is based on three U.S. clinical trials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia or gonorrhea. All three trials reported that more partners were treated when patients were offered EPT. Two reported statistically significant decreases in the rate of reinfection, and one observed a lower risk for persistent or recurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant. A fourth trial in the United Kingdom did not demonstrate a difference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of partners treated between persons offered EPT and those advised to notify their sex partners. U.S. trials and a meta-analysis of EPT revealed that the magnitude of reduction in reinfection of index patients, compared with patient referral, differed according to the STI and the sex of the index patient (,–). However, across trials, reductions in chlamydia prevalence at follow-up were approximately 20%, and reductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50% at follow-up.

Existing data indicate that EPT also might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis; however, no partner management intervention has been reported to be more effective than any other in reducing trichomoniasis reinfection rates. No data support use of EPT in the routine management of patients with syphilis.

Data are limited regarding use of EPT for gonococcal or chlamydial infections among MSM, compared with heterosexuals. Published studies, including recent data regarding extragenital testing, indicated that male partners of MSM with diagnosed gonorrhea or chlamydia might have other bacterial STIs (gonorrhea or syphilis) or HIV. Studies have reported that 5% of MSM have a new diagnosis of HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal or chlamydial infections; however, more recent data indicate that, in certain settings, the frequency of HIV infection is much lower. Considering limited data and potential for other bacterial STIs among MSM partners, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended. All persons who receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, particularly MSM, should be tested for HIV, and those at risk for HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^0bf0deb5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

A test-of-cure is unnecessary for persons with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens; however, for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended, using culture or nucleic acid amplification tests 7–14 days after initial treatment, regardless of the treatment regimen. Because reinfection within 12 months ranges from 7% to 12% among persons previously treated for gonorrhea, persons who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest within 12 months after initial treatment.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^c4adbb70]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment — CDC STI Treatment Guidelines should guide treatment of all STIs. In settings where same-day treatment is available, treatment for persons with STI symptoms and their partners can be offered while awaiting results of diagnostic tests, and when possible, STI treatment should be provided on-site rather than called into a pharmacy to reduce barriers and ensure access to medication. To limit possible complications, pregnant people diagnosed with an STI should be treated immediately in accordance with CDC STI Treatment Guidelines; treatment does not need to be initiated by an obstetrician/gynecologist or other specialist. Because the presence of an STI is a biological marker of risk for acquiring other STIs, people diagnosed with an STI should be offered testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and syphilis unless already done at initial screening, and individuals with HIV infection should be linked to ongoing HIV care and treatment.

### Screening for gonorrhea and Chlamydia: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^7fb14ab5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research has supported screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in asymptomatic, sexually active women (including pregnant women) who are younger than 25 years or at increased risk but not in other patient populations.

Purpose

To update the 2005 and 2007 systematic reviews for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in men and women, including pregnant women and adolescents.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1 January 2004 to 13 June 2014), Cochrane databases (May 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists.

Study Selection

English-language trials and observational studies about screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms.

Data Extraction

Extracted study data were confirmed by a second investigator, and study quality and applicability were dual-rated using prespecified criteria.

Data Synthesis

Screening a subset of asymptomatic young women for chlamydia in a good-quality trial did not significantly reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease over the following year (relative risk, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.14 to 1.08]); however, 1 previous trial reported a reduction. An observational study evaluating a risk prediction tool to identify persons with chlamydia in high-risk populations had low predictive ability and applicability. In 10 new studies of asymptomatic patients, nucleic acid amplification tests demonstrated sensitivity of 86% or greater and specificity of 97% or greater for diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia, regardless of specimen type or test.

Limitations

There were few relevant studies of screening benefits and harms. Only screening tests and methods cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for current clinical practice were included to determine diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion

Chlamydia screening in young women may reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease. Nucleic acid amplification tests are accurate for diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia in asymptomatic persons.

### Management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: evidence reviewed for the 2006 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^7d5618d2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In April 2005, in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted diseases (STD) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults. Key questions were posed and answered on the basis of quality of evidence and expert opinion. Clinical trials continue to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and tolerability of azithromycin and doxycycline regimens, and both remain recommended as first-line therapy in nonpregnant individuals. More data and clinical experience are available to support the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of azithromycin in pregnant women, and, in the upcoming guidelines, azithromycin will be recommended as first-line therapy for such patients. Evidence is building that expedited partner therapy (EPT), with provision of treatment or a prescription, may be just as effective as or more effective than standard partner referral in ensuring partner treatment and preventing chlamydia recurrence in women. Although there are more studies needed and barriers to be addressed before its widespread use, EPT will be recommended as an option for partner management.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^25721ecd]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Testing for sexually transmitted infections in people prescribed preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — Tests to screen for syphilis are recommended for all adults prescribed PrEP, both at screening and at semi-annual visits; tests to screen for gonorrhea are recommended for all sexually active adults prescribed PrEP, both at screening and at semi-annual visits; tests to screen for chlamydia are recommended for all sexually active MSM prescribed PrEP, both at screening prior to initiation and at semi-annual visits. Because chlamydia is very common and does not strongly correlate with risk of HIV acquisition, regular screening for chlamydia is not recommended for all sexually active women as a component of PrEP care. For gonorrhea and chlamydia testing in MSM, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are preferred because of their sensitivity, and pharyngeal, rectal, and urine specimens should be collected ("3-site testing"); self-collected samples have equivalent performance as clinician-obtained samples and can help streamline patient visit flow. For gonorrhea testing in women, vaginal specimens for NAAT tests are preferred and may also be self-collected; for women who report engaging in anal sex, rectal specimens for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing should be collected in addition to vaginal specimens. Studies have estimated that 29% of HIV infections in women are linked to sex with MSM and that more than 1/3 of women report having had anal sex; in the HPTN 064 trial that recruited women at high risk of HIV acquisition, 38% reported condomless anal sex in the 6 months prior to enrollment. Identifying asymptomatic rectal gonorrhea in women at substantial risk for HIV infection and providing treatment can provide benefits to the woman's health and help reduce the burden of infection in her sexual networks as well, especially when accompanied by partner services or expedited partner therapy.

### The initial reproductive health visit: ACOG committee opinion, number 811 [^df92775c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Initial reproductive health visit — sexually transmitted infection (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening — if patients are sexually active, annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea is recommended, and screening for STIs should be done in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines for "Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) Treatment and Screening". When appropriate, the health care professional should consider screening with a urine sample or an oral, vaginal or anal swab, and self-collected swabs may be a reasonable alternative if preferred by the patient. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that patients aged 13–64 years be tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime and annually thereafter based on factors related to risk, and trichomonas screening can be considered in high prevalence settings, in those with a high risk for infection, and with presenting concerns of vaginal discharge.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^ee79448c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx:

Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg (300 lb)

For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg (300 lb), 1 g of IM ceftriaxone should be administered.
If chlamydia coinfection is identified when pharyngeal gonorrhea testing is performed, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia.
No reliable alternative treatments are available for pharyngeal gonorrhea. For persons with a history of a beta-lactam allergy, a thorough assessment of the reaction is recommended. *
For persons with an anaphylactic or other severe reaction (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome) to ceftriaxone, consult an infectious disease specialist for an alternative treatment recommendation.

Abbreviation: IM = intramuscular.

* CDC. Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. MMWR Recomm Rep 2015;64(No. RR-3).

In cases where gonococcal expedited partner therapy (provision of prescriptions or medications for the patient to take to a sex partner without the health care provider first examining the partner) is permissible by state law and the partner is unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, the partner may be treated with a single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection in the patient has been excluded. Otherwise, the partner may be treated with a single oral 800 mg cefixime dose plus oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days.

In cases of suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, clinicians should obtain relevant clinical specimens for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, consult an infectious disease specialist or STD clinical expert for guidance in clinical management, and report the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities within 24 hours. Health departments should prioritize notification and culture evaluation for the patient's sex partner(s) from the preceding 60 days for those with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure or persons whose gonococcal isolates demonstrate reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins.

### A systematic review and appraisal of the quality of practice guidelines for the management ofinfections [^0631aeee]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines help ensure consistent care informed by current evidence. As shifts in antimicrobial resistance continue to influence first-line treatment, up-to-date guidelines are important for preventing treatment failure. A guideline's development process will influence its recommendations and users' trust.

Objective

To assess the quality of current gonorrhoea guidelines' development processes.

Data Sources

Multiple databases.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Original and current English-language guidelines targeting health professionals and containing treatment recommendations for uncomplicated gonorrhoea in the general adult population.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Two appraisers assessed the guidelines independently using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. Scores were combined as per the AGREE II users' manual.

Results

We identified 10 guidelines meeting the inclusion criteria. The quality of the gonorrhoea treatment guidelines varied. Most scored poorly on Rigour of Development; information on the evidence review process and methods for formulating recommendations was often missing. The WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and UK National Guideline for the Management of Gonorrhoea in Adults scored the highest on Rigour of Development. Methods to address conflicts of interest were often not described in the materials reviewed. Implementation of recommendations was often not addressed.

Limitations

By limiting our study to English-language guidelines, a small number of guidelines we identified were excluded. Our analysis was limited to either published or online materials that were readily available to users. We could not differentiate between items addressed in the development process but not documented from items that were not addressed.

Conclusions and Implications Of Key Findings

Gonorrhoea treatment guidelines may slow antimicrobial resistance. Many current guidelines are not in line with the current guideline development best practices; this might undermine the perceived trustworthiness of guidelines. By identifying current limitations, this study can help improve the quality of future guidelines.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^f770e1ad]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for sexually transmitted infections — efficacy, resistance, and use recommendations are detailed as follows: The final analysis confirmed preventative effects of doxyPEP against first episodes of chlamydia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.14; 95% CI, .09–.23; P < .0001), syphilis (aHR, 0.21; 95% CI, .11–.41; P < .001), and gonorrhea (aHR, 0.67; 95% CI, .52–.87; P = 0.003). Consistent with local epidemiology, high-level tetracycline resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration > 8 mg/L) was more common in incident samples from the doxyPEP arm than the control arm (36% vs 13%). In a randomized, open-label trial among transgender women and men who have sex with men in Kenya, there was no difference between the doxyPEP arm and the standard-of-care arm in the incidence of chlamydia or gonorrhea, and in a subset of the doxyPEP arm, doxycycline was present in only 29% of hair samples, while high-level tetracycline resistance was seen in 100% of gonorrhea samples identified at baseline and at study end. DoxyPEP is recommended for cisgender gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with cisgender men and for transgender women who have a history of at least 1 diagnosis of syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea within the last 12 months or who anticipate sexual activities associated with increased likelihood of STI acquisition; no recommendations can be made at this time for cisgender women, cisgender heterosexual men, transgender men, and other gender-diverse persons, and use in these populations should be based on shared decision-making. Those who receive doxyPEP should continue to receive routine screening for asymptomatic STIs and ongoing evaluation of the need for continuing doxyPEP, and the main concern for doxyPEP implementation is the risk of antimicrobial resistance; providing doxyPEP to all PrEP users or people with HIV prevented more STIs but was less efficient and exposed more people to doxycycline (higher number needed to treat to prevent 1 STI).

### Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women [^e5377587]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in women, thus it can produce infertility and chronic pelvic pain. In men infection is mainly symptomatic, but can evolve to prostatitis. Clinical practice guidelines for CT urogenital infections do not give any specific recommendation about which antibiotic use as first option OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for CT genital infection in men and non-pregnant women.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections' (STI) Information Specialist developed the electronic searches in electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS), and trials registers. We searched studies published from inception to June 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of men, and sexually-active, non-pregnant women with CT infection (urethritis or uterine cervicitis or asymptomatic), diagnosed by cell culture for CT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) or antigen-based detection methods, who had been treated with any of the antibiotic regimens recommended by any of the updated to 2013 CT Guidelines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors screened evidence according to selection criteria and independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Two authors developed the 'Summary of findings' tables. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis model for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect. We estimated the pooled risk ratio in order to establish the effects of the comparisons. Our primary outcomes were microbiological failure and adverse events, and our secondary outcomes were clinical failure, antimicrobial resistance and reinfection.

Main Results

We selected 14 studies (2715 participants: 2147 (79.08%) men and 568 (20.92%) women). The studies were conducted mainly at STD clinics. Sample sizes ranged from 71 to 606 participants; follow-up was 29.7 days on average. For the comparison: azithromycin single dose versus doxycycline once or twice daily for 7 days, in men treated for CT, the risk of microbiological failure was higher in the azithromycin group (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.41; participants = 821; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence), but regarding clinical failure, the results showed that the effect is uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.43 to 2,05; I² = 55%; participants = 525; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). Regarding adverse events (AE) in men there could be little or no difference between the antibiotics (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; participants = 1424; studies = 6; low-quality evidence). About women treated for CT, the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 6.16; participants = 338; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence). There were no studies assessing clinical failure or adverse events in women, however, we found that azithromycin probably has fewer adverse events in both genders (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98; I² = 0%; participants = 2261; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence). For the second comparison: doxycycline compared to ofloxacin, for men treated for CT the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR 8.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 167.38, I² not applicable; participants = 80; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence), as also it was on clinical failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.62; participants = 36; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). The effect of in women on clinical failure was uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.25; I² = 39%; participants = 127; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence). Regarding adverse events, the effect in both men and women was uncertain (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; participants = 339 studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). The effect on microbiological failure in women and in men and women together, the effect on microbiological failure was not estimable. The most frequently AE reported were not serious and of gastrointestinal origin. No studies assessed antimicrobial resistance or reinfection in either comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

In men, regimens with azithromycin are probably less effective than doxycycline for microbiological failure, however, there might be little or no difference for clinical failure. For women, we are uncertain whether azithromycin compared to doxycycline increases the risk of microbiological failure. Azithromycin probably slightly reduces adverse events compared to doxycycline in men and women together but may have little difference in men alone. We are uncertain whether doxycycline compared to ofloxacin reduces microbiological failure in men or women alone, or men and women together, nor if it reduces clinical failure or adverse events in men or women. Based on the fact that women suffer mainly asymptomatic infections, and in order to test the effectiveness and safety of the current recommendations (azithromycin, doxycycline and ofloxacin), for CT infection, especially in low and middle income countries, future RCTs should be designed and conducted to include a large enough sample size of women, and with low risk of bias. It is also important that future RCTs include adherence, CT resistance to antibiotic regimens, and risk of reinfection as outcomes to be measured. In addition, it is important to conduct a network meta-analysis in order to evaluate all those studies that included in one arm only the current antibiotic treatments for CT infection that are recommended by the updated clinical practice guidelines.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^dcd3f37c]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) patients — expedited partner therapy (EPT) and partner services guidance states that heterosexually-active adults and adolescents evaluated for or prescribed PrEP in whom gonorrhea or chlamydia infection is detected should be offered EPT, especially when partners are unlikely to access timely evaluation and treatment. EPT is legal in most states but varies by infection; providers should visit http://www.cdc.gov/std/ept for updated state information. For men who have sex with men, in light of limited data and the potential for other bacterial sexually transmitted infections in partners, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended. Patients with syphilis or HIV diagnosed should be referred for partner services.

Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

1.1 Adult Patients

Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.

Urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Genital ulcer disease in men due to Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). Due to the small number of women included in clinical trials, the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of chancroid in women has not been established.

1.2 Pediatric Patients

[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]

1.3 Limitations of Use

Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following:­

1.4 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening in United States emergency departments [^69310380]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) are the most commonly reported notifiable diseases in the United States, with annual reported cases exceeding 1.2 million and estimated costs exceeding $1.2 billion. Reported Emergency Department (ED) prevalence rates for CT and GC for adolescents and young adults range from 0.9% to 8.1%.

Objective

Our aim was to evaluate the burden of CT/GC infection in ED patients, assess the extent of associated under- and overtreatment, and investigate mechanisms whereby ED screening can be feasible.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of the time period from 1995 to 2010.

Discussion

Positivity rates for ED patients are comparable with other high-risk populations, and sufficient for selected screening to be cost-effective. Unfortunately, ED patient follow-up is notoriously difficult, and clinicians frequently must choose to either delay treatment until laboratory confirmation or presumptively treat based on presenting symptoms and clinical diagnosis. This results in high rates of both undertreatment (i.e., not treating those infected) and overtreatment (i.e., treating those who are infection-free). Incorrect on-the-spot treatment decisions can result in potentially infected future partners and lack of follow-up treatment, or unnecessary treatment and personal stress associated with improper diagnosis.

Conclusions

ED clinician activities are frequently symptom-driven, and screening nonsymptomatic patients presents a major barrier. Educating ED clinicians on the topics of CT/GC epidemiology, sample collection, and analysis will enable them to address the risks in their presenting populations. Collaboration with health department partners for sample analysis, cost-sharing, and patient follow-up can make routine screening feasible and enable EDs to become more important partners in intervention programs.

### Bacterial sexually transmitted infections are concentrated in subpopulations of men who have sex with men using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^06115d7f]. AIDS (2023). Medium credibility.

Modelling studies have shown that more frequent screening could reduce the incidence of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis, but these results have not been corroborated by empirical studies on opportunistic testing or within low-risk subpopulations. Due to frequent screening, asymptomatic STIs are detected sooner and reducing the screening frequency (e.g. to 6-monthly) would lead to delayed diagnosis for many of these STIs and possible onward transmission. However, screening for STIs, primarily chlamydia and gonorrhea, is costly and screening 6-monthly is more cost-effective than 3-monthly. In addition, chlamydia and gonorrhea infections can clear spontaneously, thus may not require treatment. Moreover, unnecessary treatments might induce antimicrobial resistance. A previous study among PrEP users showed that macrolide consumption decreased by 75% when the screening frequency was decreased from 3-monthly to 6-monthly. While asymptomatic STIs may remain undetected longer, the risk of serious sequela of syphilis, chlamydia or gonorrhea is limited in men if diagnosed within 6 months. Moreover, symptomatic STIs are likely diagnosed and treated regardless of screening frequency. With this in mind, screening 6-monthly and allowing interval STI testing upon symptoms could substantially decrease both costs of PrEP programs and antibiotic use.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: summary of evidence reviewed for the 2015 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^3e338bc6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2013 to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STDs. This article summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection in adolescents and adults that were considered in development of the 2015 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on CT infection risk factors in women, clinical significance of oropharyngeal CT detection, acceptability and performance of CT testing on self-collected specimens in men, performance of CT point-of-care tests, efficacy of recommended and investigational CT infection treatments, and timing of test of cure following CT infection treatment in pregnant women.

### Management of gonorrhea in adolescents and adults in the United States [^b8cd0390]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States and is associated with serious health sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Treatment for gonorrhea has been complicated by antimicrobial resistance. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to each of the antimicrobials that were previously recommended as first-line treatment regimens, and current treatment options are severely limited. This article summarizes the key questions and data that were discussed at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines Expert Consultation meeting in April 2013, and the rationale for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in adolescents and adults. Key issues addressed include whether to change the dosage of ceftriaxone and azithromycin used in the recommended dual treatment regimen, whether to continue to list dual treatment with cefixime and azithromycin as an alternative treatment regimen, and management of gonococcal infections in persons with severe cephalosporin allergy or suspected treatment failure.

### Emergency department management of sexually transmitted infections [^26a727fc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Patients seeking treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) account for a large number of emergency department (ED) visits per year. Despite the large volume of patients, STIs are often missed or treated inappropriately. Due to the high prevalence and incidence of STIs in the United States, it is important that emergency practitioners recognize symptoms consistent with STIs, and treat presumptively. This practice leads to overtreatment of STIs; however, when weighed against the public health risk and complications of untreated disease, empiric treatment is recommended. This article provides an overview of STIs encountered in the ED and recommendations for their treatment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing exposure and disease in persons with HIV infection — primary prevention should begin with a behavioral risk assessment and routine discussion of sexual behaviors, and health care providers should discuss client-centered risk reduction messages and provide specific actions that reduce sexually transmitted disease acquisition and HIV transmission. Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all sexually active persons with HIV infection, with more frequent screening (i.e., every 3–6 months) for those with multiple or anonymous partners; the occurrence of syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infection should prompt intensified risk assessment, counseling, and strong consideration of referral for behavioral intervention. Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea at anatomic sites of exposure in men and for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in women. Frequent serologic screening can identify persons recently infected, sometimes before infectious lesions, and treatment can prevent disease progression and transmission; historically, approximately one-third of sex partners of persons with primary syphilis will develop syphilis within 30 days of exposure.

### Sexually transmitted infections: updates from the 2021 CDC guidelines [^8eb6792a]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^f11fd27e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Partner services, including expedited partner therapy — patients should be counseled about the need to communicate with, evaluate, and treat partner(s) to avoid reinfection, and clinical staff can assist partner notification through coaching, written information, or outreach with consent. It is important to encourage all partners to seek timely evaluation and treatment; if same-day testing and treatment did not occur, providers can encourage patients to return with partner(s) and treat everyone concurrently. Expedited partner therapy (EPT) — treating sex partners of persons diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea by providing prescriptions or medications to the person to give to their partner(s) without the health care provider first examining the partner(s) — is a strategy to increase access to treatment, and EPT is legal in most states. Providers should routinely offer EPT to people with chlamydia, and for partners exposed to gonorrhea, every effort should be made to provide treatment using the recommended intramuscular treatment regimen; however, if intramuscular treatment is unable or unlikely to be accessed, EPT can be provided using the oral treatment regimen recommended by the CDC. People may also use online anonymous partner notification services, though the effectiveness of these services is unknown.

### Should we still treat asymptomaticandcontacts in the era of NAATs? Reviewing data from the getaKit study to inform practice [^aec28cfa]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine positivity rates for participants in the GetaKit study who identified as asymptomatic contacts of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and/or Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). Our goal was to shed light on current discrepancies between international sexually transmitted infection (STI) guidelines, some of which recommend blanket empiric treatment for all NG and CT contacts (eg, Canadian and United States guidelines) versus others which recommend waiting for positive results (BASHH, Australian, and European).

Methods

We extracted data for the period of 1 June 2023 to 30 June 2025 from GetaKit, which is a research website through which persons in Ontario, Canada can complete an online risk assessment and obtain access to laboratory-based testing for STIs, including NG, CT, HIV, syphilis and hepatitis C. From these data, we calculated positivity rates for NG and CT and the numbers needed to treat. We also evaluated for correlations of risk factors for testing positive.

Results

During our 25-month study period, participants ordered NG/CT testing 12775 times. In a total of 6.7% of these orders, participants identified as an NG and/or CT contact. Positivity rates, for all completed testing, were 1.2% (n = 115 diagnoses) for NG and 4.3% (n = 395 diagnoses) for CT. Positivity among asymptomatic contacts ranged from 0% for NG in heterosexual males to 30.6% for CT in females who were ≤ 24 years old, with most positivity rates being < 20% for both infections.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that blanket recommendations to treat or defer treatment seems inappropriate. More nuance is required. Empiric treatment of all NG and CT contacts will likely result in mass overuse of antibiotics. In contrast, deferring treatment seems inappropriate for asymptomatic females who are ≤ 24 years old and for anyone who cannot immediately obtain testing and treatment.

### Treatment of sexually transmitted diseases in women [^4c16d948]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of patients with sexually transmitted infection are developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field. This article briefly introduces various infections, reviews new diagnostic information, and presents the latest guidelines for therapy. All recommended and alternative regimens are drawn from the most recent treatment guidelines. Although this article focuses primarily on therapy, it also emphasizes the importance of counseling and prevention. Clinicians have the opportunity and obligation to provide education and counseling to patients. Prevention messages should be tailored to the individual patient with consideration given to her specific risk behaviors.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in April 2009 to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing the diagnosis and management of STDs. This article summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infection in adolescents and adults that were considered in development of the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on specimen types used for nucleic acid amplification testing for chlamydia diagnosis, considerations in screening men for chlamydia and repeat testing after infected men receive treatment, and the natural history of chlamydia.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^c089ba2d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual therapy for gonococcal infection with ceftriaxone and azithromycin recommended in previous guidance might have mitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae; however, concerns regarding potential harm to the microbiome and the effect on other pathogens diminishes the benefits of maintaining dual therapy. Consequently, only ceftriaxone is recommended for treating gonorrhea in the United States. Clinicians remaining vigilant for treatment failures is paramount, and CDC plans to continue to monitor for changing ceftriaxone MICs until additional antimicrobials or a vaccine is available. In cases in which chlamydial infection has not been excluded, patients should also receive antichlamydial therapy. CDC and state health departments participate in CDC-supported gonorrhea surveillance activities and can provide the most current information regarding gonococcal susceptibility.

Criteria for resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone have not been defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). However, isolates with cefixime or ceftriaxone MICs ≥ 0.5 µ g/mL are considered to have decreased susceptibility. In the United States, the proportion of isolates in GISP demonstrating decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone or cefixime has remained low; during 2019, < 0.1% of isolates with decreased susceptibility (MIC ≥ 0.5 µ g/mL) to ceftriaxone or cefixime were identified. Because increasing MICs might predict resistance emergence, GISP established lower cephalosporin MIC threshold values that are lower than the susceptibility breakpoints set by CLSI to provide greater sensitivity in detecting decreasing gonococcal susceptibility for surveillance purposes. The percentage of isolates with cefixime MICs ≥ 0.25 µ g/mL increased from 0.1% during 2006 to 1.4% during 2011 and declined to 0.3% during 2019. The percentage of isolates with ceftriaxone MICs ≥ 0.125 µ g/mL increased from < 0.1% in 2006 to 0.4% in 2011 and decreased to 0.1% in 2019. Isolates with high-level cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs (MICs = 1.5–8.0 µ g/mL and MICs = 1.5–4.0 µ g/mL, respectively) have been identified in Japan, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Decreased susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to cephalosporins and other antimicrobials is expected to continue; state and local surveillance for antimicrobial resistance is crucial for guiding local therapy recommendations. Although approximately 3% of all U.S. men who have gonococcal infections are sampled through GISP, surveillance by clinicians also is crucial. Clinicians who diagnose N. gonorrhoeae infection in a person with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure should perform culture and AST of relevant clinical specimens, consult an infectious disease specialist or an STD clinical expert for guidance in clinical management, and report the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities within 24 hours. Isolates should be saved and sent to CDC through local and state public health laboratory mechanisms. Health departments should prioritize notification and culture evaluation for sexual partners of persons with N. gonorrhoeae infection thought to be associated with cephalosporin treatment failure or persons whose isolates demonstrate decreased susceptibility to cephalosporin. Agar dilution is the reference standard and preferred method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing with N. gonorrhoeae. Antibiotic gradient strips, such as Etest (bioMérieux), can be used and are considered an acceptable alternative for quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing with N. gonorrhoeae when manufacturer instructions are followed. Disc diffusion only provides qualitative susceptibility results.
