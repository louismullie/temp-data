per aafp guidelines, write an mdm for a patient who presents with a cat bite to the hand

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an MDM per AAFP guidelines for a patient who presents with a cat bite to the hand. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratification and anatomic concerns unique to hand bites. Then, I should verify wound care priorities including irrigation, debridement, and whether to close or leave open. Next, I will review antibiotic prophylaxis indications, first-line agents, and penicillin-allergy options and double-check areas where guidelines diverge. After that, I need to confirm tetanus and rabies prophylaxis decisions. Finally, I will assess indications for imaging and surgical consultation, set follow-up timing with red flags, and consolidate a clear, defensible plan with patient education, all while checking consistency with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the infection risk profile for a cat bite to the hand, because this drives the rest of the plan. Hand bites are high risk due to tendon sheaths, joints, and tight compartments that allow rapid spread; cat bites also inject Pasteurella and mixed aerobes/anaerobes through puncture wounds, which have higher infection rates than many other bite scenarios, so I should not minimize risk here [^1151yZdu] [^111qxQys].

> I need to ensure early source control with meticulous wound care before talking antibiotics, since inadequate irrigation and debridement undermine any drug regimen. Copious high-pressure irrigation with saline and careful removal of devitalized tissue are essential, and I should splint and elevate the hand to reduce edema and limit dissemination; let me verify that contemporary trauma–infectious surgery consensus continues to endorse thorough cleaning and debridement for all mammalian bites, which it does [^113Xs2eU] [^111ZTZw7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about closing the wound, especially on the hand. For cat bites to the hand, I should generally avoid primary closure because of the high infection risk; leaving the wound open with consideration of delayed primary closure after short observation is preferred, whereas primary closure is better reserved for select low-risk dog bites, not this scenario [^1151yZdu] [^114wZCqa].

> Now, antibiotic prophylaxis is the next decision point, and I should double-check the indications and duration. Despite a classic Cochrane review that did not show a benefit across all cat and dog bites, modern primary care evidence and multidisciplinary trauma guidance emphasize tailoring prophylaxis to high-risk bites; the hand location and cat inoculum together meet criteria where prophylaxis is recommended, typically for 3 to 5 days, with amoxicillin–clavulanate as first line to cover Pasteurella, streptococci, staphylococci, and anaerobes; I should note that recent global guidance also cautions against routine prophylaxis for all mammalian bites, but hand bites remain a clear exception where prophylaxis is still advised [^1145Cuy8] [^1151yZdu] [^114nrpNG].

> For first-line therapy, I will specify adult dosing as amoxicillin–clavulanate 875/125 mg by mouth twice daily for 3 to 5 days, adjusting for renal function and clinical evolution, because this is repeatedly endorsed for cat bites and has the right spectrum for Pasteurella and oral anaerobes; I should confirm there is no need to add routine MRSA coverage in prophylaxis unless patient-specific risks exist, and current primary care guidance supports this focused approach [^1151yZdu].

> For penicillin allergy, let me think this through carefully and then verify the spectrum. An initial thought is doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole double-strength twice daily, or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily plus metronidazole 500 mg four times daily, to ensure Pasteurella and anaerobe coverage with added MRSA activity; wait, I should verify and correct this because moxifloxacin already has anaerobic coverage, so adding metronidazole is redundant, and the rationale for adding TMP-SMX to doxycycline for prophylaxis is weak since doxycycline alone covers Pasteurella and common aerobes and MRSA prophylaxis is not routinely needed; therefore, better-validated alternatives include doxycycline-based regimens or combinations like clindamycin plus a fluoroquinolone when anaerobic and gram-negative coverage are needed, chosen case-by-case with stewardship in mind [^1151yZdu] [^114nrpNG].

> Next, I should review tetanus status and not miss an opportunity to prevent a serious but preventable complication. For dirty wounds such as animal bites, if vaccination history is unknown or incomplete, give tetanus immune globulin plus Tdap; if the series is complete and the last booster was more than 5 years ago, give a Td or Tdap booster now; if the last booster was within 5 years, no booster is needed; I need to check ACIP's most recent recommendations, which align with this approach in current practice summaries [^111foBBw] [^111SsSXS].

> I will now examine rabies risk, and I should be systematic. If the cat is healthy, vaccinated, and can be observed for 10 days, observation without immediate post-exposure prophylaxis is standard; however, if the cat is stray, unavailable, ill, or displays neurologic signs, I should contact public health immediately to assess for rabies PEP; I need to ensure documentation and local coordination, as recommended in primary care and trauma–infectious guidance [^1151yZdu] [^1151yZdu].

> Let me consider additional evaluation to avoid missing deep-space involvement. I should obtain radiographs if there is pain over bone, suspected retained tooth fragment, or concern for joint penetration, and I need a low threshold to consult hand surgery for suspected flexor tenosynovitis, septic arthritis, or deep-space infection; if infection evolves, I should confirm that IDSA supports obtaining cultures of purulent material and blood cultures for cellulitis arising from animal bites to help direct therapy [^111qxQys] [^114mbgxG].

> I need to ensure close follow-up because early deterioration can be subtle in hand infections. Re-evaluation within 24 to 48 hours is prudent to look for progressive erythema, swelling, purulence, fever, disproportionate pain, pain with passive stretch, reduced range of motion, or lymphangitic streaking; any such findings should prompt escalation to intravenous antibiotics and urgent hand surgical evaluation, and I should double-check that primary care guidance emphasizes short-interval reassessment for high-risk bites like this [^1151yZdu] [^111qxQys].

> But wait, what about patient education and self-care while awaiting reassessment. I should instruct on elevation and splinting, keeping the wound clean and dry, strict adherence to antibiotics, and precise return precautions for fever, spreading redness, drainage, increasing pain, limited motion, or numbness; this aligns with practical primary-care bite management recommendations that reduce missed infections through clear safety-netting [^1151yZdu].

> Let me now consolidate a final, defensible plan and verify consistency with the cited guidance. Diagnosis is cat bite to the hand, a high-risk wound; management includes copious irrigation and debridement with the wound left open, splinting and elevation, antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin–clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily for 3 to 5 days or an appropriate validated alternative in penicillin allergy as above, tetanus updated per status, rabies risk assessed with 10-day observation if the cat is healthy and available, imaging and hand-surgery consultation as indicated by depth or evolving signs, and follow-up in 24 to 48 hours with strict return precautions; this plan reflects AAFP bite care, WSES/SIS-E and trauma–infectious wound-care consensus, ACIP tetanus guidance, and IDSA culture recommendations if infection develops [^1151yZdu] [^113Xs2eU] [^111ZTZw7] [^111foBBw] [^114mbgxG].

A cat bite to the hand requires **immediate irrigation and debridement** to reduce infection risk [^113Xs2eU] [^111ZTZw7], and **amoxicillin-clavulanate is first-line** for prophylaxis or treatment [^1151yZdu]. Assess for **deep structure injury** [^111qxQys], obtain radiographs if foreign body or bone involvement is suspected [^1151yZdu], and update tetanus if indicated [^111foBBw]. Rabies prophylaxis is generally unnecessary for domestic cats unless the animal is unavailable or symptomatic [^117RdE77]. Arrange **close follow-up within 24–48 hours** to monitor for infection or complications [^1151yZdu], and refer to hand surgery for deep space infection, tendon or joint involvement, or failure to improve [^111qxQys].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

Obtain a detailed history — including time since injury, the animal's vaccination and health status, patient comorbidities, and immunization status — and perform a focused examination assessing puncture wounds, erythema, swelling, tenderness, warmth, purulence, lymphangitis, and neurovascular status [^1151yZdu]. Hand bites carry a **high infection risk** [^111qxQys] due to relatively avascular compartments and inoculation of oral flora; risk increases with delayed presentation, immunocompromise, diabetes, or deep puncture wounds [^1151yZdu].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Order **radiographs** when a foreign body, fracture, or osteomyelitis is suspected [^1151yZdu]. Routine laboratory testing is unnecessary for uncomplicated bites; obtain wound cultures if infection is suspected [^114mbgxG].

---

## Wound management

Perform **immediate high-pressure irrigation** with sterile saline or dilute antiseptic [^113Xs2eU], then debride devitalized tissue [^111ZTZw7]. Leave puncture wounds open [^111qxQys], and consider delayed primary closure for large lacerations after 48–72 hours if no infection is present.

---

## Antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment

- **Indications**: Prophylaxis is recommended for all cat bites to the hand due to high infection risk [^1151yZdu].

- **First-line antibiotic**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID for 5–7 days [^1151yZdu].

- **Penicillin allergy**: Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID or TMP-SMX plus metronidazole or clindamycin [^1151yZdu].

- **MRSA coverage**: Add doxycycline or TMP-SMX if MRSA risk is high [^112wHZ8g].

---

## Tetanus and rabies prophylaxis

Update **tetanus immunization** if more than 5 years have elapsed since the last dose, administering Td or Tdap as indicated [^111SsSXS] [^111foBBw]. Rabies postexposure prophylaxis is generally unnecessary for domestic cats unless the animal is unavailable for observation or symptomatic; consult public health authorities if there is uncertainty [^117RdE77].

---

## Indications for surgical consultation

- **Deep structure involvement**: Tendon, joint, or bone involvement.

- **Progressive infection**: Rapidly spreading cellulitis, abscess, or necrotizing infection.

- **Failure of medical management**: No improvement after 48 hours of antibiotics [^111qxQys].

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Arrange **re-evaluation within 24–48 hours** to assess for developing infection or other complications [^1151yZdu]. Educate the patient on signs of infection (erythema, swelling, pain, and fever) and provide clear return precautions for any worsening symptoms.

---

## Documentation and coding

Document the history, examination findings, wound care performed, **antibiotics prescribed**, immunizations given, and follow-up plan. Use ICD-10 codes S61.451A (puncture wound with foreign body, right hand) or S61.452A (left hand) as appropriate, and CPT codes 12001–12007 for wound repair if performed.

---

## Summary of management plan

Initial assessment includes the history, focused examination, and risk stratification [^1151yZdu]. Diagnostic evaluation includes radiographs when indicated [^1151yZdu]. Wound management consists of irrigation and debridement with consideration of delayed closure [^111ZTZw7] [^114wZCqa]; **provide antibiotic prophylaxis** with amoxicillin-clavulanate or alternatives as appropriate [^1151yZdu], update tetanus [^111foBBw], and administer rabies prophylaxis only if indicated [^117RdE77]. Obtain surgical consultation for deep-structure involvement or failure of medical management [^111qxQys], arrange follow-up in 24–48 hours, and reinforce patient education on infection signs and return precautions [^1151yZdu]. Cat bites to the hand carry a **high risk of infection** and complications [^111qxQys]; prompt assessment, irrigation, and **appropriate antibiotics are essential** [^113Xs2eU] [^1151yZdu], with close follow-up and surgical consultation as needed.

### Association of duration and type of surgical prophylaxis with antimicrobial-associated adverse events [^114GfDRd]. JAMA Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The benefits of antimicrobial prophylaxis are limited to the first 24 hours postoperatively. Little is known about the harms associated with continuing antimicrobial prophylaxis after skin closure.

The objective of this study was to characterize the association of type and duration of prophylaxis with surgical site infection (SSI), acute kidney injury (AKI), and Clostridium difficile infection.

In this multicenter, national retrospective cohort study, all patients within the national Veterans Affairs health care system who underwent cardiac, orthopedic total joint replacement, colorectal, and vascular procedures and who received planned manual review by a trained nurse reviewer for type and duration of surgical prophylaxis and for SSI from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2013, were included. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, with adjustments for covariates determined a priori to be associated with the outcomes of interest. Data were analyzed from December 2016 to December 2018.

Exposure durations of postoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis included < 24 hours, 24- < 48 hours, 48- < 72 hours, and ≥ 72 hours.

The main outcomes and measures were surgical site infection, AKI, and C difficile infection.

Of the 79,058 included patients, 76,109 (96.3%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 64.8 (9.4) years. Among 79,058 surgical procedures in the cohort, all had SSI and C difficile outcome data available; 71,344 (90.2%) had AKI outcome data. After stratification by type of surgery and adjustment for age, sex, race, diabetes, and smoking, the results were analyzed.

### Low risk of infection in selected human bites treated without antibiotics [^113zD73b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the need for antibiotics in low-risk human bite wounds, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 127 patients with low-risk human bite wounds over two years at a major academic emergency department with 40,000 visits per year was conducted. Low-risk bites penetrated only the epidermis and did not involve hands, feet, skin overlying joints, or cartilaginous structures. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, puncture wounds, immunocompromise, allergy to penicillin or related compounds, or bites greater than 24 hours old. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a cephalexin/penicillin combination or a placebo. One hundred twenty-five patients completed the study. Infection developed in 1 of 62 patients receiving placebo (1.6%, 95% confidence interval, 0–7.3%). Infection developed in 0 of 63 patients receiving the cephalexin/penicillin combination (0%, 95% CI, 0–4.6%). Antibiotic treatment of some low-risk human bite wounds could be unnecessary. Infection rates appear similar in low-risk human bite wounds whether treated with antibiotics or placebo.

### Indications for medical antibiotic prophylaxis and potential targets for antimicrobial stewardship intervention: a narrative review [^1148Gx5x]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Most of the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) literature has focused on antimicrobial consumption for the treatment of infections, the prophylaxis of surgical site infection, and the prevention of endocarditis. However, the role of AMS in medical antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) has not been adequately addressed.

- **Aims**: To identify targets for AMS interventions for medical AP in adult patients.

- **Sources**: Targeted searches were conducted in PubMed.

- **Content**: The various indications for medical AP and relevant evidence from practice guidelines are outlined. The following were identified as potential targets for AMS interventions: (a) addressing under-utilization of antibiotic-sparing strategies (e.g. for recurrent urinary tract infections, soft-tissue infections, and exacerbations associated with bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), (b) reducing unnecessary AP beyond recommended indications (e.g. for acute pancreatitis, bite wounds, or urinary catheter manipulations), (c) reducing the use of AP with a broader spectrum than necessary, (d) reducing the use of AP for longer than the recommended duration (e.g. AP for prevention of osteomyelitis in open fractures or in high-risk neutropenia), (e) evaluating the role of antibiotic cycling to prevent the emergence of resistance during prolonged AP (e.g. in recurrent urinary tract infections or prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and (f) addressing research gaps regarding appropriate indications or antibiotic regimens for medical prophylaxis.

- **Implications**: This review summa

### Unilateral electric cataract: Scheimpflug imaging and review of the literature [^1122FiNB]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A 22-year-old man presented with diminished vision in the left eye one month after sustaining an injury from a high-voltage electric shock to the left side of his head. Slit lamp examination and Scheimpflug imaging confirmed the typical anterior subcapsular lenticular opacities in the left eye and also documented early anterior subcapsular vacuoles in the right eye. Based on the patient's history, the electric shock wound, and the appearance of the opacities, an electric cataract was diagnosed. The difference in lens density between the two eyes was also documented. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and counting fingers at 1 foot in the left eye.

Phacoaspiration and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation were performed in the left eye. Postoperatively, the BCVA improved to 20/20. The developmental mechanisms of these opacities after exposure to an electric shock and the role of Scheimpflug imaging in assessing the earliest subclinical manifestations of electric cataract injuries are discussed.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) related complications in surgical patients [^114kidTv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

The risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is generally low, yet it affects up to 33% of patients after certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infection can manifest as surgical site infections (SSIs), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteremia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs varies from 1% to 33%, depending on the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals involved. The optimal prophylactic antibiotic regimen for preventing MRSA post-surgery remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits and harms of various antibiotic prophylaxis methods in preventing postoperative MRSA infection and related complications in surgical patients.

- **Search methods**: In March 2013, we searched multiple databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (The Cochrane Library), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared one antibiotic regimen used as prophylaxis for SSIs (and other postoperative infections) against another antibiotic regimen or no antibiotic, while reporting the methicillin resistance status of the cultured organisms. We did not limit our search for RCTs by language.

### Antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis for snake-bitten patients [^112KYRtc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Low credibility.

To improve management, empiric antibiotics should be directed toward patients at particular risk or suspected of snakebite-related infection. Houcke et al. demonstrated that tissue necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, and thrombocytopenia can predict secondary infection after snakebite. Local envenoming signs should not be confused with infectious manifestations. However, snakebite-related infection can be suspected in the case of frank local inflammatory symptoms, and this presentation justifies empiric antibiotic prescription. A definite diagnosis of infection can only be made and targeted treatment provided when the responsible microorganism is isolated.

International consortiums recommend amoxicillin–clavulanate (AMC) to prevent infection after an animal bite. These recommendations are based on studies involving dog, cat, and human bites, but not snakes. Indeed, snake oral microbiota differ from those of other animals, making AMC ineffective against the involved bacteria most of the time. Studies on the oral microbiota of snakes and causal bacteria of snakebite-related infection, including the new report from Bonilla-Aldana et al, show that isolated microorganisms are mostly Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Morganella morganii, non-fermentative bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila, or Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These bacteria usually originate from the snakes' mouth, contaminated by the fecal flora of prey, which may defecate while being ingested, or from the environment (e.g. A. hydrophila, especially in wet areas).

### Early recognition of methicillin-resistant surgical site infections using risk and protective factors identified by a group of Italian surgeons through Delphi method [^1177P9iu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) constitute a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, duration of hospital stay, and overall costs. The bacterial pathogens implicated most frequently are Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) SSIs is increasing significantly. Since these infections have a significant impact on hospital budgets and patients' health, their diagnosis must be anticipated and therapy improved; the first step should be to evaluate risk factors for MRSA SSIs.

- **Methods**: Through a literature review, we identified possible major and minor risk factors for, and protective factors against, MRSA SSIs. We then submitted statements on these factors to 228 Italian surgeons to determine, using the Delphi method, the degree of consensus regarding their importance. The consensus was rated as positive if > 80% of the voters agreed with a statement and as negative if > 80% of the voters disagreed. In other cases, no consensus was reached.

- **Results**: There was positive consensus that sepsis, > 2 weeks of hospitalization, age > 75 years, colonization by MRSA, and diabetes were major risk factors for MRSA SSIs. Other possible major risk factors, on which a consensus was not reached, such as prior antibiotic use, were considered minor risk factors. An adequate antibiotic prophylaxis, laparoscopic technique, and infection committee surveillance were considered protective factors against MRSA SSIs.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing burn wound infection [^116NF1ho]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Infection of burn wounds is a serious problem because it can delay healing, increase scarring, and invasive infection may result in the death of the patient. Antibiotic prophylaxis is one of several interventions that may prevent burn wound infection and protect the burned patient from invasive infections.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis on rates of burn wound infection.

- **Search methods**: In January 2013, we searched the Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE - In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (2013); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL, and reference lists of relevant articles. No restrictions were applied with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of burn wound infection were included. Quasi-randomized studies were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted relevant data. Risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) were estimated for dichotomous data and continuous data, respectively. When sufficient numbers of comparable RCTs were available, trials were pooled in a meta-analysis to estimate the combined effect.

- **Main results**: This review includes 36 RCTs (2117 participants); twenty-six (72%) evaluated topical antibiotics, while seven evaluated systemic antibiotics. Four of the systemic antibiotic trials administered the antibiotic perioperatively, and three administered the antibiotic in another manner.

### Auto-substitutions to optimize perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis: Pre-post intervention study [^111tdd9a]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Low credibility.

Appropriate administration of perioperative antibiotics can prevent antimicrobial resistance, adverse drug events, surgical site infections, and increased costs to the healthcare system for many surgeries in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS).

- **Objective**: The study aims to achieve 90% compliance with evidence-based perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines among elective surgical procedures in OHNS.

- **Methods**: The pre-intervention group consisted of patients undergoing elective surgical procedures in the 13 months prior to the interventions (September 2019–2020), whereas the post-intervention group comprised patients undergoing elective procedures during the 8 months following the implementation (October 2020-May 2021). The 4 Es of knowledge translation and the Donabedian framework were used to frame the study. Components of the intervention included educational grand rounds and automatic substitutions in electronic health records. In June 2021, a survey of staff and residents assessed the self-reported perception of following evidence-based guidelines.

- **Results**: Compliance with antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines was evaluated based on agent and dose. The overall compliance improved from 38.8% pre-intervention to 59.0% post-intervention (p < 0.001). Agent compliance did not improve significantly, remaining relatively stable from 60.7% to 62.8% (p = 0.68), whereas dose compliance improved markedly from 39.6% to 89.2% (p < 0.001). Approximately 78.5% of survey respondents felt that they strongly agreed or agreed with always following evidence-based guidelines.

### AAD guidelines of care: How did we get here and where are we going [^1143JGpV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

In 1987, the American Academy of Dermatology began to create guidelines of care for clinical disease processes in dermatology. The format of the guidelines has changed dramatically over the past several years; now all of the recent guidelines are in the evidence-based style. These guidelines have been recognized nationally both in print and on the World Wide Web, establishing dermatologists as the skin experts.

### European glaucoma society terminology and guidelines for glaucoma, 5th edition [^116pm4mL]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

The foreword introduces the concept that every moment is unique. Responsible individuals should ask themselves how to act well in the present moment. While answers will vary, reflecting the uniqueness of both situations and individuals, there seems to be no definitive algorithm to arrive at the correct answer. Written guidelines cannot provide a one-size-fits-all solution for unique situations.

In medicine, there is a fallacy often believed: "What's good for the goose is good for the gander". This translates in medical terms to the idea that normal findings are good, and abnormal findings are bad. This simplistic view is frequently misleading. Good clinicians understand that personalized care leads to optimal outcomes. Although normal findings offer general guidance, they often do not apply to individuals.

Consider intraocular pressure (IOP): A normal IOP of 15 mmHg may be beneficial for some but not for others, while an abnormal IOP of 30 mmHg might be suitable for certain cases. The medical field is heavily influenced by the standard distribution curve, hindering independent and specific thinking. Physicians are often inclined to make decisions for patients based on normative data that might be irrelevant to the individual in question. This tendency is unsurprising, given the desire to help by defaulting to what appears to be the easiest and safest approach.

### Wolf spider envenomation [^1145wDiG]. Wilderness & environmental medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Although wolf spider venom has been implicated in necrotic arachnidism without acceptably documented verification, limited, prospectively collected data demonstrate a lack of cutaneous necrosis. The infrequent nature of exposure and inherent difficulty in confirming wolf spider bites in humans make it challenging to study such envenomations.

We present the case of a 20-year-old man with confirmed exposure to the wolf spider who developed cutaneous erythema with ulceration following the bite. There was no evidence of skin necrosis. He was treated with aggressive wound care and systemic antibiotics for wound infection, with subsequent resolution of symptoms.

This case adds to the limited knowledge regarding wolf spider envenomations and describes the clinical effects and management of wolf spider envenomation.

### Systemic antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections [^112brUtv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Foot infection is the most common cause of non-traumatic amputation in people with diabetes. Most diabetic foot infections (DFIs) require systemic antibiotic therapy, and the initial choice is usually empirical. Although there are many antibiotics available, uncertainty exists about which is the best for treating DFIs.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects and safety of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of DFIs compared with other systemic antibiotics, topical foot care, or placebo.

- **Search methods**: In April 2015, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library), the Health Technology Assessment database (HTA; The Cochrane Library), the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED; The Cochrane Library), unpublished literature in OpenSIGLE and ProQuest Dissertations, and ongoing trials registers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of systemic antibiotics (oral or parenteral) in people with a DFI. Primary outcomes were clinical resolution of the infection, time to its resolution, complications, and adverse effects.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated for dichotomous data when sufficient.

### Electronic surveillance system for monitoring surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis [^112CcRkq]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis comprises one third of all antibiotic use in pediatric hospitals and 80% of all antibiotic use in surgery. Previous studies reported that antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis is often inconsistent with recommended guidelines. An electronic surveillance system was developed to measure antimicrobial utilization and to identify opportunities to improve and monitor the administration of antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with selected inpatient surgical procedures performed from May 1999 to April 2000 at four US children's hospitals. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision surgical procedure codes were divided into clean or unclean categories. An electronic surveillance system was designed using antibiotic and microbiologic culture utilization data to measure appropriate antimicrobial use associated with the surgical procedure. A medical chart review was conducted to validate the electronic system.

- **Results**: Ninety percent of cases were classified properly by the electronic surveillance system, as confirmed by medical chart review. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis was not in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for almost half of all procedures. Prolonged antimicrobial administration in clean surgical procedures was the most frequent deviation from guidelines. Statistical differences between the index hospital and the comparison hospitals reflect both over- and underutilization of surgical prophylaxis.

### Vermox [^115WP6Uu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The available published literature on mebendazole use in pregnant women has not reported a clear association between mebendazole and a potential risk of major birth defects or miscarriages [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated helminthic infection during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

In animal reproduction studies, adverse developmental effects, such as skeletal malformations, soft tissue malformations, decreased pup weight, and embryolethality were observed when mebendazole was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at single oral doses as low as 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.2-fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD)). Maternal toxicity was present at the highest of these doses [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risks**: Untreated soil-transmitted helminth infections in pregnancy are associated with adverse outcomes including maternal iron deficiency anemia, low birth weight, and neonatal and maternal death.

- **Human data**: Several published studies, including prospective pregnancy registries, case-control, retrospective cohort, and randomized controlled studies, have reported these outcomes.

### Adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines for elective surgeries across 825 US hospitals, 2019–2020 [^114yMFah]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

There are limited US data assessing adherence to surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines, particularly across a large, nationwide sample. Moreover, commonly prescribed inappropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens remain unknown, hindering improvement initiatives.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults who underwent elective craniotomy, hip replacement, knee replacement, spinal procedure, or hernia repair in 2019–2020 at hospitals in the PINC AI (Premier) Healthcare Database. We evaluated adherence of prophylaxis regimens with respect to antimicrobial agents endorsed in the American Society of Health-System Pharmacist guidelines, accounting for patient antibiotic allergy and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization status. We used multivariable logistic regression with random effects by hospital to evaluate associations between patient, procedural, and hospital characteristics and guideline adherence.

- **Results**: Across 825 hospitals and 521,091 inpatient elective surgeries, 308,760 (59%) were adherent to prophylaxis guidelines. In adjusted analysis, adherence varied significantly by US Census division (adjusted OR [aOR] range: 0.61–1.61) and was significantly lower in 2020 compared with 2019 (aOR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.91–0.94; P < 0.001). The most common reason for nonadherence was unnecessary vancomycin use. In a post hoc analysis, controlling for patient age, comorbidities, other nephrotoxic agent use, and patient and procedure characteristics, patients receiving cefazolin plus vancomycin had 19% higher odds of acute kidney injury.

- **Tobacco use**: Increases the risk of infection after surgery.
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Patients with this condition should be aware of the elevated risk of SSI.
- **Obesity**: A significant factor contributing to the likelihood of SSI occurrence.
- **Excessive alcohol use**: Consumption of more than 14 units per week is related to increased SSI risk.
- **Hypoalbuminemia**: Albumin levels of less than 3.5 g/dL are a risk factor.
- **Anemia**: Hemoglobin levels below 12.5 mg/dL also contribute to higher SSI risk.

### Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in non surgical wounds [^116xfUbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Non-surgical wounds include chronic ulcers, such as pressure or decubitus ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and ischaemic ulcers, as well as burns and traumatic wounds. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization — defined as the presence of MRSA without clinical features of infection like redness or pus discharge — or infection in chronic ulcers varies between 7% and 30%. MRSA colonization or infection of non-surgical wounds can lead to MRSA bacteraemia, which is associated with a 30-day mortality rate of about 28% to 38% and a one-year mortality rate of approximately 55%. Individuals with non-surgical wounds colonized or infected with MRSA may act as reservoirs for the bacteria, making treatment important; however, the optimal antibiotic regimen for these cases is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits, such as decreased mortality and improved quality of life, and harms, such as adverse events related to antibiotic use, of all antibiotic treatments in people with non-surgical wounds with established colonization or infection caused by MRSA.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 March 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (2013, Issue 2); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (2013, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February Week 4 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, March 12, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 10); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 8 March).

### Human and other mammalian bite injuries of the hand: Evaluation and management [^111qxQys]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

The hand is the most common site for bite injuries. Due to specific characteristics of hand anatomy, bite mechanics, and organisms found in human and animal saliva, even small wounds can lead to aggressive infections. Failure to recognize and treat hand bites can result in significant morbidity. Human and animal bites most commonly cause polymicrobial bacterial infections with a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Pasteurella species are commonly found in dog and cat bite wounds, while Eikenella is characteristic of human wounds. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobic bacterial species are common to all mammals.

Although public health measures in developed countries have been highly effective at reducing rabies transmission, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies infection worldwide. Human bites can transmit HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, especially when contaminated blood is exposed to an open wound. Appropriate management of any mammal bite requires recognition, early wound cleansing, evaluation of injured structures, and infection prophylaxis. Structural repair is performed as indicated by the severity and contamination of the injury, and wounds may require delayed closure. Wound infections typically require debridement, empiric antibiotics, and delayed repair or reconstruction.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery: An advisory statement from the National Surgical Infection Prevention Project [^114pRwQW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In January 2003, the leadership of the Medicare National Surgical Infection Prevention Project hosted the Surgical Infection Prevention Guideline Writers Workgroup (SIPGWW) meeting. The objectives were to review areas of agreement among the most recently published guidelines for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis, address inconsistencies, and discuss issues not currently addressed. Participants included authors from most of the groups that have published North American guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis, as well as authors from several specialty colleges.

The nominal group process was used to draft a consensus paper that was widely circulated for comment. The consensus positions of SIPGWW include the recommendation that the infusion of the first antimicrobial dose should begin within 60 minutes before surgical incision and that prophylactic antimicrobials should be discontinued within 24 hours after the end of surgery. This advisory statement provides an overview of other issues related to antimicrobial prophylaxis, including specific suggestions regarding antimicrobial selection.

### ADP binding by the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito D7 salivary protein enhances blood feeding on mammals [^1177p2E8]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

The scavenging mechanism of action requires a high concentration of salivary protein at the bite site. As D7 proteins bind their ligands in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, they must be in equimolar concentrations with the mediators, which range from 1 to 10 µM for histamine, serotonin, or ADP. This may explain why D7 salivary proteins are one of the most abundant components of the salivary glands.

We determined that the amount of CxD7L1 and CxD7L2 present in the SGE was 31.33 and 35.97 ng, respectively. Our quantification data aligns with previous studies from Ae. aegypti, in which researchers quantified other major salivary proteins such as aegyptin or apyrase, obtaining 36.35 and 24 ng per salivary gland pair, respectively.

Furthermore, we determined the amount of D7 proteins in the secreted saliva using two different methods. Both approaches yielded similar results, confirming that the protein amount deduced from the SGE before and after blood-feeding corresponds well to what is present in the secreted saliva. After blood-feeding, we observed a 22.13 and 26.83% reduction in the amounts of CxD7L1 and CxD7L2 proteins in the SGE, respectively. In Ae. aegypti, other researchers have found a greater reduction in either total salivary protein or apyrase activity after blood-feeding (58 and 46% reduction, respectively).

Our approach to quantifying ADP in mouse skin before and after mosquito bites showed that the bites reduced the amount of ADP by 37.45%. In our ADP determinations, the effect of salivary apyrase, also present in the saliva of C. quinquefasciatus, was evident.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for colorectal surgery [^111nNCu2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Research shows that the administration of prophylactic antibiotics before colorectal surgery prevents postoperative surgical wound infection. The best antibiotic choice, timing of administration, and route of administration remain undetermined.

- **Objectives**: To establish the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical wound infection in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Specifically, to determine: 1. whether antimicrobial prophylaxis reduces the risk of surgical wound infection; 2. the target spectrum of bacteria (aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, or both); 3. the best timing and duration of antibiotic administration; 4. the most effective route of antibiotic administration (intravenous, oral, or both); 5. whether any antibiotic is clearly more effective than the currently recommended gold standard specified in published guidelines; 6. whether antibiotics should be given before or after surgery.

- **Search methods**: For the original review published in 2009, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), and EMBASE (Ovid). For the update of this review, we rewrote the search strategies and extended the search to cover from 1954 for MEDLINE and 1974 for EMBASE up to 7 January 2013. We searched CENTRAL on the same date (Issue 12, 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotic use in elective and emergency colorectal surgery, with surgical wound infection as an outcome.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were abstracted and reviewed by one review author.

### Human rabies: A reemerging disease in Costa Rica [^111ncy5y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

After 31 years without a case of human rabies in Costa Rica, the disease reemerged. This reappearance underscores the importance of an integrated network between veterinary and human health programs to identify risk zones of bat bites and prevent human and animal cases. The active participation of combined health services in the early warning of the occurrence of suspected cases of emergent diseases is essential for effective, integrated surveillance. Human rabies must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute flaccid paralysis with consciousness impairment, even in patients without a known history of animal bite. This is particularly important in zones where cattle are at high risk for bat bites.

Rabies in bats was first reported during the 1920s. Since then, rabies has been confirmed in several bat species. The historical association between vampire bats and livestock may tend to overshadow the epidemiological surveillance in other species, such as domestic animals like cats and dogs. This lack of association with other species could be due to a lack of intensified surveillance or unknown factors related to the virus, host, or ecology.

Several studies have documented the transmission of the rabies virus in the absence of a history of documented animal bite. No typical bite marks were observed in either of the patients, but the history of a cat bite raises the possibility of an indirect manner of transmission through the bite of another vector previously infected by a bat. At the community level, the immigration of human populations throughout…

### Early recognition of methicillin-resistant surgical site infections using risk and protective factors identified by a group of Italian surgeons through Delphi method [^111X39B6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In the United States, for any given type of operation, the development of a wound infection will approximately double the cost of hospitalization. These infections lead to 80,000 deaths per year and are associated with an annual treatment cost of US$2 billion. A similar scenario has been found in Italy, where nosocomial infections occur in 500,000 out of 8,000,000 hospital admissions per year.

SSIs caused by S. aureus may be life-threatening (estimated mortality rate 5%) and account for more than two extra weeks of hospitalization and around US$50,000 extra cost. Rates of MRSA infection are increasing dramatically, and there is an urgent need to reduce hospitalizations and costs and implement more effective outpatient management and treatment strategies.

Since cost containment and cost-efficient patient management are top priorities today for the whole healthcare system, many hospitalized patients with SSIs could be safely treated as outpatients with options for intravenous antibiotic therapy. This would reduce costs for hospitalization and could also improve patients' outcomes and satisfaction.

### Assessment of the risk and economic burden of surgical site infection following colorectal surgery using a US longitudinal database: Is there a role for innovative antimicrobial wound closure technology to reduce the risk of infection [^114oUADg]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). Low credibility.

Two studies involving the economic benefits associated with using an antimicrobial suture for wound closure have been recently published. In the first study, published by Singh and colleagues, the increased cost of antimicrobial sutures was minimal compared to the potential avoided costs of surgical site infections (SSIs) to third-party payers. Despite conclusions similar to the study, several key differences exist between our analysis and that of Singh et al. These differences include the population of interest (abdominal procedures), published sources for the risk and cost of infection, and the cost perspectives that were evaluated (hospital, third-party, and societal).

The analysis focuses solely on colorectal procedures using data from a large national database to inform baseline infection risk. It considers the reduced risk of infection following the use of antimicrobial sutures, which was taken from a recent meta-analysis by Leaper and colleagues. All the relevant costs of SSIs to different payers were captured during a 12-month period. Singh et al. used an overall SSI rate of 15% derived from the study of Alexander et al. in 2009, which evaluated morbidly obese patients. The superficial and deep incisional/organ-space SSI rates were calculated based on previously published estimates multiplied by 15%.

The study utilized real-world data from over 100,000 patients to document rates of 4.0% and 10.6% for superficial and deep incisional SSIs, respectively. Here, costs avoided are presented per patient, whereas the costs from Singh et al. were presented per SSI averted. Compared to the recent me.

### Medical malpractice implications of clinical practice guidelines [^111jjKXQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines aim to improve medical care by providing clear and useful recommendations to providers. Although providers should account for patients' unique characteristics when determining a treatment plan, following guidelines when applicable is generally perceived as good practice. In the context of malpractice litigation, it is essential to establish a standard of care to evaluate the performance of providers.

Although the opinions of expert witnesses are used to determine standards of care, guidelines are expected to play a leading role. Guidelines alone should not establish a legal standard but may help inform this discussion in the courtroom. Therefore, it is incumbent that excellent, practical, and timely guidelines are continually created and updated in a transparent way. These guidelines must be very clear and underscore the various strengths of recommendation based on the quality of available evidence.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites [^1145Cuy8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). High credibility.

Bites by mammals are a common problem and account for up to 1% of all visits to hospital emergency rooms. Dog and cat bites are the most common, and people are usually bitten by their own pets or by an animal known to them. School-age children make up almost half of those bitten. Prevention of tetanus, rabies, and wound infection are priorities for staff in emergency rooms. The use of antibiotics may be useful in reducing the risk of developing a wound infection.

- **Objectives**: To determine if the use of prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites is effective in preventing bite wound infections.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant RCTs were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases in November 2000.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that studied patients with bites from all mammals. Comparisons were made between antibiotics and placebo or no intervention. The outcome of interest was the number of infections at the site of the bite.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted the data independently. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method.

- **Main results**: Eight studies were included. The use of prophylactic antibiotics was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection after human bites. However, prophylactic antibiotics did not appear to reduce the rate of infection after bites by cats or dogs. The wound type, e.g. laceration or puncture, did not appear to influence the effectiveness of the prophylactic antibiotics.

### Strategies to prevent surgical site infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112se8Uy]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Low credibility.

Approaches that should not be considered a routine part of SSI prevention:

- **Vancomycin for antimicrobial prophylaxis**: Do not routinely use vancomycin for antimicrobial prophylaxis. Vancomycin should not be routinely used, but it can be appropriate for specific scenarios. Reserve vancomycin for specific clinical circumstances, such as in patients who are known to be MRSA colonized, including those identified on preoperative screening, particularly if the surgery involves prosthetic material. Vancomycin can also be used in the setting of a proven outbreak of SSIs due to MRSA.

	- Suspected high rates of MRSA SSI should not justify vancomycin use. In a cohort study of 79,092 surgical procedures, the primary reason for vancomycin perioperative prophylaxis was the perception of high facility rates of MRSA or high-risk procedures for MRSA. Patients who received vancomycin prophylaxis due to perceived high facility risk had no increase in MRSA colonization prevalence compared with the general surgical population. The incidence of SSIs remained the same regardless of vancomycin prophylaxis, but the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was significantly higher among those who received vancomycin. In a retrospective cohort study of 79,058 surgical procedures, vancomycin perioperative prophylaxis was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of AKI.

- **Comparison with glycopeptides and β-lactam antimicrobial prophylaxis**: Two meta-analyses of studies comparing glycopeptides to β-lactam antimicrobial prophylaxis concluded that there was no difference in rates of SSIs between the two.

### Does the duration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis influence the incidence of postoperative surgical-site infections in implant-based breast reconstruction in women with breast cancer? A retrospective study [^1153wajF]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is an established concept to reduce the risk of surgical-site infections; however, the optimal treatment duration in prosthetic breast reconstruction is still controversial. This study evaluated a potential association between the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis duration (≤ 24 hours versus > 24 hours) and the incidence of postoperative surgical-site infections in immediate implant-based breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients.

- **Methods**: A descriptive, retrospective analysis of surgical-site infections after immediate implant-based breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients between January 2011 and December 2018 was performed. The incidence of postoperative surgical-site infections in patients with more than 24 hours of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was compared to patients treated for 24 hours or less.

- **Results**: A total of 240 patients who met the criteria were included. There were no relevant epidemiologic, clinical, or histopathologic differences between groups. Surgical-site infections, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, occurred in 25.8 percent of cases. A risk factor-adjusted analysis by a prespecified multiple logistic regression model showed that 24 hours or less of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was not inferior to treatment for more than 24 hours. The upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval of the risk difference was 9.4 percent, below the prespecified noninferiority margin of 10 percent, leading to statistical significance.

### Reports of presumptive brown recluse spider bites reinforce improbable diagnosis in regions of North America where the spider is not endemic [^114fNnuR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Envenomations by the brown recluse spider have been reported throughout North America, despite the fact that the spider's range is limited to the South and central Midwest of the United States. Several of these medical reports have originated from regions of nonendemicity where the spider has never or rarely been documented and brown recluse spider populations are unknown. In most of these reports, no spider is positively identified in association with the dermonecrotic wound, and diagnosis has been based on clinical examination findings. Considering the extreme rarity of brown recluse spiders in areas of nonendemicity, the diagnosis of a presumptive bite is a misdiagnosis that reinforces the assumption that brown recluse spiders are common local etiologic agents of necrosis. There are many medical conditions of diverse origin that have been misdiagnosed as brown recluse spider bites, some of which can be fatal or debilitating. Physicians' awareness of these conditions will increase diagnostic accuracy in areas of North America where bites from brown recluse spiders are improbable.

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline for the prevention of surgical site infection, 2017 [^112b41Fa]. JAMA Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for surgical site infection, particularly concerning preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, the CDC 2017 guidelines recommend administering preoperative antimicrobial agents only when indicated based on published clinical practice guidelines. It is essential to ensure these agents are timed correctly to achieve a bactericidal concentration in the serum and tissues at the time of incision.

### Reference group choice and antibiotic resistance outcomes [^114MWedo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Both MRSA and VRE studies were designed as cohort studies and are discussed in detail elsewhere (Appendix). Cases were defined as patients with MRSA surgical site infection (SSI), which was the exposure of interest for study 1, and VRE wound infection, which was the exposure of interest for study 2. In each study, two different reference groups were used in separate analyses. Control group A included patients who did not have an infection caused by the target pathogen (S. aureus or enterococci). Control group B included patients with infection caused by the susceptible phenotype of the target pathogen, namely MSSA and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE).

In both studies, three outcomes were examined: death, length of hospital stay, and total hospital charges. Hospital charges were variable direct charges obtained from hospital financial databases and serve as a surrogate for cost. Hospital costs were estimated using a cost-to-charge ratio of 0.7.

Outcomes studies of antimicrobial drug resistance are notoriously difficult to perform due to confounding variables related to underlying coexisting conditions. To control for confounding, we analyzed several variables, including individual coexisting conditions, the Charlson score, the American Society of Anesthesiologists-Physical Status (ASA) score, and duration of hospitalization before infection (Appendix). These variables were analyzed in a multivariable analysis. Each of the outcomes was analyzed independently, and the inverse log value was calculated for β coefficients of variables included in the predictor models.

### Assessment of the risk and economic burden of surgical site infection following colorectal surgery using a US longitudinal database: Is there a role for innovative antimicrobial wound closure technology to reduce the risk of infection [^112k3rgg]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

In the United States, elective colorectal surgery ranks in the top 10 of operating room procedures, with over 300,000 procedures reported in 2012. This presents a high cost to healthcare systems, in part relating to increased length of hospital stay and the high risk of managing postoperative complications, including surgical site infection (SSI). The rate of SSI after colorectal surgery is one of the highest of any surgical specialty, with a reported incidence ranging from 9% to 41%. Patient comorbidities related to this group of patients further increase the risk of SSI. In addition, SSIs are associated with prolonged hospital and intensive care unit stays, increased readmission to the hospital, and additional community care. In the United States, SSIs have been reported to account for $3.2 billion in attributable cost per year to acute care hospital budgets. A more accurate understanding of the epidemiology of infection and the associated patient comorbid risk factors is important in the effort to mitigate their occurrence and provide patients with appropriate interventional care.

Evidence-based surgical care bundles have been devised to reduce the incidence of SSI after selective surgical procedures and improve patient outcomes. Components of these care bundles have included interventions such as weight-based antibiotic prophylaxis, antiseptic skin preparation, appropriate hair removal, maintenance of normothermia, and glycemic control. A meta-analysis of 13 studies involving 8,515 patients has documented that the use of evidence-based care bundles can reduce SSI occurrences.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis for preventing infection after cesarean section [^114qL1MX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

The single most important risk factor for postpartum maternal infection is cesarean section. Although guidelines endorse the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women undergoing cesarean section, this recommendation is not uniformly implemented. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995 and last updated in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of prophylactic antibiotics compared with no prophylactic antibiotics on infectious complications in women undergoing cesarean section.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register as of July 31, 2014, and reference lists of retrieved papers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effects of prophylactic antibiotics versus no treatment in women undergoing cesarean section were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, evaluated risk of bias, and conducted data extraction. The clinically important primary outcomes were wound infection, endometritis, serious maternal infectious complications, and adverse effects on the infant. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and combined trials in meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We identified 95 studies enrolling over 15,000 women. Compared with placebo or no treatment, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section reduced the incidence of wound infection (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.

### The future approach for the management of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^1135nxU7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and are listed among the most common infections encountered in both ambulatory and hospital settings. During the last decade, ABSSSIs have dramatically increased, partially due to the progressive aging of the population. A recent study from Spain, Italy, and Austria estimated the total annual expense for ABSSSI to be 13.5 million EUR, 9.9 million EUR, and 3.4 million EUR, respectively. The global ABSSSIs market size was valued at USD 1.22 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.84% from 2023 to 2030, when it is expected to reach USD 18.79 billion.

The burden of ABSSSIs and their complications is considerable, resulting in hospitalization, surgery, bacteremia, and occasionally, fatal outcomes. Managing patients with ABSSSIs is challenging due to the wide heterogeneity in etiology, disease severity, and patient characteristics. Vulnerable populations are at high risk of treatment failure or recurrence, making their management particularly challenging. Particular attention should be paid to frail patients hospitalized in internal medicine wards or residing in nursing homes, as they appear to be at increased risk of infection due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Patients with diabetes mellitus represent another category at risk for poor outcomes. In this population, ABSSSIs — other than diabetic foot infections — are common, and drug-drug interactions or drug-related adverse events (such as nephrotoxicity) should be considered in the choice of antibiotic therapy.

### Leukemia: An overview for primary care [^1125TPYS]. American Family Physician (2014). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for chronic myeloid leukemia, and more specifically the management of infection, the AAFP 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining an evaluation for the source of infection and initiating empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients with leukemia and fever with neutropenia (< 500/mcL).

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in breast cancer surgery (PAUS trial): Randomised clinical double-blind parallel-group multicentre superiority trial [^113xwxym]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

A postoperative wound infection is not only a significant complication for an individual patient but also leads to human, financial, and resource costs to health services. An infection after breast cancer surgery may cause delays in the initiation of adjuvant therapy with potential effects on survival. Although wound infection rates after breast cancer surgery are higher than expected (0 to 29 percent) when compared to other clean surgeries (1 to 2 percent), there remains controversy regarding the value of prophylactic antibiotics. The majority of postoperative wound infections occur in the first 30 days following surgery (98 percent).

The Association of Breast Surgery and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) currently recommend that antibiotics should be 'considered' in breast cancer surgery. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that local protocols should apply. In clinical practice, there is currently no consensus about prophylactic antibiotics in breast cancer surgery, and there have been no new trials published in the last 15 years. Moreover, there are no recommendations about what specific antibiotic should be used for prophylaxis in breast cancer surgery.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery carries a risk of adverse events, including Clostridium difficile infection, and it increases the prevalence of multiresistant organisms. Over the last 15 years, global antibiotic overuse has accelerated antimicrobial resistance, leading to a growing number of common infections.

Regarding medical management for surgical site infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy (indications), IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend considering systemic antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with incision and drainage in patients with SSIs associated with a significant systemic response, such as:

- **Erythema and induration**: Extending > 5 cm from the wound edge.
- **Fever**: > 38.5 °C.
- **Heart rate (HR)**: > 110 bpm.
- **White blood cell (WBC) count**: > 12,000 cells/mcL.

### Surgical techniques and related perioperative outcomes after robot-assisted minimally invasive gastrectomy (RAMIG): Results from the prospective multicenter international UGIRA gastric registry [^115kedJs]. Annals of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

In general, most centers adhere to one particular anastomotic technique per gastrectomy type and then optimize their technique as much as possible to achieve their best outcomes, especially regarding anastomotic leakage rates. The observed anastomotic leakage rates varied per technique. Low leakage rates were found for linear stapled (6%) and hand-sewn (8%) anastomosis, whereas circular stapling frequently showed leakage (21%). This variation in leakage rates likely reflects a learning curve for circular stapling, and may be secondary due to differences in patient factors, disease stage, and surgical experience per center. The higher leakage rate after circular stapling might also result from the technique itself. A previous meta-analysis (n = 2983) showed significantly more anastomotic leakage and complications after circular compared with linear stapling. Few studies were published on this topic, none including robotic procedures. Although firm conclusions based on the study cannot be made as patients were not specifically matched and surgeon experience was not corrected for, our results certainly warrant further prospective studies to determine whether linear stapled and hand-sewn anastomoses may be superior to circular stapling.

The extent of lymphadenectomy during RAMIG was ≥ D1+ (99%), resulting in high lymph node yield [34 nodes (IQR: 24–47)]. For cT1N0-stage gastric cancer, D1+ was performed most often (54%), followed by D2 (37%) and D2+ (10%). Although a D1+ for this patient subgroup corresponds to the 5th JGCA guidelines, multiple previous studies suggested that…

### Is it time to recast the principles of antimicrobial prophylaxis [^115PMSGY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The principles of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis were established more than 40 years ago. This concept has been applied to many areas of surgery, and numerous prospective randomized trials have repeatedly demonstrated that surgical site infections (SSIs) are reduced when the right antibiotics are administered appropriately. This practice has been incorporated into standardized guidelines for perioperative use through the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) and serves as a major process measurement for appropriateness of practice. First and second generation cephalosporins have been the major drug class recommended and used for prophylaxis for decades, and there has been little change in these recommendations over time.

Recent reports have demonstrated a lack of correlation between the use of guideline-directed perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis — that is, administration of the right drug at the right time for the right duration — and its primary outcome measure, prevention of SSI. This begs the question: could we have been wrong about the benefits of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis?

There are a number of potential explanations for these observations. This principle has been so widely accepted that some propose all patients receive antimicrobial prophylaxis regardless of the operation and risk of infection. This concept fails to consider the risk-benefit ratio of even single dose drug use, since there is a small but defined risk of allergic and other adverse reactions associated with most antibiotics. Overuse blurs the advantage of prophylaxis.
