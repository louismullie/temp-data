## Question

does fingertip laceration require tetanus shot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a fingertip laceration requires a tetanus shot and how to determine the correct prophylaxis based on vaccination history and wound characteristics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the wound classification and whether a fingertip laceration is considered clean or dirty. Then, I should verify the patient's tetanus immunization status and the timing of the last booster. Next, I will apply ACIP/CDC wound-management rules to decide if a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is indicated and whether tetanus immune globulin is needed. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like immunocompromise, pregnancy, and pediatric patients, and I will synthesize a clear recommendation with product selection and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the wound type. A fingertip laceration is typically a minor traumatic wound, but I need to check for contamination because that changes the threshold for tetanus prophylaxis; contamination with dirt, soil, saliva, or foreign material, and features like devitalized tissue or puncture mechanics make it "dirty", whereas a clean, linear laceration without contamination is "clean" [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo].

> Wait, let me verify the immunization status before jumping to conclusions. I need to ask when the patient last received a tetanus-containing vaccine and whether the primary series is complete; if the last dose was within 5 years, no booster is needed regardless of wound type, if it was 5–10 years ago, a booster is indicated for dirty wounds, and if it was more than 10 years ago, a booster is indicated for any wound; if the primary series is incomplete or unknown, both tetanus vaccine and tetanus immune globulin are indicated for dirty wounds [^114hmV4y] [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact thresholds. ACIP/CDC wound-management guidance uses a 5-year rule for dirty wounds and a 10-year rule for clean wounds in patients who completed the primary series; for dirty wounds, give a tetanus booster if more than 5 years have elapsed, and for clean wounds, give a booster if more than 10 years have elapsed; if the patient is unvaccinated, has an incomplete primary series, or the history is unknown, give both tetanus vaccine and TIG for dirty wounds [^114hmV4y] [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo].

> I will now examine the product selection. For patients aged 11 years and older who need a tetanus booster, Tdap is preferred if they have never received Tdap or if Tdap history is unknown; if Tdap has already been given, Td is acceptable for subsequent boosters; for children under 7 years, use DTaP to complete or update the primary series as indicated; for pregnant patients who need a tetanus booster, use Tdap regardless of prior Tdap status to provide pertussis protection to the newborn [^114hmV4y] [^113utri2] [^113bnVzb].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or the wound is particularly high risk. I should confirm that patients with HIV or severe immunodeficiency who have dirty wounds should receive TIG regardless of prior vaccination history, and that TIG is never indicated for clean, minor wounds in immunocompetent patients with up-to-date vaccination; the prophylactic TIG dose is 250 IU intramuscularly when indicated [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo] [^115BdzhT].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances. Children with fingertip lacerations follow the same ACIP rules; if they are up to date on DTaP and the last dose was within 5 years, no booster is needed, but if the last dose was more than 5 years ago and the wound is dirty, a booster is indicated; if the primary series is incomplete or unknown, both vaccine and TIG are indicated for dirty wounds; I should double-check that ED providers sometimes misclassify tetanus needs in children, so verifying records or using registries improves accuracy [^114hmV4y] [^112xCc8i] [^115GmQ7p].

> Next, I should review documentation and communication. I need to ensure I record the wound classification, the exact vaccination history including dates and products, the rationale for giving or withholding tetanus prophylaxis, and the products administered; I should also counsel the patient that tetanus is rare but serious, that recovery does not confer immunity, and that staying up to date on boosters every 10 years is important for future protection [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo] [^11678fLJ].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. A fingertip laceration does not automatically require a tetanus shot; it depends on contamination and vaccination history. If the wound is dirty and more than 5 years have passed since the last tetanus-containing vaccine, give a booster and add TIG if the primary series is incomplete or unknown; if the wound is clean and more than 10 years have passed, give a booster; if the last dose was within 5 years, no booster is needed regardless of wound type, though I should still deliver appropriate wound care and reassess for other injuries or foreign bodies [^114hmV4y] [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo].

Not every fingertip laceration needs a tetanus shot; it depends on **wound cleanliness** and **vaccination history**. For a clean, minor laceration, give a tetanus booster if it has been **> 10 years** since the last dose. For a dirty or deep laceration, give a booster if it has been **> 5 years** [^114hmV4y] [^112xCc8i]. If the patient is unvaccinated or has an incomplete primary series, give both tetanus vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) [^112xCc8i] [^115BdzhT]. Always confirm vaccination status and update if indicated [^113BmGCo].

---

## Factors influencing tetanus prophylaxis

Several factors determine whether a tetanus shot is needed for a fingertip laceration:

- **Wound cleanliness**: Clean wounds are those without significant contamination, whereas dirty wounds involve contamination with dirt, soil, saliva, or foreign material [^112xCc8i].

- **Wound depth and severity**: Deep puncture wounds, avulsions, and wounds with devitalized tissue carry a higher risk of tetanus infection [^112xCc8i].

- **Patient's vaccination history**: The timing of the last tetanus vaccination significantly influences the need for a booster dose [^114hmV4y].

---

## Guidelines for tetanus prophylaxis

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provide clear guidelines for tetanus prophylaxis in wound management:

| **Wound type** | **Vaccination history** | **Recommended prophylaxis** |
|-|-|-|
| Clean, minor wound | - Unknown or incomplete vaccination <br/> - Last tetanus dose > 10 years ago | Tetanus vaccine (Td or Tdap) [^114hmV4y] |
| Clean, minor wound | - Completed primary series <br/> - Last tetanus dose ≤ 10 years ago | No vaccine needed [^114hmV4y] |
| Dirty, deep, or contaminated wound | - Unknown or incomplete vaccination <br/> - Last tetanus dose > 5 years ago | Tetanus vaccine (Td or Tdap) + TIG [^112xCc8i] [^115BdzhT] |
| Dirty, deep, or contaminated wound | - Completed primary series <br/> - Last tetanus dose ≤ 5 years ago | Tetanus vaccine (Td or Tdap) only [^114hmV4y] |

---

## Specific considerations for fingertip lacerations

Fingertip lacerations are common and vary in severity and contamination. Key considerations include:

- **Cleanliness**: Fingertip lacerations are often contaminated with dirt, debris, or bacteria, increasing the risk of tetanus infection [^112xCc8i].

- **Depth**: Deep lacerations involving the nail bed or bone carry a higher risk of tetanus infection and may require more aggressive prophylaxis [^112xCc8i].

- **Patient's vaccination status**: Many patients may not be up-to-date with their tetanus vaccinations, necessitating a booster dose [^112khUit].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting tetanus prophylaxis

Clinical evidence and expert guidelines consistently support the administration of tetanus prophylaxis based on wound characteristics and patient vaccination history. The CDC and ACIP emphasize the importance of evaluating vaccination status and administering appropriate prophylaxis to prevent tetanus infection [^114hmV4y] [^112xCc8i].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, not every fingertip laceration requires a tetanus shot. The need for tetanus prophylaxis depends on the **cleanliness of the wound** and the patient's **vaccination history**. For clean, minor lacerations, a tetanus booster is recommended if more than 10 years have passed since the last vaccination. For dirty, deep, or contaminated lacerations, a booster is recommended if more than 5 years have passed since the last vaccination. If the patient is unvaccinated or has an incomplete primary series, both tetanus vaccine and TIG should be administered [^112xCc8i] [^115BdzhT]. Always confirm vaccination status and provide appropriate prophylaxis to prevent tetanus infection [^113BmGCo].

### Laceration repair: a practical approach [^1138Ptrx]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The goals of laceration repair are to achieve hemostasis and optimal cosmetic results without increasing the risk of infection. Many aspects of laceration repair have not changed over the years, but there is evidence to support some updates to standard management. Studies have been unable to define a "golden period" for which a wound can safely be repaired without increasing risk of infection. Depending on the type of wound, it may be reasonable to close even 18 or more hours after injury. The use of nonsterile gloves during laceration repair does not increase the risk of wound infection compared with sterile gloves. Irrigation with potable tap water rather than sterile saline also does not increase the risk of wound infection. Good evidence suggests that local anesthetic with epinephrine in a concentration of up to 1:100,000 is safe for use on digits. Local anesthetic with epinephrine in a concentration of 1:200,000 is safe for use on the nose and ears. Tissue adhesives and wound adhesive strips can be used effectively in low-tension skin areas. Wounds heal faster in a moist environment and therefore occlusive and semiocclusive dressings should be considered when available. Tetanus prophylaxis should be provided if indicated. Timing of suture removal depends on location and is based on expert opinion and experience.

### Advanced laceration management [^111MdN2i]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Many lacerations seen in the emergency department setting require specific management based on anatomic location. Lacerations of the fingertip, ear, nose, lip, tongue, and eyelid can be complex and require advanced management techniques. Many can be primarily treated by emergency clinicians; however, it is important for the clinician to know when consultation is appropriate for treatment by a specialist. Current literature recommendations are presented for initial management, methods of repair, technical tips to facilitate repair, appropriate consultation, and postoperative care for these complex lacerations.

### Fingertip injuries [^114xs6ae]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip laceration care — povidone-iodine or another antimicrobial solution should be applied once analgesia has been achieved; size 6–0 or 7–0 absorbable sutures are typically used to reapproximate the laceration, and topical glue is an acceptable alternative. Management of simple lacerations may be completed by the family physician, whereas more complex or stellate lacerations should be referred to a hand surgeon.

### Common questions about wound care [^112htkzw]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Lacerations, abrasions, burns, and puncture wounds are common in the outpatient setting. Because wounds can quickly become infected, the most important aspect of treating a minor wound is irrigation and cleaning. There is no evidence that antiseptic irrigation is superior to sterile saline or tap water. Occlusion of the wound is key to preventing contamination. Suturing, if required, can be completed up to 24 hours after the trauma occurs, depending on the wound site. Tissue adhesives are equally effective for low-tension wounds with linear edges that can be evenly approximated. Although patients are often instructed to keep their wounds covered and dry after suturing, they can get wet within the first 24 to 48 hours without increasing the risk of infection. There is no evidence that prophylactic antibiotics improve outcomes for most simple wounds. Tetanus toxoid should be administered as soon as possible to patients who have not received a booster in the past 10 years. Superficial mild wound infections can be treated with topical agents, whereas deeper mild and moderate infections should be treated with oral antibiotics. Most severe infections, and moderate infections in high-risk patients, require initial parenteral antibiotics. Severe burns and wounds that cover large areas of the body or involve the face, joints, bone, tendons, or nerves should generally be referred to wound care specialists.

### Foreign bodies in the skin: evaluation and management [^114YzV7Y]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Foreign bodies may be introduced into the skin through lacerations and soft tissue wounds. Long-term complications of retained foreign bodies include chronic pain and neurovascular impairment. Wound exploration and initial imaging with radiography or ultrasonography should be considered before foreign body removal. Risks and benefits of removal should be discussed with the patient. Although some foreign bodies may be left in place, removal should be considered if the risk of complications is high. A cooperative patient and adequate wound visualization are important for successful foreign body removal. Adequate analgesia and judicious use of anxiolytics and sedation may be helpful. Wound irrigation with normal saline or tap water is recommended after foreign body removal. Antiseptic solutions for wound irrigation may impair healing and should be avoided. Although there is no consensus on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, several indications exist. The patient's tetanus immunization history should be reviewed, and vaccine should be administered if indicated.

Stab wounds

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of stab wounds?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple stab wounds that involve only soft tissue. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: Stab wounds can range from small but deep lacerations to more shallow wounds akin to simple lacerations. They are caused by objects of variable cleanliness. Like all wounds, irrigation and debridement of any devitalized tissue are paramount for infection prevention. Adequate irrigation of the deepest portions of stab wounds can be challenging without extension of the skin defect, and opening the wound further may require sedation or a trip to the operating room. This added morbidity must be weighed against potential benefit. Deeper wounds are at higher risk of infection. The nature of the penetrating object, if known, as well as the extent and type of contamination, might sway a clinician's decision about antibiotics if there is a particular concern (eg, contamination with soil or aquatic microbes). Stab wounds that communicate with deeper body cavities or structures are generally managed based on the underlying injury. As mentioned above, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

### High-pressure injection injuries in the hand: current treatment concepts [^115PCYmo]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

High-pressure injection injury to the hand and upper extremity is a rare but very serious clinical entity. The objective of this article was to review the current available literature and highlight important topics.

Methods

A PubMed literature search was undertaken with the terms "high pressure injection injuries", "injection injuries", "finger injection injuries", and other related terms. Articles were reviewed with specific attention to clinical presentation, treatment, outcome, and prognostic variables.

Results

Most of the available literature included case studies, case series, retrospective cohorts, and literature reviews. The most common presentation of a high-pressure injection injury is a puncture wound on the nondominant index finger of a working class man in his mid thirties. Important factors at presentation include the time of injury and type and pressure of material injected. Initial treatment should include tetanus prophylaxis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and urgent consultation with a hand surgeon. Injections with air, gas, or small amounts of veterinary vaccines can usually be managed with observation and serial examinations if there is not concern for compartment syndrome. Injections with other liquid materials typically require emergent surgical débridement, with the best outcomes occurring when treated within 6 hours. A wide surgical irrigation and débridement of necrotic tissues should be performed under general or regional anesthesia. Organic and caustic materials are associated with a higher amputation rate, and decreasing the time from injury to surgery improves the prognosis.

Conclusions

High-pressure injection injuries to the hand can result in permanent impairment. Proper diagnosis and urgent treatment are essential for a good outcome.

Soft tissue injury

Of note, the focus of this section is on civilian trauma, with the acknowledgment that military-grade (ie, higher energy) weapons are sometimes used in civilian trauma. Further, this review will focus on isolated soft tissue injuries that are not associated with underlying bony or hollow viscus injury.

Simple lacerations (other than face and scalp)

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of simple lacerations?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple soft tissue lacerations. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: There are no recent data to support prophylactic antibiotics for uncomplicated, traumatic soft tissue lacerations. Most high-quality evidence on this topic is over 20 years old, and supports avoiding antibiotics, while much of the recent literature is focused on soft tissue injury with underlying open fractures but does not address isolated soft tissue injury. Overall, the studies emphasize the importance of adequate irrigation, debridement, removal of foreign bodies, and appropriate closure technique as the major means of infection prevention. While the little data that exist generally support forgoing antibiotic prophylaxis, it is important to identify the cases that are more complex and thus may have different management considerations. Moran et al provide a useful approach, advising the consideration of both high-risk wounds and high-risk patients, which may affect a clinician's decision to give antibiotic prophylaxis. The WHO provides a similar framework for wound assessment that includes size, contamination, and other high-risk factors. Clinicians should work from a baseline understanding that in most simple, traumatic soft tissue wounds in civilian patients, prophylactic antibiotics are likely unnecessary, and then adjust only on the basis of specific patient-related or wound-related risk factors or concerns. Additionally, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^114P7B81]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Immunization — tetanus in traumatic wounds — Tetanus is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious but not contagious. Tetanus immunization status should be evaluated for all patients with a traumatic wound and treated appropriately based on the patient's history and risk of infection. Tetanus immunization, if indicated based on a patient's history and exposure, should be given to all patients with a traumatic wound. Recommendation grade: 1C. Development of clinical tetanus can probably be delayed with oral antibiotics (penicillin and likely others) and should be used if evacuation of an unimmunized patient with a tetanus-prone wound will be delayed or is logistically complicated; this technique is often used in patients claiming an allergy to tetanus toxoid.

While the literature is inconclusive for low-energy wounds, there is support for prophylactic antibiotic usage when wounds are complex, are of higher energy, have anatomic location such as hands/feet, and/or have other high-risk features mentioned above. Higher energy GSWs are associated with increased infection rates, at least in part because the increased mass of devitalized tissue creates an excellent medium for bacterial growth without full host defenses. For high-energy wounds, 24–72 hours of systemic antibiotics have been recommended. However, previous studies have indicated that only in a fraction of cases could the type of weapon be accurately determined, so ultimately most of these judgments must rely on examination of the wound. This led to the axiom to treat 'the wound and not the weapon' from Lindsey. Even if the degree of tissue contamination and tissue destruction merit antibiotic prophylaxis, antibiotics alone, without adequate debridement, would be insufficient. When antibiotic prophylaxis is determined necessary for lower energy GSWs, a first-generation cephalosporin (or clindamycin in the setting of a penicillin allergy) generally is sufficient. Appropriate duration is unclear and likely needs to be determined based on the same considerations described above. Tetanus vaccination status should be addressed.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113G6uSZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Tetanus prophylaxis for animal bite wounds — Recommendation 43 — states that "Tetanus toxoid should be administered to patients without toxoid vaccination within 10 years. Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TdaP) is preferred over Tetanus and diptheria (Td) if the former has not been previously given (strong, low)". The evidence summary emphasizes that "Tetanus is a severe and often fatal disease preventable through routine vaccination (ie, primary series and decennial boosters)".

### Fingertip injuries [^113WTfKz]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Nail bed laceration — initial options include observation and reassurance in most cases; clinicians may consider nail bed laceration repair with size 6–0 or 7–0 absorbable sutures vs topical glue if nail plate already avulsed; no nail cosmetic differences are noted between observation vs repair, and there is no need for referral unless concomitant complex or open fractures present.

### Are current UK tetanus prophylaxis procedures for wound management optimal? [^117UvUJY]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a potentially fatal disease that occurs after contamination of a wound with Clostridium tetani spores. The introduction of comprehensive infant vaccination programmes in the 1960s dramatically reduced the incidence of tetanus in the UK. To achieve comprehensive protection against tetanus, the World Health Organization guidelines recommend the administration of the five-dose childhood immunisation regimen and an additional sixth dose, after approximately 10 years, to ensure long-lasting immunity. To supplement these measures, tetanus prophylaxis with human tetanus immunoglobulin is considered essential for incompletely immunised individuals presenting with dirty wounds. However, identifying those individuals who are not fully immunised has, until recently, been problematical. The use of a new rapid, point-of-care immunoassay to assess tetanus immune status may facilitate the optimal management of patients with wounds.

Primary care clinicians encounter many conditions during their day-to-day visits with patients. A few of these common presentations include burns, lacerations, trauma to the hand, and wounds, some of which do not require an evaluation by a specialist and can be managed outpatient by primary care clinicians. In this article, we share evidence-based tips to avoid common pitfalls in primary care recognition and management of such presentations as well as guide them to manage many of these conditions themselves. We also provide guidance in the decision to refer the patient to a plastic surgeon or other specialists.

### Treatment recommendations… [^111Df2Sz]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.
- Tetanus treatment often involves several types of medications and supportive care.
- Complete recovery can take several months.
- Tetanus infection doesn't provide immunity, so vaccination is recommended during recovery.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Treatment recommendations Administer tetanus immune globulin Dose Medical experts recommend a single, 500 international unit dose of TIG for tetanus treatment. While the optimal therapeutic dose is uncertain, this dose appears as effective as higher doses. It also causes less discomfort. TIG helps remove unbound tetanus toxin from the body. It can't affect toxin already bound to nerve endings. Administration Administer TIG preparations intramuscularly.

TIG preparations available in the United States aren't licensed or formulated for intrathecal or intravenous use. Some medical experts recommend infiltration of part of the dose locally around the wound, although its efficacy hasn't been proven. Alternative treatment If TIG isn't available, healthcare providers can use immune globulin intravenous. Note, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't approved IGIV for this use. In addition, anti-tetanus antibody content varies by lot. Manage wounds and treat infections Clean all wounds. Remove or debride necrotic tissue. Remove any foreign material. Observe wounds for signs of infection. Promptly treat infected wounds. Provide antibiotic therapy Appropriate antibiotic therapy is recommended to reduce the number of tetanus bacteria. Promoting long-term wellness after treatment Vaccinate during recovery Tetanus disease doesn't result in tetanus immunity.

Vaccination, if indicated, is recommended as soon as the patient's condition has stabilized. Healthcare providers should begin or continue active immunization with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.

### Common acute hand infections [^114kxL9v]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hand infections can result in significant morbidity if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Host factors, location, and circumstances of the infection are important guides to initial treatment strategies. Many hand infections improve with early splinting, elevation, appropriate antibiotics and, if an abscess is present, incision and drainage. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in patients who have at-risk infections. Paronychia, an infection of the epidermis bordering the nail, commonly is precipitated by localized trauma. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm-water soaks and, sometimes, oral antibiotics. A felon is an abscess of the distal pulp of the fingertip. An early felon may be amenable to elevation, oral antibiotics, and warm water or saline soaks. A more advanced felon requires incision and drainage. Herpetic whitlow is a painful infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Early treatment with oral antiviral agents may hasten healing. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist injuries are more serious infections that often require surgical intervention. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is an acute synovial space infection involving a flexor tendon sheath. Treatment consists of parenteral antibiotics and sheath irrigation. A clenched-fist injury usually is the result of an altercation and often involves injury to the extensor tendon, joint capsule, and bone. Wound exploration, copious irrigation, and appropriate antibiotics can prevent undesired outcomes.

### Who needs a shot… a review of tetanus immunity in the west of Ireland [^115fxbCS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tetanus is a rare disease but, in the era of widespread vaccination, largely a preventable one. Immunization programmes in childhood are felt to offer lifelong immunity but it is known that with increased age immunity wanes. We sought to assess immunity in a sample of patients presenting for conditions unrelated to injury to the emergency department covering an area in the West of Ireland.

Methods

A convenience sample of 216 patients, who presented to the emergency department for complaints unrelated to injury, requiring blood tests for their management was obtained. Using the Protetanus QuickStick® all samples were analysed.

Results

No statistical difference between men and women in terms of tetanus immunity (p = 0.94) but significant reduction in immunity with increasing age (p < 0.001). Those non-immune tended to be older with mean age of 66 years compared to mean age of 46 year for immune. Using logarithmic regression analysis an increase in age of 10 years was associated with 50% reduction in immunity.

Discussion

National guidelines should incorporate this data and explicitly advocate the use of booster doses of tetanus toxoid outside of the normal vaccination programme especially in the elderly.

### Tetanus vaccine recommendations… [^113bnVzb]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- CDC recommends tetanus vaccines for people across the lifespan, including for wound management.
- Follow the recommended immunization schedule to ensure that your patients get the tetanus vaccines that they need.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure that your patients are protected from tetanus. Background The United States uses three types of combination vaccines that include protection against tetanus: DTaP, Tdap, and Td. DT vaccine is no longer available in the United States. DTaP and Tdap also include protection against diphtheria and pertussis. Td also includes protection against diphtheria. Children younger than 7 years of age receive DTaP, while older children and adults receive Tdap or Td. The following summarizes CDC's current age-based recommendations for DTaP, Tdap, and Td. Access the official, full text of CDC's current and historical DTaP/Tdap/Td vaccine recommendations. Keep ReadingTetanus vaccination during wound care.

Infants and children CDC recommends routine DTaP vaccination for all infants and children younger than 7 years old. Administer a 5-dose DTaP series, 1 dose at each of the following ages:

- 2 months
- 4 months
- 6 months
- 15 through 18 months
- 4 through 6 years. Adolescents CDC recommends routine Tdap vaccination for all adolescents. Administer a single dose of Tdap at 11 to 12 years of age. Catch-up guidance Vaccinate children who miss their shots or start the series later than recommended. Depending on the child's age when vaccination begins, the recommendation varies for
- Type of vaccine
- Number of doses
- Interval between doses Job aids for simplifying catch-up guidance Use the following job aids to help interpret table 2 of the child and adolescent immunization schedule. Adults CDC recommends vaccination every 10 years for all adults to maintain protection against tetanus.

Once an adult has received a dose of Tdap, administer Td or Tdap for their booster doses. Keep ReadingTdap products for adults 65 years or older.

### Clinical guidance for wound management to prevent tetanus… [^112xCc8i]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The best ways to prevent tetanus are vaccination and wound management.
- There are steps healthcare providers can take during wound care to minimize the risk of tetanus.
- Antibiotics aren't recommended during wound care to protect against tetanus. Recommendations Healthcare providers should take the following steps to prevent tetanus:

- Provide appropriate wound care
- Evaluate the patient's tetanus vaccination status

Tetanus vaccination status evaluation Vaccination not recommended Regardless of wound type, no tetanus vaccination is needed if the patient meets both criteria below:

- Received last tetanus vaccination less than 5 years ago
- Completed the primary vaccine series. Vaccination recommended For all wounds
- People with an unknown vaccine history
- Unvaccinated people
- People with an incomplete tetanus primary series For clean and minor wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 10 or more years ago. For dirty or major wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 5 or more years ago. TIG assessment TIG contains antibodies against tetanus toxin and functions as an antitoxin. TIG can provide temporary protection against tetanus by directly binding and neutralizing circulating toxin. TIG cannot neutralize toxin that's already bound to nerve endings.

TIG prophylaxis indications For clean and minor wounds TIG is never indicated for clean and minor wounds. For dirty or major wounds
- People with an unknown tetanus vaccine history
- People who have never received tetanus vaccines
- People with an incomplete tetanus vaccine primary series
- People with HIV
- People with a severe immunodeficiency. Care If indicated, administer 250 international units of TIG intramuscularly. TIG is commercially available for purchase. CDC doesn't stockpile or supply TIG.

### Ten-year experiences with tetanus at a tertiary hospital in northwestern tanzania: a retrospective review of 102 cases [^117XHCV2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tetanus, though a vaccine preventable disease, is still a significant public health problem throughout the world and it is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate, particularly in the developing world. The global incidence of tetanus is still estimated at one million cases annually, with a case fatality ratio ranging from 6% to 72% depending on the availability of well equipped intensive care unit. The incidence of tetanus in the developed world is markedly low and is no longer responsible for significant mortality, this has been attributed to high level of health awareness in terms of vaccination and availability of human and material resources to manage the disease. In developed countries tetanus occurs mainly in elderly due to decline in protective antibodies and in developing countries tetanus is common in the young due to lack of effective immunization program and appropriate treatment of injuries.

Tetanus is caused by Clostridium Tetani, a gram positive, anaerobic and spore forming bacterium which is found in soil and in animal and human faeces and the usual mode of entry is through a punctured wounds or lacerations, although tetanus may follow surgery, burns, gangrene, chronic ulcers, dog bites, injections such as with drug users, dental infection, abortion and childbirth. In some patients no portal of entry for the organism can be identified.

Tetanus occurs sporadically and almost always affects non-immunized, partially immunized, or fully immunized persons who fail to maintain adequate immunity with booster doses of vaccine. It is therefore very important, in order to have protection against tetanus, that all age groups have the universal primary immunization with subsequent maintenance of adequate antitoxin levels by means of appropriately timed boosters.

### Interventions for treating fingertip entrapment injuries in children [^117Xhjwt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fingertip entrapment injuries, which involve lacerations to the pulp and nail and often a fracture of the underlying bone, commonly occur in children, usually as the result of a crushing injury. Treatment is either conservative (wound cleaning and fingertip dressing)or surgical (repair of lacerations, reduction and stabilisation of fractures); however, no consensus currently exists regarding the most appropriate treatment modality.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical and conservative interventions for fingertip entrapment injuries in children. We aimed to compare: different methods of conservative treatment; surgical versus conservative treatment; different methods of surgical treatment; and different methods of management after initial conservative or surgical treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform and reference lists of articles up to 30 April 2013. We did not apply any restrictions based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing interventions for treating fingertip entrapment injuries in children. The primary outcomes were fingertip function, nail growth, nail deformity and adverse events such as infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in each included trial and extracted data. We resolved disagreements through discussion.

Main Results

We included two RCTs examining a total of 191 young children, 180 of whom were included in the analyses. The two trials tested different comparisons. Both trials were at high risk of bias, particularly from lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and of outcome assessment. The trials did not record fingertip function, nail growth or nail deformity. The quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes was judged to be 'low' using the GRADE approach (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate). One trial compared a seven-day course of antibiotics with no antibiotics after formal surgical repair of fingertip entrapment injuries. One child in each group had an infection at day seven (1/66 antibiotic group versus 1/69 no antibiotic group; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.37). Both participants with infections had a more severe injury (partial fingertip amputation). The other trial compared two different dressings (silicone net and paraffin gauze) for use after either surgical or initial conservative management of fingertip entrapment injuries. It reported that two of 20 children in the silicone group versus one of 25 in the paraffin group had complications of wound infection (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 25.63) and that one of 20 children in the silicone group versus two of 25 in the paraffin group had skin necrosis (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.41). All complications healed with conservative treatment. The results for mean healing times and mean number of dressing changes were similar between groups but benefits of either silicone or paraffin dressings could not be excluded (silicone mean 4.1 weeks versus paraffin mean 4.0 weeks; MD 0.10 weeks, 95% CI-0.61 to 0.81); (silicone mean 4.3 dressing changes versus paraffin mean 4.2 dressing changes; MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.77). The trial found that a silicone dressing was less likely to adhere to the wound or cause distress for the child at the one-week dressing change.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence from RCTs to inform all key treatment decisions for the management of fingertip entrapment injuries in children. Given that the quality of evidence is low from one trial, we do not have conclusive evidence that prophylactic use of antibiotics after surgical repair fails to reduce risk of infection. The two children who experienced infection had more severe wounds. Similarly, the low quality evidence from one trial has not enabled us to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect on healing time or complications (infection, skin necrosis) at four-week follow-up between a silicone net dressing and a paraffin gauze dressing when applied post-surgery or after simple wound irrigation; however, the silicone net dressing may be easier to remove in the first week. Further RCTs are required in this area, preferably comparing surgical with conservative methods of managing fingertip entrapment injuries. Outcome assessment should include fingertip function, nail growth and nail deformity for a minimum of three months posttreatment.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^116M9vot]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Sixteen (76%) patients reported that an acute injury had occurred before illness onset; including punctures (seven), abrasions (four), linear lacerations (three), compound fracture (one) and animal bite (one). Of six patients with data on wound depth, two had wounds that were > 1 cm deep. Seven of 11 patients with available data had wounds that appeared infected, and two of seven patients with available data had wounds with devitalized, ischemic, or denervated tissue. Five patients reported no acute injuries before onset; of these, three were injection-drug users. The remaining two patients could not recall any acute injuries; however, one reported an insect bite, and the other reported chronic abrasions on the hands and feet and exposure to soil.

Of the 16 patients who reported acute injuries before illness onset, nine had sought medical care for their injuries (Table 2). Of the nine, only two received appropriate PEP before the onset of tetanus symptoms as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (Table 3). Of the seven patients who did not receive appropriate PEP, five had punctures or contaminated wounds and unknown TT vaccination histories, and should have received both TT and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) as recommended. However, four patients did not receive any PEP, and one received TT PEP only. Of the two remaining patients, one had a clean, minor wound and reported receiving at least one TT dose more than 10 years ago, but was not offered TT PEP as recommended; the other patient was contraindicated for TT because of a history of anaphylaxis, but was not offered TIG as an alternative.

Following their tetanus diagnoses, all 21 patients were treated with TIG; six were treated ≤ 1 day after symptom onset, eight ≤ 4 days, six ≤ 9 days, and one was treated > 2 weeks after onset. Among the five fatal cases, one patient was treated ≤ 1 day after symptom onset, two were treated ≤ 4 days, and two ≤ 9 days after onset. Of 15 patients for whom data on TIG dosage were available, five received less than the 3,000–6,000 U that is generally recommended for treatment; two received less than 500 U, and three received 500–1,000 U.

### Managing snakebite [^114Zhu3h]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Other treatments

Neostigmine with atropine is a potentially useful adjunct in patients bitten by snakes such as some cobras with postsynaptic neurotoxins in their venom. Its use must never delay or preclude antivenom treatment or intubation.

Administer a tetanus toxoid booster in all patients except in those with coagulopathy, in which case injection is postponed until haemostasis is achieved. Aspirate large tense bullae to facilitate nursing the bitten limb, pre-empt spontaneous rupture, and prevent secondary infection. Broad spectrum antibiotics are indicated only if the wound has been incised or there are signs of necrosis, wound infection, or abscess formation. Surgical debridement or amputation of gangrenous digits or limbs and skin grafting may be needed. Fasciotomies are rarely justified since compartment pressures usually remain within normal limits.

### High-pressure injection injuries of the hand [^117FxRYh]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

High-pressure injection hand injuries are often overlooked, with severe complications owing to the acute inflammatory response. Prognosis for depends on the type of material injected, location of injection, involved pressure, and timing to surgical decompression and debridement. Acute management involves broad-spectrum antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, emergent decompression within 6 hours, and complete removal of the injected material. Most patients have residual sequelae of stiffness, pain, sensation loss, and difficulties in returning to work. The hand surgeon's role is prompt surgical intervention, early postoperative motion, and education of patient and staff regarding short- and long-term expectations.

### Accuracy of parental-reported tetanus vaccination status for children with lacerations [^115GmQ7p]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether emergency department (ED) providers are able to accurately assess whether a child with a laceration needs tetanus prophylaxis.

Methods

We conducted an 8-month prospective cross-sectional study of children presenting with a laceration to a pediatric ED. We asked ED providers whether tetanus prophylaxis was necessary. An ED pharmacist accessed the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System (USIIS), and we assessed the accuracy of the ED provider's determination of necessary tetanus prophylaxis compared with USIIS records.

Results

Among 375 patients aged 5 months to 17 years, ED providers made an inaccurate assessment of necessary tetanus prophylaxis in 33 cases (8.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3%-12.1%). Emergency department providers would have inappropriately administered tetanus prophylaxis in 5 cases (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.5%-3.2%) and would have missed the need for tetanus prophylaxis in 28 cases (7.5%; 95% CI, 5.2%-10.6%). Emergency department providers were more likely to provide an inaccurate recommendation in older children (8.3 vs 4.8 years; P < 0.001), in patients with a dirty wound (45.5% vs 11.7%; P < 0.001), and in children who had fewer than 3 vaccines recorded in the USIIS (54.5% vs 1.2%; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Emergency department providers may inaccurately assess the need for tetanus prophylaxis in children. Special attention should be paid to cases of dirty wounds and cases in which fewer than 3 tetanus-containing vaccines have been given.

### Ten-year experiences with tetanus at a tertiary hospital in northwestern tanzania: a retrospective review of 102 cases [^113mbCiF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Results

One hundred-eighteen cases of tetanus were managed during the period under study. Of these, complete information was available on 102 (86.4%) cases while there was some missing data on 16 (13.6%) cases. Thus, a total of 102 patients were studied with an average of 10 cases per year (range of 8–14 cases per year).

Demographic data

Males were 94 (92.2%) and females were 8 (7.8%) with a male to female ratio of 11.8: 1. Their ages ranged from 8 to 72 years with a mean of 36.21 ± 14.64 years. The median was 34.00 years. The mean age of males and females was 35.14 ± 14.82 and 32.44 ± 11.22 years, respectively (P-value > 0.001). The modal age group was 31–40 years. Seventy-six (74.5%) were below 40 years of age, while 26 (25.5%) were aged 40 years and above. No cases of neonatal tetanus were reported. The majority of patients were farmers (51.0%) (Table 1).

Table 1
Distribution of occupation and the portals of entry of tetanus

Previous tetanus immunization history

Previous tetanus immunization status was recorded in all patients. Of these, only twenty-four (23.5%) patients had prior tetanus immunization, while the other seventy-eight (76.5%) patients were not vaccinated or did not know their tetanus immunization status. However, in patients who had prior tetanus immunization there was no written proof of the immunization schedule in any cases. Serology test to detect anti-tetanus antibodies was not performed.

Portals of entry and type of injury

Acute injuries such us prick, puncture, laceration, burns were the most common portals of entry in 52.9% of cases and commonly occurred in the lower limbs (53.8%). The portals of entry were not identified in 33.6% of cases (Table 1). Twenty-one (38.9%) patients had medical wound care before hospital admission but none received tetanus immunoglobulin despite the absence of tetanus immunity.

### A case of tetanus infection in an adult with a protective tetanus antibody level [^116799zH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani and most commonly presents as trismus or other muscle spasms. Despite the development of the tetanus toxoid vaccine, tetanus infection has not been eradicated. Additionally, while there are hypothesized protective levels of tetanus antibody, tetanus infection may still occur in properly vaccinated individuals. We report the case of a 31-year-old male that presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of neck and jaw pain. He reports puncturing his hand with a rusty nail 10 days prior. His reported vaccination history was that he received his last booster vaccination 13 years prior to presentation. In the ED, tetanus vaccine, tetanus immune globulin, and metronidazole were administered. His symptoms improved over the next 2 days and resolved at day 6. Despite his presentation of tetanus infection and rule out of other causes for his symptoms, his tetanus antibody level was reported at 8.4 U/mL, which is considered to be protective. A tetanus antibody level that is adequate for protective immunity should not preclude a patient from treatment of tetanus infection. This case demonstrates that a thorough history, physical exam, and rule out of other causes should guide treatment when there is concern for a tetanus infection.

### Fingertip injuries [^111zJPDa]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — key management points note that subungual hematoma is diagnosed clinically and treated with observation or nail trephination, and nail bed lacerations are treated by removal of the nail and repair of the nail bed. Distal interphalangeal joint dislocations typically occur dorsally from hyperextension or hyperflexion during sports or accidental trauma, and management primarily involves closed reduction and splinting, though surgical intervention might be necessary for complex cases. Distal phalanx fractures are most often minimally displaced and amenable to closed reduction and splinting, but open and intra-articular fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface require referral to a hand surgeon. Mallet finger comprises rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon or avulsion from the distal phalanx that inhibits distal interphalangeal joint extension and typically heals after 6 to 8 weeks of constant immobilization. Jersey finger involves injury to the flexor digitorum profundus tendon and necessitates referral for surgical repair to restore function.

Results

Participant disposition and baseline characteristics

Participants were recruited primarily from emergency departments in 28 hospitals across 14 provinces in China, between 22 December 2022 and 23 March 2023. A total of 715 candidate participants were assessed for eligibility, of whom 675 were enrolled; 661 received either siltartoxatug (n = 440) or HTIG (n = 221). Among the 661 participants, 71 (approximately 10% as anticipated) concomitantly received adsorbed tetanus vaccine. Most (60) received two doses of the vaccine, administered 4–8 weeks apart. A total of 649 participants completed the 105-day follow-up period. The reasons for discontinuation included withdrawal of consent (6), poor compliance (4) and loss to follow-up (2) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
CONSORT flow diagram.

The full analysis set included all randomized participants who received the study drug. The safety set included all treated participants with at least one postadministration safety evaluation. The full analysis set was used for efficacy analysis. The safety set was used for safety analysis.

The median age at baseline was 43 years, with a range of 19–79 years. Participants presented to the clinical centers with unclean or contaminated wounds posing a risk for tetanus. The most common injuries were incised wounds (58.1%) and puncture wounds (19.4%).

Over half (58.2%) of the participants had baseline anti-tetanus antibody titers below the minimum protective level against tetanus (0.01 IU mL −1), while antibodies were completely undetectable in 40.7% of participants. This reflects insufficient previous tetanus immunization in the study participants, as well as in the general adult population in China. It underscores the necessity of administering passive immunizing agents to provide rapid protection to those participants. Overall, baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups (Table 1).

The fingertip is the interface between humans and the world, including the various thorns, dirty needles, and other hazards to be found there. It is unsurprising that this is the site where hand infections most frequently occur. Although commonly encountered by hand surgeons and other physicians, fingertip infections have several mimics, and diagnosis and management is not always straightforward. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to success. As with all infections, they are more common and are more aggressive in immunosuppressed patients. This article reviews fingertip anatomy, common and uncommon fingertip infections and their mimics, and recommendations for management.

### Is injecting a finger with rabies immunoglobulin dangerous? [^1132n6AH]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Treating potentially rabies virus infected wounds requires the injection of rabies immunoglobulin into and around the wounds, followed by vaccination with an approved tissue culture rabies vaccine. A significant number of such bite wounds involves fingers where there is little space for expansion. Injecting immunoglobulin into such areas under pressure may induce a compartment syndrome caused by compromising circulation. We carried out a retrospective review and a prospective study of patients seen with digital bite injuries and found that it is a safe procedure if carried out with care by experienced staff.

§ Persons with HIV infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunization.

¶ Yes, if > 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

Yes, if ≥ 5 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

Persons who have completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series and have received a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine < 5 years earlier are protected against tetanus and do not require a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine or TIG as part of wound management. An attempt should be made to determine whether a patient has completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. Persons who have not completed the primary series might require tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management (Table 6). When both TIG and a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine are indicated, the products should be administered using separate syringes at different anatomical sites. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunizations.

Persons with a history of an Arthus reaction following a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine until > 10 years after the most recent dose; this interval is recommended regardless of the wound condition (e.g. even if contaminated or severe). In all circumstances, the decision to administer TIG should be based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus (Table 6).

### Fingertip injuries [^113QVsdK]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The family physician often provides the first and only medical intervention for fingertip injuries. Proper diagnosis and management of fingertip injuries are vital to maintaining proper function of the hand and preventing permanent disability. A subungual hematoma is a painful condition that involves bleeding beneath the nail, usually after trauma. Treatment requires subungual decompression, which is achieved by creating small holes in the nail. A nail bed laceration is treated by removing the nail and suturing the injured nail bed. Closed fractures of the distal phalanx may require reduction but usually are minimally displaced and stable, and can be splinted. Open or intra-articular fractures of the distal phalanx may warrant referral. Patients with mallet finger cannot extend the distal interphalangeal joint because of a disruption of the extensor mechanism. Radiographs help to differentiate between tendinous and bony mallet types. Most mallet finger injuries heal with six to eight weeks of splinting, but some require referral. Flexor digitorum profundus avulsion always requires referral. Dislocations of the distal interphalangeal joint are rare and usually occur dorsally.

### Treatment and outcomes of fingertip injuries at a large metropolitan public hospital [^112NJ1EY]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fingertip injuries are the most common hand injuries presenting for acute care. Treatment algorithms have been described based on defect size, bone exposure, and injury geometry. The authors hypothesized that despite accepted algorithms, many fingertip injuries can be treated conservatively.

Methods

A prospectively collected retrospective review of all fingertip injuries presenting to Bellevue Hospital between January and May of 2011 was conducted. Patients were entered into an electronic database on presentation. Follow-up care was tracked through the electronic medical record. Patients lost to follow-up were questioned by means of telephone. Patients were analyzed based on age, mechanism of injury, handedness, occupation, wound geometry, defect size, bone exposure, emergency room procedures performed, need for surgical intervention, and outcome.

Results

One hundred fingertips were injured. Injuries occurred by crush (46 percent), laceration (30 percent), and avulsion (24 percent). Sixty-four percent of patients healed without surgery, 18 percent required operative intervention, and 18 percent were lost to follow-up. Patients requiring operative intervention were more likely to have a larger defect (3.28 cm versus 1.75 cm, p < 0.005), volar oblique injury (50 percent versus 8.8 percent, p < 0.005), exposed bone (81.3 percent versus 35.3 percent, p < 0.005), and an associated distal phalanx fracture (81.3 percent versus 47.1 percent, p < 0.05). Patients requiring surgical intervention had a longer average return to work time when compared with those not requiring surgical intervention (4.33 weeks versus 2.98 weeks, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Despite current accepted algorithms, many fingertip injuries can be treated nonoperatively to achieve optimal sensation, fine motor control, and earlier return to work.

### Fingertip injuries [^111txj73]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Family physicians play a pivotal role in providing timely care for common fingertip injuries and minimizing long-term disability after injury. Subungual hematoma is diagnosed clinically and treated with observation or nail trephination. Nail bed lacerations are treated by removal of the nail and repair of the nail bed. Distal interphalangeal joint dislocations typically occur dorsally and result from hyperextension or hyperflexion during sports or because of accidental trauma. Management primarily involves closed reduction and splinting; however, surgical intervention might be necessary for complex cases. Distal phalanx fractures are most often minimally displaced and amenable to closed reduction and splinting; open and intra-articular fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface require referral to a hand surgeon. Mallet finger comprises rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon or avulsion from the adjacent distal phalanx, inhibiting distal interphalangeal joint extension, and typically heals after 6 to 8 weeks of constant immobilization. Jersey finger involves similar injuries to the flexor digitorum profundus tendon but necessitates referral for surgical repair to restore function.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management Recommendations

A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for wound management when > 5 years have passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous Tdap vaccination, either Td or Tdap may be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. Complete information on tetanus prophylaxis and the use of tetanus immunoglobulin when indicated for wound management is available at.

### Hand and fingertip injuries in children [^114zUhFt]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hands are frequently injured in children. To date, the literature has focused on the type and treatment of hand injuries. This study examines the epidemiology of hand and fingertip injuries in children who present to an emergency department (ED).

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Pediatric emergency center of an urban ED.

Participants

All patients over a period of 8 months who presented with a chief complaint of hand injury.

Methods

A total of 17,859 charts were reviewed during the study period; 382 patients were enrolled in the study (male preponderance of 1.4:1; median age, 10 y).

Results

The most frequent injury setting was outdoors (47%). The most frequent injuries were lacerations (30%), followed by fractures (16%). Only five patients required hospitalization (1.3%). The digits are the most commonly injured part of the hand, particularly the thumb (19%). Fingertips are involved in 21% of cases. Radiographs and consultations were obtained in 64% and 16% of cases, respectively. Infection occurred in 14 (3.7%) patients.

Conclusion

Hand injuries occur in a bimodal distribution in children. Children younger than 2 years suffered fingertip injuries in the home, and children aged 12 to 16 years suffered hand injuries. Sports injuries tend to present late and are the most common cause of hand fractures.

### Management of traumatic wounds in the emergency department: position paper from the Academy of Emergency Medicine and Care (AcEMC) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) [^114HAmU9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Definitions

At the end of the work the panel and the referees have reached an agreement on the following definitions of traumatic wounds:
Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin with no evidence of macroscopic contamination or signs of active infection (and likely low probability of infection).
Dirty Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin macroscopically contaminated. Among these wounds we include those with simultaneous perforation of a viscus; with presence of devitalized tissues; with foreign bodies; those that occurred in a contaminated environment (dung, marshes); animal bites; puncture wounds; wounds with a delayed treatment.
Infected Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin with signs of infection (secretions).

After completed that step, the panel reached consensus on a series of statements concerning the management of traumatic wounds. For each statement, selected references are provided. The statements are as follows:
STATEMENT 1 All traumatic wounds are to be considered contaminated at presentation in ED.

STATEMENT 2 It is useful to provide an initial stratification of the risk of infection for all the traumatic wounds. The risk assessment should be based on both the following: i) type of wound; ii) location of the wound; iii) characteristics of the wounded patient. With the aim of simplifying and optimizing the management of patients in the ED, the following fields of stratification of the risk of infection was identified: type of wound, location of the wound, characteristics of the patients. In Tables 2, 3, 4 the suggested items for risk assessment are summarized. Table 2 Infection risk assessment based on type of wound Table 3 Infection risk assessment based on the location of the wound Table 4 Infection risk assessment based on the characteristics of the patient 2A. Avoid antibiotic administration in low risk wounds (for all three variables considered). 2B. Consider antibiotic administration when one or two high risk variables are present. 2C. If the decision to avoid antibiotic administration in high risk wounds is made the reason must always be clearly stated. 2D. In every wound consider the risk of tetanus according to the patient's immunization status.

### Notes from the field: tetanus in an unvaccinated child-Oregon, 2017 [^11678fLJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

The boy required 57 days of inpatient acute care, including 47 days in the intensive care unit. The inpatient charges totaled $811,929 (excluding air transportation, inpatient rehabilitation, and ambulatory follow-up costs). One month after inpatient rehabilitation, he returned to all normal activities, including running and bicycling. Despite extensive review of the risks and benefits of tetanus vaccination by physicians, the family declined the second dose of DTaP and any other recommended immunizations.

This is the first pediatric tetanus case in > 30 years in Oregon (unpublished data, Oregon Health Authority, 2018). The diagnosis of tetanus is made based on clinical findings because the bacterium C. tetani is difficult to grow from wounds. A wound culture from the child's laceration did not grow C. tetani. However, a negative wound culture does not rule out disease. The health care costs to treat this child's preventable disease were approximately 72 times the mean (2012) cost of $11,143 for a U.S. pediatric hospitalization. A recent report describing adult tetanus cases included hospital charges ranging from $22,229 to $1,024,672.

Widespread use of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines (tetanus toxoid inactivated vaccine or a combination vaccine that contains tetanus toxoid) and tetanus immune globulin for wound management has led to a 95% decline in the number of tetanus cases and a 99% decrease in the number of tetanus-related deaths since the 1940s. From 2009 to 2015, 197 tetanus cases and 16 tetanus-associated deaths were reported in the United States. Unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated persons are at risk for tetanus, irrespective of age, and recovery from tetanus disease does not confer immunity.

Routine administration of a 5-dose DTaP series is recommended for all eligible children at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, then a dose at 15–18 months of age, and a fifth dose at 4–6 years of age. Booster doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are recommended every 10 years throughout life. Uninsured or underinsured eligible children may receive vaccines at no cost through the Vaccine For Children program. Resources to assist health care providers in discussing vaccination with their patients, including how to address questions, are available online.

Emergency physicians are often confronted with situations in which a patient with an acute injury is at high risk for an infection. Although most traumatic wounds have a low risk for developing infection, certain types of high-risk trauma justify antimicrobial prophylaxis. This article reviews antimicrobial wound infection prophylaxis for high-risk traumatic wounds, including the prevention of rabies and tetanus. Prophylaxis to prevent infections related to invasive procedures in the emergency department is also addressed.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^112khUit]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although rates of tetanus have declined, sporadic cases continue to occur, particularly in adults who are not up-to-date with TT. Vaccination coverage among children is higher; in 2012, an estimated 82.5% of U.S. children aged 19–35 months and 84.6% of U.S. children aged 13–17 years had received ≥ 4 doses of diphtheria toxoid-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) and ≥ 1 dose of tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), respectively. In contrast, only 62% of adults aged ≥ 19 years had received TT during the preceding 10 years; coverage for adults aged ≥ 65 years was 55%. All of the tetanus patients reported in California during January 2008–March 2014 were adults aged ≥ 21 years. Among the 12 patients with verified vaccination histories, none recalled receiving TT during the preceding 10 years. Health care providers should assess patient vaccination status during routine visits to determine whether TT is needed. ACIP recommends that after receiving a primary childhood series, a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) dose should be given during adolescence and every 10 years thereafter. For added protection against pertussis, one of the Td booster doses should be Tdap if it was not previously administered.

Even minor wounds or abrasions can result in tetanus, highlighting the importance of ensuring that patients are up to date for TT. Providers should assess vaccination status in patients with wounds and in particular older adults, injection-drug users, patients with diabetes, and those with chronic wounds, all of whom are considered at increased risk for tetanus. Patients who have completed the 3-dose primary TT series need a booster dose as part of wound management if they have a clean, minor wound and received their last TT dose more than 10 years prior to injury, or if they have any other type of wound and received their last TT dose more than 5 years prior to injury. ACIP recommends that persons with unknown or incomplete histories receive TT as part of routine wound management; patients with wounds that are neither clean nor minor should receive TIG in addition to TT. Although the dosage of TIG for PEP is not specified in the recommendations, dosage information is provided in the product insert. §

### Dog and cat bites: rapid evidence review [^112mVfHi]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Animal bites are a significant burden to health care systems worldwide. In the United States, dog bites account for an average of 337,000 emergency visits and generate medical costs of up to $2 billion per year. Most animal bites in adults and children are from a dog, and most bite patients are children who have been bitten by animals known to them. Dog bites may cause crush and soft-tissue avulsion, whereas cat bites usually cause deeper puncture-type wounds. Children most often present with dog bites on the head and neck, and adolescents and adults usually present with dog bites on the extremities and hands. Bite wounds should be examined, cleaned, and irrigated with warm water or normal saline solution, and any foreign bodies and devitalized tissue should be removed. Neurovascular function (e.g., pulses, sensation) and range and movement of adjacent joints should be examined and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line choice, should be considered for all bites, particularly for those at increased risk of infection. Imaging and laboratory studies are usually not required unless there is suspicion of a retained foreign body, damage to underlying structures, infection, or extensive injury. Primary closure of bite wounds may be performed if there is low risk of infection. The need for tetanus vaccination and rabies postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated for each patient; bites that do not break the skin generally do not require rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^113av1b2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Tendon Rupture or Other Serious Injury to the Injected Finger/Hand in the Treatment of Dupuytren's Contracture

In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of clinical trials in Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tendon ruptures occurred after XIAFLEX injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Injection of XIAFLEX into collagen-containing structures such as tendons or ligaments of the hand may result in damage to those structures and possible permanent injury such as tendon rupture or ligament damage. Therefore, XIAFLEX should be injected only into the collagen cord with a MP or PIP joint contracture, and care should be taken to avoid injecting into tendons, nerves, blood vessels, or other collagen-containing structures of the hand. When injecting a cord affecting a PIP joint of the fifth finger, the needle insertion should not be more than 2 to 3 mm in depth and avoid injecting more than 4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Other XIAFLEX-associated serious local adverse reactions included pulley rupture, ligament injury, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), sensory abnormality of the hand, and skin laceration (tear). In a historically controlled post-marketing trial, the incidence of skin laceration (22%) was higher for subjects treated with two concurrent injections of XIAFLEX compared with subjects treated with up to three single injections in the placebo-controlled premarketing trials (9%). Postmarketing cases of skin laceration requiring skin graft after finger extension procedures and local skin and soft-tissue necrosis, some requiring skin grafting or, other surgical interventions including finger amputation have been reported. Signs or symptoms that may reflect serious injury to the injected finger/hand should be promptly evaluated because surgical intervention may be required.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^1116e68F]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

In this analysis, only nine of 16 patients with acute injuries had sought medical care before their tetanus illness onset and diagnosis, and only two of the nine received PEP with TT or TT plus TIG as recommended. Health care providers might fail to provide TIG PEP because of a lack of knowledge about current recommendations or because the assessment of wound severity and whether a patient should be managed with TIG according to ACIP recommendations can be subjective. All tetanus patients required considerable and costly medical care, including hospitalization, and almost all (90%) were admitted to intensive care. Among patients who received TIG as treatment, there was variability in the dose administered. In the United States, 3,000–6,000 U, given in a single intramuscular dose with part of the dose infiltrated around the wound if it can be identified, is generally recommended for treatment. However, the optimal therapeutic dose has not been established, and some experts contend that a dose of 500 U, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is as effective as higher doses and causes less discomfort. It is also possible that some providers treating tetanus patients inadvertently prescribed the PEP dosage of TIG rather than the treatment dosage. Among five treated patients who received < 3,000 U of TIG as treatment, three survived and two died. Among 10 treated patients who received ≥ 3,000 U of TIG, seven survived, and three died.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, although California health care providers are required to report tetanus cases, surveillance is passive, and underreporting is likely. Second, because there is no laboratory testing for tetanus and case identification depends solely on clinical assessment, some cases might be misclassified. Finally, some of the case reports were incomplete, particularly with regard to TT history.

Although significant progress has been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by tetanus, cases of this vaccine-preventable disease continue to be reported. Health care providers should assess the tetanus vaccination status of their patients during routine visits. All providers who provide care for patients with wounds should have protocols for tetanus PEP and ensure that appropriate PEP is provided for such patients.

What is already known on this topic?

The incidence of tetanus has declined significantly since the introduction of tetanus vaccines. However, sporadic cases continue to be reported, particularly in adults who are not up-to-date with tetanus vaccinations.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^112o323B]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is added by this report?

During January 2008–March 2014 in California, a total of 21 tetanus patients were reported. All were hospitalized, including 19 in intensive care units; five (24%) died. Of 16 patients with an acute injury prior to illness, only nine had sought medical care, and only two of the nine received appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. In addition, some patients with tetanus were not administered the recommended dosage of tetanus immune globulin.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Routine vaccination of patients every 10 years is important to prevent tetanus, particularly in settings where patients do not seek medical care following an injury, where no injury is evident to the patient, or where appropriate postexposure prophylaxis is not provided following an injury. Efforts to educate health care providers might lead to better tetanus postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds and better use of therapeutic tetanus immune globulin for patients with tetanus.

### Randomized feasibility trial of replacing or discarding the nail plate after nail-bed repair in children [^111ENEEs]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nail‐bed injury is the most common paediatric hand injury requiring surgery. Typically, the injury is sustained when a child catches their fingertip in a closing door. This results in a laceration across the nail bed, which sits beneath the hard nail plate (fingernail). A tertiary hand surgery unit will expect to treat approximately four children each week. This equates to approximately 10 000 children treated annually across the UK 1. In the UK, 96 per cent of plastic surgery and orthopaedic hand surgeons replace the nail plate after repairing the nail‐bed injury (Fig. 1) 1. The rationale most often given for replacing the nail plate is that it protects the repaired nail bed and splints open the nail fold to enable normal nail growth. Recent evidence challenges surgical dogma by suggesting that replacing the nail plate results in higher infection rates, delayed wound healing and increased outpatient visits 2. A recent Cochrane review 3 highlighted the lack of high‐level evidence in the management of these injuries.

Figure 1

A consensus meeting was held at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in February 2014 to discuss this clinical uncertainty. The meeting led to development of a trial protocol, but there were key methodological uncertainties that needed to be addressed. In light of this, a feasibility trial was undertaken with the aim of informing a large definitive trial to address the question of whether the nail plate should be replaced or discarded after nail‐bed repair in children.

### Ten-year experiences with tetanus at a tertiary hospital in northwestern tanzania: a retrospective review of 102 cases [^116hdJVD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although tetanus is a vaccine preventable infectious disease, its prevalence is still high in our environment and it remains a difficult to treat disease with an unacceptably high morbidity and mortality rate, even with available advanced facilities for its management. Young adult males are commonly affected. The incidence of tetanus can be reduced significantly by an effective immunization program and proper wound management of the patients. Early recognition, intense support and prompt treatment improves morbidity and mortality of patients diagnosed with tetanus. Our study show comparable clinical pattern and outcome with other studies in the developing countries reported in the literatures.

Jersey finger — imaging and initial management: Imaging studies, such as radiography and ultrasonography, are used to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for the presence of any associated fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used for a more detailed view of the soft tissue structures and improve preoperative localization of the tendon. Once jersey finger is diagnosed, the finger should be splinted, and expedited referral to a hand surgeon should be pursued. Prompt surgical management is necessary to avoid tendon retraction and decreased blood supply that could affect surgical outcomes.

### Management of foreign bodies in the skin [^111ZTY4X]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Although puncture wounds are common, retained foreign bodies are not. Wounds with a foreign body sensation should be evaluated. The presence of wood or vegetative material, graphite or other pigmenting materials, and pain is an indication for foreign body removal. Radiography may be used to locate foreign bodies for removal, and ultrasonography can be helpful for localizing radiolucent foreign bodies. It is wise to set a time limit for exploration and to have a plan for further evaluation or referral. Injuries at high risk of infection include organic foreign bodies or dirty wounds. These should be treated with plain water irrigation and complete removal of retained fragments. In most cases, antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. If a patient presents with an infected wound, the possibility of a retained foreign body should be considered. Tetanus prophylaxis is necessary if there is no knowledge or documentation of tetanus immunization within 10 years, including tetanus immune globulin for the person with a dirty wound whose history of tetanus toxoid doses is unknown or incomplete.

### Should we test for tetanus immunity in all emergency department patients with wounds? [^113oUqpX]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

People who present to the emergency department often do not know their tetanus immunisation status. The Protetanus test can determine whether a person is immune and can guide treatment decisions.

Objectives

To examine whether testing all patients for immunity is clinically advisable and cost-effective.

Methods

200 patients presenting to the emergency department with wounds were asked whether they were covered for tetanus, not covered or did not know. All had their tetanus immunity tested with the Protetanus kit and the result was compared with reported status. The number of unnecessary vaccinations which might have been given based on recall was calculated. The cost of testing and subsequent treatment versus vaccinations based on recall was calculated.

Results

136 (68%) tested positive for tetanus immunity; 64 (32%) were negative. Age, sex and nationality were not associated with tetanus immunity. 151 (75.5%) did not know their status. Of these, 101 (66.9%) were positive and 50 (33.1%) negative. 49 (24.5%) were sure of their status. 36 said they were covered of whom 10 (27.8%) were wrong. 13 said they were not covered of whom 9 (69.2%) were wrong. If vaccination were based on recall status 38.8% of patients would receive incorrect treatment. Testing all 200 and treating appropriately would save £984, or £4.92 per patient compared with vaccination based on recall.

Conclusion

On clinical grounds testing is advisable and it may produce significant cost savings.

### Point-of-care testing for tetanus immunity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112whykE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current standard of care for tetanus prophylaxis management in patients with open wounds likely results in overtreatment and unnecessary costs. Point-of-care immunochromatographic tests, known as Tetanus Quick Sticks (TQS), have been developed to qualitatively measure tetanus immunoglobulin levels. Multiple studies advocate their use in EDs. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of TQS to assess their relevance in frontline emergency care.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, The Health Management Information Consortium and The Cochrane Library. Studies were eligible if sensitivity, specificity or cost-efficacy of TQS was reported. At least two authors independently assessed and extracted data from each study. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for TQS.

Results

12 studies were suitable for inclusion (n = 1662865 participants): 1 modelling and 11 prospective observational cohort studies. Eight studies assessed diagnostic accuracy; the summary estimate for sensitivity was 90% (95% CI, 89% to 90%) with specificity 97% (95% CI, 95% to 100%). Six studies investigated cost-efficacy, reporting lower healthcare costs when using TQS instead of the current method of vaccination history, due to a decrease in unnecessary tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin administration. Based on the current NHS supply chain data, TQS use could save £173.05 per tetanus-prone patient.

Conclusion

TQS could confer the greatest cost savings if used in combination with vaccination history in patients with tetanus-prone wounds. A quality assurance process is recommended prior to implementation of TQS in EDs.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^111Sim5c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Tetanus is an acute and sometimes fatal disease characterized by sudden muscle contractions. The number of tetanus cases reported annually in the United States has declined significantly since the 1930s and 1940s as a result of the introduction of tetanus vaccines. However, sporadic cases continue to occur in persons who are not up-to-date with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccinations (TT) and do not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). To assess the extent of these cases, the California Department of Public Health reviewed all tetanus cases reported during January 2008-March 2014. A total of 21 tetanus patients were reported; five (24%) died. An average of three cases were reported each year during 2008–2013; the average annual incidence among patients aged ≥ 65 years (0.23 cases per 1 million population) was twice that among patients aged 21–64 years (0.10 cases per 1 million population). Of 16 patients with an acute injury before illness and diagnosis, nine (56%) sought medical care, and two (22%) of the nine received appropriate PEP. Although tetanus is rare, it is a life-threatening disease that is preventable. Health care providers should ensure that their patients are up-to-date with TT vaccination and provide appropriate postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116BqhED]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention of Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus

Pregnant women who have completed the childhood immunization schedule and were last vaccinated more than ten years previously should receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine to prevent neonatal tetanus. The risk of neonatal tetanus is minimal if a previously unimmunized woman has received at least 2 properly spaced doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine during pregnancy; one of the doses administered during pregnancy should be Tdap, administered according to the current guidance. She should complete the 3-dose primary series at the recommended intervals.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management

ACIP has recommended administering tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) when indicated as part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus (Table 6). A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated as part of wound management if more than five years has passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous vaccination with Tdap, Td should be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated and Td is unavailable, Tdap may be administered.

Guide to tetanus prophylaxis in routine wound management

Abbreviations: DTaP = diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine; Tdap = tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis; Td = tetanus and diphtheria toxoids; TIG = tetanus immune globulin.

* Such as, but not limited to, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, and saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, and frostbite.

† DTaP is recommended for children aged < 7 years. Tdap is preferred to Td for persons aged ≥ 11 years who have not previously received Tdap. Persons aged ≥ 7 years who are not fully immunized against pertussis, tetanus or diphtheria should receive one dose of Tdap for wound management and as part of the catch-up series.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^115eaxSJ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lacerations — summary recommendations in the wilderness: Most lacerations can be safely closed in the wilderness. Grossly contaminated wounds should be left open and packed with wet to dry dressings. A clean, but not sterile, field is adequate for wound care. Obvious devitalized tissue should be debrided if it can be done so safely. Foreign debris should be removed, although the wound should not be extended for the purpose of retrieving foreign bodies not visible on gentle exploration of the wound. Wounds should be irrigated early with potable water. No additive should be added to the irrigation fluid or applied to the wound. Tissue adhesives are effective in wounds requiring a low-tension closure. Sutures or staples should be considered in more complex wounds requiring closure under tension. Staples should never be used on the face.

### For clinicians… [^115BdzhT]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians must administer available preparations intramuscularly; TIG preparations available in the United States are not licensed or formulated for intrathecal or intravenous use. Some medical experts recommend infiltration of part of the dose locally around the wound, although its efficacy has not been proven. If TIG is not available, clinicians can use immune globulin intravenous at a dose of 200 to 400 milligrams per kilogram. However, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved IGIV for this use. In addition, anti-tetanus antibody content varies from lot to lot. C. tetani. Clinicians should clean all wounds, remove dirt or foreign material, and remove or debride necrotic material. Evaluate the immunization status of the patient. Unvaccinated personsshould start and complete a primary series with an age-appropriate tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine as currently recommended by CDC.
- If the last dose of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine was received less than 5 years earlier, consider them protected against tetanus. They do not require another dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine as part of the current wound management.
- If the last dose of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine was received 5 or more years earlier, then administer a booster dose of an age-appropriate tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.
- Rarely have cases of tetanus occurred in persons with a documented primary series of tetanus toxoid. Assess need for administering TIG for prophylaxis. TIG provides temporary immunity by directly providing antitoxin. TIG can help remove unbound tetanus toxin but cannot neutralize toxin that is already bound to nerve endings. Persons who have dirty wounds and are either unvaccinated or have not received a primary series of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines should receive TIG for prophylaxis.

The dose of TIG for prophylaxis is 250 IU administered intramuscularly. Persons with HIV infection or severe immunodeficiency who have dirty wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus vaccinations. ‡ People with HIV infection or severe immunodeficiency who have dirty wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunizations. § Yes, if ≥ 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine dose.

### Notes from the field: tetanus in an unvaccinated child-Oregon, 2017 [^112Zg25j]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Tetanus is an acute neuromuscular disease caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. Bacterial spores found in soil can enter the body through skin disruption, with subsequent onset of clinical illness ranging from 3 to 21 days (usually within 8 days). In 2017, a boy aged 6 years who had received no immunizations sustained a forehead laceration while playing outdoors on a farm; the wound was cleaned and sutured at home. Six days later, he had episodes of crying, jaw clenching, and involuntary upper extremity muscle spasms, followed by arching of the neck and back (opisthotonus) and generalized spasticity. Later that day, at the onset of breathing difficulty, the parents contacted emergency medical services, who air-transported him directly to a tertiary pediatric medical center. The boy subsequently received a diagnosis of tetanus and required approximately 8 weeks of inpatient care, followed by rehabilitation care, before he was able to resume normal activities.

Upon hospital arrival, the child had jaw muscle spasms (trismus). He was alert and requested water but was unable to open his mouth; respiratory distress caused by diaphragmatic and laryngeal spasm necessitated sedation, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Tetanus immune globulin (3,000 units) and diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) were administered for presumed tetanus. He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and cared for in a darkened room with ear plugs and minimal stimulation (stimulation increased the intensity of his spasms). Intravenous metronidazole was initiated, and the scalp laceration was irrigated and debrided.

His opisthotonus worsened, and he developed autonomic instability (hypertension, tachycardia, and body temperatures of 97.0°F–104.9°F [36.1°C–40.5°C]). He was treated with multiple continuous intravenous medication infusions to control his pain and blood pressure, and with neuromuscular blockade to manage his muscle spasms. A tracheostomy was placed on hospital day 5 for prolonged ventilator support. Starting on hospital day 35, the patient tolerated a 5-day wean from neuromuscular blockade. On day 44, his ventilator support was discontinued, and he tolerated sips of clear liquids. On day 47, he was transferred to the intermediate care unit. Three days later, he walked 20 feet with assistance. On day 54, his tracheostomy was removed, and 3 days later, he was transferred to a rehabilitation center for 17 days.

The case of a 79-year-old woman with neurotoxin producing Clostridium tetani identified in a lower limb laceration that was promptly treated is presented; the patient developed no symptoms of tetanus. Her antibody levels were measured as 0.01 U/ml (protective levels > 0.01 U/ml) and were therefore not protective. The isolate of C tetani was identified by 16S sequencing. The potential to produce tetanus toxin was determined by detection of a fragment of the C tetani neurotoxin gene. She was given a week long course of oral flucloxacillin, 500 mg four times a day and metronidazole, 400 mg three times a day, for 5 days. The patient was subsequently given prophylactic immunoglobulin (500 IU) as per guidelines. The fact that the patient did not manifest any symptoms of localised or generalised tetanus could be attributed to prompt management when she presented to her primary care site.

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults (1,2). After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines (3).

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1156pidi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Over 90% of tetanus deaths occur in South/South East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, C. tetani is distributed worldwide, with 32–92 cases diagnosed each year in the European Union/European Economic Area; 17–33 in the USA; and 4–11 in the UK. Despite being notifiable, a study of hospital records from 2001–2014 suggested that cases in England were under-reported by 88%. There appears to be seasonality in Europe, with highest incidence in July, and a second peak in October. This likely reflects increased outdoor activity, which carries risks of skin breaks and wound contamination.

WHO has recommended universal childhood tetanus toxoid vaccination since 1974. Serial vaccination is key. This induces a potent IgG response; antibodies are transmitted transplacentally and vaccinating girls therefore prevents neonatal tetanus. Primary immunisation with a three-dose regimen provides near-total protection against clinical disease, maintained for at least 5 years. Children in Britain receive a primary course at 2, 3, and 4 months, with pre-school and teenage booster doses. This five-dose regimen is probably sufficient to confer lifelong immunity, though WHO recommends six, and global booster schedules vary.

As of 2022, 92% of children in the UK were fully vaccinated, similar to other high-income anglophone countries. However, there is no herd immunity, and with growing concerns about parental vaccine hesitancy, and interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, inquiring about childhood vaccination status is crucial. Conflict and natural disasters can also affect vaccination coverage, even in countries with historically robust programmes.

Major risk factors for tetanus include advanced age, injecting drug use, and diabetes mellitus. Sporadic tetanus outbreaks in the UK have been linked to contaminated heroin. Older individuals are at particular risk; they are more likely to have been born before the rollout of universal childhood vaccination, and vaccine-induced antibody levels diminish with age. Cases are more frequent in men, reflecting unsafe circumcision practices, and lower vaccination rates due to WHO's maternal vaccination focus.

Open fractures — tetanus prophylaxis and operative timing/soft-tissue management: Tetanus toxoid should be administered if the patient had an incomplete primary immunization, if it has been > 10 years since his or her last booster dose, or if the immunization history is unknown or unclear, and tetanus immunoglobulin should be administered if it has been > 10 years since the patient's last booster dose or if he or she has a history of incomplete primary immunization. Patients with open fractures should be taken to the operating room for irrigation and debridement within 24 hours of initial presentation whenever possible, with severe fractures associated with gross wound contamination brought to the operating room more quickly and as soon as clinically feasible based on the patient's condition and resources available. Whenever possible, skin defects overlying open fractures should be closed at the time of initial debridement. Soft tissue coverage should be completed within seven days of injury for open fractures associated with wounds requiring skin grafting or soft tissue transfers.

Recommendations 10b

At first receiving hospital: on arrival the following burn wound care is recommended:

- Cool burn wound if less than 3 h since injury with (running) potable/drinking water if available (avoid hypothermia).
- Provide analgesia to patient.
- Re-triage patient (on-arrival triage).
- Clean wound /scrub.
- Re-estimate TBSA.
- Determine burn depth.
- Confirm site of burn.
- Re-assess for other injuries including inhalational injury.
- Re-triage after wound clean/scrub (definitive triage).
- Confirm tetanus status (and give booster and/or Immunoglobulin if indicated).
- Determine appropriate dressing.

At the first receiving hospital: recommendations for:

the early management of inhalational injury include:

- Sit patient up if no suspicion of other trauma injuries (i.e. burn injuries only);
- Avoid excess fluid;
- Consider early intubation and ventilation.

Patients with < 20% TBSA and no 'special area' burns
- Consider early discharge with out-patient follow up if < 20% TBSA and superficial /partial thickness or non-special area burns.
- Ensure adequate out-patient support for those discharged (e.g. wound care, social and community support and clear care pathway communicated).

Patients with > 20% TBSA and/or deep dermal or 'special area' burns
- Patients should be reviewed by an experienced burn clinician.
- Such patients are likely to benefit from on-going in-patient care.
- Ensure comprehensive documentation of TBSA estimation, burn depth and burn site in addition to standard clinical history and examination.
- Patients with burns in 'special areas' such as across/near joints, hands, face or feet, and those with large burns to benefit from grafting and subsequent scar management, should be reviewed by a rehabilitation specialist.

Immediate first aid for burn injury influences the clinical course and severity of the burn. Basic first aid should include cooling, pain relief, cleaning and application of a simple clean dressing to the burn wound. Cooling of the burn wound should occur up to three hours after the injury was sustained and thus can be continued from scene into the first receiving hospital. Evidence has demonstrated benefit in burn care, and a reduction in future complications, from both good effective basic first aid delivered by first responders and in the cooling of a burn within this 3 hour time period.

First aid treatment should continue from scene to first receiving health facility.

### Pharmacological management of tetanus: an evidence-based review [^112qCxnp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is becoming rarer in both industrialized and developing nations due to an effective vaccination program. In 2010, the World Health Organization estimated there was a 93% reduction in newborns dying from tetanus worldwide, compared to the situation in the late 1980s. Due to its rarity, many diagnostic delays occur as physicians may not consider the diagnosis until the manifestations become overt. Without timely diagnosis and proper treatment, severe tetanus is fatal (mortality is also influenced by the comorbidities of the patient). The principles of treating tetanus are: reducing muscle spasms, rigidity and autonomic instability (with ventilatory support when necessary); neutralization of tetanus toxin with human antitetanus immunoglobulin or equine antitetanus sera; wound debridement; and administration of antibiotics to eradicate locally proliferating bacteria at the wound site. It is difficult to conduct trials on different treatment modalities in tetanus due to both logistical and ethical reasons. However, it is imperative that physicians are aware of the best evidence-based treatment strategies currently available to improve the outcome of patients. This review concentrates on analyzing the current evidence on the pharmacological management of tetanus.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^114ZLqsH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Currently a rarity in high-income countries, tetanus is a diagnosis not to miss. Deaths from tetanus fell by almost 90% between 1990 and 2019, largely reflecting the success of WHO's Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination campaign. However, deaths among children and adults have plateaued, and tetanus remains an important vaccine-preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, notably in southern Asia, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Tetanus results from infections with spore-forming Clostridium tetani bacteria, usually acquired via contaminated wounds and burns. C tetani releases a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle spasms, rigidity, and dysautonomia. Important complications include laryngeal spasm and resultant airway obstruction and respiratory arrest, nosocomial infections, and sequelae of prolonged immobility. Tetanus is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, but microbiological tests can serve as useful adjuncts. Treatment is multifaceted, requiring source control, antibiotic therapy, and antitoxin administration. With prolonged, quality intensive care, many patients survive with good functional outcome. However, due to challenges in leveraging routinely-collected health-care data and performing high-quality trials in resource-constrained settings, several key questions remain unanswered and optimal treatment strategies are contested. In this Review, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of global tetanus epidemiology, its clinical features and differential diagnosis, principles of management, and prognosis.

Introduction

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults. After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines.

### A 4-year review of human bite injuries presenting to emergency medicine and proposed evidence-based guidelines [^1169mWXG]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Human bite injuries are a common injury, roughly accounting for around 0.1% of attendances to Emergency Medicine departments. Morbidities associated with such injuries are legion. Of paramount importance is the potential for infection of the wound site, both bacterial and viral. A retrospective 4-year review of 3136 case notes was conducted, identifying 421 human bites. This amounts to one every 3 days! The majority of those bitten were young males (male:female ratio = 3:1; 44% comprising the age group 16–25 years). The management of these wounds was found to be poor. 17% of patients did not receive any antibiotic cover; 21% of patients either did not have tetanus prophylaxis administered when required or had a tetanus booster when they were already covered; 34% of patients either did not receive a hepatitis B booster when one was required or received one when they were already covered. This lack of effective documentation, along with errors in addressing prophylaxis of the infective agents, may have profound medico-legal consequences. The author believes that the findings will be reproduced in other centres and in view of the inadequacies highlighted by this work, it is necessary to introduce an evidence-based protocol for the comprehensive management of the human bite. Using United Kingdom Department of Health evidence-based guidelines, the author proposes such a pathway.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^115Brqeo]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

In 2013, ACIP did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap; the rationale was described in previously published guidance. In 2019, ACIP again concluded that in light of the higher cost of Tdap relative to Td and uncertainty about the impact that receipt of multiple Tdap doses would have on pertussis control and transmission, there continues to be insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend that Tdap replace Td. However, given the reassuring safety profile and evidence of widespread use of Tdap in place of Td, to allow providers more flexibility, either Tdap or Td was recommended for use in situations when previously only Td was recommended. ACIP recommends that either Td or Tdap be used for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and for additional required doses in the catch-up immunization schedule if a person has received at least 1 Tdap dose.

### Adverse reactions to vaccines practice parameter 2012 update [^113RwPMt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines and Tdap — About 5% of immunizations cause large local swelling at the injection site. The recommended interval between doses of Td had been 10 years, but a recent study showed the rate of Tdap injection-site reactions was the same in patients who had received Td less than 2 years previously or more than 2 years previously, and another study found no higher rates when a Tdap-containing vaccine was administered 1 month after a Td-containing vaccine or placebo. With the pertussis disease burden continuing to be substantial, it is now recommended that Tdap be given to all adolescents and adults (including those ≥ 65 years of age), regardless of the interval since the last Td.

### Vaccines for women age 50 and older [^116EVodp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td) Toxoid Boosters

Tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid are excellent immunogens. The primary vaccination series in childhood provides high-level protection and induces long-lasting immunologic memory, as evidenced by an anamnestic antibody response to Td after intervals of > 30 years. High levels of primary vaccination and appropriate wound care (including Td boosters) are the cornerstones of tetanus prevention in the United States. The current recommendation that all adults in the United States receive Td boosters every 10 years has been poorly implemented, as evidenced by serosurveys showing that most adults > 50 years of age lack protective levels of antibodies to either tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or both. Despite this high level of serosusceptibility, tetanus (≈30 cases/y) and diphtheria (0–3 cases/y) are rare diseases and almost always occur in persons who never completed the full schedule of childhood vaccinations. Cost and benefit studies favor a policy of a single mid-life Td booster for persons who have completed the full pediatric series, and several advisory groups have recommended a booster at 50 years of age as an alternative to the current standard of decennial boosters. Consideration of reducing the frequency of Td boosters will be complicated by the proposed addition of the acellular pertussis vaccine to the adult Td formulation, as it is more costly and induces a shorter duration of antibody response than Td.

### Clinical guidance for wound management to prevent… [^113BmGCo]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The best ways to prevent tetanus are vaccination and wound management.
- Tetanus vaccination and TIG prophylaxis may be indicated depending on the wound type and patient's vaccination history.
- Antibiotics aren't recommended during wound care to protect against tetanus.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Recommendations Healthcare providers should take the following steps to prevent tetanus:

- Assess the wound and provide appropriate wound care.
- Assess the need for tetanus vaccination and provide if indicated.
- Assess the need for prophylactic tetanus immune globulin and provide if indicated. Wound assessment and care Appropriate wound care consists of
- Assessing the type of wound
- Observing for signs of infection
- Properly treating infected wounds.

Tetanus vaccination status evaluation Vaccination not recommended Regardless of wound type, no tetanus vaccination is needed if the patient meets both criteria below:

- Received last tetanus vaccination less than 5 years ago
- Completed the primary vaccine series. Vaccination recommended For all wounds
- People with an unknown vaccination history
- Unvaccinated people
- People with an incomplete tetanus primary series For clean and minor wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 10 or more years ago. For dirty or major wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 5 or more years ago. TIG assessment TIG contains antibodies against tetanus toxin and functions as an antitoxin. TIG can provide temporary protection against tetanus by directly binding and neutralizing circulating toxin. TIG cannot neutralize toxin that's already bound to nerve endings.

TIG prophylaxis indications For clean and minor wounds TIG is never indicated for clean and minor wounds. For dirty or major wounds
- People with an unknown tetanus vaccination history
- People who have never received tetanus vaccines
- People with an incomplete tetanus vaccine primary series
- People with HIV
- People with a severe immunodeficiency. Care If indicated, administer 250 international units of TIG intramuscularly. TIG is commercially available for purchase. CDC doesn't stockpile or supply TIG.

Background and Epidemiology of Tetanus

Tetanus is a life-threatening but vaccine-preventable disease caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. The organism is a ubiquitous, spore-forming, motile Gram-positive bacillus found in high concentrations in soil and animal excrement. C. tetani spores enter the body through breaches in the skin or mucous membranes. Germination of C. tetani spores occurs under anaerobic conditions, such as in necrotic tissue that can result from deep puncture wounds or blunt trauma. C. tetani bacilli vegetate and produce tetanospasmin, a powerful exotoxin that binds irreversibly with neural tissue and causes spasms and rigidity of skeletal muscles. Direct person-to-person transmission of C. tetani does not occur.

The incubation period from injury to symptom onset varies from 3 to 21 days (median: 7 days), with extremes of 1 day to several months. The incubation period depends on the severity and site of the wound. Shorter incubation periods are associated with more severe disease and a poorer prognosis; longer incubation periods are associated with injuries furthest from the central nervous system. The course of disease is variable but is usually intense for ≥ 4 weeks before subsiding. The convalescent period is usually protracted and long-term neurologic sequelae and intellectual and behavioral abnormalities might follow recovery. The case-fatality ratio for tetanus is highest in infants and the elderly, and can be as high as 100% without high-quality medical care, but is approximately 10%–20% even in modern health care facilities.

### A pediatric level III trauma center experience with dog bite injuries [^112W4r5L]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Dog bite injuries often present to Emergency Departments (ED), and between 2001 and 2003, approximately 4.5 million adults and children were injured. Injuries may range from puncture wounds to deep tissue lacerations or avulsions. Deaths have been described. Our objective was to describe dog bite injuries, the overall location of injuries, and need for vaccination among children who presented to a Pediatric ED designated as a level III trauma center with a robust facial surgical infrastructure. This was a 6-year retrospective study. Charts were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for lacerations or injuries secondary to animal bites and accessing the hospital's trauma database. Variables abstracted were age, sex, type of injury, location, need for antibiotics, immunization states and requirement of tetanus or rabies vaccine, disposition from ED to the operating room, home, or any in-patient unit. We excluded children older than 17 years of age and children who had a post-bite injury infection or injury not initially managed in our facility or medical system. The final cohort consisted of 152 children. The median age was 52 months and age ranged from 2 to 215 months. Children with a single bite injury were older when compared with those with numerous injuries, 81 and 62 months of age, respectively. Among young children, 75% of injuries occurred above the neck and 15.1% were managed in the operating room. Twenty-four percent of children required either a tetanus or rabies vaccination. Most dog bite injuries occurred to facial structures. Comprehensive care of dog victims included awareness of both dog and injured child vaccination status.

### Management of traumatic wounds in the emergency department: position paper from the Academy of Emergency Medicine and Care (AcEMC) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) [^115daQjF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

STATEMENT 3 Antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e. a preventive administration of an antibiotic before the emergence of an infection with the aim to prevent it). It is desirable to implement prophylactic antibiotics in selected cases of wounds at high risk of infection. 3A. Avoid antibiotic prophylaxis in a not macroscopically contaminated wound, well vascularized, at low risk of infection (according to statements 2). 3B. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in grossly contaminated wounds and in cases at high risk of infection (according to statement 2) depending on the epidemiological criteria of antibiotic resistance in the area. In high risk wounds (all three variables considered) the EP should explain clearly the reason for avoiding the antibiotic administration.

STATEMENT 4 The assessment of tetanus immunization status in every traumatic wounded patient who arrive in the ED is desirable. 5A. All traumatic wounds are potentially at risk for tetanus infection 5B. The assessment of tetanus immunization status of patients should be performed through a thorough history and consultation of documentation confirming vaccination/booster, and eventually using a diagnostic quick test in doubtful cases. 5C. The following items should be considered as "doubtful" (i.e. cases for which it is not possible to determine the immunization status of the patient): Patient who does not remember the date of the last booster; Patient unconscious, intoxicated or cognitively impaired; Patient who does not understand your language; Patient who, presumably, has never carried out a complete vaccination course. 5D. Access to vaccination data and the availability of a rapid diagnostic test for assessing the status of tetanus immunization permit to streamline costs and to act with greater appropriateness.

### Staged flexor tendon reconstruction fingertip to palm [^114cwViu]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Thirty-five fingertip to palm staged flexor tendon reconstructions were performed between 1971 and 1998. Tendon injuries involved 5 avulsions and 30 lacerations, 9 of which had failed primary tenorrhaphies. Follow-up evaluation averaged 30 months. Thirteen patients had total active motion (TAM) of ≥ 220 degrees (excellent), 11 patients had TAM of 200 degrees to 219 degrees (good), 7 patients had TAM of 180 degrees to 199 degrees (fair), and 4 patients had TAM of < 180 degrees (poor). Less favorable results occurred in those with a > 1-year interval between injury and stage I, in those with a > 6-month interval between stage I and stage II, and in those with a higher injury severity classification. Fingertip to palm staged flexor tendon reconstruction produced 69% good to excellent results. This technique allows the use of the injured digit profundus as the motor, preserves lumbrical function, and requires less tendon graft length (palmaris longus usually suffices).
