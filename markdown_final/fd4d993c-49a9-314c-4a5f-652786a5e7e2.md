## Question

Which drugs are most likely to cause catatonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which drugs are most likely to cause catatonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entities that count as "drug-induced catatonia". Then, I should verify which medication classes and specific agents have the strongest evidence for causation. Next, I will quantify risk where possible and consider modifiers like potency, dose, and timing. After that, I should distinguish antipsychotic-induced catatonia from withdrawal catatonia and malignant catatonia/NMS. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list and outline immediate management implications, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities that qualify as drug-induced catatonia. I need to ensure I include antipsychotic-induced catatonia, withdrawal catatonia, and the overlap with malignant catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, because these are the principal iatrogenic contexts in which catatonia emerges and are repeatedly emphasized in contemporary guidelines and reviews [^4aab87a1] [^a18b5414] [^273900a8].

> Next, I should review which medication classes have the most consistent causal signal. Antipsychotics are the clearest culprits, with both first-generation and second-generation agents implicated, and guidelines explicitly warn that antipsychotics can precipitate or worsen catatonia and increase NMS risk in susceptible patients, so I need to keep both mechanism and clinical context in mind [^4aab87a1] [^473bef33] [^af7589a8].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative risk between first- and second-generation antipsychotics. A large pharmacovigilance analysis using VigiBase found that FGAs had a higher reporting odds ratio for catatonia than SGAs, with haloperidol and molindone showing particularly elevated signals, which supports the clinical impression that high-potency FGAs carry greater risk, although this is observational and susceptible to reporting bias, so I should be cautious in overinterpreting absolute risk [^ca3a6a15].

> I will now examine withdrawal catatonia, because this is a distinct and important mechanism. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is a well-documented cause of catatonia, typically after chronic use with abrupt discontinuation, and the pathophysiology plausibly relates to GABA-A receptor downregulation leading to a GABA-deficient state; clinically, reinstituting benzodiazepines is often rapidly effective, which reinforces causality in these cases [^9b36d124] [^d7b0b5c5].

> Hold on, I should verify clozapine-specific withdrawal catatonia. Multiple reviews and case series indicate that clozapine withdrawal can precipitate catatonia within days to two weeks after discontinuation, and unlike other antipsychotics, clozapine has repeated signals for withdrawal catatonia; importantly, reinstituting clozapine is often the most effective intervention, while benzodiazepines may be less effective than in benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, which I need to remember when advising on management [^9b36d124] [^c9c4674b] [^067abd16].

> Let me consider malignant catatonia and its relationship to antipsychotics. Malignant catatonia shares features with NMS and can be triggered or worsened by dopamine blockade; historical series suggest very high mortality when antipsychotics are continued, and contemporary guidance recommends withholding antipsychotics in suspected malignant catatonia and prioritizing benzodiazepines and ECT, which underscores the iatrogenic contribution in this subtype [^7de6082b] [^498db820].

> I should double-check the timing and dose-context for antipsychotic-induced catatonia. Case-based literature and systematic reviews indicate that catatonia can emerge within hours of initiation, during dose escalation, or with antipsychotic switches, and that both monotherapy and polypharmacy contexts are reported; high-potency FGAs and combinations seem to increase risk, though precise incidence estimates are lacking and likely vary by population and ascertainment [^273900a8] [^4cd9a555].

> But wait, what if other drug classes are implicated. I need to check for non-antipsychotic, non-benzodiazepine causes. While the strongest and most consistent signals remain with antipsychotics and withdrawal from GABAergic agents, isolated case reports describe catatonia in association with dopamine-depleting agents, antiemetics with dopamine blockade, and even serotonergic toxicity, though these are less well established and should be interpreted as possible but unconfirmed associations rather than high-certainty causes [^af7589a8] [^52e2f799].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list, keeping the strength of evidence in mind. First, high-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol, fluphenazine, and molindone carry the most consistent and highest signal for antipsychotic-induced catatonia and should be considered highest risk when initiating or escalating therapy, especially in patients with prior catatonia or low serum iron [^ca3a6a15] [^473bef33]. Second, second-generation antipsychotics can still precipitate catatonia, though the signal is lower than with FGAs, and risk appears to rise with rapid titration, high dose, or polypharmacy, so I should avoid assuming SGAs are "safe" in this regard [^273900a8] [^4cd9a555]. Third, benzodiazepine withdrawal after chronic use is a well-established cause and should be high on the differential when catatonia follows recent benzodiazepine cessation [^9b36d124] [^d7b0b5c5]. Fourth, clozapine withdrawal is uniquely associated with catatonia and warrants early recognition and clozapine reinitiation when feasible [^c9c4674b] [^067abd16].

> Hold on, I should verify immediate management implications because causation guides treatment. In suspected antipsychotic-induced catatonia, the offending antipsychotic should generally be discontinued or the dose minimized, benzodiazepines should be initiated promptly with lorazepam as first-line and titrated aggressively if needed, and ECT should be considered early for severe, malignant, or benzodiazepine-refractory cases; in clozapine withdrawal catatonia, reinstituting clozapine is prioritized, and in benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, reinstituting benzodiazepines is typically effective, which aligns with guideline-based care and the pathophysiology of GABA hypoactivity [^4cd9a555] [^d58b6d8d] [^074ed367] [^c9c4674b].

> In summary, I need to ensure my bottom line is precise: the drugs most likely to cause catatonia are antipsychotics, with first-generation high-potency agents carrying the highest risk, followed by second-generation antipsychotics, and withdrawal from GABAergic agents — particularly benzodiazepines and clozapine — as distinct, mechanism-linked precipitants; malignant catatonia represents a life-threatening continuum where antipsychotics can worsen outcomes, so early recognition, removal of the offending agent, and initiation of benzodiazepines and/or ECT are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^ca3a6a15] [^4aab87a1] [^7de6082b].

---

The drugs most likely to cause catatonia are **first-generation antipsychotics** (especially haloperidol, fluphenazine, and chlorpromazine) [^ca3a6a15] and **second-generation antipsychotics** (notably clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) [^273900a8]. Benzodiazepine withdrawal [^9b36d124] and clozapine withdrawal [^c9c4674b] are also well-documented triggers. Antipsychotic-induced catatonia can occur within hours to days of initiation or dose change, and risk is higher with rapid titration, high doses, or polypharmacy [^notfound]. Management includes immediate discontinuation of the offending agent, benzodiazepines as first-line therapy [^200a9e4c], and electroconvulsive therapy for refractory or severe cases [^074ed367].

---

## Antipsychotic-induced catatonia

Antipsychotic-induced catatonia (AIC) is a recognized adverse effect of both first- and second-generation antipsychotics, with **first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs)** carrying a higher risk than second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) [^ca3a6a15]. The risk is further increased with rapid titration, high doses, or polypharmacy [^notfound].

---

### First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs)

Among FGAs, **haloperidol** has the highest reported risk of catatonia, with a reporting odds ratio (ROR) of 3.8 (95% CI 3.5–4.0) in pharmacovigilance data [^ca3a6a15]. Other high-risk FGAs include fluphenazine and chlorpromazine [^notfound]. Catatonia typically manifests within hours to days of initiation or dose escalation, presenting with stupor, mutism, rigidity, and posturing [^4cd9a555].

---

### Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs)

SGAs have a lower risk than FGAs, but **clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone** have documented associations with catatonia [^273900a8]. Clozapine-induced catatonia is particularly notable and may occur during initiation, dose escalation, or withdrawal [^c9c4674b]. SGAs can also precipitate malignant catatonia, a life-threatening variant characterized by hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and elevated creatine kinase [^7de6082b].

---

## Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia

Benzodiazepine withdrawal is a well-established cause of catatonia, particularly after **chronic use and abrupt discontinuation** [^9b36d124]. The pathophysiology involves GABAergic hypoactivity due to receptor downregulation, leading to catatonic symptoms [^d7b0b5c5]. Clinical features include stupor, mutism, rigidity, and autonomic instability [^notfound]. Management involves reinstitution of benzodiazepines and supportive care [^074ed367].

---

## Clozapine withdrawal-induced catatonia

Clozapine withdrawal catatonia is a distinct clinical entity, typically occurring within **7–14 days of abrupt discontinuation** [^f9d96561]. The pathophysiology is thought to involve GABAergic dysregulation and receptor adaptations unique to clozapine [^60c56301]. Symptoms include severe psychomotor retardation, mutism, rigidity, and autonomic instability [^notfound]. Management includes reinstitution of clozapine and, if necessary, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) [^c9c4674b].

---

## Clinical risk factors and precipitating factors

Several factors increase the risk of **drug-induced catatonia**:

- **Rapid titration or high doses**: Particularly with FGAs and clozapine [^notfound].
- **Polypharmacy**: Combination of antipsychotics or antipsychotics with other psychotropics [^notfound].
- **Individual susceptibility**: History of catatonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), or movement disorders [^2748c7d5].
- **Medical comorbidities**: Encephalitis, autoimmune disorders, metabolic disturbances [^e666e239].

---

## Management strategies

Management of drug-induced catatonia follows a structured approach:

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop the offending antipsychotic or benzodiazepine [^5ca1dcfa] [^074ed367].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Lorazepam is first-line, with doses titrated up to 16–24 mg/day if necessary [^200a9e4c] [^44cf75b2].
- **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)**: Indicated for refractory cases, malignant catatonia, or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated [^074ed367] [^498db820].
- **Supportive care**: Monitor for complications such as dehydration, pneumonia, and thromboembolism [^ed6513d3].

## Summary of drugs most likely to cause catatonia

| **Drug class** | **Specific drugs** | **Risk level** |
|-|-|-|
| First-generation antipsychotics | Haloperidol, fluphenazine, chlorpromazine | High |
| Second-generation antipsychotics | Clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone | Moderate |
| Benzodiazepines | Withdrawal from chronic use | High |
| Clozapine | Withdrawal | High |

---

Antipsychotics — particularly **first-generation agents** — are the drugs most likely to cause catatonia, with benzodiazepine and clozapine withdrawal also significant triggers. Risk is modulated by dose, titration, and patient factors, and management centers on stopping the culprit drug, using benzodiazepines, and employing ECT when needed.

Research priorities

One general point for future research is that there is a need to harmonise definitions of catatonia and definitions of specific catatonic signs, as well as thresholds for making a diagnosis.

As this guideline has highlighted, the most urgent research goal for catatonia is to develop a more robust evidence base for its treatment. Despite the wealth of small reports and observational data, a Cochrane systematic review of the use of benzodiazepines for catatonia found that no RCT met its inclusion criteria. Although some might consider an RCT infeasible in catatonia, the Cochrane review found several examples. Unfortunately, though, these studies had methodological issues, introducing questions of validity. Conducting clinical trials in catatonia is an important priority for psychiatric research in the next decade.

In the meantime, there is substantial scope to improve the quality of evidence for the treatment of catatonia by using large databases of electronic healthcare records with prescribing data. Additional measures to improve the evidence base would include harmonising the outcomes used in research studies by developing a set of core outcomes. This would facilitate pooling of data across research centres, which is an important tool in researching less common conditions.

We provide a list of priority research questions in Table 11.

### Catatonia: diagnosis, classification, and treatment [^60fa2d53]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Catatonia is a distinct neuropsychiatric syndrome that is becoming more recognized clinically and in ongoing research. It occurs with psychiatric, metabolic, or neurologic conditions. It may occur in many forms, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Treatment with benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy leads to a dramatic and rapid response, although systematic, randomized trials are lacking. An important unresolved question is the role of antipsychotic agents in treatment and their potential adverse effects.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^4aab87a1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology developed an evidence-based consensus guideline on the management of catatonia. A group of international experts from a wide range of disciplines was assembled. Evidence was gathered from existing systematic reviews and the primary literature. Recommendations were made on the basis of this evidence and were graded in terms of their strength. The guideline initially covers the diagnosis, aetiology, clinical features and descriptive epidemiology of catatonia. Clinical assessments, including history, physical examination and investigations are then considered. Treatment with benzodiazepines, electroconvulsive therapy and other pharmacological and neuromodulatory therapies is covered. Special regard is given to periodic catatonia, malignant catatonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and antipsychotic-induced catatonia. There is attention to the needs of particular groups, namely children and adolescents, older adults, women in the perinatal period, people with autism spectrum disorder and those with certain medical conditions. Clinical trials were uncommon, and the recommendations in this guideline are mainly informed by small observational studies, case series and case reports, which highlights the need for randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies in this area.

### Catatonia and its treatment [^9c6a990a]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Psychiatric diagnoses are currently categorized on a syndromic basis. The syndrome of catatonia, however, remains in a diagnostic limbo, acknowledged predominantly as a subtype of schizophrenia. Yet, catatonia is present in about 10% of acutely ill psychiatry patients, only a minority of whom have schizophrenia. Among those with comorbid affective disorders, who comprise the largest subgroup of catatonic patients, the catatonic signs typically resolve dramatically and completely with benzodiazepine therapy. Those with schizophrenia respond less reliably, suggesting that the underlying processes causing the catatonia may be different in this group. The majority of patients with catatonia have concurrent psychosis. Failure to treat the catatonia before institution of antipsychotic medication may increase the risk of inducing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. At this point of time, the pathobiology of catatonia is unknown; the major reason for considering catatonia as a separate diagnostic entity would be to increase recognition of this eminently treatable neuropsychiatric syndrome.

Treatment

General approach

The evidence base for the treatment of catatonia is not extensive. Several RCTs have been conducted, but they have usually been at high risk of bias, inadequately reported, using outdated treatments or applicable to only a small subset of patients with catatonia. One systematic review found only four studies that had more than 50 participants. Nonetheless, where there is converging evidence from multiple sources, some clinically relevant inferences can be made.

Many treatments for catatonia are unlicensed applications for licensed medicines. Relevant guidance on this issue has been produced by the General Medical Council, the Royal College of Psychiatrists in association with the BAP, and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. While this guidance recommends that prescribing should usually be within a product's licence, it is recognised that there are situations in which prescribing off-licence is appropriate. Beyond the common standards for good prescribing, it is advised to use licensed medications in preference where appropriate, to be familiar and satisfied with evidence for safety and efficacy, to seek advice where necessary, giving sufficient information to patients, to inform patients that a medicine is being used outside its licence, to take consent or to document where this is not possible, to start at a low dose and to inform other professionals that the medicine is being used off-licence.

There are two distinct aspects to treating catatonia: specific treatments for catatonia per se and treatments for the disorder(s) underlying catatonia, where identified. While employing either one of these approaches may be effective in some cases, there are many cases where using either one of these strategies alone fails but using the other or a combination of the two is successful. In addition, consideration must be given to the prevention and management of the medical complications of catatonia.

Regarding specific circumstances for catatonia, more specifically with respect to patients with antipsychotic-induced catatonia, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate antipsychotics at a low dose, titrate gradually, and closely monitor for side effects when catatonia is treated but an antipsychotic is still necessary.

- Eight patients developed a syndrome marked by features of catatonia and parkinsonism while receiving high-potency neuroleptic drugs. The syndrome had a gradual onset, responded slowly to withdrawal of the neuroleptic or use of an anticholinergic agent, but seemed to respond more rapidly to amantadine.

Data extraction

We extracted data on study design, population characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis), associated symptoms, and treatment. We recorded dose and length of time using the medication or substance prior to the withdrawal event. When a dose range was given, a mean dose was calculated and used. We recorded the length of time from discontinuation until onset of catatonia. We recorded whether each episode of catatonia was associated with psychotic or autonomic symptoms. We also recorded treatments used, whether or not they were effective, and if so, the time to response.

### What clinical analysis of antipsychotic-induced catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome tells us about the links between these two syndromes: a systematic review [^273900a8]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antipsychotic-induced catatonia (AIC) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) are life-threatening adverse reactions to antipsychotic medication. We conducted a systematic review of literature following the PRISMA statement guidelines to obtain a description of these syndromes (population, context of occurrence, antipsychotic agents implicated) and draw conclusions about their links.

Methods

We searched Medline and Web of science databases from January 1951 to May 2019 (further restricted from 2000 to 2019) using search terms including "catatonia", "neuroleptic malignant syndrome" and "antipsychotic agents" for case reports, case series and analytic studies. After screening 4082 records, 410 full-text articles (describing 555 events) were assessed for eligibility. We included events of AIC and/or NMS according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) criteria and extracted data about patients' characteristics, context of occurrence, antipsychotic agent(s) involved and treatment outcomes.

Results

We included 165 events (16 AIC, 129 NMS and 20 AIC + NMS) from 144 case reports and case series. The most reported diagnosis was schizophrenia. Comorbid pre-existing conditions such as central nervous system diseases and acute medical events were common. Most of the events (63.3%) occurred during antipsychotic monotherapy. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs, 63.8%) were overall more implicated than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs, 36.2%).

Discussion

Our findings highlight that any antipsychotic medication, even SGA monotherapy prescribed at recommended dose, is at risk for these side effects. FGAs and polypharmacy seem to represent risk factors for malignant catatonia in AIC. The clinical overlap observed between AIC and NMS events in our review suggests a clinical continuum between catatonia and NMS.

### Alternative treatment strategies for catatonia: a systematic review [^918bda72]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Catatonia is a commonly encountered syndrome, affecting 10–20% of various psychiatric populations and carrying significant medical co-morbidities. However, there are few established alternative treatment strategies when benzodiazepines are ineffective and electroconvulsive therapy is unavailable.

Objective

The authors systematically review evidence for alternative treatment strategies for catatonia using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Method

The authors conducted a search of PubMed database from 1983 to August 2016 to identify articles. Eligible reports presented cases involving treatment of catatonia using modalities other than benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy.

Results

The authors identified 72 articles, comprising 98 individual cases. N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonists, anti-epileptic drugs, and atypical antipsychotic agents appeared to have the largest number of reports supporting their effectiveness and safety in treating catatonia patients.

Conclusions

Based on the case report literature, the authors propose an updated algorithm for catatonia treatment in cases where benzodiazepines fail and electroconvulsive therapy is not available.

Without a gold-standard biomarker, there can only be moderate confidence around the validity of diagnostic criteria. There is also a certain circularity to defining a syndrome based on response to benzodiazepines, then testing the same drugs as treatments. However, benzodiazepine response can perhaps be considered as a surrogate marker for some form of as yet not fully characterised pathophysiological process, although the response to benzodiazepines is not universal.

One of the more compelling pieces of evidence for a requirement of three catatonic signs derives from a cluster analysis of potential catatonic features, which distinguished patients with and without catatonia. Using this as a gold standard, the authors ascertained that a combination of at least three signs best fitted the cluster-derived catatonic syndrome. A threshold of four catatonic signs is highly specific but may miss some cases and thus have poorer sensitivity.

Definitions of different forms of catatonia are shown in Table 2.

Recommendation on the definition of catatonia

Catatonia should be diagnosed based on the presence of three or more catatonic signs, as in DSM-5-TR or ICD-11. (B)

Autism spectrum disorder

International studies over the past two decades have documented a point prevalence of catatonia ranging from 12% to 20% in individuals with autism, with onset most commonly in adolescence and early adulthood. As the US Center for Disease Control estimated an incidence of autism as 1 in 44 children, it is likely that clinicians will care for individuals with autism and catatonia. It is theorised that shared neuronal circuitry and genetic susceptibility loci exist between autism and catatonia. Catatonia often encompasses the full range of psychomotor retarded and agitated clinical features in autism, and the latter may include dangerous repetitive self-injury with high risk for severe bodily harm.

Diagnosis of catatonia in autism is complicated by the overlap in clinical features between the two conditions. Therefore, several authors have suggested that diagnosis of catatonia in autism should entail a marked change from baseline presentation. This is important because no pharmacological or neuromodulatory therapies are indicated for the core symptoms of autism.

### Sodium oxybate as a potential new treatment for catatonia… [^fe4c7a08]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

other severe health problems such as kidney failure, muscle breakdown, pneumonia, blood clots, and permanent muscle stiffness. New treatments are needed for catatonia. Currently, the only drug available for catatonia is lorazepam, which is a benzodiazepine that increases the effects of a brain chemical called GABA. significantly boosts GABA levels in the brain. This has led researchers to wonder if other methods of increasing GABA could be new treatment options. One study found that sodium oxybate might help patients with catatonia. We believe sodium oxybate could be an alternative to ECT because it is a precursor of GABA and also stimulates GABA-B receptors, which should. study to date using sodium oxybate in catatonia. If response occurs with a dose lower than 27 g /day, this dosage will be continued, which is an approach similar to the titration of lorazepam in catatonia.

Clinical assessment

History and physical examination

Studies commonly identify at least three factors or principal components of catatonia, which include hyperkinetic, hypokinetic and parakinetic (i.e. abnormal movements) phenotypes. Therefore, as a rule, catatonia should be considered as a differential diagnosis whenever a patient exhibits substantially altered levels of motor activity or abnormal behaviour, especially where it is grossly inappropriate to context.

The diagnosis of catatonia can typically be made on clinical assessment alone, even though patients with catatonia are often unable to provide a clear narrative history. Collateral sources of information should be sought to clarify potential explanations for the presenting syndrome and time course. The clinician should seek detailed information regarding the patient's medical, neurological and psychiatric history, along with exposure to or withdrawal from medications (plasma concentration measurement may be used to ascertain concordance where available), recreational substances and blood-borne or sexually transmitted infections (Table 4). It is also important to obtain a detailed family medical, neurological and psychiatric history to identify potentially specific biological vulnerability. Physical examination is also essential (Table 5).

Table 4.
Selected salient points in a history from a person with catatonia.

Table 5.
Physical examination for patients with catatonia.

The overwhelming majority of patients with catatonia are assessed within secondary care, which seems appropriate given the complexities of management and the risks to the patient. Every patient presenting with a first lifetime episode of catatonia should receive a thorough evaluation for potential underlying medical disorders with a focus on relevant neurological conditions (see section 'Aetiology'). When a patient presents with a recurrent episode of catatonia, the assessing clinician should not presume that an adequate workup was completed previously; instead, the adequacy of prior medical evaluation should be confirmed. In addition, every time a patient presents with catatonia, a medical evaluation is important to address potential complications of catatonia, as well as for care planning.

Antipsychotic-induced catatonia

Antipsychotics with strong dopamine receptor affinity in particular can lead to the development of antipsychotic-induced catatonia. Antipsychotic-induced catatonia can occur in association with FGAs and probably less frequently with SGAs, and may develop within hours after the first administration of an antipsychotic agent. Diagnosis is often complicated by a question over whether the catatonia is intrinsic to the psychiatric illness or induced by its treatment, the so-called 'catatonic dilemma'.

The incidence of and risk factors for antipsychotic-induced catatonia are currently unclear. The catatonic signs of akinesia, stupor and mutism are more often associated with antipsychotics whereas catalepsy and waxy flexibility are less common in antipsychotic-induced catatonia. More complex catatonic behavioural abnormalities, such as echolalia, echopraxia, verbigeration or Mitgehen, are not generally reported in association with antipsychotic treatment.

The primary intervention for antipsychotic-induced catatonia is discontinuation of the antipsychotic agent. In some cases, this is sufficient on its own. Other possible options are reducing the dose or switching to an antipsychotic with lower affinity for the dopamine receptors. Benzodiazepines may also be helpful. In one prospective cohort study including 18 patients with antipsychotic-induced catatonia, all were administered lorazepam, of whom 14 had complete remission and 4 had some partial response. Of the partial responders, three were administered amantadine, which was associated with a prompt recovery. Anticholinergics were ineffective in six patients before they were administered benzodiazepines. Good response to lorazepam has also been reported in other case series. Amantadine has also been reported to be helpful in a case series.

There is a lack of data on the prophylaxis of antipsychotic-induced catatonia.

Recommendations for antipsychotic-induced catatonia

When catatonia is attributed to antipsychotic administration, consider discontinuing the antipsychotic. (C)
In more severe cases or cases that do not resolve with antipsychotic discontinuation, consider a trial of a benzodiazepine. (C)
Once catatonia is treated, if an antipsychotic is still necessary, commence at a low dose and titrate gradually, closely monitoring for side effects. (S)

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^9b36d124]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms are common upon discontinuation of psychiatric medications. Catatonia, a neuropsychiatric condition proposed to be associated with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) hypoactivity due to its robust response to benzodiazepines, has been described as a withdrawal syndrome in case reports but is not a well-recognized phenomenon. The authors undertook a review of withdrawal catatonia with an aim to understand its presentation as well as the medications and psychoactive substances it is associated with. The review identified 55 cases of withdrawal catatonia, the majority of which occurred upon discontinuation of benzodiazepines (24 cases) and discontinuation of clozapine (20 cases). No other antipsychotic medications were identified as having been associated with the onset of a catatonic episode within 2 weeks following their discontinuation. Increasing GABA activity and resultant GABA receptor adaptations with prolonged use is postulated as a shared pharmacological mechanism between clozapine and benzodiazepines that underlie their association with withdrawal catatonia. The existing evidence for clozapine's activity on the GABA system is reviewed. The clinical presentations of benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia and clozapine withdrawal catatonia appear to differ and reasons for this are explored. One reason is that benzodiazepines act directly on GABA A receptors as allosteric agonists, while clozapine has more complex and indirect interactions, primarily through effects on receptors located on GABA interneurons. Another possible reason for the difference in clinical presentation is that clozapine withdrawal catatonia may also involve receptor adaptations in non-GABA receptors such as dopamine and acetylcholine. The findings from our review have implications for the treatment of withdrawal catatonia, and treatment recommendations are provided. Further research understanding the uniqueness of clozapine withdrawal catatonia among antipsychotic medication may give some insight as to clozapine's differential mechanism of action.

### Ketamine for catatonia: a novel treatment for an old clinical challenge? A systematic review of the evidence [^e54b7bf0]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Catatonia, documented since the 19th century, remains a significant challenge in terms of recognition and treatment. Over the last two decades, ketamine has brought new perspectives to psychiatry, sparking widespread interest. Concurrently, catatonia has attracted heightened scientific attention. Preliminary evidence suggests the therapeutic potential of ketamine for catatonia.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Lilacs, and Cochrane Library databases, as well as Google Scholar, for studies with ketamine or its enantiomers as intervention for catatonia, with no restrictions to underlying diagnosis, date, language, or study design.

Results

Twenty articles were included, encompassing a total of 25 catatonic patients receiving ketamine or esketamine. Predominantly female (61.9%), with a mean age of 44.4 years, patients mostly exhibited manifestations compatible with the retarded subtype of catatonia. Mood disorders were the most prevalent underlying diagnoses. Ketamine was primarily administered intravenously over a 40-minute period and in multiple-dosing schemes. Mean response and remission rates of catatonic manifestations for the whole sample were 80% and 44%, respectively, with no reports of worsening catatonic features or psychotic symptoms. Only one patient discontinued treatment due to intolerable dissociative effects.

Conclusion

Challenging the conventional contraindication of ketamine in psychotic disorders, current evidence highlights its potential efficacy, particularly in treating catatonia. Pending further research, we advocate reevaluating this contraindication, as it may offer a promising therapeutic option, especially for challenging cases. Preliminary evidence suggests potentially greater benefits for catatonic patients with underlying mood disorders compared to primary psychotic disorders.

Dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists

The use of antipsychotics is one of the most controversial areas in catatonia management. Antipsychotic medications can induce catatonia (see section 'Antipsychotic-induced catatonia') and worsen it. Catatonia is also a risk factor for NMS, a severe antipsychotic-induced movement disorder. Moreover, in some studies of catatonia, the use of antipsychotics has been associated with poor outcomes.

Nevertheless, dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists have been reported in some cases as beneficial in catatonia. This may particularly be the case in catatonic schizophrenia. There have been reports of the use of olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) theoretically would be less likely to strongly antagonise dopamine receptors making them potentially less dangerous adjunctive treatments than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in terms of NMS risk. Aripiprazole's partial agonism might balance the dopaminergic effects and be of some benefit for catatonia. A recent Cochrane review found only one RCT of antipsychotics for schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic features, and considered the evidence to be of very low quality due to a small sample size, short duration, risk of bias and other methodological issues. This RCT compared risperidone to ECT, finding greater improvement in the ECT-treated group.

Given that D 2 receptor antagonists can worsen catatonia and trigger NMS in an at-risk group, some reviews have urged caution, especially in malignant catatonia. It has also been suggested that SGAs – or an FGA with weaker dopamine receptor affinity – should be preferred. Some sources suggest that antipsychotics should only be given in catatonia if co-administered with a benzodiazepine. One review concluded that there does not seem to be evidence to support the use of SGAs in patients with catatonia without an underlying psychosis. Two small studies have suggested that low serum iron in catatonia is associated with the development of NMS, leading some to suggest that serum iron may be used in catatonia to predict those who may develop NMS, but the evidence is not of a high quality.

Recommendations on the use of GABA-ergic medications in catatonia

Where benzodiazepines are used for catatonia, available routes of administration may include oral, sublingual, IM and IV. The choice of route should be decided based on clinical appropriateness, rapidity of the required response, patient preference, local experience and availability. (S)
Where benzodiazepines are used for catatonia, lorazepam is generally the preferred agent. (S)
Where lorazepam is used for catatonia, high doses above the licensed maximum may be necessary to achieve maximal effect. An adequate trial may be considered complete when catatonia is adequately treated, titration has been stopped due to side effects or dose has reached at least 16 mg per day. (C)
Benzodiazepines for catatonia should not be stopped abruptly but rather tapered down. The speed of the taper depends on a balance of the therapeutic benefits and the risks of withdrawal effects against the possibility of dependence and the risks of long-term harm from benzodiazepines. (S)
If catatonia relapses on withdrawal of benzodiazepines, a clinician should ensure that any underlying condition has been adequately treated and a slower taper may be tried. (S)

Electroconvulsive therapy

The first patients treated with convulsive therapy, both for chemically induced seizures by Meduna in 1934 and for electrically induced seizures by Cerletti and Bini in 1938, had catatonic illnesses. Since then, governmental authorities, authors of textbooks on ECT or catatonia, and most publications discussing treatment options for catatonia endorse ECT, usually as the most effective treatment even where medications or other interventions have failed. For example, the United States FDA panel endorsed ECT for catatonia under a less restrictive Class 2 safety/efficacy designation and in the UK NICE recommends ECT for catatonia. In the UK and many other countries, there are specific legal requirements for administering ECT in a patient who is unable to consent.

Despite this extensive clinical recognition in common practice, a rigorous base of high-quality published evidence is lacking. This deficiency of RCTs arises principally from practical difficulties in conducting sham or placebo treatment arms in people who are usually severely ill with catatonia and often lack an ability to participate in informed-consent processes for such clinical trials.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

NMS is a rare and potentially lethal idiosyncratic reaction to treatment with dopamine antagonists. Like malignant catatonia, NMS involves altered consciousness with catatonia, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction. Recent reports suggest a prevalence of 0.02–0.03%, much lower than the 1–3% reported in the 1980s. Mortality has declined over the years to an average of less than 10%. Virtually, all classes of drugs that induce dopamine receptor blockade have been implicated in causing NMS, with antipsychotics that have higher affinity for the D 2 receptor posing the greatest risk. However, SGAs have also been associated with NMS, although they may result in an 'atypical' presentation with less severe or absent rigidity or hyperthermia. NMS may also occur with dopamine-blocking drugs used as antiemetics, with dopamine depleting drugs, and during dopamine agonist withdrawal. About two-thirds of cases develop within the first 1–2 weeks after drug initiation. Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific but commonly include elevated serum CK, leucocytosis and low serum iron resembling malignant catatonia.

Further research and conclusions

We conducted a comprehensive review on the phenomenon of withdrawal catatonia with a goal of identifying all medications and psychoactive substances associated with it. Clozapine and benzodiazepines were the principal agents identified. With the prevailing view that catatonia is associated with hypoactivity of the GABA system, our findings are suggestive of GABA activity being a potential pharmacological similarity between clozapine and benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines have relatively straightforward involvement with the GABA system, acting as allosteric agonists at GABA A receptors. Clozapine however has a much more complex mechanism involving action on multiple receptor systems that interface with GABA interneurons resulting in region-specific changes in serum GABA levels. Clozapine also has complex interactions with the dopamine and acetylcholine systems which have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of catatonia and its associated symptoms.

For withdrawal catatonia to occur, several years of treatment are usually required, suggesting that receptor adaptations are an important etiological component for developing withdrawal catatonia. Long-term benzodiazepine use could result in GABA A receptor downregulation. When the benzodiazepine is then abruptly discontinued, a GABA-deficient state could result in predisposing an individual to develop catatonia. Long-term clozapine use could lead to downregulation of the multiple receptors clozapine acts on that have complex and indirect interactions with the GABA system. When clozapine is then abruptly discontinued, this could also result in a GABA-deficient state leading to the development of a catatonic episode. It is the complex multireceptor effects of clozapine that explains why clozapine withdrawal catatonia was more severe and responded mainly to reinstitution with clozapine rather than benzodiazepines.

Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication of significant interest due to its unique efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The aspects of clozapine's pharmacology that underlie this unique feature are yet to be fully established. Our finding was that clozapine was the only antipsychotic to have caused withdrawal catatonia within 14 days of discontinuation. One possible reason for this is that clozapine's uniqueness as an antipsychotic is related to its effect on the GABA system. We therefore speculate that this unique aspect may also underlie clozapine's superior efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Abnormalities in the GABA system have been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia. It is possible that treatment-resistant schizophrenia is related to problems with GABA transmission that is addressed by clozapine. Further research into clozapine and its possible interaction with the GABA system is warranted, as this could have a significant impact on the development of more novel and targeted pharmaceuticals.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^f1f57e6f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Several authors have proposed that NMS represents an antipsychotic drug-induced toxic or iatrogenic subtype of malignant catatonia. Two retrospective studies of hospitalised patients meeting stringent criteria for NMS found that, in total, 42 out of 43 episodes also met DSM-IV criteria for catatonia. As mentioned in section 'Dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists', antipsychotic drugs can precipitate and worsen catatonia, while catatonia is a risk factor for NMS. Others, however, have asserted that malignant catatonia and NMS represent two distinct entities, suggesting that excited or agitated behaviour points to malignant catatonia. A prodromal phase involving agitation and affective disturbance is perhaps more common in malignant catatonia but is not universally present. However, agitation is a common feature of the psychosis preceding NMS for which antipsychotics were originally used. Prominent muscle rigidity has also been proposed as a distinguishing feature. Nonetheless, since patients with hyperactivity or psychotic features usually receive medications early in treatment, it may be difficult to know if the presence of rigidity represents NMS or drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects superimposed on malignant catatonia. Furthermore, many malignant catatonia cases in the era prior to antipsychotic therapy did present with rigidity. At a minimum, differentiating between NMS and malignant catatonia where antipsychotic medications have been used is acknowledged to be very challenging.

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^12caf380]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Another key finding of our review was that clozapine was the only antipsychotic reported to have caused withdrawal catatonia within a 2-week period following discontinuation. This finding has to be viewed in the context of clozapine making up only a relatively small proportion of all antipsychotics prescribed in the community. This brings up the question of what are the unique aspects of clozapine's pharmacology that result in it causing withdrawal catatonia when no other antipsychotic does. We hypothesize that one aspect may be clozapine's possible effect on the GABA system, a receptor system that is not typically associated with the action of other antipsychotic medications. Clozapine has been clearly demonstrated to have superior efficacy than other antipsychotics in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The reasons for this are not well understood and therefore identification of unique aspects of clozapine's pharmacology is important.

GABA activity is likely a key factor in the clinical picture of withdrawal catatonia but it would be too simplistic to view it as the only receptor system involved. While one should refrain from making conclusions from a review consisting solely of case reports, an examination of the characteristics of the catatonic episodes in the cases suggests that benzodiazepine and clozapine withdrawal catatonia are phenotypically different from one another. While increasing GABA activity may be a shared feature of clozapine and benzodiazepine activity, there are many differing aspects of their pharmacology and these differences likely underlie the observed phenotypic variations. This is further explored as we discuss proposed etiological mechanisms for each.

Aetiology

Catatonic signs are not uncommon and can occur in many psychiatric and medical disorders. The lingering nosological legacy of catatonic schizophrenia, whereby catatonia necessarily implied schizophrenia, has been laid to rest by ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR, where catatonia can now be diagnosed in the context of many different conditions. The terms 'organic' or 'secondary' catatonia have been used in the past to signify underlying medical or neurological aetiological conditions. However, the distinction between 'organic' and 'functional' is perhaps best avoided due to their differing connotations in disparate clinical settings.

Our consideration of the medical and psychiatric conditions underlying catatonia is largely based on clinical judgements in the published literature about what is likely to have led to catatonia, rather than on robust epidemiological associations. Often there is a close temporal relationship and sometimes a concomitant response to treatment. However, the literature largely rests on heterogeneous case reports and series, sometimes lacking standardised assessment. Many reports do not fulfil the Bradford Hill criteria for causation. Moreover, as prolonged or severe catatonia can, in turn, result in medical complications, it can be difficult to elucidate the cause-and-effect dilemma in some cases. However, it is hard to design studies to test for aetiological links, as there is under-detection and a lack of comprehensive investigations in many cases with catatonia. This may lead to a publication bias at both ends, with many cases going under-reported but the more dramatic ones finding favour for publication.

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^56a7c893]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

While clozapine is well-established to have antipsychotic properties, it's effect on catatonia is not fully known. There is evidence that clozapine has a unique feature among antipsychotics in improving signs and symptoms of catatonia rather than causing or worsening catatonia. This has been reported in cases of catatonia secondary to both psychiatric – and neurologicconditions. In most of these cases, clozapine was used after unsuccessful trials of the established anticationic agents benzodiazepines and ECT, supporting its potential efficacy in treatment-resistant cases of catatonia. Some of these cases involve catatonic presentations in individuals with schizophrenia, and therefore clozapine may have exerted its superior effect through treatment of the underlying psychotic illness. Clozapine was also however found to be effective in treating catatonia related to nonpsychotic illnesses in two cases of major depressive disorderand one case of traumatic brain injury. This limited evidence suggests that clozapine potentially may have some primary anticatatonic effects beyond its well-established antipsychotic properties.

Many medications used in psychiatry are associated with physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms that occur upon medication discontinuation. These withdrawal symptoms are generally characterized as rebound effects in the same physiological systems that were acted upon by the medication. Benzodiazepines, for instance, are associated with multiple patterns of withdrawal symptoms, the most common being rebound anxiety and insomnia that occurs 1−4 days after discontinuation. A less recognized withdrawal syndrome that has been associated with benzodiazepine discontinuation is withdrawal catatonia. Withdrawal catatonia has also been associated with clozapine discontinuation, as previously reported by the authorsand recently reviewed by Bilbily et al. Knowing that benzodiazepines and clozapine are both treatments for catatonia, it is possible that these cases are indicative of a phenomenon of "rebound" catatonia occurring when discontinuing medications used to treat catatonia. This would be analogous to the clinical presentations seen following the discontinuation of benzodiazepines (rebound anxiety) and antipsychotics (rebound psychosis). The aim of our review was to expand on previous reviews of sedativeand clozapinewithdrawal catatonia by ascertaining all medications and psychoactive substances that have been associated with "withdrawal catatonia". Furthermore, we were interested in determining potentially common pharmacological characteristics that may underlie this shared occurrence.

Catatonia due to a medical condition

There is evidence to suggest that in about 20% of patients with catatonia in unselected populations and more than 50% of patients with catatonia in acute medical and surgical settings there is an associated medical disorder that may be contributing to their presentation; this percentage rises to almost 80% in older patients. These figures exclude catatonic signs seen in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). There are several clinical features that suggest a higher likelihood of 'medical catatonia', and these include comorbid delirium, clinically significant autonomic disturbances, catatonic excitement, presence of the grasp reflex, pneumonia, known history of a neurological condition and history of seizures.

describes the common underlying medical disorders associated with catatonia in a systematic review of 11 studies, with inflammatory brain disorders contributing 28.8% out of a total of 302 patients. These disorders include encephalitis (most common) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), followed by neural injury (19.2%; with vascular and degenerative conditions the most common causes of injury), toxins or medications (11.6%; such as benzodiazepine withdrawal), structural brain pathology (9.6%; such as space occupying lesions) and epilepsy (9.3%), with miscellaneous disorders and states (such as hyponatremia, postpartum, renal failure and sepsis) contributing 19.5%. Unlike delirium, where metabolic and systemic disorders predominate, 68.9% of medical disorders underlying catatonia were secondary to a central nervous system (CNS)-specific disease.

### Catatonia [^a18b5414]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor, affective and cognitive-behavioural signs, which lasts from hours to days. Intensive research over the past two decades has led to catatonia being recognized as an independent diagnosis in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) since 2022. Catatonia is found in 5–18% of inpatients on psychiatric units and 3.3% of inpatients on medical units. However, in an unknown number of patients, catatonia remains unrecognized and these patients are at risk of life-threatening complications. Hence, recognizing the symptoms of catatonia early is crucial to initiate appropriate treatment to achieve a favourable outcome. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam, electroconvulsive therapy, and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists such as amantadine and memantine, are the cornerstones of catatonia therapy. In addition, dopamine-modulating second-generation antipsychotics (for example, clozapine and aripiprazole) are effective in some patient populations. Early and appropriate treatment combined with new screening assessments has the potential to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with catatonia in psychiatric and non-psychiatric settings.

Clozapine-Withdrawal-Induced Catatonia

Catatonia is a psychomotor disorder characterized by stupor, posturing, and echo phenomenaand is thought to arise due to hypoactivity of the GABAergic system. Catatonia has been reported in a subset of patients abruptly discontinued on clozapine, and whilst it is thought to occur rarely, its incidence is unknown. It has mainly been observed in patients without a history of catatonia and who have been treated with clozapine for several years, with symptoms emerging within a week of discontinuation. Catatonia is not associated with the discontinuation of other antipsychotics, but is observed following benzodiazepine withdrawal. The similarity between clozapine and benzodiazepine discontinuation precipitating catatonia suggests a possible shared pathophysiology mediated via GABA effects. While benzodiazepines are known to directly modulate the GABAergic system, prolonged use of clozapine has been shown to indirectly lead to GABA receptor adaption and a reduction in GABAergic effects.

Strategies to Reduce the Risk and Treat Clozapine-Withdrawal-Induced Catatonia

Clozapine-withdrawal-induced catatonia has not been widely studied, and support for particular treatment strategies is limited to case reports and case series. Based on indirect evidence from other clozapine withdrawal-associated symptoms, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided where possible. In situations where catatonia emerges, clozapine re-initiation is associated with the greatest symptomatic improvement. Furthermore, there is case report evidence that benzodiazepines are effective for some patients, however the effects appear to be more modest than in other causes of catatonia. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown to be effective in some case of clozapine-withdrawal-induced catatonia, however in all of the reported cases to date, clozapine re-initiation had not been attempted (table 4).

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^2d981116]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first review examining the entire spectrum of withdrawal catatonia. One main finding of our review was that the two primary medications associated with withdrawal catatonia were clozapine and the medication class of benzodiazepines. Clozapine and benzodiazepines are both known to cause withdrawal symptoms. In the case of clozapine, recognized withdrawal symptoms include rebound psychosisand rebound movement disorders including dystonias and dyskinesias. In the case of benzodiazepines, withdrawal symptoms commonly include rebound anxiety and insomnia.

This principal finding brings up the question of whether or not there may be a shared pharmacological mechanism between clozapine and benzodiazepines that underlie both these medications being associated with withdrawal catatonia. Clozapine and benzodiazepines have the structural similarity of both being based around a diazepine rings. Clozapine is in the dibenzodiazepine class, which refers to it having two benzene rings fused to a diazepine ring. Benzodiazepines contain a single benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring. There are significant structural differences between the two as well however, and the clinical significance of the structural similarities is unclear.

Drug withdrawal or discontinuation symptoms have been suggested to be a result of the pharmacological profile of a drug, its neurobiological targets and the adaptations of the body to these targets following its use. When a drug is discontinued, and eliminated from the system, the persistence of the adapted state in the absence of the drug leads to withdrawal symptoms. Therefore clozapine and benzodiazepines may share a common neurobiological target leading to the receptor changes that result in a catatonic state. We hypothesize that a commonality possibly involves the GABA system. All the medications and psychoactive substances identified to cause withdrawal catatonia have an effect on increasing activity in the GABA system. Benzodiazepines facilitate GABA activity through allosteric modulation of GABA A receptors. Clozapine increases GABA levels through effects on different receptors located on GABA interneuronsand through acting as an agonist at GABA B receptors, the evidence for which is reviewed later in the article. All of the other identified compounds in our review including alcohol, glutethimide, gabapentin, zolpidem, and GHB have been associated with increasing GABA activity as well –. Of note, there were no cases of ECT withdrawal catatonia identified, despite ECT being a treatment for catatonia that also increases GABA activity. This may be due to ECT having longer lasting effects, limiting the sudden fluctuation of GABA activity required for withdrawal symptoms to occur.

Investigations

The diagnosis of catatonia is made through clinical observation, interview and physical examination of the patient, as well as from collateral information from carers and review of the medical record, and in general is not established through clinical investigations (e.g. laboratory tests, brain imaging, EEG, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, urine drug screen). Clinical investigations should be ordered based on history and clinical examination findings, taking into consideration the overall severity of illness as well as medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses. Medical investigations are typically performed to rule out catatonia-like conditions or to understand the underlying aetiology of catatonia as this informs treatment and prognosis.

Although catatonia is not diagnosed through neuroimaging, given the large number of neurological conditions associated with catatonia (see Table 3), brain imaging is often requested as part of the medical evaluation of a patient with catatonia. A systematic review of structural and functional brain imaging in catatonia, which identified 137 case reports and 18 studies with multiple patients (pooled n = 186), found that more than 75% of cases of catatonia were associated with non-focal brain imaging abnormalities affecting several brain regions, and associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including neuroinflammatory conditions (SLE, encephalitis). The most common abnormalities in catatonia are generalised atrophy and non-specific white matter abnormalities.

Recommendations on the general approach to treating catatonia

Treatment for catatonia should be instituted quickly after identification of catatonia and it is not always necessary to await results of all investigations before commencing treatment. (D)
Prescribing outside of a product licence is often justified in catatonia, but where a prescriber does this, they should take particular care to provide information to the patient or carer and obtain consent, where possible, taking advice where necessary. (S)
Catatonia treatment should consist of specific treatment for the catatonia, treatment of any underlying disorder and prevention and management of complications of catatonia. (S)
First-line treatment for catatonia should usually consist of a trial of benzodiazepines and/or ECT, (C) but see references to special cases in 'First-line treatment' and below.
ECT should be available in any settings where catatonia may be treated, including in psychiatric and general hospitals. (S)
When deciding between benzodiazepines and ECT as a first-line treatment, consider the following factors: side effect profile, whether there is an underlying disorder that is likely to be responsive to ECT (such as depression or mania) and availability of ECT. (S)
Where benzodiazepines have not resulted in remission, ECT should be used. (B) For details of what an adequate trial of benzodiazepines consists of, see section 'GABA-ergic pharmacotherapies'.
Where catatonia has resulted from clozapine withdrawal, restart clozapine if possible and, if necessary, use ECT. (D)
Where catatonia has resulted from benzodiazepine withdrawal, restart a benzodiazepine. (D)
If catatonia is chronic and mild in the context of schizophrenia, consider a trial of clozapine. (C)
If clozapine and benzodiazepines are administered concomitantly, titrate slowly and closely monitor vital signs. (S)
Where catatonia does not respond to first-line therapy, re-evaluate the diagnosis. (D)

### Benzodiazepines for catatonia in people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses [^e95922ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Catatonia is a debilitating disorder of movement and volition associated with schizophrenia and some other mental disorders. People in a catatonic state have increased risk of secondary complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration. The mainstay of treatment has been drug therapies and electroconvulsive therapy.

Objectives

To compare the effects of benzodiazepines with other drugs, placebo or electroconvulsive therapy for people with catatonia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007) and manually searched reference lists from the selected studies.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled clinical trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We (RCG, GW) extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we would have calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

No studies could be included. We did find studies reporting no usable data that we had to exclude or assign to those awaiting assessment. These studies, although poorly reported, do illustrate that relevant studies have been undertaken, and are not impossible.

Authors' Conclusions

Studies have been justified and undertaken in the past. This justification remains as relevant as ever. Further studies with a high-quality methodology and reporting are required and it may be for countries where catatonia is seen often to take a lead in this area.

### Benzodiazepines for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses [^435d073e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Catatonia is a debilitating disorder of movement and volition associated with schizophrenia and some other mental illnesses. People with catatonia are more likely to require hospitalisation and highly supervised care than those without the disorder. They also have an increased risk of secondary complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration. The mainstay of treatment has been drug therapies and electroconvulsive therapy.

Objectives

To compare the effects of benzodiazepines with other drugs, placebo or electroconvulsive therapy for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses (SMIs).

Search Methods

We updated our previous search (28 February 2007) by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (9 November 2016; 6 February 2019). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. We also manually searched reference lists from studies selected by the search.

Selection Criteria

All controlled clinical trials that randomised people who have schizophrenia or other similar SMI and experiencing catatonia to receive benzodiazepines or another relevant treatment. We included studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported usable data. We excluded those not meeting our inclusion criteria or those not reporting usable data. We contacted authors when we required further information; and if we received no response, we put those studies aside as 'awaiting assessment'.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis using a fixed-effect model. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included study and generated a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

The searches found 130 citations, from which we could identify 22 possibly relevant studies. From these, we could only include one study. This study had a relatively small sample size of 17 participants who received lorazepam or oxazepam and were drug free for one week before the trial started. The only usable data reported by this study were clinically important change in symptoms of catatonia measured as 50% improvement on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). There was no difference in the numbers of participants showing a clinically important change in their catatonic symptoms (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.16; participants = 17; studies = 1; very low quality evidence). No data were reported for other important outcomes of hospital stay, clinically important change in satisfaction with care, global state, adverse effects or general functioningWe did find a few studies meeting our inclusion criteria but they reported no usable data. We had to exclude these. Although poorly reported, these studies do illustrate that relevant studies have been undertaken - they are not impossible to design and conduct.

Authors' Conclusions

Analysis of the results from this review, which was a head-to-head comparison of two benzodiazepine monotherapies, does not show a clear difference in effect. No data were available for benzodiazepines compared to placebo or standard care. The lack of usable data and very low quality of data available makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions and further studies with a high-quality methodology and reporting are required in order to determine more definitively the outcomes associated with benzodiazepine use in the clinical management of catatonia in persons with schizophrenia and other SMI.

### Movement disorders in catatonia [^88fa63c6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Catatonia is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by a broad range of motor, speech and behavioural abnormalities. 'Waxy flexibility', 'posturing' and 'catalepsy' are among the well-recognised motor abnormalities seen in catatonia. However, there are many other motor abnormalities associated with catatonia. Recognition of the full spectrum of the phenomenology is critical for an accurate diagnosis. Although controlled trials are lacking benzodiazepines are considered first-line therapy and N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists also appears to be effective. Electroconvulsive therapy is used in those patients who are resistant to medical therapy. An underlying cause of the catatonia should be identified and treated to ensure early and complete resolution of symptoms.

Introduction

Guideline rationale

Catatonia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder affecting movement, speech and complex behaviour, often involving autonomic and affective disturbances. It has been associated with excess morbidity and, sometimes, mortality compared to other serious mental illnesses. For much of the 20th century, catatonia was considered a subtype of schizophrenia, but, in recent decades, emerging evidence has shown that catatonia can occur in a range of psychiatric, neurological and general medical conditions. This is now reflected in both the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Edition (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), which acknowledge the existence of catatonia in a range of conditions. However, recognition of catatonia is often poor, and knowledge about the condition and its distinctive treatments is frequently limited among clinicians. There are no national UK guidelines that adequately cover the management of catatonia. The only UK guidance that mentions catatonia is the 2003 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Technology Appraisal (TA59) on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which recognises catatonia as an indication for ECT, but there is no consideration of pharmacological treatment for catatonia. From an international perspective, the European Association of Psychosomatic Medicine and the US Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry have produced guidelines for the management of the subpopulation of patients with catatonia that occurs in medically ill patients. The schizophrenia guidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics briefly mention catatonia and suggest treatment with benzodiazepines, glutamate antagonists (amantadine and memantine) or ECT. There is a clear gap in the literature for a multidisciplinary consensus guideline that comprehensively reviews the current evidence and offers treatment recommendations.

Treatment recommendations for NMS are not uniform and – in the absence of RCTs – any recommendations should be made with caution. In a prospective study of 20 NMS patients, observed that those receiving dantrolene (two patients), bromocriptine (two patients) or both (four patients) had a more prolonged course and more sequalae than those treated only with supportive care, leading the authors to question the efficacy of either agent. More recently, conducted a systematic review of 405 NMS cases comparing patients treated with dantrolene, bromocriptine and ECT with those receiving supportive care alone. Cases were defined as mild, moderate or severe using thecriteria. Across the entire sample, independent of severity levels, differences in mortality rates with specific therapies compared to supportive care alone were not statistically significant. However, in severe NMS, mortality rates proved significantly lower with each of dantrolene, bromocriptine and ECT compared to supportive care. The authors concluded that supportive care alone could be sufficient for the treatment of mild to moderate NMS, but that specific therapies were indicated for severe NMS.

A series of international guidelines for the management of schizophrenia contain certain specific recommendations for the treatment of NMS, but these are based on weak levels of evidence and do not consider all relevant treatment options.contend that expert-based treatment algorithms derived from clinical experience, numerous clinical reports and rational theories are of greater value than recommendations provided by the guidelines. These algorithms stress that the specific treatment of NMS be individualised and based on the character, duration and severity or stage of clinical features. In general, the first steps include supportive care and discontinuing dopamine blocking agents and anticholinergics. Benzodiazepines are also widely recommended as an initial intervention for patients with mild NMS characterised by mild rigidity, catatonia or confusion, temperature < 38°C, HR < 100. Trials of bromocriptine, amantadine or other dopamine agonists may be a reasonable next step in patients with moderate NMS involving prominent parkinsonian signs and temperatures in the range of 38–40°C. Dantrolene appears beneficial primarily when extreme hyperthermia (> 40°C) and severe rigidity develop. Although many patients respond to pharmacotherapy, none of the above medications have been reliably effective in all reported cases of NMS. As reviewed above, ECT may remain effective even late during treatment, as opposed to pharmacotherapies, and after pharmacotherapies have failed.

ANTIEPILEPTIC THERAPY FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER Several antiepileptic drugs are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, including valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. However, data on the fetal effects of these drugs come primarily from studies of women with seizures. It is not clear whether the underlying pathology of epilepsy contributes to the teratogenic effect of these drugs on the fetus. Exposure to valproic acid during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, craniofacial and cardiovascular anomalies, fetal growth restriction, and cognitive impairment. Carbamazepine exposure during pregnancy is associated with facial dysmorphism and fingernail hypoplasia. It is unclear whether carbamazepine use increases the risk of neural tube defects or developmental delay.

Although these drugs are superior to lithium in the treatment of patients with mixed episodes or rapid cycling, they should be avoided during pregnancy. The use of lamotrigine during pregnancy has not been associated with any major fetal anomalies and is an option for maintenance therapy in women with bipolar disorder. Valproic acid use during lactation has been studied in 41 maternal-infant dyads; only one infant was adversely affected with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization consider valproic acid safe in breastfeeding women. Carbamazepine is ruled "probably safe"; rare side effects include transient cholestatic hepatitis and hyperbilirubinemia. The use of benzodiazepines in women with anxiety disorders does not carry a significant teratogenic risk. Prenatal exposure to diazepam increases the risk of oral cleft, but the absolute risk increases by only 0. 01 percent.

Atypical antipsychotics have replaced typical agents as first-line therapy for psychotic disorders because these drugs are better tolerated and may be more effective in managing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The reproductive safety data on atypical antipsychotics are limited, but the use of olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and clozapine has been associated with increased rates of low birth weight and therapeutic abortion.

### Catatonia in psychiatric classification: a home of its own [^3e81fe50]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors assess the present position of catatonia in diagnostic classification systems and consider the merits of designating catatonia as a separate diagnostic category with defined criteria.

Method

Following the logical steps to establish diagnostic validity when the etiology of a syndrome is unknown, the authors review the literature on the features that delineate catatonia as a syndrome, the prevalence and response to treatment of catatonia, and the conditions that are associated with catatonia.

Results

Catatonia is a well-defined syndrome that can be reliably ascertained. Although more than 40 motor signs of catatonia are known, the presence of two prominent features for 24 hours or longer is sufficient to identify the syndrome. Catatonia is found in about 10% of acutely ill psychiatric inpatients and is more commonly observed in persons with mood disorder than in those with schizophrenia. It is found in many conditions and presents mainly as retarded-stuporous or excited-delirious forms. Catatonia responds to specific treatments, including sedative anticonvulsants (barbiturates and benzodiazepines) and ECT.

Conclusions

Catatonia can be distinguished from other behavioral syndromes by a recognizable cluster of clinical features. Catatonia is sufficiently common to warrant classification as an independent syndrome. It can be reliably identified, has a typical course when appropriately treated, responds to specific treatments, and is worsened by other treatments. It is associated with many pathophysiologic processes and most often with mood disorder. These findings, which are consistent with established methods of defining distinct diagnostic groupings, support consideration of catatonia as an individual category in psychiatric diagnostic systems.

There are several special cases to these recommendations about first-line treatment, which are as follows:

Clozapine-withdrawal catatonia: a systematic review of case reports found that restarting clozapine or using ECT were the most effective treatment strategies, while benzodiazepines were less effective.
Benzodiazepine-withdrawal catatonia: a systematic review of case reports found that reinstating benzodiazepines was generally effective.
Catatonia in autism spectrum disorder: see section 'Autism spectrum disorder'.
Chronic, milder catatonia in the context of schizophrenia: there is some evidence that this tends not to respond to benzodiazepines or ECT. There is some evidence based on observational data that these patients may respond to clozapine. There have been rare cases of cardiorespiratory arrest associated with the concomitant use of clozapine and benzodiazepines, so caution should be exercised if there is co-administration.
Malignant catatonia: see section 'Periodic catatonia'.
NMS: see section 'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome'.
Antipsychotic-induced catatonia: see section 'Antipsychotic-induced catatonia'.
Women in the perinatal period: see section 'The perinatal period'.

Non-response

Where benzodiazepines or ECT do not succeed in achieving remission of catatonia, it is important to re-evaluate the diagnosis. In one study of 21 patients who entered an RCT for catatonia, 2 of the non-responders were subsequently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. For alternative treatment approaches, see section 'Other therapies'.

Underlying condition

Alongside treating the catatonia, it is important to treat any underlying disorder. This may involve psychotropic medications (e.g. antidepressants), other medical therapies (e.g. antibiotics, immunosuppressants) or even occasionally surgical treatments (e.g. tumour resection in the case of a paraneoplastic syndrome). Guidelines for treating relevant psychiatric disorders are available from the BAP. There is some controversy over the use of antipsychotic medications in catatonia, which is discussed in section 'Dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists'.

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^fd227833]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Withdrawal catatonia versus illness relapse

An argument could be made that the occurrence of catatonia following clozapine discontinuation within 14 days could be related to a relapse of the underlying illness rather than withdrawal effects from the medication. All patients identified in this group had a diagnosis of a primary psychotic illness, which can also present with catatonic features. There are a number of reasons however that we believe the catatonia in these cases to be related to withdrawal rather than illness relapse. First, the cases of withdrawal catatonia that we identified all occurred within 14 days of clozapine discontinuation, and all but three of those occurred within 7 days or less of discontinuation. This time frame supports a mechanism related to discontinuation as it matches the time frame in which somatic discontinuation symptoms are seen upon stopping clozapine. This is also the time frame that is seen for the occurrence of a rapid onset psychosis that can follow clozapine discontinuation, a process that is also believed to be distinct from a relapse of the underlying illness. Second, of the 20 cases identified, only eight had experienced a previous episode of catatonia and in five of those cases, the previous episodes of catatonia had only occurred also immediately following clozapine discontinuation. Therefore, only 3 of the 20 cases had previously experienced a catatonic episode that had been unrelated to clozapine discontinuation. Based on this, it is our view that the cases of catatonia identified were less likely to be due to a relapse of the underlying illness considering that in the majority of the cases (85%), catatonia unrelated to clozapine withdrawal had not previously been a specific feature of the patient's illness presentation.

### Catatonia is not schizophrenia and it is treatable [^07c041ce]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Catatonia is a cluster of motor features that appears in many recognized psychiatric illnesses, that according to the DSM-5 it is not linked as a subtype to schizophrenia anymore. The classic signs are mutism, a rigid posture, fixed staring, stereotypic movements, and stupor, which are all part of a broad psychopathology that may be found in affective, thought, neurological, toxic, metabolic and immunological disorders. Despite the many etiologies, catatonia may be a life-threatening condition with a specific treatment. Benzodiazepines are the first line therapeutic option for catatonia, being lorazepam the first-choice drug. Eighty percent of the patients are relieved by the use of barbiturates or benzodiazepines, while in those who fail, an improvement is achieved by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). With more than 60years of use in catatonic patients, ECT has proven to be an effective and safe tool for the treatment of this frequent and sometimes forgotten syndrome.

In terms of neurophysiology, there is a clear case for an electroencephalogram (EEG) in the context of possible non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), which can present as catatonia. Red flags for NCSE include subtle ictal phenomena (such as twitching of the face or extremities), comorbid neurological disease and a change in medications that affect seizure threshold. Another quite specific EEG finding of relevance to catatonia is the extreme delta brush, which occurs in some patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The literature on the value of 'encephalopathic' findings on EEGs suggests that this is not entirely specific for a medical disorder underlying catatonia.

Any hospital work-up must weigh the potential risks and benefits of detailed investigation. Hospital investigations may contribute to anxiety. Given that several studies have associated catatonia with intense anxiety, prolonged uncertainty amid medical testing may be expected to worsen this in some patients. In addition, the costs and potential harms of investigation (e.g. radiation exposure with computed tomography (CT) imaging, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in patients who are unable to communicate whether they have any metallic implants) must be considered.

Recommendations on the use of investigations in catatonia

Investigations, such as blood tests, urine drug screen, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography and neuroimaging, should be considered based on history and examination findings, taking into account the possible diagnoses that may mimic catatonia and the possible underlying aetiology of the catatonia. (D)
In patients experiencing a first episode of catatonia or where the diagnosis underlying catatonia is unclear, consider a CT or MRI scan of the brain. (C)
In patients experiencing a first episode of catatonia or where the diagnosis underlying catatonia is unclear, consider assessing for the presence of antibodies to the NMDA receptor and other relevant autoantibodies in serum and CSF. (D)
In patients with risk factors for seizures, possible evidence of a seizure or possible encephalitis, consider performing an EEG (with continuous monitoring if available). (C)

Since 2008, several reviews have proposed paediatric catatonia management along the lines of objective catatonia rating scales, medical work-up, removal of offending drugs and lorazepam challenge, followed by lorazepam treatment (sometimes at high doses) and or ECT (Dhossche et al. 2010a;).

Recommendations for catatonia in the children and adolescents

Catatonia is known to occur in children as young as 5 years and clinicians should screen for catatonia whenever clinical suspicion exists. (S)
Evaluation of catatonia aetiologies in children and adolescents should include the same range of disorders as found in adults. (S)
When assessing for the presence of paediatric catatonia, the PCRS should be used. (C)
First-line management for paediatric catatonia includes a lorazepam challenge test, lorazepam in increasing doses and bilateral ECT. (D)

Older adults

The literature on catatonia in the older adult population is limited compared to that in the working-age adult population. As with adult patients, it can be transient or long lasting, varying from weeks to months or years. The studies that have assessed the epidemiology of catatonia among older adults have focused on the acute psychiatric hospital setting, liaison psychiatry setting and intensive care setting. The prevalence has varied widely by the study setting and the assessment instruments used.

The phenotype of catatonia among older adults shows a high prevalence of hypokinetic signs, such as immobility/stupor, staring, rigidity, mutism, withdrawal, posturing and negativism, although one study listed excitement among the commonly identified clinical features. Catatonia among older adults is often multifactorial in aetiology and a wide range of medical conditions has been implicated, though the outcome is still usually good if it is treated promptly.

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^373624f1]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Catatonia is a serious neuropsychiatric condition that has been associated with a wide range of psychiatric, medical, neurologic, and drug-induced conditions. Catatonia has been described as having two subtypes, a stuporous form that includes signs and symptoms of mutism, rigidity, immobility, negativism, posturing, and catalepsy, and an excited form that includes excitement, aggression, and impulsivity. Additionally, a severe and life-threatening form that is associated with autonomic instability and fever is known as malignant catatonia.

Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for catatonia regardless of the underlying causewith high treatment response rates –. Benzodiazepines exert their effects on GABA A receptors, which are classified as ligand-gated ion channels. When GABA binds to its binding site on the GABA A receptor, it increases the frequency of opening of the receptor chloride channel, allowing more chloride to pass through, resulting in an inhibitory effect. The flow of ions through the channel also depends on the concentration gradient of the ions and the membrane potential of the cell. Benzodiazepines are classified as a positive allosteric modulator, as they bind to a separate site on the GABA A receptor and amplify the effect of GABA on the GABA A receptor. The presence of a benzodiazepine at a GABA A receptor increases the frequency of opening of the chloride channel more than when GABA alone is present. Benzodiazepines have no activity on their own, and thus require the presence of GABA at the GABA A receptor to exert their effect. The well-established efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of catatonia implicates GABA hypoactivity in the pathophysiology of catatonia.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with catatonic symptoms: a narrative review [^134057e1]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome consisting of psychomotor abnormalities caused by a broad range of disorders affecting brain function. While the nosological status of catatonia is no longer restricted to a subtype of schizophrenia in standardized diagnostic systems, the character, course, and clinical significance of catatonia in people with schizophrenia remain unclear. Evidence suggests that catatonia could be a nonspecific state-related phenomenon, a fundamental core symptom dimension of schizophrenia, or a subcortical variant of schizophrenia. Either way, the validity of catatonia in schizophrenia is clinically significant only insofar as it predicts prognosis and response to treatment. Most contemporary clinical trials of antipsychotics have targeted schizophrenia as an overly broad unitary psychosis neglecting any differential response defined by phenomenology or course. However, early naturalistic studies showed that catatonia predicted poor response to first-generation antipsychotics in chronic schizophrenia and case reports cautioned against the risk of triggering neuroleptic malignant syndrome. More recent studies suggest that second-generation antipsychotics, particularly clozapine, may be effective in schizophrenia with catatonic symptoms, while small randomized controlled trials have found that the short-term response to ECT may be faster and more significant. Based on available data, conclusions are limited as to whether antipsychotics are as effective and safe in acute and chronic schizophrenia with catatonic symptoms compared to other treatments and compared to schizophrenia without catatonia. Further studies of the pathophysiology, phenomenology, course and predictive value of catatonia in schizophrenia are worthwhile.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^add64f12]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Guideline method

To address this need for a guideline, the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) convened a group of experts with representation from general adult psychiatry, neuropsychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, liaison (consultation-liaison) psychiatry, perinatal psychiatry, autoimmune neurology, movement disorder neurology, pharmacy and primary care. Group members spanned the UK, USA, Canada, India and Germany, and were a mixture of disease experts and those with expertise in psychopharmacology, neuroimaging, epidemiology and clinical trials. There was patient representation on the group from its inception.

A virtual meeting was convened in June 2022, where group members presented proposals for separate sections of the guideline, which were discussed by the overall group. Following the meeting, certain group members drafted sections of the guideline, which were edited and synthesised into a first draft. This draft was then disseminated to all authors for further amendments before a second draft was made for further review.

The recommendations are summarised in an algorithm in Figure 1. A list of the recommendations apart from the rest of the manuscript is provided in.provides a plain language summary of the guidelines for patients and carers. Example slides, which may be used for presentations of the guidelines, are available in.

Strength of evidence and recommendations

To assess the strength of evidence and recommendations, the guideline group adopted the schema developed by. This system provides categories of evidence for the purposes of assessing causal relationships as well as a classification of the strength of recommendations. To grade the strength of evidence for non-causal relationships, we used the classification employed for the British Association for Pharmacology guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, as shown in Table 1.

Recommendations for the use of ECT in catatonia

Where ECT is administered, bilateral ECT should be considered. (S)
Where ECT is administered in acute catatonia, it should be given at least two times weekly. (S)
Number of ECT sessions should be decided on the basis of treatment response, risks and side effects. (S)

Other therapies

While the majority of patients with catatonia respond robustly to benzodiazepines or ECT, some patients have a partial or non-response. Catatonia associated with schizophrenia may be less likely to respond to benzodiazepines. In addition, benzodiazepines and ECT are cautioned in some circumstances. There are also barriers to ECT use such as legal restrictions and stigma.

These factors have prompted the trialling of several alternative agents, either as monotherapies or as augmentation strategies. The studies examining adjunctive medications for catatonia have consisted of prospective cohort studies, open prospective studies, prospective open label studies, retrospective chart review studies, case series and an open label double blind trial.

NMDA receptor antagonists

The NMDA receptor may be allosterically more available to glutamate in catatonia leading to dysfunction in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits. The NMDA receptor antagonists, amantadine and memantine, may reset the problems related to reduced dopamine and GABA in the CSTC circuitries by balancing NMDA receptor effects on PFC GABA-A parvalbumin interneurons that inhibit PFC pyramidal corticostriatal glutamatergic projections to the striatum while also reducing NMDA action in the striatum itself. Medications such as amantadine and memantine serve as uncompetitive antagonists of the NMDA receptor and thus may be helpful in patients with catatonia. Amantadine has the added theoretical benefit of enhancing central dopamine release and delaying dopamine reuptake from the synapse and since catatonia is hypothesised to be to some degree a disorder of hypodopaminergic tone, this profile may also benefit patients with catatonia.

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^926fa321]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for withdrawal catatonia

The 24 cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia identified presented in a nearly identical fashion to "typical" cases of catatonia previously described in the literature in regard to both symptoms and treatment response. We would therefore suggest following pre-established guidelines for the treatment of catatonia when encountering a case of benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, including using lorazepam as the medication of choice. The use of antipsychotic medications with high D2 receptor antagonism, such as typical antipsychotics, should be avoided. If lorazepam is not effective or if the patient is experiencing high fevers or is medically compromised, ECT should be considered. Conservative measures such as ensuring adequate hydration and being mindful of falls risk due to the use of sedating medication are essential as well.

As clozapine withdrawal catatonia has not been widely studied in the past, treatment suggestions are based on the accumulation of data from this literature review. Based on our findings, we would suggest the first-line treatment for clozapine withdrawal catatonia be early recognition and reinstitution of clozapine. Clinical guidelines recommend that when more than 2 days of clozapine treatment have been missed, clozapine should be re-started at a dose of 12.5−25 mg and increased slowly by 25−50 mg daily over 1−2 weeks until a therapeutic dose is reached. The purpose of the slow taper is to minimize the occurrence of adverse effects including orthostatic hypotension and seizures. There is however emerging evidence that rapid titration of clozapine using a higher starting dose and increasing by up to 100 mg daily is safe and provides faster resolution of psychotic symptoms. We speculate that an early and fast titration of clozapine would also result in a reduction of the duration of symptoms in clozapine withdrawal catatonia. A rapid inpatient titration with close monitoring should therefore be considered in cases where there are no pre-existing conditions that predispose an individual to experience adverse effects, such as old age, cardiac disease, or seizure disorder.

In addition to reinstitution of clozapine, the use of adjunct benzodiazepines can be considered, but are unlikely to be effective if used as a monotherapy. Sometimes reinstitution of clozapine is not possible due to various factors including drug intolerance or clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. When clozapine reinstitution is not possible, we would suggest the use of ECT. Consideration of conservative measures such as those described above are even more important in the treatment of clozapine withdrawal catatonia due to its association with autonomic instability and its prolonged course.

Regarding specific circumstances for catatonia, more specifically with respect to patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering a trial of lorazepam in patients with mild, early neuroleptic malignant syndrome (mild rigidity, catatonia, or confusion, temperature < 38 °C, and HR < 100 bpm).

Miscellaneous treatments

Muscle relaxants, calcium channel blockers and corticosteroids have all anecdotally been associated with improvement in isolated patients with catatonia. Lithium and other treatments for prophylaxis in periodic catatonia warrant particular attention and are considered in section 'Periodic catatonia'.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct-current stimulation as alternatives to ECT

There are conditions and situations that discourage the use of ECT after non-response to benzodiazepines and second-line agents, and when maintenance ECT is required that offers a potential niche for newer neuromodulatory treatments such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) for the treatment of catatonia. Two systematic reviews have covered this topic and found that the majority of case reports and case series in the literature reported a positive response. rTMS over the bilateral dorsolateral PFC has been particularly emphasised. Adverse effects appear to be minimal.

Recommendations on the use of other therapies

Where first-line therapies for catatonia are unavailable, cautioned, ineffective or only partially effective, consider a trial of an NMDA receptor antagonist, either amantadine or memantine. (C)
Where first-line therapies and NMDA receptor antagonists are unavailable, cautioned, ineffective or only partially effective, consider a trial of levodopa, a dopamine agonist, carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate or a SGA. (D)
Antipsychotic medications should be avoided where there is no underlying psychotic disorder. (C)
Where catatonia exists in the context of an underlying psychotic disorder, if antipsychotic medications are used, they should be prescribed with caution after an evaluation of the potential benefits and risks, including the risk of NMS. Additional caution should be exercised if there is low serum iron or a prior history of NMS. If antipsychotic medications are used, a SGA should be used with gradual titration, and co-administration of a benzodiazepine should be considered. (S)
Where ECT is indicated but unavailable, consider treatment with rTMS or tDCS. (D)

The perinatal period

The only systematic study of catatonia in the perinatal period is a retrospective chart review of 200 women consecutively admitted to hospital with postpartum psychosis, which suggests that the condition may be prevalent in women with severe mental illness in the postnatal period: 40 women (20%) were assessed as having catatonic signs. The literature in other perinatal groups with psychiatric or medical illnesses does not allow prevalence estimates.

In pregnancy, many potential complications of persistent catatonia place the mother and child at exceptionally high risk. These include venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, dehydration, malnutrition, incontinence, infections, communication difficulties, impaired co-operation with assessments and investigations, and impairment of capacity. Postnatally, the mother's ability to breastfeed and to care and bond with her infant are key concerns.

The sections that follow describe the risks that the two main treatments for catatonia, lorazepam and ECT, may pose to the mother and the child. More details about the general principles of use of psychotropic medications in the perinatal period may be found in the BAP guidance on this topic

The reproductive safety of lorazepam in the perinatal period

Research on the reproductive safety of benzodiazepines remains at an early stage, and studies more typically evaluate benzodiazepines as a group, rather than individual agents. In a meta-analysis of cohort studies of exposure to benzodiazepines, found a trend towards increased risks for total (n = 5195) and cardiovascular (n = 4414) malformations with the lower end of the 95% CI nearly achieving significance.reported in a nationwide cohort study of 3.1 million pregnancies with a larger sample of benzodiazepine exposures (n = 40,846), using propensity scores to account for a large number of potential confounders and several sensitivity analyses, that first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with a very small increased risk of overall congenital malformations (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05–1.13) and specifically, heart defects (adjusted RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.10–1.21). A risk of oral clefts, reported by several previous studies, was not confirmed. There were differences between compounds and lorazepam was not associated with significant effects (aRR for overall congenital malformations 1.00, CI: 0.85–1.18; aRR for cardiovascular malformations 1.14, CI: 0.93–1.40).

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^77351e9a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The medical disorders underlying catatonia listed in this guideline are not a comprehensive list, as such a compilation is out of the scope of this guidance. In Table 3, we provide a selection of the most important underlying disorders.

Table 3.
Selected important medical conditions that may underlie catatonia.

In terms of focal neurological lesions in catatonia, there are case reports of catatonia associated with lesions to the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, basal ganglia, diencephalon and cerebellum and lesions around the third ventricle. However, larger studies have found that most of the structural neuroimaging abnormalities in catatonia consist of generalised atrophy or non-specific white matter abnormalities.

In terms of functional neuroimaging, decreased activation in the contralateral motor cortex, decreased regional cerebral blood flow (r-CBF) in right fronto-parietal cortex and decreased density of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors in the left sensorimotor cortex and right parietal cortex have all been found.

Catatonia due to another psychiatric disorder

In DSM-5-TR, catatonic signs represent a specifier for autism spectrum disorder, mood disorders (major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder), psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder and substance-induced psychotic disorder) and another medical condition. The DSM-5-TR also includes a category for unspecified catatonia. The DSM-IV Handbook of Differential Diagnosis provided a helpful hierarchy of diagnosis for catatonia, with medical aetiology first, followed by antipsychotic-induced catatonia, then substance intoxication or withdrawal, and then bipolar disorder and major depression, and then other psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. This remains a useful hierarchy for clinical use.

Among primary psychiatric disorders, observational studies have reported catatonia in association with depression, mania, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorders and postpartum psychosis. Other psychiatric disorders with evidence from case reports or case series include obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (Dhossche et al. 2010b;).

A few additional articles cite the benefits for catatonia of other medications that may act as glutamate antagonists. These include four cases of minocycline use and one case of dextromethorphan–quinidine use.

In summary, reviews show that in 58 published cases plus other additional reports of amantadine and memantine use in catatonia of various aetiologies, substantial improvement was reported. This improvement usually occurred within a 7-day window. A bias towards the non-reporting of negative results must be considered, making the lack of RCTs and controlled studies an important shortcoming.

Dopamine precursors, agonists and reuptake inhibitors

The dopamine system modulates motivation and movement by informing the anterior cingulate cortex/mid-cingulate cortex when a task is associated with high predictive value (tonic dopamine) as well as when circumstances abruptly change to better or worse than predicted (phasic dopamine).proposes that the dopamine system in the midbrain ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra functions as a manager of sorts for the CSTC circuits thought to be implicated in catatonia. The dopamine agonists and precursors can be hypothesised to treat catatonia by increasing dopamine modulation and by favouring the striosomal direct pathway as they do in akinetic mutism, leading to opening of the thalamic filter with feedforward activation of cortical regions including the supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex.

Levodopa is a dopamine precursor that is often used in combination with a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa and benserazide) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. A case report and small case series found marked improvement after treatment with levodopa, although the case series reported worsening of psychosis. Bromocriptine, a dopamine D 2 receptor agonist was used successfully in a 16-year-old girl with catatonia. There is also a literature on the use of dopamine agonists in the related conditions of NMS (see section 'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome') and akinetic mutism, a neurological condition associated with lesions to frontal-subcortical circuits.

Methylphenidate is a noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. There have been five case reports of successful use of methylphenidate for catatonia. Most of these cases were due to mood disorders, and most used methylphenidate as monotherapy.

### Clozapine as a treatment for catatonia: a systematic review [^b12eb65f]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by altered movement, speech, and behaviour. Clozapine is an established therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but its role in catatonia has not been systematically examined. In this systematic review, we aimed to assess the evidence for clozapine as a treatment for catatonia. Full text original research articles in English where at least one patient with catatonia was treated with clozapine were included, provided catatonia did not occur solely in the context of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Results were tabulated with calculations of summary statistics presented. Risk of bias was assessed with the Tool for Evaluating the Methodological Quality of Case Reports and Case Series. 182 patients were included, 81 from cohort studies and 101 from case reports or case series. 119/182 patients (65%) had a specified underlying diagnosis of schizophrenia. Over 80% of reported patients with catatonia had at least partial remission following treatment with clozapine across both cohort studies and case reports and case series. Among the case reports and series, 24/101 patients (23.8%) followed clozapine withdrawal. Overall, 25 studies were of low quality, 60 of moderate quality and 8 of high quality. Our findings should be interpreted with caution, as the reliance on case reports, case series and small cohort studies is susceptible to reporting biases, regression to the mean and confounding by other treatments. Future research could use large healthcare databases to ascertain outcomes in those on clozapine with a history of catatonia given the difficulty and expense of conducting randomised controlled trials.

### Movement disorders in psychiatric patients [^2748c7d5]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Table 1
Clinical features of catatonia

With modern supportive care and treatment, lethal catatonia no longer has its dire connotation although patients with this variant develop prolonged depression of conscious state with fever and autonomic instability. There are parallels between severe catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and the two disorders can be hard to differentiate when intermediate syndromes occur in psychiatrically ill patients on antipsychotic drugs. Both conditions may be worsened by dopamine receptor antagonists, whereas electroconvulsive treatment is effective in catatonia and in selected cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A prior or family history of catatonia is a risk factor for neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Both conditions produce alterations in alertness that are likely to be neurochemically mediated yet are poorly understood. Serotonin syndrome, which shares a number of clinical signs with neuroleptic malignant syndrome and catatonia, enters the differential diagnosis when there is additional exposure to serotonergic agents. Typically, serotonin syndrome has more mental agitation, with more excitatory motor features such as tremor, myoclonus, clonus and hyperreflexia.

Malignant catatonia

Catatonia may be conceptualised as a continuum, with milder forms at one end (termed simple or benign) and more severe forms, involving hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction (termed malignant), at the other.described 'lethal catatonia' as a fulminant psychotic disorder characterised by intense motor excitement, which progressed to stuporous exhaustion, cardiovascular collapse, coma and death. The entire course, passing through excitement into stupor, involved mounting hyperthermia, autonomic instability, delirium, muscle rigidity and prominent catatonic features. The paucity of findings on autopsy was difficult to explain and in sharp contrast to the catastrophic clinical manifestations. This disorder was the subject of numerous publications throughout the pre-antipsychotic drug era. Competing terminology included Bell's mania, acute delirious mania, pernicious catatonia and delirium acutum, among numerous others. More recently, the term malignant catatonia has been proposed, since not all cases are fatal. Unlike Stauder, some authors have observed that muscle tone in malignant catatonia is flaccid.

Although the incidence of malignant catatonia appears to have declined following the introduction of modern psychopharmacologic agents, it continues to be reported. Like non-malignant catatonia, malignant catatonia represents a syndrome rather than a specific disease, occurring in association with diverse neuromedical illnesses as well as with psychiatric disorders. Current data suggest that it is likely that a proportion of malignant catatonia cases previously attributed to schizophrenia were more likely the product of autoimmune disorders, particularly anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Mortality, which had exceeded 75% during the pre-antipsychotic drug era, has fallen to 10% in recent reports.

Although some qualified support may exist for the use of SGAs in non-malignant catatonia (see section 'Dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists'), the literature on antipsychotics for malignant catatonia is rather different. First, there is an issue that malignant catatonia is generally clinically indistinguishable from NMS, so antipsychotics seem injudicious. Second, in a review of 292 malignant catatonia cases, 78% of those treated with only an antipsychotic died, compared with an overall mortality of 60%. Moreover, this review found that many patients with catatonia developed malignant features only after treatment with antipsychotics. The evidence for the SGAs in malignant catatonia is minimal and mixed. Antipsychotic drugs should be withheld whenever malignant catatonia is suspected.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^498db820]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since RCTs are unavailable, treatment recommendations for malignant catatonia are based on case reports or case series. Five international guidelines for the management of schizophrenia specifically address the treatment of malignant catatonia, although they are based on low levels of evidence. Each of the guidelines recommends ECT either as the initial treatment or as second line after a failed benzodiazepine trial. Although the benefits of benzodiazepines in malignant catatonia are less consistent than in non-malignant catatonia, a review of 44 cases found that there was clear benefit in about a third, transient or partial improvement in a third and no benefit in the remainder, so a benzodiazepine trial seems reasonable. Doses as high as 24 mg of lorazepam per day may be required. However, if benzodiazepines are not rapidly effective, ECT should be started within 48–72 h following the onset of malignant catatonia.

ECT appears to be a safe and effective treatment for malignant catatonia occurring in association with a psychiatric disorder. Among 68 patients reported in five series, 51 of 54 treated with ECT survived, whereas only 6 of 14 who received antipsychotics and supportive care recovered. Still, ECT appears effective only if initiated before severe progression of malignant catatonia. In another series, although 16 of 19 patients receiving ECT within 5 days of malignant catatonia onset survived, none of 14 patients starting ECT beyond that 5-day point recovered. In view of the life-threatening potential of malignant catatonia, bilateral treatments daily or twice daily for 3–5 days are often required to achieve a rapid result, followed by ECT at conventional frequencies until complete resolution. In addition, ECT has been effective as a symptomatic measure in malignant catatonia complicating a diversity of medical conditions, such as anti-NMDAR encephalitis, permitting resolution of the underlying condition.

Among patients who recover from NMS, there may be a 30% risk of recurrent episodes following antipsychotic rechallenge. However, most patients who require antipsychotics can be safely treated provided measures to reduce risk are followed. Strategies suggested are minimising other risk factors for NMS (such as agitation, medical illness and dehydration), allowing at least 2 weeks from recovery before rechallenge, using a low dose of a SGA with gradual titration and careful monitoring for early signs of NMS.

Recommendations for the treatment of NMS

In NMS, discontinue all dopamine antagonists. (C)
In NMS, discontinue anticholinergic drugs. (S)
In NMS, supportive care should be provided. This consists of assessment and appropriate management of airway, ventilation, temperature and swallow. Fluid input/output should be monitored, and aggressive fluid resuscitation should be used where required. There should be assessment for hyperkalaemia, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. There should be careful monitoring for complications such as cardiorespiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, thromboembolism and renal failure, alongside early consideration of high-dependency care. (S)
For mild, early NMS, characterised by mild rigidity, catatonia or confusion, temperature < 38°C and HR < 100, consider a trial of lorazepam. (C)
For moderate NMS, characterised by moderate rigidity, catatonia or confusion, temperature = 38°C–40°C and HR = 100–120, consider a trial of lorazepam. Consider a trial of bromocriptine or amantadine. Consider ECT. (C)
For severe NMS, characterised by severe rigidity, catatonia or coma, temperature > 40°C and HR > 120, consider a trial of lorazepam and consider dantrolene. Consider bromocriptine or amantadine. Consider ECT. (C).
If clinical features persist, consider bilateral ECT three times weekly or, in severe cases, once or twice daily, until NMS abates. Continue ECT three times per week until there is sustained improvement to a total of 5–20 treatments. (C)
Delay restarting antipsychotics by at least 2 weeks after resolution of an NMS episode to reduce the risk of recurrence. (C)

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^d7b0b5c5]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia

In the 24 cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, the benzodiazepine dose was substantial and the length of use was typically long term. There were no withdrawal catatonic episodes documented after very short-term regular use or intermittent as-needed use, despite the fact that benzodiazepines are frequently used in this manner. We hypothesize that this is because in order to create an environment in which withdrawal catatonia could occur, chronic use of benzodiazepines is required to create compensatory receptor changes. Chronic potentiation of activity at GABA A receptors would likely result in downregulation of GABA A receptor function. When the GABA promoting drugs are then suddenly withdrawn from the downregulated GABA A receptors, a state of GABA deficiency would result, leading to catatonia. Reinstitution of benzodiazepines, which act as GABA A agonists, would be expected to have a high treatment response rate through correction of the GABA deficiency. This was indeed the clinical observation, as all 24 cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia responded rapidly to treatment with benzodiazepines.

Symptoms of psychosis accompanied the catatonic symptoms in about half of the cases. The psychotic symptoms most commonly reported were hallucinations with or without delusions. These symptoms are not core features of catatonia. This finding is somewhat surprising as only two of the cases reported pre-existing psychotic symptoms and therefore the psychotic symptoms that occurred were new-onset and could not be attributed to pre-existing illness in most cases. One possible explanation is that there is a component of delirium in benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia. Alcohol, which also acts on GABA A receptors, is associated with a withdrawal delirium with prevalent hallucinations. It has been previously suggested that catatonia associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal and withdrawal delirium may exist along a spectrum with a convergence in pathophysiology. In the cases we identified, eight described disorientation, which is a central feature of delirium. Disorientation or other features of delirium may have been present in other cases as well; however, assessing mental status in the presence of a condition that commonly features mutism is very difficult and may not be possible to do. An alternative explanation is that when a state of GABA hypoactivity occurs with benzodiazepine withdrawal, a hyper-dopaminergic state is stimulated and this could result in the emergence of psychotic symptoms. Downregualtion of GABA function has been understood to increase dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area through disinhibition of pyramidal neurons.

Table 6.
Means of assessment of catatonia.

Recommendations on the assessment of catatonia

Initial assessment and treatment of catatonia should be conducted within secondary care. (S)
Catatonia should be considered as a differential diagnosis whenever a patient exhibits a substantially altered level of activity or abnormal behaviour, especially where it is grossly inappropriate to the context. (D)
A collateral history should be sought wherever possible. (S)
The history should include identification of possible medical and psychiatric disorders underlying catatonia, as well as prior response to treatment. (S)
Physical examination should include assessment for catatonic signs, signs of medical conditions that may have led to the catatonia and signs of medical complications of catatonia. (D)
When assessing a patient with catatonia, clinicians should interact with the person as if they are able to understand what is being said to them. (S)
In an individual who is suspected to have catatonia, non-engagement with clinical assessment should not automatically be assumed to be wilful. Mental capacity to engage in an assessment should be assessed and, if found lacking, consideration should be given to acting in an individual's best interests within the appropriate legal framework. (S)

Rating instruments

Most catatonia rating instruments approach catatonia scoring in a polythetic fashion (i.e. any combination of a diverse range of clinical features can contribute towards reaching a threshold for caseness), with the Northoff Catatonia Rating Scale (NCRS) a notable exception (Table 7).

Table 7.
A comparison of commonly used catatonia rating scales.

The Rogers Catatonia Scale was designed to differentiate catatonic depression from non-depressed patients with Parkinson's disease. Its exclusive focus on motoric features of catatonia means that it has uncertain generalisability to other populations. It also omits several diagnostic criteria included in the ICD-11. The Kanner scale also has a significant weakness in that it has yet to be validated in a clinical cohort. As such, both the Rogers and Kanner scales should be disfavoured from routine clinical use at this time.

### Challenges of managing delirium and catatonia in a medically ill patient [^a83a2299]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Untangling catatonia and delirium can be challenging. Furthermore, treatment of one syndrome can potentially worsen another.

Case Presentation

We present the case of a 71-year-old patient with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar subtype, who developed catatonia and delirium with prominent psychotic symptoms, during a single hospitalization. Treatment of this patient's catatonia with benzodiazepines exacerbated delirium, while treatment of psychotic symptoms precipitated by delirium with antipsychotics led to catatonia. Catatonia and psychotic symptoms were eventually successfully managed with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Discussion

This case report highlights some of the treatment challenges faced when delirium and catatonia overlap in a medically ill patient. The use of benzodiazepines, valproic acid, antipsychotics, ECT and alternate medications to treat catatonia are also discussed.

### Structure and neural mechanisms of catatonia [^99018908]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on catatonia:

- **Definition**: Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by motor disturbances, ranging from stupor to agitation, and includes pathognomonic features such as verbigeration and waxy flexibility.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of catatonia is not fully understood, but it is hypothesized to involve dysregulation of the GABA-ergic system.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of catatonia is estimated to be around 9.45% among inpatients with psychiatric disorders.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for catatonia primarily include psychiatric conditions. Mood disorders are the most common underlying conditions, followed by schizophrenia. Certain medical conditions, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, can also present with catatonic symptoms.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, catatonia presents with a variety of symptoms including stupor, posturing, mutism, and echolalia. Other features can include withdrawal, psychomotor retardation, and other neurovegetative features. The diagnosis of catatonia can be made with the presence of at least 3 symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of catatonia can vary widely, depending on the underlying cause and the promptness of treatment. However, with proper management, significant improvement is often observed.

### Comparative effects of 30 antipsychotics on risk of catatonia: an analysis of the WHO pharmacovigilance database [^ca3a6a15]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective: Catatonia is a life-threatening psychomotor syndrome that occurs in approximately 10% of patients with acute psychiatric illnesses. Although some case reports have argued that first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) are more likely to induce catatonia than second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), no large observational study has confirmed this hypothesis. We investigated whether FGAs were associated with an increased risk of reporting catatonia when compared with SGAs.

Methods: A pharmacovigilance study was performed within VigiBase to compare the cases of catatonia syndromes reported in patients exposed to FGAs with those reported in patients exposed to SGAs. This approach is similar in concept to case-control study, but adapted to a pharmacovigilance database, and allows the estimation of reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% confidence intervals.

Results: We identified 60,443 adverse effects reported in patients who received FGAs and 253,067 adverse effects reported in patients treated with SGAs. Compared with SGAs, the use of FGAs was associated with an increased risk of reporting catatonia syndromes (ROR = 2.2; 95% CI, 2.0–2.3). Consistent results were observed when the analysis was restricted to reports generated from physicians, reports from the US, and reports with the highest completeness score. The highest RORs were found for molindone (6.0; 95% CI, 3.1–10.4) and haloperidol (3.8; 95% CI, 3.5–4.0).

Conclusions: In this large pharmacovigilance study of patients exposed to antipsychotics, the use of FGAs was associated with an increased risk of reporting catatonia syndromes compared to the use of SGAs. This increased risk is consistent with the pharmacodynamic hypothesis of antipsychotic-induced catatonia. Our results warrant replication in population-based studies.

Other drugs

In contrast to reports of ketamine causing catatonic signs, there is at least one report of slow IV injection of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine (12.5 mg) producing dramatic improvement in catatonic signs. More studies, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), are needed before this translates into clinical practice as a diagnostic test.

Recommendations on the use of challenge test

When a diagnosis of catatonia is uncertain, a diagnostic challenge using lorazepam should be considered. (B)
When a diagnosis of catatonia is uncertain, a diagnostic challenge using zolpidem may be considered. (C)
In suspected or confirmed cases of catatonia, a lorazepam challenge may be used to predict future response to benzodiazepines. (B)

Differential diagnosis

There is some overlap between the differential diagnosis of catatonia (i.e. mimics of catatonia) and the conditions that may underlie catatonia. For example, NMS is sometimes listed in both categories, probably because of diverging views as to what extent it represents a form of catatonia (see section 'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome'). For some conditions, their status is subject to debate. In Table 10, we provide a list of some of the more important conditions that may mimic catatonia, what the similarities are and how they can be differentiated.

Table 10.
Differential diagnosis of catatonia.

As general principles, the positive features of catatonia (such as echophenomena, catalepsy and posturing) may have greater discriminatory value than some of the negative features (such as mutism and stupor). Challenge tests are useful in many situations (see section 'Challenge tests'), but their sensitivity and specificity are imperfect; importantly, stiff person syndrome and NCSE are likely to improve with a lorazepam challenge.

Although it has been asserted that serotonin syndrome (SS) is a form of catatonia, there is currently insufficient systematic evidence to support this claim. Furthermore, although ECT, a core intervention for catatonia, has been advocated for the treatment of SS, recent reports suggest that it is ineffective and, in fact, may exacerbate SS.

### DSM-IV catatonia signs and criteria in first-episode, drug-naive, psychotic patients: psychometric validity and response to antipsychotic medication [^df568d22]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the prevalence, psychometric validity and response to antipsychotic drugs of DSM-IV catatonia signs and criteria in patients with a first-episode psychotic disorder.

Methods

Two-hundred antipsychotic-naive patients with a DSM-IV nonaffective psychosis were assessed for catatonia signs and criteria using the Modified Rogers Scale, and the psychometric validity of the 12 DSM-IV catatonia signs and diagnostic criteria was examined. Treatment response of catatonia was assessed in 173 patients who completed one-month trial with haloperidol (n = 23), risperidone (n = 93) or olanzapine (n = 57).

Results

Sixty-two patients (31%) endorsed at least one catatonia sign and 24 (12%) met DSM-IV criteria for catatonia. DSM-IV catatonia signs showed an excellent convergent validity (r > 0.8) with other rating scales, and DSM-IV criteria showed moderate to fair concordance with other criteria (kappa from 0.57 to 0.77). The total number of signs reflected catatonia severity and demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance against alternative diagnostic criteria. The presence of at least any three signs accurately identified patients with catatonia. Three catatonia domains were identified (hyperkinesia, volitional and hypokinesia), which showed a different association pattern with external variables. Overall, catatonia ratings were particularly related to both dyskinesia and disorganization symptoms and lacked diagnostic specificity for schizophrenia. Patients with catatonia responded well to antipsychotic medication irrespective of the type of antipsychotic drug used, although treatment response was dependent upon the remission of psychotic symptoms.

Conclusions

These results may inform the DSM-V development on diagnosis and classification of catatonia, and indicate that catatonia signs and syndromes are highly responsive to antipsychotic drugs.

Recommendations for catatonia in autism spectrum disorder

Clinical vigilance is warranted for the assessment of catatonia in autism spectrum disorder given its high prevalence. (C)
Diagnosis of catatonia in autism spectrum disorder requires a marked change from baseline presentation. (S)
First-line interventions in mild cases of catatonia are psychological interventions and/or lorazepam, but the standard treatments for catatonia (i.e. benzodiazepines in escalating dosages and/or bilateral ECT) should be considered in moderate to severe cases. (D)

Medical conditions

Considerations in kidney disease

Catatonia, including malignant catatonia, has been described in the context of severe renal impairment, in patients receiving dialysis and in the post-transplantation period, often as a result of drug toxicities. Patients with renal impairment, even those on dialysis, may still be able to tolerate and benefit from benzodiazepines with consideration of the severity of renal impairment, route of administration of benzodiazepines, comorbidities (e.g. frailty), including the risk for delirium.

Typically, no dose adjustments are required even in severe impairment for acute dosing of lorazepam in either oral or parenteral formulation; however, for high or repeated parenteral dosing, monitoring for propylene glycol toxicity and consideration of other therapies such as ECT and NMDA receptor antagonists may be indicated to lessen the impact of the potential side effects of treatment (e.g. falls, confusion, delirium).

Considerations in liver disease

Malignant catatonia may be a rare cause of liver failure. Catatonia has been reported secondary to Wilson's disease, after liver transplantation, including in post-transplantation delirium as well as secondary to post-transplantation drug toxicities. The early post-liver transplantation period may be a state of deficiency in GABA signalling, which may place the patient at increased risk for catatonia.

Benzodiazepines may be an effective treatment for catatonia post-transplantation. In mild to moderate hepatic impairment, typically no dose adjustment for lorazepam is required (oral or parenteral formulations). In severe impairment or failure, use caution. Other treatments such as NMDA receptor antagonists or ECT may be required when benzodiazepine treatment is cautioned.

### Movement disorders associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs [^4fc7435a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Data from clinical trials reviewed in this article fulfill predictions based on preclinical findings that atypical antipsychotic drugs are associated with a reduced potential for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and other movement disorders. Atypical drugs have been shown to reduce all subtypes of acute EPS, the frequency of EPS-related patient dropouts, and the need for concomitant antiparkinsonian drug use. Clozapine remains superior to other atypicals in treating psychosis without worsening motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Atypicals may be selectively advantageous in treating schizophrenic patients with a predisposition to catatonia. Although the risk of developing lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome may be diminished with atypical drugs, clinicians must remain alert to the signs of this disorder. Atypicals have reduced liability for inducing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and show antidyskinetic properties in patients with preexisting TD. Passive resolution of TD may be facilitated in some patients by the use of these agents. Thus, the risk of movement disorders has become only one of several considerations in choosing among antipsychotic drugs.

estimated an incidence of catatonia in the general population, in London, UK, finding that catatonia occurred in 10.6 (95% CI: 10.0–11.1) per 100,000 person-years, but this also relied upon the mention of catatonia in the healthcare notes. In a large recent study in US non-federal general hospitals, a discharge diagnosis with an ICD-10 catatonia code occurred in 0.05% of hospital admissions.

Some reports indicate a temporal decline in the diagnosis of catatonia in routinely collected data.described a drop in incidence of catatonic schizophrenia between the 1950s and 1970s in Finnish registry data, especially in the age group of 25–40 years. However, it is possible that this apparent decline is a result of changes in diagnostic practice rather than a true change in incidence.reported that the apparent decline in catatonia between 1980 and 2000 in routine diagnostic data from the Netherlands could be explained by a change in diagnostic habits. A sample of patients with more detailed clinical data illustrated a high frequency of catatonic presentations from 2001 to 2003.reported an increase in incidence between 2007 and 2016. The varying interest in catatonia and changes in diagnostic practice over time make the interpretation of time trend data very difficult.

Several studies conducted in Western nations have found that catatonia was more common among individuals from ethnic minorities, often by a large margin.

Administration can be oral, IM or IV. Parenteral administration can be particularly useful if oral administration is not possible, for example due to negativism. Lorazepam is usually administered in 2–4 divided doses each day.

Reported response ranges from 66% up to 100%. These studies were mainly conducted in Western countries. Studies conducted in India and Asia show more variable response, ranging from 0% to 100%. The reason for these differences remains unclear, but it is possible that – given that lorazepam is unstable at room temperature – storage conditions may play a role. Usually, administration of lorazepam is well tolerated, and major side effects are rare. Even a dose as high as 16 mg of lorazepam is often well tolerated without sedation.

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^111f5f60]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

ECT has also been established as being highly effective for catatoniaand is suggested in benzodiazepine-resistant cases and in cases with life-threatening features. ECT has broad effects on the central nervous system including increasing serum GABA levels and GABA B activity. This lends further support to a GABA deficit model of catatonia.

The use of typical antipsychotics is discouraged in patients presenting with catatonic features due to inefficacy and the potential risk of worsening symptoms of catatonia. Furthermore, administration of antipsychotic medications can cause a catatonic episode. This is known as neuroleptic-induced catatonia and has been reported with both typical and atypical antipsychotics –. Neuroleptic-induced catatonia has overlapping symptoms with neuroleptic malignant syndrome including autonomic abnormalities. As such, neuroleptic-induced catatonia has been proposed to be a mild variant of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a syndrome believed to be due to dopamine blockade. The clinical findings that catatonia can be precipitated or worsened by the administration of dopamine blocking agents and that neuroleptic-induced catatonia shares similarities with neuroleptic malignant syndrome suggest the role of dopamine hypoactivity in the pathophysiology of catatonia.

An evolutionary model of catatonia as a primitive response to fear that is triggered by extreme physical or psychological stress has also been proposed. In this model, catatonia may be a form of the animal defense strategy of tonic immobility, which is the sudden onset of prolonged stillness or "freezing" when an animal is exposed to a threatening stimulus. In the animal world, tonic immobility may increase the chances of survival by helping avoid predators that are triggered by movement. Catatonia and tonic immobility share many features including immobility, posturing, stupor, waxy flexibility, mutism, and abrupt onset. Observations that support a model of catatonia as a fear response are high rates of fear during a catatonic episode reported by patients after the episode resolves, the frequent presence of symptoms of autonomic arousal during a catatonic episode, and benzodiazepines, which are an effective treatment for catatonia, having anxiolytic properties.

### Antipsychotics for schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic symptoms [^c899c862]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Whilst antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, there have been numerous attempts to identify biomarkers that can predict treatment response. One potential marker may be psychomotor abnormalities, including catatonic symptoms. Early studies suggested that catatonic symptoms predict poor treatment response, whilst anecdotal reports of rare adverse events have been invoked against antipsychotics. The efficacy and safety of antipsychotics in the treatment of this subtype of schizophrenia have rarely been studied in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Objectives

To compare the effects of any single antipsychotic medication with another antipsychotic or with other pharmacological agents, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), other non-pharmacological neuromodulation therapies (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation), or placebo for treating positive, negative, and catatonic symptoms in people who have schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and WHO ICTRP, on 19 September 2021. There were no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We also manually searched reference lists from the included studies, and contacted study authors when relevant.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs comparing any single antipsychotic medication with another antipsychotic or with other pharmacological agents, ECT, other non-pharmacological neuromodulation therapies, or placebo for people who have schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

two review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we planned to calculate risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we planned to calculate mean differences between groups and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies, and created a summary of findings table; however, we did not assess the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach because there was no quantitative evidence in the included study.

Main Results

Out of 53 identified reports, one RCT including 14 hospitalised adults with schizophrenia and catatonic symptoms met the inclusion criteria of the review. The study, which was conducted in India and lasted only three weeks, compared risperidone with ECT in people who did not respond to an initial lorazepam trial.

There were no usable data reported on the primary efficacy outcomes of clinically important changes in positive, negative, or catatonic symptoms. Whilst both study groups improved in catatonia scores on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), the ECT group showed significantly greater improvement at week 3 endpoint (mean ± estimated standard deviation; 0.68 ± 4.58; N = 8) than the risperidone group (6.04 ± 4.58; N = 6; P = 0.035 of a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures originally conducted in the trial). Similarly, both groups improved on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores by week 3, but ECT showed significantly greater improvement in positive symptoms scores compared with risperidone (P = 0.04). However, data on BFCRS scores in the ECT group appeared to be skewed, and mean PANSS scores were not reported, thereby precluding further analyses of both BFCRS and PANSS data according to the protocol.

Although no cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were reported, extrapyramidal symptoms as a primary safety outcome were reported in three cases in the risperidone group. Conversely, headache (N = 6), memory loss (N = 4), and a prolonged seizure were reported in people receiving ECT. These adverse effects, which were assessed as specific for antipsychotics and ECT, respectively, were the only adverse effects reported in the study. However, the exact number of participants with adverse events was not clearly reported in both groups, precluding further analysis.

Our results were based only on a single study with a very small sample size, short duration of treatment, unclear or high risk of bias due to unclear randomisation methods, possible imbalance in baseline characteristics, skewed data, and selective reporting. Data on outcomes of general functioning, global state, quality of life, and service use, as well as data on specific phenomenology and duration of catatonic symptoms, were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We found only one small, short-term trial suggesting that risperidone may improve catatonic and positive symptoms scale scores amongst people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and catatonic symptoms, but that ECT may result in greater improvement in the first three weeks of treatment. Due to small sample size, methodological shortcomings and brief duration of the study, as well as risk of bias, the evidence from this review is of very low quality. We are uncertain if these are true effects, limiting any conclusions that can be drawn from the evidence. No cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were reported, but we cannot rule out the risk of this or other rare adverse events in larger population samples.

High-quality trials continue to be necessary to differentiate treatments for people with symptoms of catatonia in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The lack of consensus on the psychopathology of catatonia remains a barrier to defining treatments for people with schizophrenia. Better understanding of the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics may clarify treatment for this unique subtype of schizophrenia.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome | NEJM resident 360… [^52e2f799]. resident360.nejm.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published September 25, 2024 The biologic basis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is not known, but neuroleptic antipsychotic agents block dopamine D2 receptors, a family of G protein–coupled receptors that bind extracellular dopamine, and this blockade is inferentially implicated in the disorder. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are the cardinal clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A: The typical presentation of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is dysautonomia, particularly tachycardia and rapidly fluctuating hypertensive or hypotensive blood pressure; temperature elevation to 40°C or higher; delirium that in the severe form is catatonia; and increased muscle tone. Q: What medications are associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

A: High-potency, first-generation antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol, fluphenazine, and pimozide have most often been implicated in cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. There has been a clinical sense that the syndrome has been less common and less severe with second-generation agents than with first-generation agents. Other drugs that block dopamine, such as metoclopramide, droperidol, prochlorperazine, and dopamine-depleting agents such as tetrabenazine, have also been implicated but are apparently less likely to cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A: Management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, like the management of any other critical illness, requires close clinical attention and a focus on risk factors for complications and death.

In addition to withdrawal of the offending agent when possible, treatment involves a tiered approach to the main features of the syndrome: blood-pressure instability, hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis from severe rigidity, and the potential for respiratory compromise. Data from prospective trials of the currently used interventions are lacking, and there may be several effective approaches. Recovery times vary but generally range from 7 to 11 days and may be roughly predicted from the half-life of the implicated neuroleptic drug. Rare cases in which the syndrome persists for months, with residual catatonia and motor signs, have been reported.

Challenge tests

DSM-5-TR has included a diagnosis of unspecified catatonia to encourage early treatment while a search for an underlying disorder can continue. Challenge tests may provide support in clarifying diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This section is limited to the use of benzodiazepines and zolpidem as a diagnostic and therapeutic 'challenge test'. These agents are discussed in greater detail in section 'GABA-ergic pharmacotherapies'.

In 1930, Bleckwenn described the use of short-acting barbiturates to 'render catatonic patients responsive'. Lorazepam (and to a limited extent, other benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam and oxazepam) have now replaced the use of barbiturates (such as amobarbital and sodium thiopental) as a diagnostic challenge (sometimes called the lorazepam test or the diazepam test) for confirming the diagnosis of catatonia.

Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines

Lorazepam is an effective and clinically useful diagnostic challenge test for catatonia. It is available in oral, liquid, intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) forms, and is available in a variety of clinical settings. Lorazepam is a non-selective positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors. Possible therapeutic mechanisms in catatonia are discussed in section 'GABA-ergic pharmacotherapies'.

The recommended dose for a lorazepam challenge is 1–2 mg IV, IM or 2 mg oral. The response to an oral challenge is often slower than for parenteral administration and oral formulations can be harder to administer to both hyperkinetic and hypokinetic patients. A positive response to a lorazepam challenge, commonly defined as a 50% reduction in catatonic signs on a standardised scale, makes a diagnosis of catatonia more likely, but it is not 100% specific. A good response on the first day appears predictive of overall response to lorazepam. Low serum iron has been reported as a predictor of poor response with benzodiazepines. An example protocol is provided in Table 9.

Table 9.
Example protocol for a lorazepam challenge for catatonia.

Based on their clinical effectiveness in these conditions, benzodiazepines may also be considered as a therapeutic test in antipsychotic-induced catatonia, NMS and malignant catatonia.

The conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that both ACS and NMS have been clearly underappreciated by genetic research. Both ACS and NMS are clinically rather rare conditions, so that finding candidate genes that are associated with these disorders will require large groups of patients. Given the clinical relevance of these syndromes, we strongly endorse population-based cohort studies that could decisively contribute to the specification of risk (or protective) factors (including relevant gene variants) and predictors for the occurrence of ACS and NMS. In line with this, we would appreciate hearing the authors' opinion on the relationship between candidate genes and ACS and NMS.
