## Question

How would i go about fall risk assessement?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to conduct a step-by-step fall risk assessment for older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial screening and where it applies. Then, I should clarify risk stratification and criteria. Next, I will review each mandatory assessment domain and the measurement tools. After that, I will synthesize findings into person-centered decisions and match them to interventions by risk tier. Finally, I need to ensure documentation, coordination, and reassessment are explicit and evidence-based, while noting caveats such as care home exceptions and syncope considerations.

> Let me first confirm where screening is appropriate and what tool to use. My initial instinct is to screen all older adults, but wait, I should verify the exception for care homes; the World Guidelines advise against risk screening in care homes because all residents are high risk by default, so they should proceed directly to multifactorial assessment, especially at admission and with condition changes [^113UHB8r]. For community and primary care, I need to check that routine opportunistic or annual screening in adults 65 years and older is reasonable, and the CDC STEADI approach is supported by current primary care guidance, which it is according to AAFP 2024, so brief, validated screening at health encounters is appropriate in community settings [^112GwQun] [^112mJ744].

> Now, I should clarify risk stratification to decide intensity of assessment and intervention. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cutoffs before aligning with the guideline flow, which places individuals into low, intermediate, or high risk based on fall history, injury, gait/balance concerns, frailty, and red flags like suspected syncope, then links risk level to assessment depth and intervention proportionality; this is exactly the GGF/WFG framework described and endorsed, though further validation and possibly continuous risk scoring have been argued as future directions to improve adaptability [^112mJ744] [^113525Wk] [^114wjHS9].

> Next, I will examine gait, balance, and functional mobility, since mobility limitations are among the strongest predictors. I'm thinking gait speed over 4 meters is the simplest anchor; hmm, wait a minute, which cut-off is most defensible for falls prediction, 1.0 m/s or 0.8 m/s; the WFG endorses gait speed or TUG for prediction with recognition that evidence is mixed and the umbrella review shows no single test has high certainty predictive value, so I should use these as part of a battery rather than alone; BBS can provide granularity, with community data suggesting ≤ 50 as a pragmatic threshold, but again I need to emphasize synthesis across tests rather than reliance on one measure [^114wYxLq] [^1153Juyq] [^116rYAqL] [^1176hitC].

> I need to check concerns about falling because psychological factors independently relate to future falls. Initially, I considered the ABC scale interchangeable with FES-I for prediction, but hold on, I should verify measurement properties and prognostic data; the Age and Ageing 2023 synthesis confirms excellent reliability and validity for FES-I variants, and a 2025 meta-analysis suggests FES-I scores predict future falls while ABC may not, so FES-I or Short FES-I should be my default for concern assessment and risk prognostication in community-dwelling older adults [^115dJw3p] [^115pa7uz] [^114joxHc] [^1162rSZY].

> Let me consider sensory function next, because sensory deficits are modifiable contributors. I should confirm that visual acuity and field deficits like hemianopia and neglect warrant screening and referral, which the WFG recommends as part of multifactorial assessment; I also need to remember hearing loss, which is often overlooked, yet the guidelines advise assessing hearing and referring when indicated, as deficits are associated with falls risk and functional decline [^111RWW6W] [^114X9bMX].

> I should confirm cognitive assessment is routine in the multifactorial evaluation. Deficits in executive function and processing speed elevate fall risk, so a brief cognitive screen with escalation as needed is appropriate; this is consistent with WFG recommendations and broader evidence linking cognitive and mobility factors to falls, and meta-analytic work in hospitalized cohorts highlights cognition among top predictors alongside mobility, prior falls, and medications [^111Sye1Z] [^111TvHb3] [^112me3gD].

> I will now examine medications, because polypharmacy and specific classes increase fall risk. Let me double-check that psychotropics, antiepileptics, opioids, and antihypertensives are recurrent culprits and that deprescribing is encouraged when benefits do not outweigh harms; the guidelines also emphasize assessing fall history before prescribing fall risk–increasing drugs, while meta-analyses reaffirm medication burden and certain classes as major predictors in hospitalized older adults, supporting systematic reconciliation and optimization [^112MrzV8] [^112me3gD] [^111TvHb3].

> I need to ensure pain is assessed, since untreated pain compromises gait and balance and is modifiable. The WFG explicitly recommends including pain screening within the multifactorial assessment, with escalation to comprehensive pain evaluation when indicated to reduce downstream mobility limitations and fear-driven inactivity [^113FW58c].

> I should review mental health, particularly depressive symptoms, because depression correlates with both falls and concerns about falling. The WFG advises screening for depression followed by further mental state assessment or referral as needed, integrating these findings into the overall plan to address intrinsic contributors [^112Jss6V].

> Let me verify environmental risk evaluation, because extrinsic hazards and behavior-environment fit are frequent contributors. The WFG calls for identifying hazards in the living environment and assessing the person's capabilities and behaviors regarding these hazards, and it also recommends asking about perceptions of falls, causes, risk, and prevention as part of a person-centered, behaviorally informed assessment that can improve uptake of home modifications and safer behaviors [^116aBNTB].

> Hold on, I should synthesize these domain findings into actionable decisions, not just a checklist. The WFG framework requires identifying a small set of modifiable drivers, aligning with the person's goals, priorities, and willingness to engage, and then selecting proportionate interventions by risk category; commentary on the GGF tool similarly emphasizes person-centeredness and suggests continuous scoring may aid local adaptation, which reminds me to present options in shared decision-making terms [^112mJ744] [^112GrYC8] [^115P7ef8].

> For low-risk individuals, I initially thought a single exercise recommendation might suffice, but let me reconsider and ensure preventive breadth. General fall education, encouragement of safe physical activity, and reassessment annually are reasonable, with exercise as a core modality; USPSTF supports offering exercise and multifactorial interventions to selected at-risk groups, and WFG endorses individualized balance-challenging and functional exercises at least three times weekly for at least 12 weeks, progressing intensity and sustaining longer for durable benefit [^112mJ744] [^112Tus3z].

> For intermediate risk, I should confirm that targeted multifactorial assessment plus structured strength and balance training is the backbone. I need to ensure programs include sit-to-stand and stepping, possibly tai chi, address identified environmental hazards, and implement medication optimization; this aligns with WFG recommendations and the broader framework linking assessment to tailored intervention intensity [^112Tus3z] [^112mJ744].

> For high-risk individuals, I should verify the need for a comprehensive, multiprofessional, multifactorial program with urgency. This includes supervised exercise therapy, vision correction, home modifications, medication optimization, management of chronic conditions, cognition and mood support, and technology-enhanced monitoring where appropriate; the WFG specifically calls for multiprofessional multifactorial assessment and intervention in high-risk community-dwelling older adults [^1141a4wt] [^112mJ744].

> Let me first confirm post-fall and syncope-related considerations, because mechanism matters for recurrence prevention. Immediate post-fall evaluation should review injuries and precipitating factors and adjust the plan, and cardiovascular work-up beyond initial assessment is not recommended unless syncope is suspected or there are abnormalities suggesting cardiogenic causes, in which case appropriate syncope pathways should be pursued [^113UHB8r] [^113aEsyA].

> Next, I should review documentation and coordination requirements, since prevention spans settings and disciplines. A concise falls care plan should capture the risk category, modifiable risk factors, chosen interventions, and responsible team members, and be shared with primary care, specialists, nursing, and community services; in hospital practice, I need to double-check that risk tools should not supplant clinical judgment and that documentation burden can erode direct care time, so streamlining while prioritizing clinical reasoning is essential [^112mJ744] [^115qVbTJ].

> I will now examine reassessment cadence and triggers. Fall risk is dynamic, so reassessment at least annually for low risk and every 3 to 6 months for intermediate to high risk is sensible, with immediate reassessment after falls, major health changes, new high-risk medications, or environmental changes; this maintains alignment with the WFG's iterative, person-centered model and supports timely intervention adjustments [^112mJ744] [^111YF6AT].

> But wait, what about overarching principles to avoid common pitfalls. I should emphasize that no single gait, balance, or mobility test is sufficient for accurate prediction, making multifactorial assessment the standard; ensure person-centeredness and setting-specific adaptation, recognize that many older adults misestimate their fall risk necessitating education to align subjective and objective risk, and remain mindful that inpatient fall precautions can unintentionally suppress mobility, so fall prevention should be balanced with mobility preservation [^1153Juyq] [^113Y3Kft] [^1176oUsj] [^112mJ744].

To assess fall risk, use a **multifactorial approach** [^112mJ744] that includes a structured history (prior falls, medications, comorbidities) [^111TvHb3], physical exam (gait, balance, strength, vision [^111RWW6W], cognition [^111Sye1Z]), and environment review [^111YF6AT]. Apply **validated tools** such as TUG, gait speed [^114wYxLq], and FES-I [^114joxHc] [^115dJw3p], and stratify risk to guide interventions [^112mJ744]. Reassess **annually** [^112mJ744] or after any fall or health change, and **document findings** to support individualized, evidence-based prevention.

---

## Step 1: initial screening and history-taking

Begin with a **structured history** to identify key risk factors:

- **Previous falls**: Strong predictor of future falls [^112mJ744] [^112me3gD].
- **Medications**: Especially psychotropics, antihypertensives, sedatives, and polypharmacy [^111TvHb3].
- **Comorbidities**: Cognitive impairment, depression, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease [^111Sye1Z] [^112Jss6V] [^113zf6gN].
- **Functional status**: Difficulties with ADLs, use of mobility aids, gait or balance problems [^112mJ744].
- **Environmental hazards**: Home hazards, poor lighting, uneven surfaces [^111YF6AT] [^111TvHb3].

---

## Step 2: physical examination and functional assessment

Conduct a focused **physical examination and functional assessment**:

- **Gait and balance**: Observe gait, balance, and posture; use TUG and gait speed [^114wYxLq] [^1153Juyq].
- **Strength and mobility**: Assess lower limb strength and mobility (e.g. chair stand test) [^114wYxLq].
- **Vision and hearing**: Measure visual acuity [^111RWW6W] and screen for hearing impairment [^114X9bMX].
- **Cognition and mood**: Screen for cognitive impairment [^111Sye1Z] and depression [^112Jss6V].

---

## Step 3: use of validated assessment tools

Incorporate **validated tools** to quantify risk:

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|
| Timed Up and Go (TUG) | Gait and balance | Community and clinical settings [^114wYxLq] [^1153Juyq] |
| Gait speed | Mobility assessment | Community and clinical settings [^114wYxLq] [^1176hitC] |
| Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) | Fear of falling | Community and clinical settings [^114joxHc] [^115dJw3p] |
| Berg Balance Scale (BBS) | Balance assessment | Clinical settings [^1153Juyq] [^116rYAqL] |

---

## Step 4: risk stratification

Stratify patients into **risk categories** to guide interventions. Define low risk as no falls, no gait/balance problems, and independent mobility; intermediate risk as a single non-severe fall or gait/balance problems; and high risk as multiple falls, severe injury, frailty, cognitive impairment, or inability to rise following a fall [^112mJ744] [^113525Wk]. Use this stratification to align prevention intensity with risk level.

---

## Step 5: individualized intervention planning

Develop **tailored interventions** based on risk level:

- **Low risk**: Primary prevention, education, and annual reassessment [^112mJ744].
- **Intermediate risk**: Strength and balance exercises, medication review, vision correction, environmental modifications [^112mJ744] [^112MrzV8] [^112Tus3z].
- **High risk**: Multifactorial interventions, comprehensive geriatric assessment, specialist referral, and close follow-up [^112mJ744] [^1141a4wt] [^112ah6ej].

---

## Step 6: documentation and follow-up

Document **all findings**, risk stratification, and interventions. Reassess **annually** or after any fall or significant health change [^112mJ744].

---

A comprehensive fall risk assessment uses a **multifactorial approach** with structured history, physical exam, validated tools, and risk stratification to guide individualized interventions and reduce falls [^112ah6ej].

### Everyday experiences of physical function and awareness of fall risk in older adulthood [^112pHnk7]. Innovation in Aging (2023). High credibility.

Accurate awareness of fall risk, the primary study outcome, was conceptualized as the alignment of subjective and objective functional capacity above and below the established fall-risk cutoffs. When objective fall risk was low, awareness of fall risk was indexed as aware of low risk (Q1) or underconfident (Q2), when aligned or misaligned with subjective fall risk, respectively. When objective fall risk was high, awareness of fall risk was indexed as aware of high risk (Q3) or overconfident (Q4), when aligned or misaligned with subjective fall risk, respectively.

Subjective fall risk was assessed at baseline and daily during the study using the validated activity-specific balance confidence scale (ABC). The ABC scale is correlated and exchangeable with the Falls-Efficacy Scale and was chosen to minimize the risk of priming participants to consider fear of falling while completing study tasks. The scale was modified for daily assessment. Participants indicated their confidence in maintaining balance while completing common activities today (e.g. "bend over and pick up a slipper from the front of a closet floor" or "stand on a chair and reach for something") by typing a number between 0 and 100 in the text box. Items were averaged to create a balance confidence score at baseline and for each day in the study, with higher values indicating greater confidence. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.94 to 0.97 during the study period, indicating high interitem reliability. Baseline and daily scores below 67 indicated low balance confidence and high subjective fall risk.

### Predicting falls in older adults: An umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^1153Juyq]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

To review the validated instruments that assess gait, balance, and functional mobility to predict falls in older adults across different settings.

- **Methods**: Umbrella review of narrative and systematic reviews, with or without meta-analyses, of all study types. Reviews that focused on older adults in any setting and included validated instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility were included. Medical and allied health professional databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to April 2022. Two reviewers undertook title, abstract, and full-text screening independently. Review quality was assessed through the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). Data extraction was completed in duplicate using a standardized spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was presented for each assessment tool.

- **Results**: Among 2736 articles initially identified, 31 reviews were included; 11 were meta-analyses. Reviews were primarily of low quality, thus at high risk of potential bias. The most frequently reported assessments were Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, gait speed, dual task assessments, single-leg stance, Functional Reach Test, tandem gait and stance, and the chair stand test. Findings on the predictive ability of these tests were inconsistent across the reviews.

- **Conclusions**: In conclusion, we found that no single gait, balance, or functional mobility assessment in isolation can be used to predict fall risk in older adults with high certainty. Moderate evidence suggests gait speed can be useful in predicting fall risk.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of concerns-about-falling instruments in older people and people at increased risk of falls [^115pa7uz]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

A comprehensive systematic review of the measurement properties of Falls Efficacy Scale International variants is lacking. This review includes 58 studies on reliability, validity, responsiveness, feasibility, and/or interpretability of four tools.

There is evidence for excellent measurement properties of all four instruments. We recommend their use with healthy older people and those at risk of falls, especially conditions that might affect mobility or balance. These findings contributed to the World Guidelines for Falls Prevention in Older Adults.

### Towards a core-set of mobility measures in ageing research: The need to define mobility and its constructs [^1145V67w]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). High credibility.

Standardization of measures in ageing research for data comparison and sharing requires uniform definitions and nomenclature. A key determinant and outcome of healthy ageing is mobility. Impaired mobility is reported to be prevalent in 46% of older adults and is associated with negative health outcomes such as dependency in activities of daily living (ADL), institutionalization, poor quality of life, and mortality. There are multiple risk factors for impaired mobility, such as walking impairment, injuries, falls, cognitive impairment, comorbidity, and psychosocial factors. Nevertheless, despite its apparent clinical importance, mobility is not uniformly defined. Mobility commonly refers to the movement of oneself or is referred to in the context of travel and commuting. Furthermore, mobility can be conceptualized using multiple interrelations within conceptual frameworks and encompasses various poorly defined underlying constructs and measures.

The World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines mobility in a general way as "movement by changing body position or location or by transferring from one place to another". This conceptual framework includes components of body functions and structures, activities, participation, environmental factors, and personal factors. Other frameworks encompass specific mobility domains, i.e. financial, psychosocial, environmental, physical, cognitive, and gender, as well as cultural and biographical influences, or focus on risk factors of mobility limitation. However, none of these are fully comprehensive.

### Identifying sensors-based parameters associated with fall risk in community-dwelling older adults: an investigation and interpretation of discriminatory parameters [^116rYAqL]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

During the experiment phase, participants were required to complete two sets of tests: the BBS assessment and the 3 m-TUG test.

- **BBS assessment**: The BBS consists of 14 items examining the balance capability of older adults, with each item scored on a scale of 0 to 4. If the participant is unable to do the task, the score is recorded as 0, and if they are able to complete it according to the criteria, the score is 4. The BBS is designed to objectively assess a person's ability to control balance in functional tasks. A cutoff score of 50 was proposed for predicting falls in community-dwelling older adults. Participants with a BBS score greater than 50 were labeled as low-fall-risk individuals, while those with scores of 50 or below were labeled as high-fall-risk individuals. Consequently, we identified twenty-six low-fall-risk individuals and fifteen high-fall-risk individuals.

- **3 m-TUG test**: Participants were required to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around 180°, then walk back and sit in the chair again. The TUG is a simple and feasible tool that can be administered in any setting at any time, involving basic mobility skills such as rising, turning, sitting, and walking. Thus, it is recommended as a screening tool to identify older adults with balance or gait impairments. In our experiment, all participants completed the TUG without any walking assistance.

### Validation and inter-rater reliability of a three item falls risk screening tool [^116pb6PZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Falls are one of the most common adverse events that occur during hospitalization. They can lead to injury, increased morbidity, longer hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs. It is estimated that the incidence is between 3 and 13 falls per 1,000 bed days, with approximately one in three hospital falls resulting in injury. A recent study showed that individuals who fell in the hospital had an extended stay of about four additional days, and if an injury occurred, it further increased the length of stay by another four days.

In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on reducing hospital falls. This priority is reflected in the accreditation standards for Australian hospitals (National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards), which includes 'Preventing falls and harm from falls' as one of the ten Accreditation Standards. One of the requirements of the standard is that patients be screened for fall risk. While several tools have been developed, it is crucial to validate the tool in the specific setting where it will be used.

Austin Health is a large tertiary hospital with approximately 980 beds, providing acute and subacute care across three campuses. To comply with accreditation guidelines, a falls risk screening system that could be implemented across the health service was needed. As nursing staff perform numerous assessments upon admission, the falls screening tool had to be completed swiftly to maximize compliance and minimize the documentation burden.

### Novel sensing technology in fall risk assessment in older adults: A systematic review [^113XpNW4]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, a wide range of sensor technologies have been utilized in fall risk assessment in older adults. Overall, these devices have the potential to provide accurate, inexpensive, and easy-to-administer, objective assessments of fall risk. However, the variation in measured parameters, assessment tools, sensor sites, movement tasks, and modeling techniques precludes a firm conclusion on their ability to predict future falls. There is potential for these assessments to be undertaken regularly in both clinical and non-clinical settings.

To generate clinically meaningful and easy-to-interpret information, proper sensor-based predictors need to be identified. Additionally, a gap between clinical functionality and user experience remains.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^113zf6gN]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for falls in the elderly, particularly for patients with Parkinson's disease, the WFG 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a falls risk assessment. This should include a self-report 3-risk factor assessment tool that considers a history of falls in the previous year, freezing of gait in the past month, and slow gait speed in older patients with Parkinson's disease.

### Predicting falls in older adults: An umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^1176hitC]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

Over one-third of adults aged 65 years and older fall at least once a year. Increasing age, frailty, comorbidity, impaired gait, muscle weakness, and impaired balance all contribute to the risk of falls. Falls are a major cause of disability and constitute the leading cause of injury-related mortality in people aged above 75 years. The importance of an individualized approach to screening, assessment, and intervention is emphasized across professional guidelines, such as the Steadi Algorithm. There is no clear consensus on the specific choice of fall assessment; however, professional guidelines state that adults at high risk should be able to access individually tailored multifactorial measures based on a comprehensive assessment. This should include assessment of gait, balance, and motor function with targeted interventions to address any limitation since these domains are associated with an increased risk of falls. Assessing these limitations could help to identify older adults at risk of falling and allow targeted intervention to reduce this risk.

Multiple approaches to assess gait, balance, and functional mobility have been developed, including the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and gait speed testing, such as the dual-task gait test. Although widely used across clinical practice, there appears to be little standardization and difficulty determining the most appropriate tool. Systematic reviews of individual tools have provided limited and conflicting evidence for a tool's predictive ability, thus precluding the ability to make clear recommendations.

### Ecological gait as a fall indicator in older adults: A systematic review [^112HCF7G]. The Gerontologist (2020). Low credibility.

Falls represent a major threat for elders, affecting their quality of life and life expectancy. Clinical tests and questionnaires have shown low diagnostic value concerning fall risk. Modern sensor technology allows in-home gait assessments, enabling the registration of older adults' ecological mobility and potentially improving the accuracy in determining fall risk. Therefore, this study examined the correlation between standardized assessments and ecological gait measures, comparing their ability to identify fall risk and predict prospective falls.

- **Research design and method**: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement guidelines.

- **Results**: From a total of 938 studies screened, nine articles with an observational study design were included. Evidence from selected works was subcategorized into: (i) correlations between ecological and clinical measures, (ii) comparative statistics of prospective fall prediction, and (iii) fall risk identification. Numerous correlations were observed between single ecological gait assessments and multiple clinical fall risk evaluations. Furthermore, the combination of daily-life features and clinical tests outcomes appeared to improve diagnostic accuracy in fall risk identification and fall prediction. However, it was not possible to understand the extent of this enhancement due to the high variability in models' parameters.

- **Discussion and implications**: Evidence suggests that sensor-based ecological assessments of gait could enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### Novel sensing technology in fall risk assessment in older adults: A systematic review [^115QtVCL]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Falls are the leading cause of accidental death and injury in older adults. One in three older adults over the age of 65 and one in two over 85 years of age will experience a fall in the next year, and a significant portion of those who fall will suffer an injury. Given the adverse consequences of falls in older adults, considerable research has focused on identifying individual fall risk factors and targeted fall prevention.

This collective research has revealed that falls and fall-related injuries are predictable and preventable with interventions targeting modifiable risk factors such as muscle strength, balance, and mobility. It is also maintained that effective fall prevention programs are cost-effective and an appropriate method to maximize the quality of life and maintain the independence of older adults. The first step to an effective fall prevention program is to identify those at risk of falling and then to determine the most appropriate interventions to reduce or eliminate falls.

### How accurate are geriatricians' fall predictions [^113DEcq1]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Older patients are at an increased risk of falling and of experiencing serious morbidity and mortality resulting from falls. The ability to accurately identify older patients at increased fall risk provides the opportunity to implement interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality. Geriatricians are trained to assess older patients for fall risk. If geriatricians can accurately predict fallers — as opposed to merely evaluating individual risk factors for falling — more aggressive and earlier interventions could be deployed to reduce falls in older adults. However, there is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the accuracy of geriatrician fall risk predictions. This study aims to determine the accuracy of geriatricians in predicting falls.

- **Methods**: Between October 2018 and November 2019, a convenience sample of 100 subjects was recruited from an academic geriatric clinic population seeking routine medical care. Subjects performed a series of gait and balance assessments, answered the Stay Independent Brochure, and were surveyed about fall incidence 6–12 months after study entry. Five geriatricians, blinded to subjects and fall outcomes, were provided the subjects' data and asked to categorize each as a faller or non-faller, with no requirements imposed on their use of the available data. These predictions were compared to predictions of an examining geriatrician who performed the assessments and to fall outcomes reported by subjects.

- **Results**: Kappa values for the five geriatricians who used all the available data to classify participants as fallers or non-fallers compare favorably with the outcomes.

### Risk prediction models for falls in hospitalized older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112me3gD]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

Falls in older adults are a complex issue with both intrinsic (individual characteristics) and extrinsic (environmental) risk factors. Most falls involve a combination of advanced age, health conditions, and interactions with the environment. Due to this complexity, predicting fall risk is challenging. This study summarized the most commonly reported influences on falls based on the final models' results. The top four factors identified were: mobility limitations, history of falls, medications, and mental cognition. While mobility testing is crucial for fall risk assessment, relying solely on a single test (e.g. Single Leg Stance Test, Timed Up and Go) is insufficient. Combining these tests with other factors improved the accuracy.

Indeed, although numerous fall risk assessment tools exist, achieving both high sensitivity and specificity remains difficult. Therefore, a more precise prediction model for hospitalized older adults is urgently needed for clinical application. A history of falls is a strong predictor of future falls and a major focus in clinical assessments. This is likely due to both the physical consequences (functional decline) and psychological impact (fear of falling (FOF)) of falls. Notably, FOF is prevalent, affecting 40–73% of older adults with a history of falls, and even half of those without.

Polypharmacy and specific medications like cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs significantly increase fall risk in hospitalized older adults with high comorbidity. Certain medications, including antiepileptic drugs, opioids, and those used in high quantities, pose a substantial risk.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^112m6SeM]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Falls in care homes - **Risk stratification and assessment**: Strong recommendation. Do not perform falls risk screening to identify care home residents at risk for falls, as all residents should be considered at high risk of falls. Perform a comprehensive multifactorial assessment at admission to identify factors contributing to fall risk and implement appropriate interventions to avoid falls and fall-related injuries in care home older adults. Expert recommendation. Conduct a post-fall assessment in care home residents following a fall to identify the mechanism of the fall, any resulting injuries, reassess the resident's fall risk factors, adjust the intervention strategy for the resident, and avoid unnecessary transfer to hospital. We recommend using the FES-I or especially the Short FES-I for assessing concerns about falling in long-term care facilities.

- **Recommendation details and justification**: All care home residents have a high risk of falling and may benefit from a multifactorial falls risk assessment and tailored intervention strategy. A multifactorial falls risk assessment at admission should include identifying falls risk factors and be repeated at least once annually or when the resident's condition changes, based on resource availability in each setting.

### Predicting the risk of falling — efficacy of a risk assessment tool compared to nurses' judgement: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^111v5VQ9]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The primary outcome is the number of participants with at least one fall at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures include the number of falls, clinical consequences such as fall and injury prevention measures applied, and side effects of the two risk assessment strategies. Side effects are defined as the application of physical or pharmacological restraints. Injuries and fractures related to falls, hospital admissions, consultations with a physician related to falls irrespective of the reason for falls, and costs will also be recorded.

Nursing staff are required to fill in a specially developed documentation sheet in case of a fall event, as well as a documentation sheet on measures used to prevent falls on a monthly basis. Data will be checked monthly during personal visits by the investigators. Although it is not possible to objectify the documented falls, in Germany, nurses are legally required to document falls in nursing homes. The interrater reliability of the Downton Index will be determined in a subgroup of nurses in the IG clusters.

It is assumed that about 45% of the participants in the control group will experience at least one fall in 12 months, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of ICCC = 0.075. A cluster-randomisation with about 20 participants in each cluster leads to a variation inflation factor of VIF = 2.425. Assuming that 20% of the participants will not complete follow-up and furthermore assuming an absolute difference of 15% (incidence of fallers in the Downton Index-group: 30%) to reach a significant result.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of concerns-about-falling instruments in older people and people at increased risk of falls [^115dJw3p]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

The 16-item Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) is widely used to assess concerns about falling. Variants include the 7-item Short FES-I, the 30-item Iconographical Falls Efficacy Scale (Icon FES), and the 10-item short Icon FES. No comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis have been conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the measurement properties of these tools.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the measurement properties of four FES-I variants.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched, and articles were independently assessed for eligibility. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias checklist. The quality of measurement properties was assessed using COSMIN criteria for good measurement properties. Where possible, meta-analysis was conducted; otherwise, narrative synthesis was performed. Overall certainty of the evidence was rated using a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system approach.

- **Results**: The review included 58 studies investigating the measurement properties of the four instruments. There was high-quality evidence to support the internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity of all instruments. Moderate- to high-certainty evidence suggests a one-factor structure of FES-I with two underlying dimensions, a one-factor structure of Short FES-I, and a two-factor structure of Icon FES. There was high-certainty…

### Development and applicability of a risk assessment tool for hospital-acquired mobility impairment in ambulatory older adults [^112iVWz3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

Mobility loss is common in hospitalized older adults, and resources to prevent mobility impairment are finite. Our goal was to use routinely collected data to develop a risk assessment tool that identifies individuals at risk of losing the ability to walk during hospitalization on the first hospital day. Second, we determined if the tool could inform the use of mobility-preserving interventions.

- **Methods**: We included patients admitted to a general medical service, aged ≥ 65 years, who walked occasionally or frequently on admission (Braden Scale Activity subset ≥ 3). Patients were considered to have a new mobility impairment if, at discharge, their ability to walk was severely limited or nonexistent, or they were confined to bed (Braden Scale Activity subset < 3). We used predictors available on the first hospital day to develop (2017–18 cohort) and validate (2019 cohort) a risk assessment tool. We determined the association between predicted risk and therapy use in the validation cohort to highlight the model's clinical utility.

- **Results**: A total of 5542 patients were included (median age 76 years, 48% women); 7.6% were discharged unable to walk. The model included five predictors: age, medication administrations, Glasgow Coma Scale verbal score, serum albumin, and urinary catheter presence. In the validation cohort, the model discriminated well (c-statistic 0.75) and was strongly associated with hospital-acquired mobility impairment (lowest decile 1%, highest decile 25%). In the validation cohort, therapy consultation ordering increased linearly with predicted risk; however, obse…

### Does concern about falling predict future falls in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162rSZY]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

The 2022 World Falls Guidelines recommend assessing concerns (or 'fears') about falling in multifactorial fall risk assessments. However, the evidence base for this recommendation is limited. This review evaluated the evidence for concerns about falling as an independent predictor of future falls, applying the Bradford Hill criteria for causality.

- **Methods**: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42023387212). MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched for studies examining associations between baseline concerns about falling and future falls in older adults (minimum 6-month follow-up). Meta-analyses examined associations between concerns about falling and future falls. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies, and evidence certainty was rated with GRADE.

- **Results**: About 53 studies, comprising 75,076 participants, were included. Meta-analysis showed a significant independent association between baseline concerns and future falls when using the Falls Efficacy Scale-International to assess concerns (full scale version, pooled OR = 1.03 [95% CI = 1.02–1.05] per 1-point increase; short scale version, pooled OR = 1.08 [95% CI = 1.05–1.11]). Significant associations were also observed when using single-item measures of concerns (pooled OR = 1.60 [95% CI = 1.36–1.89] for high vs. low concerns). In contrast, balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale) did not predict future falls (pooled OR = 0.97 [95% CI = 0.93–1.01]). Despite 26 studies being rated as poor quality, the data still revealed substantial findings in the context of fall prediction.

### Fall risk stratification in older adults: Low and not-at-risk status still associated with falls and injuries [^116boXJY]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Forty-one percent of those screened "not-at-risk" had a fall during the follow-up period, and 63% of them sustained injuries. Being screened as "not-at-risk" for falls does not mean no risk at all. Assessing gait speed universally — in all older adults screened — can detect those at-risk of injurious falls. Individuals classified as "not-at-risk" who walk slower than 1 m/s experienced double the risk of injuries, and they could benefit from primary prevention, including falls prevention exercises.

### Everyday experiences of physical function and awareness of fall risk in older adulthood [^113Y3Kft]. Innovation in Aging (2023). High credibility.

Falls, the leading cause of death and disability among older adults, occur in daily life when the demands of daily activities surpass the ability to maintain balance. An estimated 30% of older adults misestimate their physical function, placing them at greater risk of falling. This study examined how experiences of physical function are linked to awareness of fall risk in daily life.

- **Research design and methods**: For 30 consecutive days following a fall-risk assessment, 41 older adults (observations = 1,135; 56% women; age: 65–91) self-assessed objective and subjective fall risk using a custom smartphone application. Alignment of objective and subjective fall risk was indexed as awareness of fall risk. Postural sway was measured by the application. Physical and mobility symptoms and fear of falling were reported daily.

- **Results**: At baseline, 49% of participants misestimated their fall risk. Awareness of fall risk varied from day to day, and fall risk was misestimated on 40% of days. Multilevel multinomial models showed individual differences in the level of daily symptoms to increase the tendency to misestimate fall risk. Daily symptoms and fear of falling increased awareness of high fall risk, but daily symptoms threatened awareness of low fall risk.

- **Discussion and implications**: Findings suggest that misestimation of fall risk is common in older adulthood and informed by appraisals of physical function. Fall prevention strategies could support older adults in understanding their everyday physical function and provide tools to adjust the demands of daily activities accordingly.

### Risk prediction models for falls in hospitalized older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117No2rN]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Existing fall risk assessment tools in clinical settings often lack accuracy. Although an increasing number of fall risk prediction models have been developed for hospitalized older patients in recent years, it remains unclear how useful these models are for clinical practice and future research.

- **Objectives**: To systematically review published studies of fall risk prediction models for hospitalized older adults.

- **Methods**: A search was performed using the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases to retrieve studies of predictive models related to falls in hospitalized older adults from their inception until January 11, 2024. Data were extracted from included studies, covering study design, data sources, sample size, predictors, model development and performance. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) checklist.

- **Results**: A total of 8086 studies were retrieved, with 13 prediction models from 13 studies included after screening. Four models were externally validated, eight models reported discrimination metrics, and two models reported calibration metrics. Common predictors of falls included mobility, fall history, medications, and psychiatric disorders. All studies indicated a high risk of bias, primarily due to inadequate study design and methodological flaws. The AUC values of eight models ranged from 0.630 to 0.851.

- **Conclusions**: In the present study, all included studies had a high risk of bias, primarily due to the lack of prospective study designs.

### Predicting falls in older adults: an umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^1169ccNn]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Three reviewers (KR, DBJ, GO) extracted the data by using a predefined data extraction form developed specifically for this review. The following data were extracted: review details, including author(s), year of publication, country of lead author, type of participants, review objective, number of participants, age range of participants, mean age of participants, and proportion of women.

- **Search details**: sources searched, type of analysis (narrative review, systematic review without meta-analysis, or systematic review with meta-analysis), number of studies included in the review, design of studies included, and countries in which included studies were conducted.
- **Critical appraisal**: date range of included studies, critical appraisal tool(s) used in the review, and critical appraisal score.
- **Gait, balance, and functional mobility tests assessed**: fall prediction outcome, measurement of falls, predictive ability, reliability, validity (specificity, and sensitivity).
- **Cost**: any cost analysis conducted.

Three reviewers (KR, DBJ, GO) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). ROBIS assesses four domains: 1) study eligibility criteria; 2) identification and selection of studies; 3) data collection and study appraisal; and 4) synthesis and findings.

To provide key clinical and research recommendations on assessment tools for fall prevention, the findings were synthesized for the most commonly reported gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments.

### Predicting falls in older adults: An umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^111EF4cs]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Selection criteria**: We included the following types of review studies: narrative reviews, defined as reviews that may or may not present a systematic synthesis of findings from all individual studies included; systematic reviews without meta-analysis, defined as having an explicit reproducible methodology including a systematic search that aims to identify all studies that meet pre-specified eligibility criteria followed by a systematic presentation and synthesis of the findings of all included studies; and systematic reviews with meta-analysis, defined as systematic reviews using statistical techniques to combine and summarize the results of multiple studies.

	- **We excluded the following types of studies**: conference abstracts, student theses, books, book chapters, and papers reporting empirical data from a single study rather than reviewing more than one study. Reviews which included technology-based instruments only were excluded, as there is another ongoing systematic review on this topic from Working Group 8 of the task force on global guidelines for falls in older adults (PROSPERO CRD42021241177).

- **Populations and settings**: We included reviews of empirical studies in older adults (women and/or men), aged 60 years or older, in any setting. Specifically, we included reviews in all the following settings: the community, and primary and secondary care settings, including long-term care institutions, rehabilitation, and acute hospital settings. We also included reviews that presented data from various age groups in case they presented data on a subgroup of older adults.

### Falls in older adults: Risk assessment, management and prevention [^111BXNuW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Falls are a common and serious problem for older adults. This article reviews practical aspects of the evaluation and management of this disorder in the ambulatory setting. Older patients should be screened for falls or changes in mobility as part of their annual health maintenance examination. Most falls are due to multiple factors, including disorders of gait, balance, strength, and vision. Polypharmacy and certain medications contribute to falls in many patients and can be a remediable factor. Many falls can be prevented through individualized multicomponent interventions. Exercise programs, rehabilitation, medication management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency are the most effective single interventions. Referral to a geriatrician should be considered for patients with other common geriatric syndromes, such as cognitive impairment, incontinence, or depression.

### Fall risk stratification of community-living older people. Commentary on the world guidelines for fall prevention and management [^114wjHS9]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

The potential impact of fall risk models on healthcare systems largely depends on the proportion of individuals across risk categories. Thus, simulation studies should estimate the proportion of individuals assigned to each category using the GGF algorithm. These simulations should also consider the effect of the opportunistic time scheduling, given the variability of healthcare visits among individuals with different levels of fall risk.

Furthermore, we suggest that a risk model producing a continuous risk score, in combination with flexible thresholds, would make it easier to adjust the implementation of the GGF recommendations according to local context and resources.

Finally, the clinical effectiveness of the GGF risk stratification tool, like all screening tools, relies on the efficacy of the recommendations for preventive intervention or treatment. In hospital settings, it was found that fall risk stratification tools were not effective in reducing fall rates, besides taking considerable time to administer. At the time of writing, much of the research on artificial intelligence-based fall risk prediction models has focused on accurately predicting falls, without providing any link to fall prevention interventions or treatments. The new GGF further underscores the growing importance of shifting research focus towards the development of complete clinical decision support systems for fall prevention and treatment, combining prediction with recommendations on effective and targeted interventions.

### Validation and inter-rater reliability of a three item falls risk screening tool [^115qVbTJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

There is also a need to consider the resources spent on screening and assessing falls risk, particularly in the acute setting where people are typically in for short periods of time and can have significant changes in medical status. Clinical staff are required to complete a substantial amount of documentation, and there are concerns that this burden may reduce the time spent providing direct patient care. The clinical utility of screening tools is further compromised by non-completion and possible errors in completion when used as part of routine clinical practice, as observed in this study. While advancements such as electronic screening tools may enhance compliance, it is important that the potential benefits of generalized screening are balanced against the burdens. Other authors have also queried the importance placed on risk screening in hospitals. The revised NICE guidelines from the UK, which were released around the time this study was conceived, state that falls risk prediction tools should not be used in hospital settings. Despite this, many health services continue to rely on falls screening tools. To justify the burden associated with screening, a tool should offer superior predictive validity compared with clinical judgement alone. However, a systematic review of falls risk tools found validity did not differ between 'clinical judgement' of falls risk and other developed tools. Clinical judgement has been shown to be influenced by training and experience. However, the emphasis on the use of a validated screening tool may devalue the importance of clinical judgement.

### Older persons' experiences with wearable sensor-based fall risk screening in free-living conditions - a qualitative study [^112hhv2J]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Various methods have been used to identify older persons at risk of falling. Commonly, both self-reported and performance measures for fall risk assessment are used. Subjective measures, such as self-reported question-based tools, can be applied by older persons or healthcare personnel. In a study by Frisendahl et al, older persons found the use of a question-based screening tool for fall risk in clinical settings to be meaningful as it increased their awareness of their own abilities. The older persons felt motivated to prevent falls, but a low fall risk could create a false sense of security.

However, the predictive value of question-based tools for fall risk assessment has been questioned, and it is recommended that healthcare personnel use these tools with caution due to their limitations in identifying persons at risk. Alternative methods to measure fall risk include objective measures, such as physical tests of gait and balance, and functional mobility assessment. However, the predictive ability of the most used objective measures for fall risk assessment in community-dwelling older persons is inconsistent. This inconsistency is because no single physical test assessing objective measures can be used alone to predict falls in community-dwelling older persons. These findings highlight the need for alternative methods to assess fall risks among older persons more accurately.

### A systematic review of fall prediction models for community-dwelling older adults: Comparison between models based on research cohorts and models based on routinely collected data [^114PxyJz]. Age and Ageing (2024). Low credibility.

Prediction models can identify fall-prone individuals and can be based on either data from research cohorts (cohort-based) or routinely collected data (RCD-based). We review and compare cohort-based and RCD-based studies describing the development and/or validation of fall prediction models for community-dwelling older adults.

- **Methods**: Medline and Embase were searched via Ovid until January 2023. We included studies describing the development or validation of multivariable prediction models of falls in older adults (60+). Both risk of bias and reporting quality were assessed using the PROBAST and TRIPOD, respectively.

- **Results**: We included and reviewed 28 relevant studies, describing 30 prediction models (23 cohort-based and 7 RCD-based), and external validation of two existing models (one cohort-based and one RCD-based). The median sample sizes for cohort-based and RCD-based studies were 1,365 [interquartile range (IQR) 426–2,766] versus 90,441 (IQR 56,442–128,157), and the ranges of fall rates were 5.4% to 60.4% versus 1.6% to 13.1%, respectively. Discrimination performance was comparable between cohort-based and RCD-based models, with the respective area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0.65 to 0.88 versus 0.71 to 0.81. The median number of predictors in cohort-based final models was 6 (IQR 5–11); for RCD-based models, it was 16 (IQR 11–26). All but one cohort-based model had high bias risks, primarily due to deficiencies in statistical analysis and outcome determination.

Cohort-based models to predict falls faced challenges due to high bias risks.

### Everyday experiences of physical function and awareness of fall risk in older adulthood [^111PQpv1]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Low credibility.

Falls, the leading cause of death and disability among older adults, occur in daily life when the demands of daily activities surpass the ability to maintain balance. An estimated 30% of older adults misestimate their physical function, placing them at greater risk of falling. This study examined how experiences of physical function are linked to awareness of fall risk in daily life.

For 30 consecutive days following a fall-risk assessment, 41 older adults (observations = 1,135; 56% women; age: 65–91) self-assessed objective and subjective fall risk using a custom smartphone application. Alignment of objective and subjective fall risk was indexed as awareness of fall risk. Postural sway was measured by the application. Physical and mobility symptoms and fear of falling were reported daily.

At baseline, 49% of participants misestimated their fall risk. Awareness of fall risk varied from day to day, and fall risk was misestimated on 40% of days. Multilevel multinomial models showed individual differences in the level of daily symptoms to increase the tendency to misestimate fall risk. Daily symptoms and fear of falling increased awareness of high fall risk, but daily symptoms threatened awareness of low fall risk.

Findings suggest that misestimation of fall risk is common in older adulthood and informed by appraisals of physical function. Fall prevention strategies could support older adults in understanding their everyday physical function and provide tools to adjust their perceptions and behaviors accordingly.

### Prevention of falls in older people [^114PeYFC]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

In recent years, the evidence base for the prevention of falls in older people has increased. Associated with this expansion has been the growth of clinical services attempting to localize and implement strategies described in the literature. This article reviews the basic physiology involved in maintaining an upright posture and highlights the diversity of medical and non-medical risk factors associated with falls. It describes the clinical assessment of an older person at risk of falls and reviews the evidence for interventions in the prevention of falls in older individuals. The article also acknowledges the need for a clear strategic direction to successfully prevent falls, the requirement for ongoing research, and the necessity for service evaluation.

### Are triage questions sufficient to assign fall risk precautions in the ED [^111heNfW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Emergency Physicians Geriatric Emergency Department (ED) Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control recommend that older adults be assessed for the risk of falls. The standard ED assessment is a verbal query of fall risk factors, which may be inadequate. We hypothesized that the addition of a functional balance test endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control Stop Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries Falls Prevention Guidelines, the 4-Stage Balance Test (4SBT), would improve the detection of patients at risk for falls.

- **Methods**: A prospective pilot study of a convenience sample of ambulatory adults 65 years and older was conducted in the ED. All participants received the standard nursing triage fall risk assessment. After patients were stabilized in their ED room, the 4SBT was administered.

- **Results**: The 58 participants had an average age of 74.1 years (range, 65–94), 40.0% were women, and 98% were community dwelling. Five (8.6%) presented to the ED for a fall-related chief complaint. The nursing triage screen identified 39.7% (n = 23) as at risk for falls, whereas the 4SBT identified 43% (n = 25). Combining triage questions with the 4SBT identified 60.3% (n = 35) as at high risk for falls, compared with 39.7% (n = 23) with triage questions alone (p < 0.01). Ten (17%) of the patients at high risk by 4SBT and missed by triage questions were inpatients unaware that they were at risk for falls (new diagnoses).

- **Conclusions**: Incorporating a quick functional test of balance into the ED assessment for fall risk is feasible and significantly increases the detection of individuals at high risk.

### Predicting falls in older adults: An umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^114X5Rne]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

It was not possible from the umbrella review to provide guidance on the critical level of performance in gait speed associated with a higher risk of falling. The optimal cut-off in gait speed to predict falls has not been universally defined and accepted, although different cut-offs (e.g. 1 m/s, 0.8 m/s, 0.6 m/s) have been associated with various adverse health outcomes, including falls. Based on a systematic literature review, an International Academy on Nutrition and Ageing (IANA) expert panel advised assessing gait speed at a usual pace over 4 m and using the easy-to-remember cut-off point of 0.8 m/s to predict the risk of adverse outcomes.

The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was included in the search terms for this review; however, it was only reported in one review, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about its predictive ability in this review. In 2018, the SPPB was accepted by the European Medical Agency as an assessment tool to assess frailty. In addition, as the SPPB is widely used in geriatric and other medical fields, it is gaining importance. Single studies reported mixed results regarding fall prediction. Therefore, future research investigating its ability to predict falls and injurious falls is urgently needed.

Further studies are required to investigate the applicability and validity of fall risk assessment tests in different populations with varying functional levels. Different frailty or intrinsic capacity status may influence the fall predictive ability of these tests. Older frailer adults with cognitive or physical impairment may not be a…

### Identifying sensors-based parameters associated with fall risk in community-dwelling older adults: An investigation and interpretation of discriminatory parameters [^117LseDF]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Falls pose a severe threat to the health of older adults worldwide. Determining gait and kinematic parameters that are related to an increased risk of falls is essential for developing effective intervention and fall prevention strategies. This study aimed to investigate the discriminatory parameters, which lay an important basis for developing effective clinical screening tools for identifying high-fall-risk older adults.

- **Methods**: Forty-one individuals aged 65 years and above living in the community participated in this study. The older adults were classified as high-fall-risk and low-fall-risk individuals based on their BBS scores. The participants wore an inertial measurement unit (IMU) while conducting the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Simultaneously, a depth camera acquired images of the participants' movements during the experiment. After segmenting the data according to subtasks, 142 parameters were extracted from the sensor-based data. A t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed on the parameters for distinguishing older adults at high risk of falling. Logistic regression was used to further quantify the role of different parameters in identifying high-fall-risk individuals. Furthermore, we conducted an ablation experiment to explore the complementary information offered by the two sensors.

- **Results**: Fifteen participants were defined as high-fall-risk individuals, while twenty-six were defined as low-fall-risk individuals. Seventeen parameters were tested for significance with p-values less than 0.05. Some of these parameters, such as the usage of walking a…

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^115aJ2aT]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

There are several tests for assessing gait and balance impairment. For risk stratification, we recommend the use of gait speed, with a cut-off value of 15 seconds, although evidence for fall risk stratification is mixed. There is evidence that the TUG (Timed Up and Go test) is predictive of falls in lower-functioning adults.

An older adult who does not have a history of falling or who had a single non-severe fall and no gait or balance problems is deemed as being at low risk. Since low risk does not mean 'no risk at all', we recommend primary prevention for these older adults. This 'low risk' group should be reassessed annually. Older adults who had a single non-severe fall but also have gait and/or balance problems should be considered as being at 'intermediate risk' and would benefit from a strength and balance exercise intervention, as evidence shows that this type of exercise is effective in reducing falls risk.

Finally, those at 'high risk' include older adults with a fall and one or more of the following characteristics: (i) accompanying injury, (ii) multiple falls (≥ 2 falls) in the previous 12 months, (iii) known frailty, (iv) inability to get up after the fall without help for at least an hour, and (v) accompanied by (suspected) transient loss of consciousness. These high-risk older adults should be offered a multifactorial intervention tailored to their specific risk profile.

### How accurate are geriatricians' fall predictions [^115p15ns]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Worldwide, the percentage of persons over the age of 60 years is growing faster than any other age group. Fall-related injuries are a major source of morbidity and mortality for older adults, accounting for 40% of all injury-related deaths. In 2018, in the United States, 27.5% of adults aged 65 years and older reported at least one fall in the previous year, and 10.2% reported at least one fall-related injury. Health care spending on older adult falls in the U.S. is estimated to be $50 billion per year.

While falls are highly prevalent in older adults, they also represent a preventable source of morbidity, mortality, and cost to the healthcare system. If older adult fallers can be identified prior to an injurious fall, multifactorial risk factor assessment and intervention may prevent falls. However, over 100 fall risk assessment tools have been developed and published without a clear "gold standard" emerging. Given their clinical training, which includes fall risk assessment, geriatricians may be anticipated to possess a high degree of accuracy for predicting fall risk in older adults. However, there is a paucity of data to either support or refute this assertion, and a search of the medical literature reveals no publications directly comparing geriatricians' clinical gestalt for fall risk with more objective screening tools.

The purpose of this study is to compare the geriatricians' predictions of faller/non-faller to (a) comprehensive assessment by a single examining geriatrician reference standard and (b) participant falls reported at 6–12 months after.

### Mobility screening for fall prediction in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA): Implications for fall prevention in the decade of healthy ageing [^112xL2Ff]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines for fall prevention in older adults recommend mobility screening for fall risk assessment; however, there is no consensus on which test to use and at what cutoff. This study aimed to determine the accuracy and optimal cut-off values of commonly used mobility tests for predicting falls in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA).

- **Methods**: Mobility tests at baseline included the Timed Up and Go (TUG), Single Leg Stance (SLS), chair-rise, and gait speed. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 65 years and meeting first-level fall screening criteria (i.e. history of a fall or mobility problem) at baseline. Accuracy of fall prediction at 18 months for each test was measured by the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).

- **Results**: Of 1,121 participants that met inclusion criteria (mean age 75.2 ± 5.9 years; 66.6% women), 218 (19.4%) reported ≥ one fall at 18 months. None of the tests achieved acceptable accuracy for identifying individuals with ≥ one fall at follow-up. Among women 65–74 and 75–85 years, the TUG identified reFallers (≥ two falls) with optimal cut-off scores of 14.1 and 12.9 s (both AUCs 0.70), respectively. Among men 65–74 years, only the SLS showed acceptable accuracy (AUC 0.85) for identifying reFallers with an optimal cutoff of 3.6 s.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings indicate that commonly used mobility tests do not have sufficient discriminability to identify fallers in a population-based sample of community-dwelling older adults. The TUG and SLS can identify reFallers; however, their accuracy and cut-off values vary by demographic.

### Fall-risk evaluation and management: Challenges in adopting geriatric care practices [^113RvXWu]. The Gerontologist (2006). Low credibility.

One third of older adults fall each year, placing them at risk for serious injury, functional decline, and increased health care utilization. Despite the availability of effective preventive approaches, policy and clinical efforts at preventing falls among older adults have been limited. In this article, we present the burden of falls, review evidence concerning the effectiveness of fall-prevention services, describe barriers for clinicians and payers in promoting these services, and suggest strategies to encourage greater use of these services.

The challenges are substantial, but strategies for incremental change are available while broader changes in health care financing and clinical practice evolve to better manage the multiple chronic health conditions, including falls, experienced by older Americans.

### Is independence of older adults safe considering the risk of falls [^112KJjAV]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Risk of falls – statistical analysis

In the group of subjects prone to falls, difficulties in going out, feeling unsafe outside the home, and vision impairment were the dominant factors in the EASY-Care Standard 2010 risk of falls scale. A total of 74.81% of people prone to falls and 21.07% not prone to falls experienced previous falls.

The study found a negative correlation between the risk of falls scale in EASY-Care Standard 2010 and AMTS score (rs = -0.1696, p = 0.007), and a positive correlation with GDS (rs = 0.2347, p < 0.001). Analysis shows that the risk of falls increases with poorer mental ability, indicated by a lower AMTS score, and depression, indicated by a higher GDS score. A negative correlation (rs test) was also found between the level of functioning in basic activities of daily living (p < 0.001) and complex activities (p < 0.001) and the risk of falls. The risk of falls increased with poorer functioning in both scales.

Analysis of individual EASY-Care Standard 2010 fields identified the activities causing the greatest difficulties in independent functioning. It also identified those activities that might be the cause of falls and were not included in the risk of falls scale.

As a part of risk of falls factors, the following demographic variables were analyzed: sex, age, and form of residence. A relationship with age (chi2, p < 0.001) was found, but no relationship with sex (chi2, p = 0.215) or form of residence (chi2, p = 0.803).

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^115P7ef8]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for falls in the elderly — specifically with respect to risk prediction — the WFG 2022 guidelines recommend inquiring about the goals and priorities, attitudes to activities, independence and risk, as well as the willingness and capability of older adults. This should be part of a multifactorial falls risk assessment to inform decision-making on potential interventions.

### Fall risk stratification of community-living older people. Commentary on the world guidelines for fall prevention and management [^112GrYC8]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

- **Key points**: We comment on the fall risk stratification tool for community-dwelling older adults of the Global Guidelines for Falls (GGF). The GGF is a highly needed standardized risk stratification tool that combines evidence-based and expert-based recommendations. Additional validation is warranted to evaluate the accuracy, impact, and clinical effectiveness of the tool. Stratifying in three categories is straightforward; however, a continuous risk score could better adapt to local context and resources. Multifactorial fall risk prediction models could have better accuracy, although their usability requires further research.

We read with interest the recommendations for fall prevention and management proposed by the Task Force on Global Guidelines for Falls in Older Adults (GGF) and the tool proposed for fall risk stratification. As a group of researchers focused on fall risk in older adults, and as members of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Focus Group on 'Artificial Intelligence for Health', we would like to offer our perspective on the design, validation, usability, and potential impact of this tool and provide suggestions on future directions for the field.

The GGF algorithm is a flowchart that includes two entry points, three output risk categories, and three binary split nodes at the center. The first entry point relates to individuals having an annual health visit or an update to their health record, while the second relates to those presenting to healthcare services subsequent to a fall. The three output risk categories define the stratification process more clearly.

### Falls in the elderly: Assessment of prevalence and risk factors [^114Q82KP]. Pharmacy Practice (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on falls in the elderly:

- **Definition**: Falls in the elderly are accidental events due to the loss of center of gravity and imbalance, resulting in an increased risk of traumatic injuries and hospitalizations.

- **Pathophysiology**: Falls in the elderly can be caused by intrinsic factors, such as sight disorders, hearing disorders, balance deficits, alterations in the central nervous system, musculoskeletal alterations, and various pathologies, including neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, psychiatric, and iatrogenic. Extrinsic factors, such as environmental obstacles and inadequate footwear, also predispose individuals to falls. Recurrent falls may suggest elder abuse or neglect.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of falls in the elderly include pain, bruising, lacerations, fractures (mostly upper extremity and hip fractures), and intracranial bleeding in severe cases. Falls in the elderly increase the risk of hospitalizations and morbidity.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Falls-related mortality in adults aged 65, 75, and 85 years is 50 per 100,000, 150 per 100,000, and 5,252 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^113aEsyA]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for falls in the elderly, specifically concerning risk prediction through cardiovascular assessment, the WFG 2022 guidelines recommend not obtaining further cardiovascular assessment in the absence of abnormalities on the initial assessment, unless syncope is suspected (i.e. described or witnessed syncope/pre-syncope or unexplained falls).

### Revealing the tension: The relationship between high fall risk categorization and low patient mobility [^1176oUsj]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

Using an inpatient fall risk assessment tool helps categorize patients into risk groups, which can then be targeted with fall prevention strategies. While potentially important in preventing patient injury, fall risk assessment may unintentionally lead to reduced mobility among hospitalized patients. Here, we examined the relationship between fall risk assessment and ambulatory status among these patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutively admitted adult patients (n = 48,271) to a quaternary urban hospital that provides care for patients of broad socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. Non-ambulatory status, the primary outcome, was defined as a median Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility < 6 (i.e. patient walks less than 10 steps) throughout hospitalization. The primary exposure variable was the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) category (Low, Moderate, High). The capacity to ambulate was assessed using the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC). Multivariable regression analysis controlled for clinical demographics, JHFRAT items, AM-PAC, comorbidity count, and length of stay.

- **Results**: Eight percent of patients at low risk for falls were non-ambulatory, compared to 25% and 54% of patients at moderate and high risk for falls, respectively. Patients categorized as high risk and moderate risk for falls were 4.6 (95% CI: 3.9–5.5) and 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4–2.9) times more likely to be non-ambulatory compared to patients categorized as low risk, respectively.

### Population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people [^113E3621]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

We prepared summary of findings tables for each category of interventions and included data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomized trials in separate tables. We presented summary of findings tables for:

- **Medication or nutrition interventions**: Evidence derived from RCTs.
- **Multicomponent interventions**: Evidence derived from RCTs and from non‐randomized trials.

In the event that robust data were available from more than one study for these categories, we described the intervention components in the footnotes of the summary of findings table. Some studies reported outcomes using measures that did not precisely meet our outcome criteria (e.g. rate of events rather than the number of people experiencing one or more events). While we reported these data in the "Effects of interventions" section for completeness, we did not include these data in the summary of findings tables. Similarly, if studies reported a breakdown of data according to subgroups (such as participant age) in addition to the overall group, we included these data in the "Effects of interventions" section but not in the summary of findings tables.

We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence as it relates to the primary and secondary outcomes listed in "Types of outcome measures" (Schünemann 2020). The rating of high certainty is reserved for a body of evidence based on RCTs. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low depending on the presence and extent of specific limitations.

### Predicting falls in older adults: An umbrella review of instruments assessing gait, balance, and functional mobility [^11424Yx9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first umbrella review examining gait, balance, and functional mobility assessments in the prediction of falls for older adults. Further strengths of this umbrella review included following PRISMA reporting guidelines, conducting a comprehensive search for evidence with the support of a research librarian, and clearly stating the objectives beforehand and ensuring transparency with the published protocol. Furthermore, the selection of the included studies was performed in duplicate, with a third reviewer resolving any conflicts. The reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies in pairs, using a quality assessment tool designed specifically to assess the risk of bias in systematic reviews, and differences were discussed and resolved between reviewers.

However, this umbrella review has some limitations. The included studies were too heterogeneous to allow for direct comparison of results in a united meta-analysis. In addition, studies involved both prospectively and retrospectively reported falls, which might have contributed to some of the heterogeneity. Also, many of the included review studies were considered to have a high or unclear risk of bias with a lack of clear reporting. This limited the data that could be extracted and synthesized. The differences in the included studies were not statistically assessed, following advice from a statistician that it was not possible to do so due to heterogeneity between studies. We excluded review papers that were not available in English due to the resource constraints.

### Predicting the risk of falling — efficacy of a risk assessment tool compared to nurses' judgement: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^116d7Yid]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Fall prevention in the elderly has been recognised as an important area of research and intervention. Numerous studies have presented combinations of fall-related risk factors, and a number of risk assessment tools have been developed. However, few of these tools are based on rigorous research, and only a minority have been adequately tested for accuracy. Reproducibility and transportability have been rarely investigated. A recently conducted systematic review, including 27 publications on 25 non-laboratory fall risk assessment tools, found that only 13 instruments have been validated in different settings. Treatment paradox has been discussed by only four publications, although it seems to be an important source of bias in accuracy studies that use the number of fallers as the reference standard. However, there is no other measure to use as the gold standard for determining the validity of a fall risk assessment tool. Treatment paradox is difficult to overcome as it would be unethical to discourage fall prevention measures in the clinical setting in order to test risk assessment tools. None of the publications included in the systematic review reported or even discussed side effects of fall risk assessment, such as the application of physical restraints.

A German national nursing guideline on fall prevention discourages the use of a risk assessment tool. However, as shown in a national survey, these instruments are increasingly used throughout different nursing settings. Only three tools have been repeatedly evaluated in geriatric populations: the Tinetti Test, the Mobility…

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^112Tus3z]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventive measures for falls in the elderly, specifically concerning exercise interventions, WFG 2022 guidelines recommend offering individualized exercise programs. These programs should include balance-challenging and functional exercises, such as sit-to-stand and stepping. Sessions should occur at least three times weekly, with increasing intensity over a minimum of 12 weeks. Continuing the program for a longer duration may enhance its effectiveness in preventing falls among community-dwelling older adults.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^116gdBFD]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and societal costs due to the increased use of health and social services. Both bone fragility and the propensity to fall are critical determinants of fracture risk. International consensus advises that fracture prevention should encompass the identification of older adults at high risk of falls, interventions to mitigate that risk, identification of those with bone fragility, including osteoporosis, and the institution of pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures to reduce fracture risk.

Adults who experience low trauma fractures and those with osteoporosis should undergo a falls risk assessment. Fracture liaison services, which identify individuals with recent fractures, are operational in many areas. Their remit should include the identification of individuals at high risk of falling, in addition to investigating osteoporosis.

Conversely, those identified as having a moderate to high falls risk should have a bone health assessment using local protocols. In this regard, fracture risk assessment tools such as FRAX, Garvan, and QFracture can be employed to identify older adults at high fracture risk, and bone densitometry can confirm osteoporosis. International consensus osteoporosis management guidelines are established to guide treatment.

Individuals aged 60 years and over, with pre-existing comorbidities and an increased risk of fractures, should be regularly assessed for modifiable falls risk factors, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Furthermore, in individuals with fractures or an increased risk of fractures within LMIC, falls risk assessments should be conducted regularly.

### Is independence of older adults safe considering the risk of falls [^114VmqjF]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Falls affect approximately 30% of the elderly population annually and cause major injuries, reducing the independence of older adults' functioning. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of independence and identify fall risk factors within the study group.

- **Methods**: The study included 506 older adults, comprising patients from GP clinics and members of two senior centers, observed over 12 months. The study tools used were the EASY-Care Standard 2010 questionnaire, Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), Index Barthel, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Timed Up and Go (TUG).

- **Results**: The study included 357 (70.6%) female and 149 (29.4%) male subjects, with a mean age of 75.7 years ± 8.0. Most subjects were independent in both basic (Index Barthel) and instrumental (IADL) activities. Gait fluency, evaluated using the TUG scale, revealed slow and unsteady gait in 33.7% of subjects. Also, 27.5% of subjects used mobility aids when walking. On the Risk of Falls scale, 131 subjects (25.89%) were at risk. According to logistic regression, the main fall risk determinants (p < 0.05) were age, previous falls, feet problems, lack of regular care, impaired vision, urinary incontinence, pain, sleeping disorders, and lowered mood.

- **Conclusions**: The risk of falls increases in individuals who are less independent in basic and complex life activities and those with depression. Most risk factors identified can be modified.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for falls in the elderly, specifically with respect to risk prediction and the assessment of mental health, the WFG 2022 guidelines recommend assessing for depressive symptoms as part of a multifactorial falls risk assessment. This should be followed by further mental state assessments if necessary, and referral to a specialist where appropriate.

### Population-based interventions for preventing falls and fall-related injuries in older people [^111TvHb3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Falls represent a global public health concern, with nearly 700,000 accidental deaths globally every year and are the second‐leading cause of mortality caused by unintentional injury after road traffic injuries. People aged 60 years and older represent the majority of fall‐related mortality cases. There is no agreed age cut‐off to determine older people; usually, a cut‐off of 60 years and older or 65 years and older is used.

A fall can be defined as "an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor or lower level". Physiological, cognitive, and environmental risk factors are responsible for an increased risk of falls and fall‐related injuries in older people. Risk factors include socio‐demographic factors (such as age or sex), psychological factors (cognitive impairment, depression, concerns about falling, etc), medical conditions (number of comorbidities, Parkinson's, stroke, etc), medication use (total number of medications and types of medication, e.g. antiepileptics, sedatives, antihypertensive), and mobility and sensory issues (history of falls, walking aid use, gait problems, disability, vision or hearing impairment, physical inactivity, etc). Cognitive risk factors are related to deficits in executive function, such as slower processing speed and reaction times. Environmental factors include poor footwear, inappropriate lighting, and uneven surfaces.
