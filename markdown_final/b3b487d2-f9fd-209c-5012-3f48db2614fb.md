## Question

Different types of eye infections

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the different types of eye infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching classification framework by etiology and ocular anatomy. Then, I should verify the major categories and their clinical significance. Next, I will examine bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections with key pathogens and distinguishing features. After that, I need to consider special populations and emerging issues like antimicrobial resistance and COVID-19. Finally, I will integrate diagnostic principles and management priorities, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too broad or unsupported by the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework so I don't miss anything important. Eye infections are best organized by etiologic class (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) and by anatomic site (external ocular surface, intraocular structures, and ocular adnexa), because both dimensions guide urgency, diagnostics, and therapy; this is consistently emphasized in contemporary overviews and preferred practice patterns, and it aligns with microbiology guidance that all major pathogen groups can involve the eye, requiring specimen-source triage for actionable results [^4b000d16] [^718e456b] [^cfd53a35].

> I will now examine bacterial infections, starting with conjunctivitis, since it is the most common ocular infection and often the entry point for clinicians. Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I overgeneralize: in adults, viral etiologies predominate, whereas in children bacterial causes are more frequent, with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis leading in pediatrics, and Staphylococcus aureus more common in adults; this age-related pattern is supported by high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and it helps explain why empiric antibiotics are more often justified in children than in adults [^534f7176] [^2e85962b] [^8022567f]. Hold on, I should also distinguish hyperacute gonococcal conjunctivitis, which is a sight-threatening emergency requiring urgent systemic and topical therapy, from milder forms that are often self-limited; this distinction is critical to avoid delays in treatment [^a829e093].

> Next, I should review bacterial keratitis, because corneal infections carry high morbidity. Contact lens wear is a major modifiable risk factor, with an estimated incidence around 27.6 per 100,000 person-years in the U.S.; Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen in contact lens–associated disease, while Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae are common in community-acquired cases; I need to ensure I note that smears and cultures are indicated in severe, nonhealing, or atypical cases to guide therapy and detect resistance, which is emphasized in preferred practice patterns [^b031976d] [^473b1290]. But wait, what if the ulcer is not responding to empiric therapy? In that scenario, I should double-check for fungal or herpetic etiologies and consider alternative diagnostics, as misclassification delays appropriate treatment and worsens outcomes [^85653d7a].

> I will now examine endophthalmitis, where timing and organism profile drive prognosis. Exogenous endophthalmitis follows surgery or trauma, whereas endogenous forms arise from hematogenous spread; coagulase-negative staphylococci dominate postoperative cases, but Gram-negative rods, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae, are overrepresented in endogenous disease in East Asia, and fungi such as Candida and Aspergillus account for a meaningful minority; I should confirm that emergent intravitreal antibiotics and consideration of vitrectomy are standard, with systemic therapy guided by the organism and source control when applicable [^225cea64] [^1c1d4001]. Hold on, I should verify the role of screening after candidemia; the AAO advises against routine ophthalmic screening in asymptomatic candidemia, favoring clinical-driven evaluation, which I need to keep in mind to avoid low-value care [^e7ba61a5].

> Let me consider adnexal bacterial infections next. Blepharitis is common and often chronic, frequently due to staphylococcal species and associated with meibomian gland dysfunction; dacryocystitis reflects nasolacrimal duct obstruction with secondary infection and can seed more serious disease if not addressed; orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency requiring urgent imaging and systemic antibiotics to prevent vision loss and intracranial complications; I should confirm that cultures from lids and lacrimal sites often yield commensals, so clinical correlation is essential to avoid overcalling colonization as infection [^266be982] [^c3fef94d].

> Now, I should review viral infections, starting with conjunctivitis. Adenoviruses cause roughly 80% of acute viral conjunctivitis, with characteristic watery discharge, follicles, and preauricular nodes; herpes simplex virus can cause conjunctivitis with epithelial keratitis and is a leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in developed countries; I need to ensure I distinguish adenoviral disease from bacterial conjunctivitis and from allergic etiologies, as misdiagnosis drives unnecessary antibiotics and poor outcomes [^534f7176] [^d6e45a3f]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic clues again: concomitant pharyngitis, preauricular lymphadenopathy, and contact with others with red eye increase the likelihood of viral disease, whereas mucopurulent discharge favors bacterial etiology, though no single sign is pathognomonic [^2e85962b].

> Next, I should review viral keratitis and retinitis. HSV epithelial keratitis presents with dendritic ulcers and requires prompt antiviral therapy to limit scarring; VZV can cause a similar pattern and may be more aggressive in immunocompromised hosts; CMV retinitis is a hallmark of advanced HIV and requires urgent anti-CMV therapy and immune recovery planning; I should confirm that ophthalmology co-management is essential in these entities to optimize outcomes and monitor for complications like immune recovery uveitis [^d6e45a3f] [^1311d3f2]. Hold on, I should verify that emerging viral diseases like Zika and SARS-CoV-2 can manifest with ocular involvement; indeed, conjunctivitis is a recognized manifestation of COVID-19, though the ocular surface appears to be a relatively uncommon portal and transmission risk is likely low but not zero, which has infection control implications in healthcare settings [^5bdd4e8e] [^8ed7e0a0].

> I will now examine fungal infections, which are rare but sight-threatening. Fungal keratitis is classically linked to trauma with plant material and is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions; Fusarium and Aspergillus are common culprits, and Candida is more typical in immunocompromised hosts or with indwelling devices; I should confirm that early antifungal therapy and, when indicated, therapeutic keratoplasty improve outcomes, and that misdiagnosis as bacterial disease delays appropriate treatment [^938b4421] [^5fe1f5b3]. For endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, Candida is the leading cause, with Aspergillus second; management requires coordinated systemic and intravitreal antifungals, often with vitrectomy, and screening strategies after candidemia should be individualized rather than universal, given low yield and potential harms of overtreatment [^d2a2d16e] [^e7ba61a5].

> Let me consider parasitic infections, and I should double-check the major entities. Toxoplasma gondii causes posterior uveitis with necrotizing retinochoroiditis and is a major cause of visual loss after congenital or acquired infection; Acanthamoeba keratitis is strongly associated with contact lens misuse and exposure to water, and requires aggressive topical antiamebic therapy; onchocerciasis and toxocariasis are geographically restricted but important causes of blindness in endemic regions; I need to ensure I emphasize that these diagnoses require a high index of suspicion and, in many cases, targeted laboratory confirmation [^4c2e66e8] [^475fb194]. Hold on, I should verify that Acanthamoeba is indeed a free-living amoeba and not a bacterium; yes, it is a protozoan parasite, which explains its distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approach compared with bacterial keratitis [^475fb194].

> Next, I should review special populations and emerging issues. In neonates, gonococcal and chlamydial conjunctivitis are preventable causes of blindness; universal prophylaxis with erythromycin 0.5% ointment is recommended in the U.S., though evidence quality for preventing serious outcomes is limited and practice may vary by risk and legislation; I should confirm that neonates with purulent discharge require urgent evaluation and systemic therapy for gonococcus to prevent corneal perforation [^e7b343d0] [^706c4ea2] [^8930dbde]. In immunocompromised patients, CMV retinitis and HSV keratitis are more common and may be atypical, necessitating lower thresholds for ophthalmic consultation and aggressive therapy; in contact lens wearers, risk behaviors like sleeping in lenses and exposure to water drive Acanthamoeba and Pseudomonas infections, so counseling on hygiene is essential [^1311d3f2] [^eac064b0].

> I need to ensure I address antimicrobial resistance, which is reshaping empiric choices. Overuse of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics contributes to resistance among common ocular pathogens, and emerging multidrug-resistant organisms complicate keratitis management; stewardship principles include reserving cultures for severe or nonhealing cases, using the narrowest effective agent, and avoiding unnecessary therapy for viral disease; I should double-check that guidelines increasingly call for culture-directed therapy in refractory cases to preserve visual outcomes [^ff5eecec] [^473b1290]. But wait, what if access to culture is limited? In resource-limited settings, empiric regimens must balance local epidemiology and availability, underscoring the need for surveillance and access to effective antifungals and antiamebics where indicated [^585c4659].

> Next, I should review diagnostic principles so I don't overstate any test. No single clinical sign reliably distinguishes viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, so history and examination must be integrated; in severe keratitis or suspected endophthalmitis, corneal scrapings or intraocular fluids should be sent for Gram stain, culture, and, when available, molecular testing, as NAATs improve sensitivity for fastidious organisms; I should confirm that preanalytic communication of suspected source and timing of antibiotics improves yield and turnaround [^2e85962b] [^df708f05] [^55c23eaf]. Hold on, I should verify that molecular testing is not FDA-cleared for ocular specimens; correct, many NAATs are lab-developed and require clinical correlation, especially when commensals are detected [^55c23eaf].

> Finally, I should synthesize management priorities to close the loop. For mild viral conjunctivitis, supportive care and strict hygiene are first-line; for suspected bacterial conjunctivitis in children or with purulent discharge, topical antibiotics can shorten disease; for keratitis, urgent topical therapy with close follow-up is essential, escalating to fortified regimens or antifungals if there is no improvement; for endophthalmitis, emergent intravitreal antibiotics and vitrectomy are time-critical; for systemic infections with ocular involvement, coordinate with infectious diseases and ophthalmology for source control and organ-specific therapy; and throughout, educate patients on hand hygiene, contact lens safety, and red flags that mandate urgent care to prevent complications and transmission [^8263bd76] [^b031976d] [^1c1d4001] [^4c2e66e8]. I should double-check that these priorities align with guideline-based care; yes, they reflect contemporary preferred practice patterns and multidisciplinary guidance for complex infections [^718e456b] [^1311d3f2].

Eye infections are classified by **anatomic site** (conjunctiva, cornea, eyelids, intraocular) and **etiologic agent** (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) [^4b000d16]. The most common are **conjunctivitis** (viral or bacterial) [^534f7176], **keratitis** (often contact lens–related) [^b031976d], and **endophthalmitis** (post-surgical or endogenous) [^62586193]. Viral infections predominate in adults [^2e85962b], whereas bacterial infections are more frequent in children [^2e85962b]; fungi and parasites are less common but can cause severe disease [^5fe1f5b3] [^4c2e66e8]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features plus targeted cultures or molecular testing [^54f5c61f] [^55c23eaf], and management is etiology-specific, with urgent ophthalmology referral for vision-threatening disease [^713d46f2].

---

## Classification by anatomic site

Eye infections are categorized by the **involved ocular structure**:

| **Anatomic site** | **Clinical entity** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Conjunctiva | Conjunctivitis | Inflammation of the conjunctiva; viral, bacterial, allergic, or chemical [^534f7176] [^f12ef21c] |
| Cornea | Keratitis | Corneal infection; bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic [^b031976d] [^585c4659] |
| Eyelids | Blepharitis, hordeolum | Inflammation of eyelid margins or glands; bacterial [^c3fef94d] |
| Intraocular | Endophthalmitis, uveitis | Infection within the eye; bacterial, fungal, or viral [^62586193] [^ef8afddc] |
| Orbit | Orbital cellulitis | Infection of orbital tissues; bacterial [^585c4659] |

---

## Bacterial eye infections

Bacterial infections are a major cause of ocular morbidity [^c3fef94d]; **Gram-positive organisms** predominate, but Gram-negative pathogens are increasingly recognized [^a100176d].

- **Conjunctivitis**: Commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [^534f7176]; acute bacterial conjunctivitis is often self-limited but antibiotics shorten duration [^a829e093].

- **Keratitis**: Contact lens wear increases risk; Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus are frequent [^b031976d]; can progress to corneal scarring and blindness if untreated [^c3fef94d].

- **Endophthalmitis**: Postoperative or endogenous; coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, and Gram-negative rods are common [^225cea64]; vision-threatening emergency [^1c1d4001].

- **Blepharitis and hordeolum**: S. aureus is typical; chronic disease can cause lid margin scarring and lash loss [^c3fef94d].

---

## Viral eye infections

Viruses cause about 80% of acute conjunctivitis in adults [^534f7176]; **adenovirus** is the most common, with HSV and VZV causing significant corneal disease [^d6e45a3f].

- **Viral conjunctivitis**: Adenovirus causes epidemic keratoconjunctivitis; HSV and VZV cause conjunctivitis with corneal involvement [^286dd208] [^d6e45a3f].

- **Herpetic keratitis**: HSV is the leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in developed countries; recurrent disease is common [^d6e45a3f].

- **CMV retinitis**: Occurs in immunocompromised patients, especially with HIV; can cause rapid vision loss without treatment [^1311d3f2].

---

## Fungal eye infections

Fungal infections are rare but **vision-threatening**; they include keratitis and endophthalmitis [^5fe1f5b3].

- **Fungal keratitis**: Associated with trauma, contact lenses, or immunosuppression; Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium are common [^585c4659].

- **Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis**: Hematogenous spread, often Candida or Aspergillus; requires systemic and intravitreal antifungals [^d2a2d16e].

---

## Parasitic eye infections

Parasitic infections are less common globally but can cause **severe ocular damage** [^4c2e66e8].

- **Acanthamoeba keratitis**: Contact lens–related; chronic, painful, and difficult to treat [^475fb194].

- **Toxoplasma gondii**: Causes posterior uveitis and retinochoroiditis; congenital or acquired [^4c2e66e8].

- **Onchocerciasis**: River blindness; chronic keratitis and optic atrophy in endemic regions [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Neonatal conjunctivitis**: Ophthalmia neonatorum from Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae; prophylaxis is recommended [^e7b343d0] [^706c4ea2].

- **Contact lens wearers**: Higher risk for keratitis from Pseudomonas, Acanthamoeba, and fungi; hygiene education is critical [^eac064b0].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk for severe viral, fungal, and bacterial infections, including CMV retinitis and endogenous endophthalmitis [^1311d3f2] [^d2a2d16e].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis integrates clinical features with **targeted testing** [^54f5c61f]. Clinical features guide the differential, while **microbiology** — culture, Gram stain, and molecular testing (PCR) — confirms etiology and guides therapy [^55c23eaf]. Imaging (ultrasound, CT/MRI) is used for deep or orbital disease [^1c1d4001].

---

## Management principles

Management is **etiology-specific**: antibiotics for bacteria, antivirals for viruses, antifungals for fungi, and anti-parasitics for parasites. Urgent ophthalmology referral is indicated for vision-threatening disease (e.g. keratitis, endophthalmitis, orbital cellulitis) [^713d46f2]. Supportive care includes analgesia, hygiene, and patient education to prevent transmission [^8263bd76].

---

Eye infections span conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, blepharitis, and orbital cellulitis, with bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic causes; **accurate diagnosis and timely, etiology-specific therapy** are essential to prevent vision loss [^4b000d16].

### Will vaccination against human papillomavirus prevent eye disease? A review of the evidence [^5a322813]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in eye disease is controversial. However, a recent case illustrates the possible role of HPV in conjunctival squamous carcinoma and the potentially devastating effects of this disease. The development of two vaccines to prevent infection with HPV types most commonly associated with anogenital cancers has led to debate about the pros and cons of a national immunisation programme to prevent cervical cancer. The introduction of such a vaccination programme may have an additional beneficial effect on the occurrence of some head and neck, including ocular, cancers. This review discusses the nature of papillomaviruses, mechanisms of infection and carcinogenesis, the possible role of HPV in eye disease, and finally the likely impact of the new prophylactic vaccines.

### About fungal eye infections… [^5fe1f5b3]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

About Fungal Eye Infections Eye infections can be caused by many different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, amoeba, and fungi. Eye infections caused by fungi are extremely rare, but they can be very serious. Types of fungal eye infections Fungal infections can affect different parts of the eye.
- Keratitis is an infection of the clear, front layer of the eye.
- Endophthalmitis is an infection of the inside of the eye. There are two types of endophthalmitis: exogenous and endogenous. Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs after fungal spores enter the eye from an external source. Endogenous endophthalmitis occurs when a bloodstream infection spreads to one or both eyes. Types of fungi that cause eye infections Many of different types of fungi can cause eye infections.

Common types include: Fusarium– a fungus that lives in the environment, especially in soil and on plants Aspergillus– a common fungus that lives in indoor and outdoor environments Candida– a type of yeast that normally lives on human skin and on the protective lining inside the body called the mucous membrane Page last reviewed: January 14, 2021.

### Bacterial profile of ocular infections: a systematic review [^586811f6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria are threats of ophthalmic tissues. However, Gram positive bacteria are the major contributor of ocular infections. Bacterial ocular infection involves but is not limited to blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, and orbital cellulitis. The distribution and proportion of bacterial isolates varied among the different clinical diagnoses but without exclusive anatomical restriction. To mitigate the burden of bacterial ocular infections, physicians should regard on risk reduction and comply with etiologic approach of diagnosis.

### Diagnosis of infectious diseases of the eye [^54f5c61f]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Specific therapy of ocular infections often requires etiological diagnosis that is a combined effect of observation of characteristic clinical features and microbiological investigations. Clinical impression is central to guiding the laboratory investigation, and the aim of laboratory investigation is to confirm or rule out the clinical diagnosis. However, clinical features may vary considerably, and no one clinical feature may be pathognomonic of a particular pathogen. In addition, there may be a racial, geographical, and climatic difference in the distribution and type of causative agents associated with infections. Ophthalmologists have at their disposal in vivo and in vitro methods of diagnosis of ocular infections. The expertise of the clinician and the microbiologist along with the facilities available, determine the success with accurate diagnosis. A wide range of conventional and molecular techniques are available that not only provide rapid diagnosis for known common infections but have the potential to bring to the fore unknown organisms that may be associated with ocular infections.

### Infectious eye disease in the 21st century-an overview [^9d7e62b7]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases affecting the eye often cause unilateral or asymmetric visual loss in children and people of working age. This group of conditions includes viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases, both common and rare presentations which, in aggregate, may account for a significant portion of the global visual burden. Diagnosis is frequently challenging even in specialist centres, and many disease presentations are highly regional. In an age of globalisation, an understanding of the various modes of transmission and the geographic distribution of infections can be instructive to clinicians. The impact of eye infections on global disability is currently not sufficiently captured in global prevalence studies on visual impairment and blindness, which focus on bilateral disease in the over-50s. Moreover, in many cases it is hard to differentiate between infectious and immune-mediated diseases. Since infectious eye diseases can be preventable and frequently affect younger people, we argue that in future prevalence studies they should be considered as a separate category, including estimates of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) as a measure of overall disease burden. Numbers of ocular infections are uniquely affected by outbreaks as well as endemic transmission, and their control frequently relies on collaborative partnerships that go well beyond the remit of ophthalmology, encompassing domains as various as vaccination, antibiotic development, individual healthcare, vector control, mass drug administration, food supplementation, environmental and food hygiene, epidemiological mapping, and many more. Moreover, the anticipated impacts of global warming, conflict, food poverty, urbanisation and environmental degradation are likely to magnify their importance. While remote telemedicine can be a useful aide in the diagnosis of these conditions in resource-poor areas, enhanced global reporting networks and artificial intelligence systems may ultimately be required for disease surveillance and monitoring.

### Bacterial profile of ocular infections: a systematic review [^c3fef94d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bacteria are the major contributor of ocular infections worldwide. Infection can be mono or poly-microbial and is associated with many factors including contact lenses, trauma, surgery, age, dry eye state, chronic nasolacrimal duct obstruction and previous ocular infections. Bacteria are generally associated with many types of ocular infections such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, blepharitis, orbital cellulitis and dacryocystitis manifestations.

Conjunctivitis, inflammation of the mucosa of conjunctiva, is the most frequent ocular case with noticeable economic and social burdens. During chronicity, the disease can affect not only the conjunctiva but also adjacent structures including the eye lid and can be a potential risk for other extra or intraocular infections. Bacteria contribute for about 50–70% of infectious conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly seen in children and the elders but can also be presented among neonates and adults.

Blepharitis which is an inflammation of the eyelid can cause loss of eye lash. The infection may not remain localized and is known to spread to other anatomical sites of the eye. Keratitis, the most serious eye infection is the leading cause of corneal blindness. Moreover, the disease can also progress to endophthalmitis if not diagnosed early.

Exogenous endophthalmitis is an infective complication of primary cataract, intraocular surgery and ocular trauma due to the introduction of infectious pathogens like bacteria whereas the endogenous one is commonly due to systemic dissemination of the pathogens. Both keratitis and endophthalmitis are potentially devastating ocular infections if not diagnosed early.

Dacryocystitis is an inflammation of the nasolacrimal duct. During chronicity the disease is associated with infection, inflammation of the conjunctiva, accumulation of fluid and chronic tearing. This can be potentially dangerous to ocular tissues such as the cornea; leading to post surgery endophthalmitis.

Ocular infections, if left untreated, can damage the structures of the eye leading to visual impairments and blindness. Even though the eye is hard and protected by the continuous flow of tear which contains antibacterial compounds, inflammation and scarring once occurred may not be easily resolved and requires immediate management. Effective management of such infections demands knowledge of the specific etiology. However, ocular infections are mostly managed empirically and little is known about the specific bacterial etiologies. Therefore, the main goal of this work was to review the bacterial profile of the different forms of ocular infections in order to come up with concrete information for physicians and policy makers who deals with ocular infections.

### Could infectious agents play a role in the onset of age-related macular degeneration? A scoping review [^f316c1a0]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic

This scoping review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on the potential involvement of infections in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Clinical Relevance

Age-related macular degeneration is a multifactorial disease and the leading cause of vision loss among older adults in developed countries. Clarifying whether certain infections participate in its onset or progression seems essential, given the potential implications for treatment and prevention.

Methods

Using the PubMed database, we searched for articles in English, published until June 1, 2023, whose title and/or abstract contained terms related to AMD and infections. All types of study design, infectious agents, AMD diagnostic methods, and AMD stages were considered. Articles dealing with the oral and gut microbiota were not included but we provide a brief summary of high-quality literature reviews recently published on the subject.

Results

Two investigators independently screened the 868 articles obtained by our algorithm and the reference lists of selected studies. In total, 40 articles were included, among which 30 on human data, 9 animal studies, 6 in vitro experiments, and 1 hypothesis paper (sometimes with several data types in the same article). Of these, 27 studies were published after 2010, highlighting a growing interest in recent years. A wide range of infectious agents has been investigated, including various microbiota (nasal, pharyngeal), 8 bacteria, 6 viral species, and 1 yeast. Among them, most have been investigated anecdotally. Only Chlamydia pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B virus received more attention with 17, 6, and 4 studies, respectively. Numerous potential pathophysiological mechanisms have been discussed, including (1) an indirect role of infectious agents (i.e. a role of infections located distant from the eye, mainly through their interactions with the immune system) and (2) a direct role of some infectious agents implying potential infection of various cells types within AMD-related tissues.

Conclusions

Overall, this review highlights the diversity of possible interactions between infectious agents and AMD and suggests avenues of research to enrich the data currently available, which provide an insufficient level of evidence to conclude whether or not infectious agents are involved in this pathology.

### Ocular manifestations of infectious skin diseases [^1c941344]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Ocular complications of infectious skin diseases are a common occurrence. Managing the inflamed or infected eye in the emergency setting presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the emergency physician. Infectious agents may affect any part of the eye. Ocular findings may be the first sign of many infectious diseases, such as, for example, gonorrhea or chlamydia infection. Understanding the various forms of ocular involvement in these conditions is important, because untreated ophthalmic involvement can lead to severe vision loss. This review focuses on the significant ocular manifestations of the most common infectious diseases, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections, that both ophthalmologists and dermatologists may encounter.

### Infectious eye disease in the 21st century-an overview [^4b000d16]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The eye is susceptible to infections caused by a bewildering spectrum of organisms, from prions to arthropods (Table 1). Pathology may be restricted to the ocular tissues, or manifest in the eye as part of a systemic infectious disease, with impact ranging from minor nuisance to sight impairment or death. While any structure along the visual pathways may be the focus of an infection, these disease presentations principally fall into one of three distinct anatomical categories: external eye, intraocular structures including the optic nerve, and ocular adnexae, although all three may be involved simultaneously. Many of these infections occur universally, whereas others occur only within certain geographic parameters such as the tropical belt, and seldom surface in temperate countries. A few, like cysticercosis and soil-transmitted helminthiases, are categorised as neglected tropical diseases.

Table 1
Examples of ocular infections causing sight loss.

As global warming progresses, however, geographic boundaries may shift. In addition, widespread international travel and migration makes geographic boundaries porous, with the result that clinical presentations more commonly associated with tropical climes can present and must be recognised worldwide. Infectious diseases that can manifest in the eye such as tuberculosis (TB) and measles tend to occur disproportionately among persons from developing countries with incomplete healthcare coverage and among migrants from these countries. Moreover, emerging infectious diseases (EID) including arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) infections (e.g. Zika virus) and diseases of presumed zoonotic origin (e.g. Ebolavirus) have given rise to unexpected ocular pathologies. While recognition thereof can be life-saving or life-changing, a failure to understand its implications can lead to inappropriate immunosuppression, with devastating consequences. It therefore behoves ophthalmologists everywhere to have a working knowledge of the vast spectrum of infectious diseases that can affect the eye.

### Ocular infection and inflammation [^28ececd2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Managing the inflamed or infected eye in the emergency setting presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the emergency physician; the causes and prognoses range from benign, self-limited illness to organ-threatening pathology. A careful history, with attention to comorbid illnesses and time course, is paramount, as is knowledge of the complete ophthalmologic examination. Much of the organ morbidity is ameliorated with prompt therapy in the emergency department and by initiating ophthalmologic consultation. In this article, the authors discuss the diagnosis and treatment of several types of eye infection, including conjunctivitis, episcleritis, keratitis, uveitis, hordeolum and chalazion, dacryocystitis, and cellulitis.

Ocular infection — specimen collection and transport principles — The guidance emphasizes that "The source, type, and suspected infection is essential to triage small volume specimens to achieve clinically actionable results". It further states, "If this information is not received, providers must be contacted for additional clarification". This is "particularly important because all major pathogen groups — viruses, parasites, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi can cause ocular infection [68]".

### Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases [^5bdd4e8e]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a considerable ongoing threat to humanity. The World Health Organization (WHO) define EIDs as those that are either novel and severely affect a population for the first time, or those that have existed previously but have a rapidly increasing incidence or degree of spread to new geographical areas. Globalisation and climate change have led to an acceleration in the emergence of EID outbreaks in recent times, with the WHO reporting 1483 epidemic events in 172 countries between 2011 and 2018. Since infectious diseases are increasingly extending beyond endemic territories, the clinician should be armed with a global perspective.

Recent outbreaks combined with the development of diagnostic techniques have increasingly allowed characterisation of the ocular manifestations of EIDs. The most prominent outbreaks in recent times have constituted viruses such as the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, 2015–2016 Zika outbreak in the Americas, a series of increasingly frequent Dengue outbreaks and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. With the necessary precautions, eye specialists are therefore in a position to facilitate swift diagnosis, improve clinical outcomes and contribute to wider public health efforts during outbreaks. To this end, we provide a timely review of emerging viral diseases for the ophthalmologist (Table 1).

### What is causing the corneal ulcer? Management strategies for unresponsive corneal ulceration [^85653d7a]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious keratitis represents a significant cause of ocular morbidity in the United States. The work-up and treatment of presumed infectious keratitis (PIK) has changed in the past two decades. The development of newer topical antibiotics has enabled broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with good tissue penetration. The majority of PIK cases respond well to this strategy. The small numbers of cases that do not respond to the treatment are the cases that offer a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. This review will describe different algorithms that can be followed for the successful management of patients with difficult or progressive PIK. These algorithms are based on scientific work and on our empirical clinical experience. The review will also present three different clinical cases of PIK that were managed according to the algorithms presented in this review.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^15157b37]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 had a significant impact on the health of the global human population, affecting almost every human organ, including the organ of vision. Research focus on understanding the pathophysiology, identifying symptoms and complications of the disease. Eye-related pathologies are important foci of research due to the potential for direct impact of the virus. Ophthalmologists around the world are reporting various symptoms of eye infections and ocular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2. The review of ophthalmic symptoms was conducted to help physicians of various specialties recognize possible ophthalmic manifestations of this viral disease. A literature review was conducted from January 2020 to July 2023 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, Scielo and Google Scholar databases. The review of the literature showed that conjunctivitis is the most common ophthalmic symptom observed during the course of COVID-19 and can occur at any stage of the disease. Changes in the eye may result from the direct effect of the virus, immune response, prothrombotic states, comorbidities, and medications used. Symptoms related to the organ of vision can be divided into: changes affecting the protective apparatus of the eye, the anterior eye segment, the posterior eye segment, neuro-ophthalmic, and orbital changes. Ocular symptoms may suggest COVID-19 infection or appear several weeks after recovery. Following COVID-19 vaccinations, a diverse range of ophthalmic symptoms was observed in various locations and at different times, mirroring the ocular symptoms experienced throughout the course of the COVID-19 illness. It is important for physicians of all specialties to be aware of possible potential connections between eye diseases and SARS-CoV-2, in order to effectively diagnose and treat patients.

### Sore eyes as the most significant ocular symptom experienced by people with COVID-19: a comparison between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 States [^abc0be80]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19, which has been shown to be primarily a respiratory illness, with the most common symptoms being a new continuous cough and high temperature. Further symptoms have been added to this list, and the WHO added conjunctivitis a less common symptom. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 have not been at the forefront of substantial research, possibly due to the life-threatening nature of the other more serious respiratory symptoms which have resulted in high numbers of mortality around the world. This might have resulted in other non-life-threatening symptoms not given importance in the presence of other life-threatening conditions. However, the type, frequency and ocular transmission of the virus must not be ignored, especially as the eye has been recognised as one of the organs through which the virus might enter the body.

### The eye in systemic infection [^4c2e66e8]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens all cause systemic infection and can spread to the eye. Dissemination of pathogens via the bloodstream can lead to direct involvement of the eye. Visual loss is common in bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis, and toxoplasmosis is a major cause of ocular morbidity and poor vision after congenital or acquired infection. Some infections cause intraocular damage by indirect mechanisms (eg, HIV-mediated immunosuppression), leading to opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus infection, periocular nerve involvement due to leprosy, and hypersensitivity reactions in tuberculosis. Eye symptoms might indicate the outcome of an underlying infection, such as development of retinal ischaemia in severe malaria, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Successful outcome for patients with ocular infection depends on close collaboration between clinicians identifying and treating underlying disease, specialist ophthalmic review, and ophthalmic interventional skills (when needed).

### Viral ocular manifestations: a broad overview [^76ca056c]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

The viruses able to affect the eye are taxonomically diverse, ranging from double-stranded DNA viruses, to single stranded RNA viruses, to retroviruses. Any part of the eye may be affected, frequently producing blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, cataract and retinitis. The more common ocular viral infections include the Herpesviruses such as HSV-1, VZV and CMV. The HIV pandemic is placing a serious burden on ophthalmology clinics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa as the number of viral ocular diseases is increasing. In particular, CMV retinitis is becoming more prevalent where antiretroviral therapy is not available and is replaced by immune-recovery uveitis where antiretrovirals are given. This review aims to improve knowledge of the common viral ocular diseases, their diagnosis and management, as well as the fairly uncommon viral ocular diseases that may also cause considerable morbidity.

### Bacterial profile of ocular infections: a systematic review [^a100176d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The summary of literatures in this review indicated that both gram positive and Gram negative bacteria can cause eye infections. Gram positive bacteria are the leading cause of ocular bacterial infections elsewhere. As compared to Gram positives, Gram negative bacteria are less prevalent but more diverse than Gram positive pathogens. Specifically, S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are the leading isolates in ocular infections. Frequent pathogens of the respective clinical diagnose include Staphylococci, S. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa in blepharitis; Staphylococi, S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli in Conjunctivitis; Staphylococci, P. aeruginosa and E. coli in dacryocystitis; CoNS, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in keratitis; S. viridians, S. pneumoniae and CoNS in endophthalmitis diagnoses. However, there may be some differences in the leading type of bacterial isolates in some parts of the world. In the United States of America for instance, acute conjunctivitis is the most common ocular infection in outpatient healthcare settings and the most common bacterial causes are S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. S. aureus is the common cause of conjunctivitis in adults but S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are the most frequent causes of bacterial conjunctivitis in Children.

### Bacterial profile of ocular infections: a systematic review [^65de91f6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bacteria are the major contributor of ocular infections worldwide. Ocular infections, if left untreated, can damage the structures of the eye with possible blindness and visual impairments. This work was aimed to review the bacterial profile of ocular infections.

Methods

Literature search was made in different electronic databases; the review was systematically made to get concrete findings.

Results

As far as this review, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase negative Staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the leading isolates in ocular infections. Frequent pathogens of the respective clinical diagnose include Staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in blepharitis; Staphylococci, Streptococus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in Conjunctivitis; Staphylococci, P. aeruginosa and E. coli in dacryocystitis; Coagulase negative Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in keratitis; Streptococcus viridians, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Coagulase negative Staphylococci in endophthalmitis diagnoses. Endogenous endophthalmitis is associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae whereas Coagulase negative Staphylococci and Bacillus spp. are common causes of post-operative and post-traumatic endophthalmitis. However, the predominant pathogens may not be exactly same in all areas of the world, in the United States for instance, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major causes of conjunctivitis.

Conclusion

Gram positive bacteria are the major contributor of bacterial ocular infections. The distribution and proportion of bacterial isolates among clinical diagnoses varied but without exclusive anatomical restriction. To mitigate the burden of bacterial ocular infections, physicians should regard on risk reduction and comply with etiologic approach of diagnosis.

### Bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility in ocular infections: a study at boru-meda general hospital, dessie, Ethiopia [^475fb194]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The eye is a sensory organ used by humans and is essential for daily life. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be attained without eye health, and universal health coverage cannot exist without it. The structure of the eye consists of two compartments: one internal and one external. Sterilization is maintained in the interior compartment, which is physically isolated from the immune system. However, the exterior compartment of the eye is prone to contamination by potentially harmful microorganisms owing to exposure to the external environment. Several variables, including microbes, dust, and high temperatures can cause eye illnesses that can result in blindness. Hyperemia/redness, eye discharge, itching, eye pain, and falling lashes are among the most common symptoms in patients with eye infection. The familiar forms of eye infections are conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, blepharoconjunctivis, keratitis, and ocular trauma.

Various infectious agents, such as parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungi, are responsible for different forms of eye infections. Free-living Acanthamoeba is known to cause keratitis, a rare corneal infection and its incidence has increased over time. Viral infections can cause minor-to-severe ocular discomfort. Many types of eye infections have been linked to Molluscum contagiosum, arboviruses, herpes simplex virus type 1, and common respiratory viruses including adenoviruses. Ocular fungal infections are a significant contributor to ocular morbidity. Aspergillus, Candida, and Fusarium species are the most commonly isolated organisms from ocular specimens. Globally, bacterial eye infections in various clinical conditions continue to be a major cause of ocular morbidity and blindness, and their prevalence is periodically increasing. Even in developed countries, the prevalence of bacterial isolates from eye specimens is high.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^2db6b7bc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 infection prevention — eye protection for health care personnel (HCP) caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients: The guideline panel recommends that HCP caring for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients use eye protection in conjunction with other recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and appropriate hand hygiene. Evidence certainty is described as very low, with observational studies showing either a modest reduction or no meaningful reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when eye protection is added to standard PPE, and the panel determined that there is unlikely to be harm in adding eye protection. The panel also notes that the addition of eye protection to PPE does not represent a substantial use of resources, but a potential undesirable consequence might be an increase in hand-to-face contact. The panel recognizes that additional well-designed studies are needed, ideally well-designed pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing consistent eye protection to current practices, and large prospective cohort studies with appropriate comparison groups and integration with prospective outcome registries; study designs should consider and adjust for infectivity from community settings.

### Interventions for preventing ophthalmia neonatorum [^8930dbde]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ophthalmia neonatorum is an infection of the eyes in newborns that can lead to blindness, particularly if the infection is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Antiseptic or antibiotic medication is dispensed into the eyes of newborns, or dispensed systemically, soon after delivery to prevent neonatal conjunctivitis and potential vision impairment.

Objectives

1. To determine if any type of systemic or topical eye medication is better than placebo or no prophylaxis in preventing ophthalmia neonatorum. 2. To determine if any one systemic or topical eye medication is better than any other medication in preventing ophthalmia neonatorum.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and three trials registers, date of last search 4 October 2019. We also searched references of included studies and contacted pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of any topical, systemic, or combination medical interventions used to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum in newborns compared with placebo, no prophylaxis, or with each other.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Outcomes were: blindness or any adverse visual outcome at 12 months, conjunctivitis at 1 month (gonococcal (GC), chlamydial (CC), bacterial (BC), any aetiology (ACAE), or unknown aetiology (CUE)), and adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We included 30 trials with a total of 79,198 neonates. Eighteen studies were conducted in high-income settings (the USA, Europe, Israel, Canada), and 12 were conducted in low- and middle-income settings (Africa, Iran, China, Indonesia, Mexico). Fifteen of the 30 studies were quasi-randomised. We judged every study to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Ten studies included a comparison arm with no prophylaxis. There were 14 different prophylactic regimens and 12 different medications in the 30 included studies. Any prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis Unless otherwise indicated, the following evidence comes from studies assessing one or more of the following interventions: tetracycline 1%, erythromycin 0.5%, povidone-iodine 2.5%, silver nitrate 1%. None of the studies reported data on the primary outcomes: blindness or any adverse visual outcome at any time point. There was only very low-certainty evidence on the risk of GC with prophylaxis (4/5340 newborns) compared to no prophylaxis (5/2889) at one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 2.65, 3 studies). Low-certainty evidence suggested there may be little or no difference in effect on CC (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.61, 4874 newborns, 2 studies) and BC (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.93, 3685 newborns, 2 studies). Moderate-certainty evidence suggested a probable reduction in risk of ACAE at one month (RR 0.65, 95% 0.54 to 0.78, 9666 newborns, 8 studies assessing tetracycline 1%, erythromycin 0.5%, povidone-iodine 2.5%, silver nitrate 1%, colostrum, bacitracin-phenacaine ointment). There was only very low-certainty evidence on CUE (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.37 to 8.28, 330 newborns, 1 study). Very low-certainty evidence on adverse effects suggested no increased nasolacrimal duct obstruction (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, 404 newborns, 1 study of erythromycin 0.5% and silver nitrate 1%) and no increased keratitis (single study of 40 newborns assessing silver nitrate 1% with no events). Any prophylaxis compared to another prophylaxis Overall, evidence comparing different interventions did not suggest any consistently superior intervention. However, most of this evidence was of low-certainty and was extremely limited.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no data on whether prophylaxis for ophthalmia neonatorum prevents serious outcomes such as blindness or any adverse visual outcome. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that the use of prophylaxis may lead to a reduction in the incidence of ACAE in newborns but the evidence for effect on GC, CC or BC was less certain. Comparison of individual interventions did not suggest any consistently superior intervention, but data were limited. A trial comparing tetracycline, povidone-iodine (single administration), and chloramphenicol for GC and CC could potentially provide the community with an effective, universally applicable prophylaxis against ophthalmia neonatorum.

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^8022567f]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are probably due to viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than they are viral forms. The main bacterial pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults and children, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. Contact lens wearers may be more likely to develop gram-negative infections. Bacterial keratitis occurs in up to 30 per 100,000 contact lens wearers.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment in adults and children with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with bacteriologically confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with clinically confirmed gonococcal conjunctivitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 44 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ocular decongestants, oral antibiotics, parenteral antibiotics, saline, topical antibiotics, and warm compresses.

### Impact of antibiotic resistance in the management of ocular infections: the role of current and future antibiotics [^ff5eecec]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article reviews the effects of the increase in bacterial resistance on the treatment of ocular infections.

Design

Interpretive assessment.

Methods

Literature review and interpretation.

Results

Ocular bacterial infections include conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, blepharitis, orbital cellulitis, and dacryocystitis. Treatment for most ocular bacterial infections is primarily empiric with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are effective against the most common bacteria associated with these ocular infections. However, the widespread use of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics has resulted in a global increase in resistance among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to a number of the older antibiotics as well as some of the newer fluoroquinolones used to treat ophthalmic infections. Strategies for the prevention of the increase in ocular pathogen resistance should be developed and implemented. In addition, new antimicrobial agents with optimized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that have low toxicity, high efficacy, and reduced potential for the development of resistance are needed.

Conclusions

New antimicrobial agents that treat ocular infections effectively and have a low potential for the development of resistance could be a part of strategies to prevent the global increase in ocular pathogen resistance.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^fc25677d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Also, discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, in order to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

### Endophthalmitis: state of the art [^62586193]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endophthalmitis is a rare but potentially sight-threatening disease characterized by marked inflammation of intraocular tissues and fluids. This ocular pathology can be divided into broad categories of exogenous and endogenous endophthalmitis. Exogenous endophthalmitis is caused by inoculation of the eye by microorganisms from the external environment and most commonly occurs as a complication of ocular surgery, trauma, or intravitreal injections. Endogenous endophthalmitis is caused by hematogenous spread of infectious organisms from distant sites of the body. Both categories of endophthalmitis lead to subsequent intraocular inflammation and potentially severe visual loss.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^f12ef21c]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis classification and targeted types — conjunctivitis can be classified as noninfectious or infectious and as acute, chronic, or recurrent. Noninfectious types of conjunctivitis include allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic, and these types may overlap, while the causes of infectious conjunctivitis include viruses and bacteria. It is important to differentiate between primary conjunctival disease and conditions in which conjunctival inflammation is secondary to systemic or ocular diseases; for example, dry eye and blepharitis are the most frequent causes of conjunctival inflammation and the treatment for each of these entities should be directed at correcting the underlying problems. Systemic conditions such as atopy or acute infections such as gonorrhea may also cause conjunctival inflammation, and treatment of conjunctivitis must include addressing the underlying systemic disease. This preferred practice pattern addresses types that are either most common or are particularly important to detect and treat, including allergic types — seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and atopic conjunctivitis — and mechanical/irritative/toxic types — superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK), blepharoconjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye), rosacea conjunctivitis, contact lens–related keratoconjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), floppy eyelid syndrome, giant fornix syndrome, and medication-induced/preservative-induced keratoconjunctivitis.

Prevalence and risk factors — conjunctivitis is a diagnosis that encompasses a diverse group of diseases that occur worldwide and affect all ages, all social strata, and all genders, and although there are no reliable figures that document the incidence or prevalence of all forms of conjunctivitis, this condition has been cited as one of the most frequent causes of patient self-referral; conjunctivitis infrequently causes permanent visual loss or structural damage, but the economic impact of the disease in terms of lost work and school time, cost of medical visits, diagnostic testing, and medication is considerable; the risk factors for developing conjunctivitis depend on the etiology, the associated and predisposing factors for the types of conjunctivitis that are most common or most important to treat are listed in Table 1, and symptoms may be exacerbated by the coexistence of blepharitis, dry eye, or other causes of ocular surface inflammation.

### SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface: is it truly a novel transmission route? [^69978ee0]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Virus infection on the ocular surface

Ocular diseases associated with herpesvirus type 1 and feline calicivirus are not unusual in animals. Conjunctivitis, or 'pink eye', is the most commonly reported clinical symptom after virus infection on the ocular surface. Jean et al found that conjunctivitis was the most common ocular condition, followed by corneal epithelial ulceration and keratitis with or without ulceration. However, ocular manifestations of feline CoV consist predominantly of uveitis and chorioretinitis with associated fibrinous exudate in the anterior ocular chamber. In humans, avian and human influenza A viruses show a capacity to use the eyes as a portal of entry and spread ocular disease. Like the respiratory tract, the ocular surface (notably the corneal and conjunctival epithelia) represents a mucosal surface that provides a pathway for viral entry. Other viruses that cause conjunctivitis in humans are also very common, such as the mumps virus, respiratory syncytial virusesand subtype H7 viruses. During the SARS outbreak, researchers also found that RT-PCR and ELISA detection of patient's tears were positive. Therefore, the ocular surface is actually quite vulnerable to respiratory viruses. In the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic area, SARS-CoV-2-related eye infections must be seriously and carefully evaluated.

### Medical interventions for fungal keratitis [^938b4421]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fungal infections can involve different parts of the eye and periocular tissues, including the lacrimal apparatus, conjunctiva, eyelids and bony orbit. The most common sites for fungal infections of the eye involve the cornea and the retina or vitreous. Fungal keratitis is a severe infection of the cornea which often results in loss of vision. It most commonly affects young agricultural workers of low socioeconomic status in tropical and subtropical countries. Early intervention with the appropriate treatment is vital to improving outcomes for these patients. There is evidence to suggest the incidence of this condition is increasing globally, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

Hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis What: A very rare and severe type of conjunctivitis with rapid onset and progression. Severe symptoms: massive exudate, severe chemosis, eyelid swelling, marked hyperemia, pain, and decreased vision. Can progress to corneal infiltrates, melting and perforation, and vision loss if not treated promptly by an ophthalmologist. Cause: Neisseria gonorrhoeaeor Neisseria meningitidis. Therapy: Requires both parenteral and topical antibiotic therapy. Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis What: Defined as symptoms lasting for at least 4 weeks. People with this condition should see an ophthalmologist.

### Herpes simplex keratitis: challenges in diagnosis and clinical management [^d6e45a3f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a ubiquitous DNA virus that can infect virtually anywhere in the body, particularly when newborns are infected.–However, in an individual with a normal immune system, the most common sites of infection are the mouth, genitalia, and eyes. In very young children, and in rare instances adults, the brain may also become infected. HSV infections of the eye are the leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in developed countries. Approximately 500,000 people in the US are currently infected with ocular HSV. The costs of treatment for this disease are in the tens of millions spent annually in the US alone. While most infections are unilateral, around 1.3%–12% of affected individuals have bilateral ocular infections. Bilateral infections are seen mostly in immunocompromised patients.–Infections can occur in both anterior and posterior segments of the eye, but it most commonly infects the corneal epithelia. It is primarily diagnosed by its clinical presentation, but atypical presentation of the infection can impede accurate diagnoses and thus proper treatment.

### Bacterial etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors among patients attending eye unit of shashemene comprehensive specialized hospital, shashemene, Ethiopia [^f431a81c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The eye is one of the sense organs in humans which is important throughout life for daily activities. The awareness given to eye health and cleanliness is essential. Dust, high temperature, microorganisms, and other factors can lead to eye diseases which may lead to loss of sight.

Although the eye can be infected, it is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes. There is disparity in the type of bacteria that colonize the eye and other parts of the body. Although the eye is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes, it is prone to infection because the lens and vitreous are avascular and protein-rich structures; thus, ideal media for the proliferation of many pathogenic bacteria. The external part of the eye is susceptible to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections. Microorganisms can also invade and damage the internal parts of the eye, which often results in loss of vision. The source of eye infection can be exogenous or endogenous. Clinically external eye infections can be presented as conjunctivitis, keratitis, blepharitis, canaliculitis, dacryocystitis, external hordeolum and cellulitis. The clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation of the eyes along with pus are frequently caused by bacteria. Globally, purulent bacterial conjunctivitis is mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The most common causative agents are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The microbial etiology and drug susceptibility, as well as resistance profile may differ with geographic location.

The common way of transmission of pathogens is the contact with contaminated fingers, eyelids margins, and adjacent skin, from the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal duct, from infected eye drops or contact lenses and more rarely from the genitals or via the bloodstream. Bacterial eye infection needs immediate treatment. Treatment of bacterial eye infections involves empirical treatment with topical ophthalmic broad-spectrum antibiotic formulations that become a prevailing practice among ophthalmologists and general practitioners. This along with the irrational use of drugs, availability of antibiotics without prescription, has led to the development of resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

There are 1.4 million blind children estimated worldwide, of whom about 320,000 live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of blindness was reported to be 1.6% and about 87.4% of the cases were due to preventable causes, bacterial infection is one of them. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors.

### Bacterial profile of ocular infections: a systematic review [^024d5775]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Result

The distribution and types of bacteria in ocular infections

Gram positive bacteria

According to the studies conducted so far Gram positive bacteria are associated with variety of ocular infections. The most commonly reported isolates belong to the genus Staphylococci regardless of the study area and population (see Table 1). Staphylococci are associated with any type of eye infections including conjunctivitis, blepharitis, endophthalmitis, keratitis, dacryocystitis and orbital cellulitis; most importantly with blepharitis, conjunctivitis and keratitis. Both S. aureus (Staphylococcus aureus) and CoNS (Coagulase-negative Staphylococci) took the highest proportion of the isolates.

Table 1
Overall proportion of common bacterial isolates in ocular infection

Note: CoNS✱ = Coagulase Negative Staphylococci

Despite their normal existence, CoNS are the most frequent cause of ocular infections with increasing frequencies over time. A 5 year retrospective study in Iran indicated that 40% of infections were due to CoNS. A Similar study in India also found a prevalence of 45.4%. The problem is worse especially in pre-operative and post-operative cases. In a study conducted in patients with cataract surgery, 88.8% of isolates from conjunctival swabs were CoNS. Likewise, 65.9% and 21% of pre-operative cataract patients had CoNS and S. aureus isolates respectively. Considering the specific species, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus were the common species of CoNS; both species being dominant in subjects with post-operative endophthalmitis as to the study conducted over 20 years in China. In general Staphylococcal infection is common in both post infection and post-operative endophthalmitis cases. Moreover, S. aureus and S. epidermidis are known to be the common cause of early onset bleb-associated endophthalmitis.

### Uveitis for the non-ophthalmologist [^ef8afddc]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The uveitides are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by inflammation inside the eye. The uveitides are classified as infectious or non-infectious. The non-infectious uveitides, which are presumed to be immune mediated, can be further divided into those that are associated with a known systemic disease and those that are eye limited,-ie, not associated with a systemic disease. The ophthalmologist identifies the specific uveitic entity by medical history, clinical examination, and ocular imaging, as well as supplemental laboratory testing, if indicated. Treatment of the infectious uveitides is tailored to the particular infectious organism and may include regional and/or systemic medication. First line treatment for non-infectious uveitides is corticosteroids that can be administered topically, as regional injections or surgical implants, or systemically. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy is used in patients with severe disease who cannot tolerate corticosteroids, require chronic corticosteroids at > 7.5 mg/day prednisone, or in whom the disease is known to respond better to immunosuppression. Management of many of these diseases is optimized by coordination between the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist or internist.

### Approach to the diagnosis of the uveitides [^e3eac58d]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe an approach to diagnosing the uveitides, a collection of about 30 separate diseases characterized by intraocular inflammation.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Integration of clinical approach with a more formal, informatics-derived approach to characterization and a Bayesian approach to laboratory testing.

Results

The patient's uveitis is characterized along several dimensions: course, laterality, anatomic location of the inflammation, morphology, presence of active infection, and the host (age, presence of a systemic disease). Posterior uveitis can be characterized further by whether it is primarily a retinitis, choroiditis, or retinal vasculitis; by whether it is paucifocal or multifocal; and by the morphology of the lesions. This characterization narrows the differential diagnosis to 1 or, at most, a few diseases. Laboratory screening (ie, testing all patients) should be reserved for those diseases that can present as any type of uveitis, whereas targeted testing (ie, testing a subset with specific features) is used selectively. Laboratory testing should be used to identify an infection (which will alter therapy) or a systemic disease that will affect the patient's health. A uveitis that is not one of the established diagnoses is designated as "undifferentiated" with the course, laterality, and anatomic location (eg, undifferentiated bilateral chronic anterior uveitis). We avoid the term "idiopathic" uveitis as most identified noninfectious uveitic diseases are idiopathic, and most systemic diseases associated with uveitis also are idiopathic (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis).

Conclusion

This approach should lead to the correct diagnosis of the specific uveitic disease in the large majority of cases without overuse of laboratory testing.

### Endophthalmitis: pathogenesis, clinical presentation, management, and perspectives [^1f0cdf5e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Endophthalmitis is a rare but sight-threatening complication that can occur after ocular surgery or trauma or as a consequence of systemic infection. To optimize visual outcome, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Over recent decades, advances in hygienic standards, improved microbiologic and surgical techniques, development of powerful antimicrobial drugs, and the introduction of intravitreal antibiotic therapy have led to a decreased incidence and improved management of endophthalmitis. However, endophthalmitis still represents a serious clinical problem. This review focuses on current principles and techniques for evaluation and treatment of endophthalmitis. In addition, it addresses recent developments regarding antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of infectious endophthalmitis.

### Infectious eye disease in the 21st century-an overview [^225cea64]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious endophthalmitis remains a serious possible complication of all penetrating eye injuries and intraocular procedures, but it may also arise spontaneously, rarely in otherwise completely asymptomatic individuals, as well as those with serious systemic infections, following haematogenous spread of bacterial, fungal and other pathogens. As a matter of convention, viral and parasitic causes of endogenous infection are usually considered separately as uveitic entities. The list of organisms reported to cause endophthalmitis is long, but commensal coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were found to predominate (39.4%) in one large series of culture-positive isolates from a single institution in North America, followed by Streptococcus viridans (12.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (11.1%). Gram-negative organisms and fungi accounted for 10.3% and 4.6% of isolates, respectively. More indolent causes of endophthalmitis, typically with a delayed presentation, include Cutibacterium acnes. Regional differences in the percentages of different causative pathogens exist, as exemplified by endogenous Klebsiella pneumoniae endophthalmitis secondary to pyogenic liver abscess, often reported to be more prevalent in east Asian countries but which is emerging in several countries around the world. In rich countries, postoperative endophthalmitis is well recognised as a serious complication, and is typically managed as a medical emergency with intravitreal and systemic antibiotics and vitrectomy, with mixed results reflecting the virulence of the causative organism and the timing of presentation. In many resource-poor settings, however, the circumstances surrounding presentations of endophthalmitis may be very different, often leading to poor visual outcomes and impacting on patients' economic potential. As cataract surgical rates increase around the world, and with the emergence of intravitreal therapies, the incidence of endophthalmitis can be expected to rise concomitantly.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^b031976d]. Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial keratitis:

- **Definition**: Bacterial keratitis is a corneal infection caused by bacteria, characterized by pain, redness, inflammation, and opacity of the cornea.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of bacterial keratitis involves the entry of bacteria into the cornea, often facilitated by a disruption in the ocular epithelial surface. The bacteria then proliferate and release tissue-damaging proteases and toxins, leading to an inflammatory response.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of keratitis in the US is estimated at 27.6 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for bacterial keratitis include the use of contact lenses, the presence of ocular surface diseases, ocular trauma, administration of topical corticosteroids, history of ocular surgery, and exposure to certain environmental factors.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with bacterial keratitis often present with symptoms such as pain, redness, discharge, blurred vision, and photophobia. On examination, suppurative stromal infiltrates with indistinct edges, corneal edema, and white cell infiltration in the surrounding stroma are often observed. An epithelial defect is typically present, and an anterior chamber reaction is often observed.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of bacterial keratitis can vary, but it can lead to severe visual impairment if not treated promptly.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^5d34e23a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis is complicated because of the signs and symptoms that overlap with other inflammatory conjunctival conditions; therefore, likelihood for misdiagnosis remains high. Misdiagnosis of viral conjunctivitis as bacterial conjunctivitis may result in inappropriate use of antibiotics, which in turn contributes to increased antibiotic resistance. Additionally, misdiagnosis may lead to impaired quality of life and lost productivity due to poor outcomes. Adherence to the American Academy of Ophthalmology evidence-based treatment guidelines and greater educational efforts directed at both patients and physicians could improve the management of acute infectious conjunctivitis. Prescription of antibiotics should be delayed until a bacterial etiology is confirmed, and educational pamphlets should be distributed to general and emergency care practitioners. Development of novel agents with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity may offer potential new approaches without the drawback of resistance.

American Academy of Ophthalmology — screening for endogenous Candida endophthalmitis: Ophthalmologic consultation is reasonable for anyone with a clinical rationale including signs or symptoms concerning for an ocular infection, but current evidence does not support a routine ophthalmologic consultation after laboratory findings of systemic Candida septicemia, and this low-value practice should be de-adopted. Systemic management should be tailored to the underlying candidemia, rather than associated ocular findings. Any future recommendations should be developed through collaborative efforts between specialists represented by ophthalmology and infectious diseases, and such efforts and any future studies must eliminate discrepancies regarding the incidence of sight-threatening disease and potential benefit of ophthalmologic screening for candidemia within the literature after carefully applying rigorous definitions, reviewing associated clinical data, including control groups, and including long-term visual outcomes data. These recommendations are based on, but not limited to, safety, efficacy, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of endogenous Candida endophthalmitis.

Molecular detection in ocular infections — intraocular fluids should be analyzed directly for infectious agents. There are no FDA-approved NAATs for ocular specimens, but commercial reference laboratories and a subset of hospital-based laboratories servicing large ophthalmology practices offer molecular testing using validated lab developed tests, some of which are FDA-approved for other specimen types. NAATs exhibit increased sensitivity for most ocular pathogens relative to traditional culture, with specificity for pathogens not part of the normal ocular surface microbiota (eg, C. trachomatis) being > 99%, whereas specificity drops considerably for commensals such as C. acnes. NAATs are particularly helpful in culture-negative intraocular infections with fastidious organisms; HSV and VZV NAATs are the most commonly used and exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for active infection, while detection of ubiquitous commensal viruses such as CMV, EBV, and HHV-6 requires careful clinical correlation.

Introduction

Eye infection can be caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. Microorganisms exist in the ocular mucosa, and bacteria are the major contributor of ocular infections worldwide. Bacteria are generally associated with many types of ocular infections such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, blepharitis, orbital cellulitis and dacryocystitis manifestations. Corneal diseases are still the second most important cause of blindness globally in the world. Their epidemiology is very complex, including a variety of infectious and inflam- matory eye diseases. The eye acts as a portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2 to infect respiratory cells or viral shedding from respiratory cells via the nasolacrimal duct unto the ocular surface. The possibility of ocular secretions as a source for external spread of SARS-CoV-2 has substantial public health implications. The rapid and accurate detection of pathogenic microorganisms in the early stage of eye infection directly affects the effect of disease diagnosis and treatment. It is important to improve the accuracy of the detection and treatment of ocular pathogens. Conjunctival sac swab sampling method is an important method to detect microorganisms on the ocular surface at present, but this method has limited contact area with the ocular conjunctiva surface and is easy to be polluted by microorganisms on the eyelids, eyelashes and surrounding skin which leads to sample pollution and misdiagnosis; At the same time, the conjunctival sac swab sampling method needs to smear the collected swab on the blood agar for inoculation, and rely on the manual operation of the inspectors for bacterial inoculation. Due to the influence of many factors, the test results cannot be standardized, and the efficiency and accuracy of the test results are affected. This process will reduce the microbial samples collected in the conjunctival sac, which is easy to cause missed diagnosis. At present, many studies have shown that the positive rate of conjunctival sampling, inoculation and culture is approximately 50%. There are some references of this technique being used in body fluid detection. Instead of cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive progress in swab sampling such as preprocessing, some studies have aerosolized liquid from human oral cavity, the unmodified biological samples, which are sampled and identified rapidly. The operation is simple, efficient, and direct.

Therefore, we attempts to propose a new sampling method to improve the accuracy of the test, in order to compare and analyze its clinical application effect with the conventional conjunctival sac swab sampling method.

Infections of the eyelids and lacrimal system — scope and culture utility are noted: Table 13 highlights the most common pathogens causing lacrimal and eyelid infections. Blepharitis, canaliculitis, and dacryocystitis are all superficial infections that are generally self-limited. Cultures from these sites are rarely submitted for diagnostic work-up and often yield a predominance of commensal microbiota making it difficult to attribute a clear pathogenic role.

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Infectious eye disease in the 21st century-an overview [^585c4659]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Several sight-threatening ocular pathologies, including infectious keratitis, orbital cellulitis and endophthalmitis are caused by a wide variety of different pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, protists and viruses; co-infection is also possible. Many of the causative pathogens are universal, whereas others exhibit considerable variation in geographic distribution. In the tropics, these conditions may be caused by organisms unfamiliar to ophthalmologists in temperate countries. As an example, Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative bacillus acquired through direct contact with contaminated soil and water, is a known cause of infectious keratitis, endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis in Thailand, yet its geographical distribution outside southeast Asia and northern Australia remains poorly understood.

Infectious keratitis, commonly called corneal ulceration, is one of the leading global causes of unilateral blindness; it has been described as a 'silent epidemic'. The visual burden of infectious keratitis in resource-poor settings greatly exceeds that in rich countries, prompting a proposal to designate this condition as a neglected tropical disease. Common pathogenic causes worldwide include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp. herpes simplex and zoster, Fusarium spp. Aspergillus spp. Microsporidia, Candida spp. and Acanthamoeba spp. and rarer causes include non-tubercular mycobacteria and Nocardia spp. as well as a plethora of other organisms. Risk factors include hypoxia-inducing contact lens wear, while agricultural and other ocular trauma is a more common predisposing factor in resource-poor countries. In a proportion of cases, it is bilateral, notably in neonatal conjunctivitis where the causative pathogen may be Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can lead to blindness rapidly and may be resistant to antibiotics. More broadly, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacterial keratitis may be increasing. The true burden of infectious keratitis is unknown, in part because epidemiological studies lack the data to disaggregate it from other non-infectious causes of non-trachomatous corneal opacity, estimated to cause 3.2% of global blindness. In areas where bacterial, fungal and other pathogenic causes of infectious keratitis are common, it can be difficult to distinguish these clinically. There is no substitute for microbiological diagnosis, including Gram staining, culture and DNA analysis of tissue samples in identifying the causative pathogen to guide treatment. Wherever this facility is lacking, however, empirical treatments with topical antibiotics and anti-fungals are sometimes the only option to treat infectious keratitis, leading to uncertain outcomes. The emergence of multidrug resistance, as well as the harm done by traditional medicines, contribute further to the toll of infectious visual loss. The role of antiseptics such as povidone-iodine in treating infectious keratitis has been evaluated, showing promise against Gram-positive organisms.

### Conjunctivitis… [^13d27911]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The conjunctiva is a thin membrane covering the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eye. Inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva is called conjunctivitis. It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi; allergy; exposure to chemicals or irritants; or long-term presence of a foreign body, such as hard or rigid contact lenses. Viruses causing the common cold can also result in conjunctivitis. The time course for viral conjunctivitis is similar to that of upper respiratory tract infections, with the worst symptoms occurring at 3 to 5 days and resolving in 7 to 14 days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. These bacteria live on human skin and can contaminate eye makeup or other products. Less commonly, chlamydia or gonorrhea infections can cause conjunctivitis.

Bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves in 2 to 5 days without treatment but may need topical antibiotics. These types of infectious conjunctivitis are very contagious and easily spread between people. Signs and symptoms of conjunctivitis Redness Sensitivity to light Gritty sensation, itchiness, or burning Swollen eyelids Discharge Increased tears If symptoms do not resolve within the expected time frame, if you have a weakened immune system, or if any of the following symptoms are encountered, you should seek immediate medical attention. Moderate to severe eye pain or light sensitivity Decreased vision, blurred vision, or double vision that does not resolve after removing discharge from the eyes Increased redness of the eyes If someone has a cold or respiratory symptoms, conjunctivitis is likely caused by the same respiratory virus. Herpes conjunctivitis can occur when there are herpes-like blisters elsewhere on the body.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (~80% of cases), followed by bacterial. The noninfectious forms are allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic. Of noninfectious conjunctivitis, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent, according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute and, less frequently, as hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and the toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, with possible onset in childhood, and present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for ~2% of all medical consultations in the United Statesand countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. It is difficult to accurately capture the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis because of the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate or delay or decline to seek medical care, and because of inaccurate diagnosis in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent care, posing a large economic and social burden.–The pharmacoeconomic impact of infectious conjunctivitis is noteworthy and includes the cost of repeat diagnoses, referrals, insurance copays, patient medications, and lost productivity associated with absence from work or school. In the United States, acute conjunctivitis affects an estimated 6 million people per year, and bacterial conjunctivitis treatment alone costs the United States $377–857 million annually. To the best of our knowledge, no health-related quality-of-life studies of patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis have been published.

The purpose of this narrative review is to provide practical guidance on the differentiation of acute infectious conjunctivitis in the primary care setting and to highlight disconnects between diagnosis and treatment.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^2e85962b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### Human coronaviruses: ophthalmic manifestations [^8ed7e0a0]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

The 2019 novel coronavirus which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) known as SARS-CoV-2 still remains as a global pandemic since its discovery and continues to spread across the world, given how highly contagious the virus is. We reviewed various articles that explore eye involvement in COVID-19 and other human coronaviruses, its human manifestations in comparison to animal studies and potential mechanism of viral entry into the eye surface. Evidence of animal studies depicted various complications of coronaviruses infection into the eyes, in both anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Conjunctival inflammation remains uncommon in association with COVID-19, with other ophthalmic findings. The risk of transmission via the ocular surface remains likely low, though it is inarguably present based on preliminary finding of viral load in ocular samples and expression of ACE2 on the ocular surface. Testing the tears sample for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 was unreliable due to limitations of the testing kits and conflicting evidence of the viral titre in the ocular samples. Further larger, more precise and specific studies are required to allow us to better understand the pattern of virulence underlying the associations of SARS-CoV-2 in the eye despite its rare occurrence. This review article aims to enhance better awareness among clinicians regarding ocular manifestations associated with COVID-19 and necessary precautions should be implemented to minimise the risk of person-to-person especially in the nosocomial setting.

### Liposomal ozonated oil in ocular infections: a review of preclinical and clinical studies, focusing on its antiseptic and regenerative properties [^43e07b8e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The structure of the eye is divided into the anterior and posterior segments, and the different structures provide natural barriers such as the tears, the cornea, the blood-aqueous barrier and the blood-retinal barrier. The most common eye disorders diagnosed in both animals and humans are inflammatory anterior segment diseases, such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and corneal ulcers.

Ocular infections are caused by a large number of microorganisms, involving bacteria, virus, fungi and yeast. Bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are among the most frequent eye pathogens causing acute and chronic infections. The most common viral infections in the eye are in the form of conjunctivitis and keratitis, mainly due to adenovirus and occasionally to herpes simplex or herpes zoster virus. Virus replication in the corneal epithelium leads to epithelial keratitis causing opacities, which can also affect the anterior part of the stroma due to the accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes and fibroblasts in response to the infection. Ocular fungal infections related to fungi, such as Aspergillus and Fusarium, and yeast, particularly Candida, can affect any part of the ocular surface and can extend to the interior ocular structures causing endophthalmitis. Fungal infections on the ocular surface may affect the cornea causing fungal keratitis, conjunctiva causing conjunctivitis, lacrimal glands causing dacryoadenitis, and eyelids causing blepharitis.

Usually, infectious and traumatic ocular diseases are treated with different therapies to provide treatment and/or protection against infection and promote re-epithelialization. Nowadays, the excessive use of antibiotics has led to the appearance of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, and there is a need for new antimicrobial formulations with novel mechanisms of action to overcome this major health problem.

The present review is intended to bring the most relevant general aspects and the main preclinical and clinical results related to the use of ozonated oil and liposomal ozonated oil in ocular infections and regeneration of ocular surface, and to bring to light the benefits of its use over other antiseptics, such as povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: endophthalmitis [^1c1d4001]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endophthalmitis is a serious, vision-threatening condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of endophthalmitis, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Endophthalmitis is a vision-threatening emergency associated with infection and inflammation of vitreous and aqueous humor. Risk factors include ocular trauma or surgery, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, and injection drug use. History and examination include visual changes, ocular pain, and inflammatory findings (e.g., hypopyon). Fever may be present. Diagnosis should be based on the clinical evaluation, though aqueous or vitreous culture performed by the ophthalmology specialist is recommended. Imaging including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound may suggest the disease but cannot exclude the diagnosis. Management includes emergent ophthalmology consultation and evaluation. Treatment for all types of endophthalmitis is injection of intravitreal antibiotics with consideration of vitrectomy in severe cases. Systemic antimicrobials are recommended in specific types of endophthalmitis. Prompt recognition and diagnosis are key to optimizing favorable visual outcomes.

Conclusions

An understanding of endophthalmitis can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this serious disease.

### Diagnostic techniques for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future: a review [^7b54e100]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intraocular inflammatory eye diseases though relatively uncommon remain an important cause of visual impairment. For example, uveitis is the third leading cause of blindness. Broadly, the underlying aetiologies are divided into infective and non-infective (presumed autoimmune or autoinflammatory) causes. Since the late 20 th century, advances in molecular techniques have led not only to increasing our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms that are associated with various forms non-infectious uveitides, but also to improved refined, sensitive and specific diagnosis of infectious causes. Our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways enabled in uveitis has led to the adoption of various immunosuppressive agents to overcome the burden of corticosteroid use, traditional and entrenched in uveitis practice. In a recent survey of treatment patterns of non-infectious uveitis by Ophthalmologists in the USA, it was found that up to 60% of patients were still treated with greater than 30mg of steroids for more than 1.5 years as maintenance therapy to control inflammation and the use of immunosuppressive therapy was only used in 12% of patients. 75% of physicians were not aware of treatment guidelines for uveitis. Such guidelines are based on data and evidence that include, over time, the iterative bench-to-bedside translation and delivering clinical evidence for use of anti-metabolites and calcineurin inhibitors. More recently, progress in targeted therapy with biologics targeted against cytokines (e.g. anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF-α), soluble mediators (e.g. interferons), or cell surface molecules (e.g. Alemtuzumab and CTLA-4 Ig) are showing great promise in the control of refractory non-infective uveitides. There remains the need to provide randomized controlled trial evidence to confirm their efficacy, some of which are on going. There are increasingly guidelines and algorithms being developed for immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies for non-infectious uveitis by harnessing the increasing evidence being developed, in for example Behcet's disease, and adoption by governments. Arguably on the contrary, infective uveitides are still managed based on the clinician's experience as such a clinical diagnosis is sometimes based on clinical signs and symptoms, supported by demographic information, morphology, laterality and clinical history. One clear example is cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV. However in practice with many cases, investigations are often necessary to elucidate and differentiate an aetiology and importantly to discriminate those that directly cause an infectious disease versus those evoking an inflammatory disease, such as latent tuberculosis (TB).

### Endophthalmitis: state of the art [^d2a2d16e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Endogenous endophthalmitis

Background and incidence

In contrast to exogenous endophthalmitis, endogenous endophthalmitis is caused by inoculation of the eye by infectious pathogens spread systemically through the bloodstream and across the blood-ocular barrier. Endogenous endophthalmitis is uncommon and generally accounts for 2%–16% of all reported endophthalmitis cases,–but the prevalence has been reported to be as high as 41% in one series.

Presentation

Symptoms of endogenous endophthalmitis include decreased vision, eye pain, eye redness, photophobia, floaters, and eyelid swelling.–Reported ocular signs include hypopyon, subconjuctival hemorrhage, conjuctival injection, iritis/retinitis, corneal edema, anterior chamber cells, and reduced or absent red reflex.

Since the pathogenesis of endogenous endophthalmitis typically involves hematogenous spread of infection to the eye, systemic findings and bilateral involvement are relatively common. Systemic finding would be signs and symptoms associated with sepsis or bacteremia such as fever, chills, and nausea and vomiting. Bilateral involvement of endogenous endophthalmitis has been reported in 19%–33% of cases.

Risk factors

Several studies have reported a high prevalence of comorbidities, which can potentially predispose patients to development of endogenous endophthalmitis. These include immunocompromisation, diabetes mellitus, malignancies, intravenous drug use, organ abscess, immunosuppressive therapy, indwelling catheter, urinary tract infection, organ transplant, end-stage renal or liver disease, and endocarditis.–While most studies evaluating patients with endogenous endophthalmitis have reported predisposing comorbidities, one series reported seven cases of culture proven endogenous endophthalmitis in healthy, immunocompetent individuals without any apparent extraocular loci of infection.

Causative organisms

The pathogens involved in endogenous endophthalmitis vary from study to study and appear to be potentially affected by geographic location and by the origin of the extraocular loci of infection. In contrast to other types of endophthalmitis where bacteria are the most prevalent pathogens, fungal causes were the most commonly isolated microorganisms in several series of endogenous endophthalmitis. The leading cause of fungal endogenous endophthalmitis is Candida albicans, followed by Aspergillus species.,

Bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis is typically due to Gram-positive species in western nations. Meanwhile, Gram-negative species (specifically Klebsiella species) are the main cause of bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis in East Asian countries.

### Diagnostic and management strategies of aspergillus endophthalmitis: current insights [^b8caec00]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ocular fungal infections represent a significant cause of loss of vision due to the involvement of different segments of the eye: cornea, orbit, eyelid, lacrimal apparatus, conjunctiva, sclera and internal structures in case of endophthalmitis.

Exogenous endophthalmitis may be consequent to postoperative or post-traumatic complications, whereas endogenous endophthalmitis derives from the hematogenous spread of pathogens into the eye and affects immunodepressed patients.

The incidence of endophthalmitis ranges from 0.03% to 1.3% following cataract surgery and can be as high as 30% to 40% following open globe injuries. Fungal endophthalmitis accounts for 8.6% to 18.6% of culture-positive cases and has increased over the last 20 years, probably because of a larger amount of immunodepressed individuals.–

Aspergillus accounts for 56% to 74% of all cases of fungal endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. The rate varies between 4% and 14% of fungal endophthalmitis following bulbar trauma.

Aspergillus is the second most common cause of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis after Candida; the infection involves most frequently immunocompromised patients affected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), malignancy, diabetes mellitus, or in therapy with immunodepressive medications. Other associations include solid organ transplantation, drug use, lung disease and renal insufficiency. However, immunocompetent individuals may also be affected by Aspergillus endophthalmitis with no risk factors.

Aspergillus causes reduction of visual capacity because of early macular involvement, retinal necrosis and choroidal damage. This severe and irreversible damage has to be prevented with an early diagnosis.

A PubMed search was performed using the search terms "Aspergillus, endophthalmitis, fungal infection, cataract surgery, ocular mycoses" and a full systematic review of the literature was conducted up until August 2019 to analyze current strategy to diagnose and treat Aspergillus endophthalmitis and discuss both pharmacological and surgical approach used for the management.

### American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations on screening for endogenous Candida endophthalmitis [^cda5bab4]. Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology evaluated the practice of routine screening for intraocular infection from Candida septicemia. In the United States, ophthalmologists are consulted in the hospital to screen for intraocular infection routinely for patients with Candida bloodstream infections. This practice was established in the era before the use of systemic antifungal medication and the establishment of definitions of ocular disease with candidemia. A recent systematic review found a rate of less than 1% of routinely screened patients with endophthalmitis from Candida septicemia. Other studies found higher rates of endophthalmitis but had limitations in terms of inaccuracies in ocular disease classification, lack of vitreous biopsies, selection biases, and lack of longer-term visual outcomes. Some studies attributed ocular findings to Candida infections, rather than other comorbidities. Studies also have not demonstrated differences in medical management that are modified for eye disease treatment; therefore, therapy should be dictated by the underlying Candida infection, rather than be tailored on the basis of ocular findings. In summary, the Academy does not recommend a routine ophthalmologic consultation after laboratory findings of systemic Candida septicemia, which appears to be a low-value practice. An ophthalmologic consultation is a reasonable practice for a patient with signs or symptoms suggestive of ocular infection regardless of Candida septicemia.

### How to use… eye swabs [^528337d3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a very common presentation to general practitioners and general paediatricians. The investigation of conjunctivitis can be a significant cost to microbiology laboratories due to the high volume of samples that can be submitted, particularly from patients in the community. The key issue is to send eye swabs in clinical situations where it can make a difference to management, and limiting the use of eye swabs in routine cases of conjunctivitis which are likely to be due to viruses. For investigation of neonatal conjunctivitis we recommend sending a bacterial swab for routine culture, and also a swab for molecular detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In older children with mild conjunctivitis no swab is necessary unless there is marked conjunctival injection. In this article we also highlight patient populations that require specialist tests to be sent as part of their assessment such as contact lens wearers and sexually active teenagers.

### Interferon-independent STING signaling promotes resistance to HSV-1 in vivo [^52f23faf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

STING S365A mice partially resist ocular HSV-1 infection

HSV-1 is a neurotropic virus that is transmitted via mucosal routes (typically oral, ocular, or genital) and infects epithelial cells before reaching the central nervous system where it establishes latency in neurons. Therefore, in order to mimic a more natural route of infection, we challenged mice with HSV-1 using an eye infection model. In these experiments, we used strain 17, a more virulent HSV-1 isolate, because the KOS strain used for intravenous infections fails to cause pathology in the eye infection model. As with systemic infection, Gt and ∆CTT mice rapidly lost weight and all mice succumbed to infection by 6–7 days post infection (Fig. 4a, b). In contrast, WT mice remained fully resistant and S365A mice exhibited an intermediate phenotype, with initial weight loss but later recovery and ~50% survival (Fig. 4a, b). Similar to systemic infection, the susceptibility of the mice correlated with viral burdens: WT and S365A exhibited lower viral titers in the eyewash (Supplementary Fig. 4a), whole brain, brain stem, and spinal cord as compared with Gt and ∆CTT mice (Fig. 4c–e). Once again, we found that Ifnb and viperin expression was elevated in WT but not in Gt, S365A or ∆CTT brain stems (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 4b). By contrast, we did not observe STING-dependent changes in Tnfa expression in the eye infection model (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Previous studies have shown that STING-dependent control of HSV-1 is cell-type specific. To investigate an S365-dependent viral control in brain cells, we infected primary neurons and astrocytes in vitro with HSV-1. However, we observed similar viral yields and autophagy-related processes (colocalization of virus-LC3 and LC3 conversion) (Supplementary Fig. 5a–e) in both cell populations among all genotypes, confirming prior reports that STING does not function cell autonomously in these cell types. We also infected bone marrow-derived macrophages with HSV-1 and observed that virus does not replicate well in these cells and did not stimulate detectable STING-induced autophagy (Supplementary Fig. 5f, g). To address which cells require S365 for type I IFN induction in vivo, we sorted brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) 3 days post infection from brains of HSV-1-infected mice (ocular route). We found elevated Ifnb expression in all cell populations only in WT mice (Fig. 4g–i), confirming that IFN-β induction in vivo requires STING S365. Together, our data suggest that STING-mediated control of HSV-1 infection in vivo does not require STING S365-induced type I IFN production.

### Contact lens wearer demographics and risk behaviors for contact lens-related eye infections – United States, 2014 [^eac064b0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

An estimated one in six adults in the United States wears contact lenses, and one third of them report at least one health care visit for a red or painful eye while wearing lenses. Approximately 99% of contact lens wearers reported at least one risk behavior ever for eye infections or inflammation. Of particular concern, contact lens wearers of all types frequently reported exposure of their contact lenses to water, including storing or rinsing their lenses in tap water and showering or swimming while wearing lenses. Exposure of lenses to water raises the risk for infection because microorganisms living in water can be transferred to the eye. Even household tap water, although treated to be safe for drinking, is not sterile and contains microorganisms that can contaminate lens cases and contact lenses and cause eye infections.

Sleeping in contact lenses was a frequently reported behavior. Although many soft and some rigid contact lenses have U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for overnight wear, sleeping in any type of contact lens increases risk for eye infection, although the precise mechanism is not known. Noncompliance with recommended lens and case replacement schedules was also commonly reported. Infrequent replacement of contact lens cases has been linked to serious eye infections. Additionally, contact lens wearers who do not follow recommended contact lens replacement schedules have more complications and eye discomfort. These behaviors raise the risk for eye infections because repeated handling of the lens and case provides opportunities for introduction of microorganisms, while the moist surface of the lens and case provide an environment conducive to microbial growth. This risk is compounded if wearers top off solution in the case, as a majority of surveyed contact lens wearers reported having done at least once. Topping off also decreases the effectiveness of contact lens disinfection.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis — regimen selection and outcomes emphasize multidisciplinary decision-making: The choice of regimen — including drug type and administration route — should be made in consultation with an ophthalmologist. Considerations should include the anatomic location of the retinal lesion, vision in the contralateral eye, and the individual's immunologic and virologic status, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Ocular complications, such as IRU and retinal detachment, are related to lesion size; therefore, the retinitis should be controlled with anti-CMV therapy to minimize lesion size until immune recovery is sufficient. Furthermore, evidence from both the pre-ART and ART eras demonstrates that specific anti-CMV therapy decreases mortality among immune-compromised patients with CMV retinitis.

### Key points… [^67af7f01]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Fungal eye infections are extremely rare but can be very serious.
- Most fungal eye infections occur from eye injuries.
- Eye surgeries and bloodstream infections can also cause fungal eye infections.
- Fungal eye infections are treated with prescription antifungal medications. Overview Eye infections can be caused by many different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, amoeba, and fungi. Eye infections caused by fungi are extremely rare but can be very serious. Types There are two main types of fungal eye infections, depending on the part of the eye that is infected. Many types of fungi can cause eye infections. Types of infections The two types of fungal eye infections are keratitis and endophthalmitis. Keratitis is an infection of the clear, front layer of the eye. Endophthalmitis is an infection of the inside of the eye. Endophthalmitis can occur two different ways.

Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs after fungal spores enter the eye from an external source. Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs when a bloodstream infection spreads to one or both eyes. Many types of fungi can cause infections. Fusarium–lives in the environment, especially in soil and on plants. Aspergillus– common mold foundi n indoor and outdoor environments. Candida– a type of yeast that normally lives in and on the body. Symptoms The symptoms of a fungal eye infection can show up anytime from several days to several weeks after an exposure. Fungal eye infection symptoms are similar to those of other types of eye infections, like those caused by bacteria. Symptoms can include:

- Eye pain
- Eye redness
- Blurred vision
- Sensitivity to light
- Excessive tearing
- Eye discharge. Causes A fungal eye infection can be caused by:

- Eye injury, especially with plant material.
- Eye surgery or invasive eye procedures.
- Contaminated medical products are a potential risk factor.
- Contaminated medical products are a potential risk factor.
- Chronic eye disease involving the surface of the eye.
- Wearing contact lenses.
- Fungal bloodstream infection.
