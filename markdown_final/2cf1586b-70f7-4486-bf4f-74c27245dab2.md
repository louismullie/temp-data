## Question

Patient with either pre-render azotemia or postrenal azotemia in the early stage. History of asthma, hypertension and t2DM

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate and manage early-stage prerenal versus postrenal azotemia in a patient with asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and distinguishing features of prerenal and postrenal azotemia. Then, I should verify the initial diagnostic workup, including history, exam, labs, and imaging. Next, I will review medication reconciliation with attention to nephrotoxic and hemodynamically active drugs. After that, I need to outline immediate management for prerenal and postrenal etiologies, including fluids, catheterization, and RAAS inhibitor handling. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, thresholds for nephrology consultation, and special considerations in diabetes and asthma, and close with a concise decision algorithm and safety checks [^111NmB7g] [^114Jdmv4].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic distinctions. Prerenal azotemia reflects decreased effective renal perfusion with intact tubular function, producing avid sodium and water reabsorption, oliguria, and a BUN/creatinine ratio often greater than 20:1, whereas postrenal azotemia from obstruction initially shows low urine output and low urine sodium due to impaired outflow, but with sustained obstruction can transition to intrinsic injury if not relieved, so timing of recognition and decompression is critical [^114Jdmv4] [^113GXEgH].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to conclusions. I should obtain a focused history for volume loss, heart failure, NSAID or ACEi/ARB use, and obstructive symptoms, then examine for orthostasis, edema, jugular venous distension, and a palpable bladder, and order urinalysis with microscopy, urine sodium, urine creatinine for FENa, urine osmolality, and a basic metabolic panel including BUN and creatinine, while remembering that a BUN/creatinine ratio above 20:1 supports prerenal but is imperfect and must be interpreted in context [^111NmB7g] [^111ATaCw]. I should also confirm that renal ultrasound is indicated early to exclude obstruction, especially in older men or those with risk factors, because prompt decompression can reverse functional injury [^111NmB7g] [^114Jdmv4].

> Hold on, I should verify medication contributors that can mimic or worsen prerenal physiology. NSAIDs impair afferent arteriolar vasodilation and can precipitate prerenal azotemia, ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce efferent tone and can unmask hemodynamic AKI in volume-depleted states, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics such as metolazone can provoke prerenal azotemia and hyperglycemia, so I need to check for these and consider holding or adjusting them based on volume status and kidney function trajectory [^111vbPGH] [^1143PyGM]. I should double-check for metformin as well; in hypoperfusion or hypoxia, metformin-associated lactic acidosis risk rises, so it should be held in acute kidney injury or hypoxic states pending recovery [^1145QeN8].

> Next, I should review prerenal management. If the patient is intravascularly depleted, isotonic crystalloid resuscitation is appropriate, with careful reassessment of volume responsiveness and urine output, and I should avoid over-resuscitation that could precipitate volume overload, particularly in heart failure or cirrhosis, where albumin-guided challenges may be preferred in select contexts [^111NmB7g] [^113jZndV]. Let me reconsider RAAS inhibitors; I should not reflexively stop an ACEi or ARB if the creatinine rise is modest and the patient has proteinuric CKD, but I should monitor closely and consider temporary dose reduction if there is significant hemodynamic instability or a creatinine rise exceeding about 30 percent from baseline, aligning with kidney outcome benefits of RAAS blockade in diabetes and CKD [^114BoXBC] [^116VhNKh].

> I will now examine postrenal management. If obstruction is identified, immediate urologic consultation for decompression is indicated, typically via urethral or suprapubic catheterization depending on the level of obstruction, because early relief can rapidly reverse functional azotemia and prevent progression to tubular injury [^114Jdmv4]. But wait, what if the patient has diabetes and autonomic neuropathy affecting bladder emptying; I should check for urinary retention and elevated post-void residuals, as this can masquerade as prerenal disease and requires catheter drainage rather than aggressive fluids [^115spsC7].

> Let me think about monitoring and follow-up. I should confirm frequent reassessment of vitals, urine output, daily creatinine and electrolytes, and repeat ultrasound if obstruction is suspected but not initially visualized, recognizing that creatinine can lag and that oliguria alone is an early but imperfect marker of AKI severity, so serial trends matter [^111NmB7g] [^1168XcAC]. I need to ensure that if RAAS inhibitors or diuretics are initiated or uptitrated, kidney function and potassium are rechecked within 7 to 14 days per diabetes guidelines, and sooner if clinically unstable, to catch hemodynamic or electrolyte complications early [^111eQck7] [^1125hA23].

> I should confirm thresholds for nephrology consultation. Indications include uncertain etiology after initial workup, stage 3 AKI or higher, preexisting stage 4 CKD, need for renal replacement therapy, refractory electrolyte or acid-base disturbances, or rapidly progressive kidney injury, and this is especially important in diabetes where atypical features may signal non-diabetic glomerular disease or renovascular etiologies [^111NmB7g] [^11141cw2]. Hold on, I should verify secondary causes of hypertension if there is resistant hypertension, new azotemia after ACEi/ARB, or a significant kidney size discrepancy, as renovascular disease may require targeted imaging and management [^115SsmBi] [^113aXSur].

> Let me consider special issues in diabetes and asthma. Autonomic neuropathy can impair bladder emptying and mimic prerenal azotemia, so I should check for retention and manage catheterization accordingly, and beta-agonists for asthma can cause hypokalemia and shift potassium intracellularly, which may confound electrolyte interpretation during diuretic therapy, so I need to monitor potassium closely and adjust supplements or diuretics as needed [^115spsC7] [^113cb6Ds]. I should also remember that in diabetic CKD, RAAS blockade remains foundational for kidney protection, and I should tolerate an expected eGFR dip up to about 30 percent if accompanied by blood pressure and albuminuria benefit, with close follow-up labs to ensure safety [^114BoXBC] [^116VhNKh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a BUN/creatinine ratio above 20:1 would reliably distinguish prerenal from postrenal, but I should double-check that assumption because the ratio has limited diagnostic performance in real-world emergency settings and must be interpreted alongside urine indices, volume status, and imaging rather than in isolation [^111ATaCw] [^111KxnfM]. I also briefly considered whether a low BUN/creatinine ratio might suggest postrenal obstruction, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; a low ratio more often points toward intrinsic renal disease rather than obstruction, so I should avoid overinterpreting extremes without corroborating data [^notfound].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure a disciplined algorithm: assess volume status and obstructive symptoms, obtain urinalysis with microscopy and urine chemistries including sodium and osmolality, calculate FENa, check BUN/creatinine ratio as supportive rather than definitive, and perform renal ultrasound early to exclude obstruction, then manage prerenal with cautious isotonic fluids and judicious medication adjustments while managing postrenal with urgent decompression, all with frequent monitoring and timely nephrology input when indicated [^111NmB7g] [^114Jdmv4]. If I follow this structured approach, I can minimize delays, avoid iatrogenic harm from misclassification, and maximize the chance of rapid renal recovery in this high-risk patient with diabetes and hypertension [^111NmB7g].

Early-stage prerenal azotemia reflects **reversible hypoperfusion** [^114Jdmv4] and is managed with **isotonic fluids** [^111NmB7g] and stopping NSAIDs/ACEis/ARBs [^notfound]; early-stage postrenal azotemia reflects **reversible obstruction** [^114Jdmv4] and is managed with **urgent decompression** (catheter or stent) [^111NmB7g]. Both require prompt recognition and correction to prevent progression to ATN [^111vbPGH]; prerenal cases need close monitoring of volume status and renal function, while postrenal cases need imaging and urology input [^111NmB7g]. In patients with asthma, hypertension, and T2DM, avoid nephrotoxins, adjust antihypertensives, and monitor electrolytes and glucose closely [^111eQck7].

## Pathophysiology and clinical features

Key distinctions in pathophysiology, clinical features, and reversibility:

| **Aspect** | **Prerenal azotemia** | **Postrenal azotemia** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | Reduced renal perfusion from hypovolemia, heart failure, or vasodilation [^1133HscU] causes GFR to fall without tubular injury; the kidney responds with sodium and water retention, concentrating urine, and increasing BUN relative to creatinine [^113gBUEu] | Obstruction increases intratubular pressure, reducing GFR and causing back-leak; early obstruction is functional and reversible if promptly relieved [^114Jdmv4] |
| Clinical features | Oliguria, concentrated urine, high BUN/creatinine ratio (> 20:1), low urine sodium (< 20 mmol/L), and low FENa (< 1%) [^114Jdmv4] | Flank pain, hematuria, anuria or alternating urine output, distended bladder, hydronephrosis on ultrasound [^115spsC7] |
| Reversibility | Rapidly reversible with restoration of perfusion; prolonged hypoperfusion can progress to ATN [^114Jdmv4] | Early decompression (catheter or stent) restores function; delayed relief risks irreversible injury [^114Jdmv4] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

| **Parameter** | **Prerenal azotemia** | **Postrenal azotemia** |
|-|-|-|
| Urine output | Oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/h) | Oliguria or anuria |
| Urine specific gravity | High (> 1.020) | Normal or low |
| Urine sodium | Low (< 20 mmol/L) | Variable |
| FENa | Low (< 1%) | Variable |
| BUN/creatinine ratio | High (> 20:1) | Normal or high |
| Ultrasound | Normal kidneys | Hydronephrosis, obstruction |

---

Imaging with **renal ultrasound** is essential to distinguish prerenal from postrenal causes and guide intervention [^117E4SRg].

---

## Management strategies

### Prerenal azotemia

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Isotonic crystalloids to restore intravascular volume and renal perfusion [^111NmB7g].

- **Medication adjustment**: Stop NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs temporarily; restart cautiously after perfusion improves [^111NmB7g].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent assessment of volume status, urine output, and renal function [^111NmB7g].

---

### Postrenal azotemia

- **Relief of obstruction**: Urgent catheterization or stenting to restore urine flow [^notfound].

- **Address underlying cause**: Treat stones, strictures, or prostatic hypertrophy [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Renal function and electrolytes after decompression [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Both prerenal and early postrenal azotemia are **reversible with timely intervention** [^114Jdmv4]; delayed treatment risks progression to ATN and chronic kidney disease. Early recognition and correction improve outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality [^111NmB7g].

---

## Special considerations in patients with asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus

- **Asthma**: Avoid nephrotoxic agents (e.g. NSAIDs); beta-agonists can cause hypokalemia, worsening renal perfusion [^111vbPGH].

- **Hypertension**: ACE inhibitors and ARBs may precipitate prerenal azotemia in hypovolemia; monitor closely and adjust as needed [^111vbPGH].

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**: Hyperglycemia can worsen renal perfusion; optimize glycemic control and monitor for electrolyte disturbances [^116DpqXk].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive measures include maintaining **adequate hydration**, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, and monitoring renal function in high-risk patients [^111NmB7g]. In diabetes and hypertension, regular follow-up and medication adjustment help prevent prerenal azotemia [^114BoXBC].

---

Early-stage prerenal and postrenal azotemia are **distinct, reversible syndromes** requiring prompt, targeted management. Prerenal azotemia needs volume repletion and hemodynamic optimization, whereas postrenal azotemia requires urgent decompression. In patients with asthma, hypertension, and T2DM, individualized care and close monitoring are essential to prevent progression and complications [^1125hA23].

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^116zoaEu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include: (1) an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, (2) an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, (3) a careful assessment of volume status, and (4) the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities. The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI. Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group, generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients? In evaluating the current literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI, and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Metolazone (zaroxolyn) [^115mSsCg]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

DO NOT INTERCHANGE ZAROXOLYN TABLETS AND OTHER FORMULATIONS OF METOLAZONE THAT SHARE ITS SLOW AND INCOMPLETE BIOAVAILABILITY AND ARE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT AT THE SAME DOSES TO MYKROX TABLETS, A MORE RAPIDLY AVAILABLE AND COMPLETELY BIOAVAILABLE METOLAZONE PRODUCT. FORMULATIONS BIOEQUIVALENT TO ZAROXOLYN AND FORMULATIONS BIOEQUIVALENT TO MYKROX SHOULD BE INTERCHANGED FOR ONE ANOTHER. DO NOT INTERCHANGE NOT NOT

Fluid And Electrolytes

All patients receiving therapy with ZAROXOLYN Tablets should have serum electrolyte measurements done at appropriate intervals and be observed for clinical signs of fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. In patients with severe edema accompanying cardiac failure or renal disease, a low-salt syndrome may be produced, especially with hot weather and a low-salt diet. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient has protracted vomiting, severe diarrhea, or is receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs of imbalance are: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscle fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hyponatremia may occur at any time during long term therapy and, on rare occasions, may be life threatening.

The risk of hypokalemia is increased when larger doses are used, when diuresis is rapid, when severe liver disease is present, when corticosteroids are given concomitantly, when oral intake is inadequate or when excess potassium is being lost extrarenally, such as with vomiting or diarrhea.

Thiazide-like diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Glucose Tolerance

Metolazone may raise blood glucose concentrations possibly causing hyperglycemia and glycosuria in patients with diabetes or latent diabetes.

Hyperuricemia

ZAROXOLYN regularly causes an increase in serum uric acid and can occasionally precipitate gouty attacks even in patients without a prior history of them.

Azotemia

Azotemia, presumably prerenal azotemia, may be precipitated during the administration of ZAROXOLYN. If azotemia and oliguria worsen during treatment of patients with severe renal disease, ZAROXOLYN should be discontinued.

Renal Impairment

Use caution when administering ZAROXOLYN Tablets to patients with severely impaired renal function. As most of the drug is excreted by the renal route, accumulation may occur.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

### Approach to the patient with type 2 diabetes and progressive kidney disease [^116DpqXk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes and progressive kidney disease requires a comprehensive approach that includes aggressive blood pressure control with agents that also lower urinary protein excretion and optimization of glucose and lipid control while remaining cognizant of the therapeutic limitations imparted by renal dysfunction. Clinicians must also address the comorbidities associated with renal failure such as anemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Diabetic nephropathy typically follows a slowly progressive course from albuminuria to azotemia. Consequently, optimal care includes planning for the management of impending renal failure long before the patient requires dialysis or transplantation.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^1132UKCM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis residual kidney function — pharmacologic and etiologic measures to preserve RKF: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are agents of choice in HD patients with significant residual kidney function (RKF) who need antihypertensive medication, insults known to be nephrotoxic in patients with normal or impaired kidney function should be assumed, in the absence of direct evidence, to be nephrotoxic for the remnant kidney in HD patients and therefore should be avoided, and prerenal and postrenal causes of decrease in RKF should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

### Prerenal acute kidney injury-still a relevant term in modern clinical practice? [^117BvjEb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The traditional taxonomy of acute kidney injury (AKI) has remained pervasive in clinical nephrology. While the terms 'prerenal', 'intrarenal' and 'postrenal' highlight the diverse pathophysiology underlying AKI, they also imply discrete disease pathways and de-emphasize the nature of AKI as an evolving clinical syndrome with multiple, often simultaneous and overlapping, causes. In a similar vein, prerenal AKI comprises a diverse spectrum of kidney disorders, albeit one that is often managed by using a standardized clinical algorithm. We contend that the term 'prerenal' is too vague to adequately convey our current understanding of hypoperfusion-related AKI and that it should thus be avoided in the clinical setting. Practice patterns among nephrologists indicate that AKI-related terminology plays a significant role in the approaches that clinicians take to patients that have this complex disease. Thus, it appears that precise terminology does impact the treatment that patients receive. We will outline differences in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions lying on the so-called prerenal disease spectrum to advocate caution when administering intravenous fluids to these clinically decompensated patients. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may, thus, avert clinical missteps such as fluid and vasopressor mismanagement in tenuous or critically ill patients.

### Management of acute renal failure [^115vHPYG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure is present in 1 to 5 percent of patients at hospital admission and affects up to 20 percent of patients in intensive care units. The condition has prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal causes, with prerenal conditions accounting for 60 to 70 percent of cases. The cause of acute renal failure usually can be identified through an appropriate history, a physical examination, and selected laboratory tests. The initial laboratory evaluation should include urinalysis, a determination of the fractional excretion of sodium, a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio, and a basic metabolic panel. Management includes correction of fluid and electrolyte levels; avoidance of nephrotoxins; and kidney replacement therapy, when appropriate. Several recent studies support the use of acetylcysteine for the prevention of acute renal failure in patients undergoing various procedures. The relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.11 in patients undergoing radiocontrast-media procedures (absolute risk reduction: 19 percent) and 0.33 in patients undergoing coronary angiography (absolute risk reduction: 8 percent). In patients pretreated with sodium bicarbonate before radiocontrast-media procedures, the relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.13 and the absolute risk reduction was 11.9 percent. Dopamine and diuretics have been shown to be ineffective in ameliorating the course of acute renal failure.

### Adrenal mass causing secondary hypertension [^112UfmUx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most hypertensive patients have essential (primary) hypertension; only 5% to 10% have a secondary cause. Two clinical characteristics suggestive of secondary hypertension are early onset (< 30 years of age) and severe hypertension (> 180/110 mm Hg). When faced with these findings, clinicians should consider a secondary cause of hypertension.

Case Report

A 22-year-old woman being evaluated for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department was noted to have severe persistent hypertension. Additional evaluation revealed severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypernatremia. The patient was admitted to the hospital for blood pressure management, electrolyte replacement, and further evaluation of presumed hyperaldosteronism. Diagnostic imaging revealed a large adrenal mass. Surgical resection was performed, leading to a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism caused by adrenal carcinoma. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Secondary hypertension is far less common than essential hypertension; however, considering the large volume of patients seen in emergency departments, it is likely that some will have secondary hypertension. Emergency physicians should be aware of the clinical characteristics that suggest secondary hypertension so that the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathways can be pursued.

---

### Metolazone [^1143PyGM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucose Tolerance

Metolazone may raise blood glucose concentrations possibly causing hyperglycemia and glycosuria in patients with diabetes or latent diabetes.

Hyperuricemia

Metolazone tablets regularly cause an increase in serum uric acid and can occasionally precipitate gouty attacks even in patients without a prior history of them.

Azotemia

Azotemia, presumably prerenal azotemia, may be precipitated during the administration of metolazone tablets. If azotemia and oliguria worsen during treatment of patients with severe renal disease, metolazone tablets should be discontinued.

Renal Impairment

Use caution when administering metolazone tablets to patients with severely impaired renal function. As most of the drug is excreted by the renal route, accumulation may occur.

Orthostatic Hypotension

Orthostatic hypotension may occur; this may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, or concurrent therapy with other antihypertensive drugs.

Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia may infrequently occur with metolazone, especially in patients taking high doses of vitamin D or with high bone turnover states, and may signify hidden hyperparathyroidism. Metolazone should be discontinued before tests for parathyroid function are performed.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics have exacerbated or activated systemic lupus erythematosus and this possibility should be considered with metolazone tablets.

Information For Patients

Patients should be informed of possible adverse effects, advised to take the medication as directed, and promptly report any possible adverse reactions to the treating physician.

### Chronic kidney disease-part 2: management and its complications [^114kP1bb]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

### Prerenal success in chronic kidney disease [^1143fW5X]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics are commonly prescribed to patients with chronic kidney disease to reduce systemic blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin inhibitors also reduce intraglomerular pressure. The lower pressures may result in initial increases in the serum creatinine. The long-term renoprotection provided by these therapies establishes the basis for tolerating the initial increases. However, physicians are sometimes reluctant to continue these treatments when the serum creatinine increases. Several reasons for this reluctance are discussed, including the failure to distinguish between hemodynamic- and parenchymal-mediated changes in kidney function. In addition, the lack of a formal term and place in our diagnostic algorithm for increases in serum creatinine that derive from ultimately beneficial hemodynamic alterations may be a hindrance. The term "prerenal success" is proposed to describe hemodynamic alterations associated with improved prognosis and is placed in a new algorithm. Finally, recent literature describing harmful effects of increases in serum creatinine in other cohorts is reviewed; these cohorts are sufficiently different from the stable chronic kidney disease patient that the results ought not to be extrapolated.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^1133HscU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

### Low-flow acute kidney injury: the pathophysiology of prerenal azotemia, abdominal compartment syndrome, and obstructive uropathy [^114Jdmv4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

AKI is a syndrome, not a disease. It results from many different primary and/or secondary etiologies and is often multifactorial, especially in the hospitalized patient. This review discusses the pathophysiology of three etiologies that cause AKI, those being kidney hypoperfusion, abdominal compartment syndrome, and urinary tract obstruction. The pathophysiology of these three causes of AKI differs but is overlapping. They all lead to a low urine flow rate and low urine sodium initially. In all three cases, with early recognition and correction of the underlying process, the resulting functional AKI can be rapidly reversed. However, with continued duration and/or increased severity, cell injury occurs within the kidney, resulting in structural AKI and a longer and more severe disease state with increased morbidity and mortality. This is why early recognition and reversal are critical.

### Alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride (Kazano) [^1145QeN8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoxic States

Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue KAZANO.

Excessive Alcohol Intake

Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving KAZANO.

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of KAZANO in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

5.2 Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 2 (< 0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in 7 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo.

It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using KAZANO.

After initiation of KAZANO, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, alogliptin should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.

Chronic kidney disease, as defined by albuminuria or decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), affects 11.6% of the adult population in the United States. CKD frequently occurs in association with diabetes and hypertension, suggesting that vascular disease is a likely cause in many people. We provide data on the frequency of diabetes, hypertension, or both, according to albumin-to-creatinine ratio and eGFR, and review the rationale for retaining the current name.

### Varenicline-associated acute renal failure [^116rUCpT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report an association between acute renal failure and varenicline.

Case Summary

A 53-year-old white male with preexisting moderate renal insufficiency was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure following a change in serum creatinine from 4 mg/dL at baseline to 10.6 mg/dL upon admission. One week prior to admission, the patient started taking varenicline (dose undetermined) for smoking cessation and had been stable on all other medications for 2 months prior to admission. All hospital workup tests were negative for prerenal azotemia, postrenal obstruction, and intrinsic renal disease. Varenicline was discontinued on admission. With no other changes in therapy, the serum creatinine level decreased each day of the patient's 5-day hospitalization to 8.6 mg/dL upon discharge, and it was 6.4 mg/dL at a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after discharge.

Discussion

Varenicline is a novel medication that is effective for smoking cessation. Adverse effects are generally mild and self-limiting, with gastro-intestinal effects most commonly reported. According to the package insert, varenicline does not change creatinine clearance to any appreciable extent, but it should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. It also states that varenicline can cause acute renal failure rarely; to our knowledge, this is the first published association of varenicline with renal effects. Use of the Naranjo probability scale showed varenicline to be the probable cause of renal dysfunction in this patient because of the temporal relationship and lack of alternative causes.

Conclusions

Although there was a probable relationship between varenicline and acute renal failure in this patient, the significant benefit of smoking cessation to overall health outweighs the risk of this rare adverse effect. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect and should monitor renal function upon initiation of varenicline therapy, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### A longitudinal clinical trajectory analysis examining the accumulation of Co-morbidity in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with non-T2D individuals [^113FMGzB]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Pre-diagnosis of T2D

In the period prior to an individual receiving a T2D diagnosis, we found a steadily increasing prevalence of hypertension (higher than in the control group), along with less severe but still substantial manifestations of ischaemic heart disease and documented renal illness. The incidence of asthma also increased. The prevalence of chest infections as well as ear, nose and throat infections increased in both groups. These findings imply that other health problems emerge that are precursors to the future emergence of T2D and that there is therefore a window of opportunity prior to the diagnosis of T2D when enhanced preventative interventions could be provided. The answer to the question of whether some pre-T2D diagnostic characteristics are a direct result of the beginning phase of diabetes or a side effect of the undetected onset of diabetes is crucial.

Consequently, it is only reasonable to assume that certain clinical indications associated with T2D would be present in patients who eventually receive a clinical diagnosis of T2D when utilising the strict cutoff of "clinical diagnosis" as a time point. The duration of the pre-diagnosis time window in relation to the accumulation of comorbidities appears to be much longer than generally appreciated, particularly in terms of increasing levels of hypertension and an increased frequency of respiratory/ear, nose and throat infections and diagnosed asthma. While some indicators of impaired glucose control would be expected prior to diagnosis, these two observations stood out as being immediately of interest.

### Oliguria in the ICU. systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment [^1112Ynue]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Perioperative oliguria is common but rarely implies acute renal failure. We should interpret oliguria as a sign of intravascular hypovolemia and treat it as prerenal until proven otherwise. On the other hand, the absence of oliguria does not exclude acute renal failure. The most reliable clinical indicator of progressive renal dysfunction is a serial decline in creatinine clearance estimation, a measure of glomerular filtration rate.

### The diagnosis and non-pharmacological management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis [^113DppVE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis is quite common, and is seen in up to 50% of patients hospitalized for decompensated cirrhosis. Causes of acute kidney injury include prerenal, renal, or postrenal etiologies. The diagnosis and early institution of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management are key to the recovery of renal function. The objective of this review is to provide a practical approach to the use of diagnostic biomarkers and highlight the nonpharmacologic management and prevention of acute kidney injury.

### Sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride (Janumet) [^114kmuuY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery and Other Procedures

Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. JANUMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.

Hypoxic States

Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue JANUMET.

Excessive Alcohol Intake

Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET.

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of JANUMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

5.2 Pancreatitis

There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUMET. After initiation of JANUMET, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUMET should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET.

5.3 Heart Failure

An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Consider the risks and benefits of JANUMET prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUMET.

### Acute kidney injury [^113Ghui6]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and classification of acute pathology in the kidney are major clinical problems. Azotemia and oliguria represent not only disease but normal responses of the kidney to extracellular volume depletion or decreased renal blood flow. Changes in urine output and glomerular filtration rate are therefore neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of renal pathology. However, no simple alternative for the diagnosis currently exists. By examining both glomerular and tubular function, clinicians routinely make inferences not only on the presence of renal dysfunction but also on its cause. However, pure prerenal physiology is unusual in hospitalized patients, and its effects are not necessary benign. Sepsis, the most common condition associated with acute renal failure in the intensive care unit, may alter renal function without any characteristic changes in urine indices, and classification of these abnormalities as prerenal will undoubtedly lead to incorrect management decisions. The clinical syndrome known as acute tubular necrosis does not actually manifest the morphologic changes that the name implies. A precise biochemical definition of acute renal failure has never been proposed, and until recently, there has been no consensus on the diagnostic criteria or clinical definition. Depending on the definition used, acute renal failure has been reported to affect from 1% to 25% of intensive care unit patients and has led to mortality rates ranging from 15% to 60%. From this chaos, two principles emerged: first, the need for a standard definition and, second, the need to classify the severity of the syndrome rather than only consider its most severe form. The RIFLE criteria were developed to achieve these goals, and the term acute kidney injury has been proposed to encompass the entire spectrum of the syndrome, from minor changes in renal function to requirement for renal replacement therapy. Thus, acute kidney injury is not acute tubular necrosis, nor is it renal failure. Small changes in kidney function in hospitalized patients are important and are associated with significant changes in short-term and possibly long-term outcomes. The RIFLE criteria provide a uniform definition of acute kidney injury and have now been validated in numerous studies.

### Optimal timing of renal replacement therapy initiation in acute kidney injury: the elephant felt by the blindmen? [^112btud8]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Practical implications and prospects: we plea for a universal AKI definition!

AKI is a complex disorder with many potential (i.e. septic, ischemic, or toxic) triggers. Prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal disorders may either alone or in combination contribute to AKI severity and progression. All of these factors finally will determine patient outcome. On top of this, RRT is increasingly implemented in the treatment of AKI, even in the absence of life-threatening hemodynamic or metabolic conditions. Basing decisions on creatinine concentrations or urinary output is unreliable in critically ill ICU patients. Moreover, the prognosis may also vary in patients who are diagnosed with similar AKI stage at different time points (e.g. at admission or during hospitalization). Thus, currently applied AKI criteria should be adapted and perhaps strengthened by adding sensitive functional and structural biomarkers.

Several novel biomarkers have been introduced as an aid to identify patients with AKI earlier, to evaluate severity of kidney injury, to differentiate type and etiology of injury, and to assess the effect of interventions on renal recovery. Some biomarkers may even independently detect AKI progression regardless of glomerular filtration rate changes. Actual biomarkers lack specificity for correctly assessing the time of AKI occurrence but are useful for risk stratification in severe AKI and for determining the need for RRT or mortality prediction. Furthermore, a clinical approach supported by biomarker assessment performed better than a pure clinical or biomarker model to predict relevant outcome variables such as AKI progression, recovery of renal function, need for RRT, and death.

We strongly believe that adding biomarker measurement to existing AKI classifications would more accurately confirm both the presence and severity of AKI and allow appropriate stratification and inclusion of patients in well-designed RCTs. This is imperative to correctly assess the real impact of early versus late RRT initiation on patient outcome. Maybe then we will behold the whole elephant!

### National Kidney Foundation consensus conference on cardiovascular and kidney diseases and diabetes risk: an integrated therapeutic approach to reduce events [^117LcTnz]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in industrialized nations. Type 2 diabetes is a CVD risk factor that confers risk similar to a previous myocardial infarction in an individual who does not have diabetes. In addition, the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is diabetes. Together, diabetes and hypertension account for more than two-thirds of CVD risk, and other risk factors such as dyslipidemia contribute to the remainder of CVD risk. CKD, particularly with presence of significant albuminuria, should be considered an additional cardiovascular risk factor. There is no consensus on how to assess and stratify risk for patients with kidney disease across subspecialties that commonly treat such patients. This paper summarizes the results of a consensus conference utilizing a patient case to discuss the integrated management of hypertension, kidney disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and heart failure across disciplines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are the clinical needs? [^113EWmme]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Renal disease is prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. Aggressive metabolic control and lowering of systemic and/or intraglomerular blood pressure are effective interventions but not without side effects. Thus a better, early identification of patients at risk for incidence or progression to end-stage renal failure by the use of new, validated biomarkers is highly desirable. In the majority of patients, hypertension and hyperglycaemia are pathogenetically important pathways for the progression of renal disease. Nonetheless even aggressive therapy targeting these factors does not eliminate the risk of end-stage renal failure and experimental evidence suggests that many other pathways (e.g. tubulointerstitial hypoxia or inflammation etc.) also contribute. As their individual importance might vary from patient to patient, interventions which interfere are likely not to be therapeutically effective in all subjects. In this situation, an option to preserve the statistical power of clinical trials is to rely on biomarkers that reflect individual pathophysiology. In current clinical practice, albuminuria is the biomarker that has been best evaluated to guide stratified/personalized therapy but there is a clear need to expand our diagnostic abilities.

### Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene (triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) [^113cb6Ds]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Hypochloremia

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Renal Stones

Triamterene has been found in renal stones in association with the other usual calculus components. Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules should be used with caution in patients with a history of renal stones.

Serum Potassium

The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq per liter with 4.5 mEq often being used for a reference point. If hypokalemia should develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium-rich foods.

Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels. Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq per liter require careful observation and treatment. Serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration. A rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in the intracellular potassium concentration. Discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately if laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium. Discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal.

Serum Creatinine and BUN

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine level or both. This apparently is secondary to a reversible reduction of glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume (prerenal azotemia) rather than renal toxicity; levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are discontinued. If azotemia increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules. Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be made, especially in elderly patients and in patients with suspected or confirmed renal insufficiency.

Serum PBI

Thiazide may decrease serum PBI levels without sign of thyroid disturbance.

### Acute kidney injury: novel biomarkers and potential utility for patient care in urology [^117KnKQc]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Urologists are integrally involved in the management of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is common after renal surgery or secondary to postrenal (obstructive) etiologies. The measurement of serum creatinine is a suboptimal indicator of AKI because it lags behind acute changes in renal function. Recent advances indicate that serum/urine biomarkers will prove useful for early detection of AKI, analogous to the use of cardiac enzymes for acute myocardial infarction. These serum/urine markers may guide future therapy, facilitate research efforts to reduce the severity of AKI, such as after partial nephrectomy, and allow for more accurate prognostication for patients with AKI.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^113gBUEu]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

A limitation that affects most studies on AKI, is the absence of a baseline creatinine for all patients. Indeed, the KDIGO classification scheme requires a baseline creatinine level to define AKI. In the absence of such values a method of "imputation" or "back calculation" by reversing the "Modification of Diet in Renal Disease" (MDRD) equation using age, sex and an assumed normal GFR of 75 mL/min per 1.73 m² has been recommended by the ADQI workgroup. This commonly accepted method underestimates baseline creatinine and overestimates GFR. It has been shown that the incidence of AKI actually falls when you rely excessively on the estimation of baseline renal function by this method. Challinger et al. found that 54% of the 745 patients included in their study on AKI in the Emergency Department had no baseline creatinine measurement. These patients were assumed to have a normal estimated GFR. They found an overall incidence of AKI of 24.4%, but this rose to 38.1% if only patients with known previous creatinine records were included. Because of this observation we decided to exclude patients with no creatinine baseline (n = 255).

Acute renal failure remains a common, devastating complication of the postoperative period and in the critically ill patient. The most common cause is the progression of prerenal insufficiency to ATN. Despite improved understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms, including impaired hemodynamic autoregulation, medullary hypoxia, and proximal tubular obstruction and transtubular backleak, the treatment, to date, remains largely supportive. Avoidance by ensuring hemodynamic stability, with provision of adequate renal perfusion, provides the best means for minimizing the complications of this organ dysfunction.

### Current concepts in the diagnosis and classification of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis [^1137Rogx]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Renal dysfunction is one of the most common complications of cirrhosis with high morbidity and mortality.

Summary

In subjects with cirrhosis, renal dysfunction can present either as a direct consequence of cirrhosis (e.g. hepatorenal syndrome type I and type II) or secondary to etiologies other than cirrhosis (chronic kidney disease due to diabetic nephropathy, prerenal azotemia), or patients with cirrhosis may have renal dysfunction resulting directly from cirrhosis and an underlying chronic kidney disease.

Key Messages

Given the challenges in the differential diagnosis of renal dysfunction and insufficient accuracy of serum creatinine and creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate estimating equations in cirrhosis, there is an urgent need for more accurate biomarkers of renal dysfunction in this population. This review will discuss novel concepts for the diagnosis and classification of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis to overcome at least some of the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Additionally, a new classification will be proposed for renal dysfunction in cirrhosis.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115xkS7v]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

4. Interpretation

A. Nonanalytical sources of variation.

Transient increases in urinary albumin excretion have been reported with short-term hyperglycemia, exercise, urinary tract infections, marked hypertension, heart failure, acute febrile illness, and hyperlipidemia.

RECOMMENDATION: LOW URINE ALBUMIN CONCENTRATIONS (i.e. < 30 mg/g CREATININE) ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IF THE eGFR IS > 60 mL · min ⁻¹ · (1.73 m²) ⁻¹ AND THE PATIENT IS NORMOTENSIVE. IF THE eGFR IS < 60 mL · min ⁻¹ · (1.73 m²) ⁻¹ AND/OR THE LEVEL OF ALBUMINURIA IS ≥ 30 mg/g CREATININE ON A SPOT URINE SAMPLE, A REPEAT MEASUREMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN WITHIN THE YEAR TO ASSESS CHANGE AMONG PEOPLE WITH HYPERTENSION A (moderate).

B. Frequency of measurement.

The NKF, ADA, and JNC 7 recommend annual measurement in diabetic patients with albumin–creatinine ratios < 30 μg/mg. After the documentation of stage A2 albuminuria (i.e. with results as defined above on two of three tests performed within 3 to 6 months), repeated testing is reasonable to determine whether a chosen therapy is effective. It may also be useful in determining the rate of disease progression and thus may support planning for care of end-stage renal disease. Although the ADA recommendations suggest that such testing is not generally needed before puberty, testing may be considered on an individual basis if it appears appropriate because of an early onset of diabetes, poor control, or a family history of diabetic nephropathy. The duration of diabetes prior to puberty is reportedly an important risk factor in this age-group and thus can be used to support such testing in individual patients.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: THERE IS NO ROLE FOR ROUTINE TESTING FOR INSULIN, C-PEPTIDE, OR PROINSULIN IN MOST PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MAY BE MADE IN MOST CASES ON THE BASIS OF THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND THE SUBSEQUENT COURSE. THESE ASSAYS ARE USEFUL PRIMARILY FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. OCCASIONALLY, C-PEPTIDE MEASUREMENTS MAY HELP DISTINGUISH TYPE 1 FROM TYPE 2 DIABETES IN AMBIGUOUS CASES, SUCH AS PATIENTS WHO HAVE A TYPE 2 PHENOTYPE BUT PRESENT IN KETOACIDOSIS B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: THERE IS NO ROLE FOR MEASUREMENT OF INSULIN CONCENTRATION IN THE ASSESSMENT OF CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK, BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS VALUE DOES NOT ALTER THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE PATIENTS B (moderate).

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115tb9kd]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery has been consistently associated with long-term morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Furthermore, the relationship persists even among patients with complete renal recovery, or patients with minor perturbations in renal function not reaching the threshold for AKI. The mechanism, pathogenesis, and risk factors for postoperative AKI vary significantly by surgical type and corresponding perioperative stressors.

Because treatment options for postoperative AKI are limited, perioperative management has traditionally focused on prevention and diagnosis. Identifying prerenal (hypoperfusion), postrenal (outflow obstruction), and intrinsic renal (ischemic or nephrotoxic injury) causes are crucial first steps in the management of AKI. Additionally, the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines emphasize severity-based management of AKI. In patients with normal kidney function and mild AKI, management focuses on rapid identification and avoidance of nephrotoxic insults plus attention to volume status and renal perfusion pressure. As the severity of AKI increases, the accompanying disruption to acid–base status and electrolyte balance may necessitate focused medical and supportive therapies, with renal replacement therapy and/or intensive care admission for the most severe cases.

In this review, we define AKI in the perioperative setting, describe the epidemiologic burden, discuss procedure-specific risk factors, detail principles of management, and highlight areas of ongoing controversy and research.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^1168XcAC]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urine output monitoring

Urine output is one of the standard tools for diagnosing AKI. Oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/h) or anuria (< 50 mL/day) are early clinical signs of AKI. In 2012, the KDIGO guidelines proposed that a urine output of ≤ 0.5 mL/(kg·h) within 6 h can diagnose AKI. Although the reliability of oliguria as a renal function marker is debated, studies have shown it is closely associated with worse prognosis.

In AKI, changes in urine output alone may not accurately reflect the severity of kidney injury. Prerenal AKI typically presents with a significant reduction in urine output, whereas in renal AKI, particularly in cases of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), urine output may remain normal. Additionally, transient oliguria can be a physiological phenomenon and can be modulated with diuretics, but measurement errors can still occur even with a catheter. In patients with chronic underlying diseases, urine output tends to decrease more gradually, and recovery is more complex, further complicating the interpretation.

Imaging and electrolyte tests

Imaging and laboratory tests play a crucial role in identifying the cause of AKI and evaluating complications. Common imaging techniques include X-ray, ultrasound, CT, and MRI. X-ray can detect stones and calcification, while ultrasound is useful for evaluating kidney structure and urinary tract obstruction, especially in diagnosing postrenal AKI. CT provides detailed anatomical images, but contrast agents may exacerbate kidney damage, so caution is needed. MRI has no radiation and can be used in complex cases or when other imaging methods are inconclusive.

Laboratory tests focus on electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, such as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperphosphatemia. Blood electrolyte testing can guide treatment, but it should be considered in conjunction with other clinical information for a comprehensive assessment.

### Alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride [^113Yoevj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery and Other Procedures

Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.

Hypoxic States

Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.

Excessive Alcohol Intake

Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

5.2	Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 2 (< 0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in 7 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo.

It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.

After initiation of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, alogliptin should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.

### Mortality after acute kidney injury and acute interstitial nephritis in patients prescribed immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^1131q9ca]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

It is not clear if the occurrence of ICI-associated AKI has any impact on long-term outcomes. Occurrence of AKI could lead to premature discontinuation of life-saving ICI therapy and unnecessary immune suppression if incorrectly diagnosed. AKI from ATI or prerenal azotemia also occurs as a result of the overall disease burden and is associated with higher mortality in other settings. On the other hand, several studies have suggested that the occurrence of dermatologic, endocrinologic, and low-grade IrAEs indicates ICI effectiveness and is associated with improvements in patient outcomes. Thus, it is possible that a subset of patients with AKI who have AIN may in fact have better survival. Whether the association of AKI with mortality differs between those who experience AKI due to AIN or other causes is not known. While it is difficult to diagnose AIN without a kidney biopsy, we recently developed and externally validated a statistical model for diagnosis of AIN using data from participants with biopsy-proven AIN and controls. In this study, we test the association of model predicted AIN with mortality among participants on ICI therapy who develop AKI. We hypothesize that occurrence of AIN indicates a favorable response to ICI therapy; therefore, among patients who develop AKI while on ICI therapy, those predicted to have AIN will demonstrate greater survival compared with others with AKI.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1178DFgo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### Mortality after acute kidney injury and acute interstitial nephritis in patients prescribed immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^111zRtqq]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has rapidly increased over the past decade and has significantly improved the survival of patients with various malignancies. ICIs have become standard treatments for various common malignancies such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, microsatellite instability-high tumors, and many others, and are increasingly studied for their potential role in the treatment of other malignancies. These therapies have shown improved survival by months to years compared with other standard-of-care treatments in many clinical settings.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known complication in patients on ICI therapy. AKI incidence ranges from only 2%–3% in clinical trialsto up to 17% in real-world analyses. Case series of kidney biopsies in patients experiencing ICI-associated AKI use report that acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is the histological diagnosis in over 80% of cases. AIN is thought to be an immune-related adverse event (IrAE). IrAEs are off-target effects of T-cell activation against non-tumor cells resulting in damage to various organs, including the kidney. However, the true etiological spectrum of ICI-associated AKI also includes acute tubular injury (ATI) and prerenal azotemia. AKI could also be due to coadministered drugs such as chemotherapy and vascular endothelial growth factor-pathway targeting drugs or due to morbidity related to malignancy itself, such as postrenal obstruction from tumor, kidney involvement by tumor, and coagulopathy. Non-AIN causes of AKI may be significantly underrepresented in biopsy series since these cases, when suspected, are usually managed without a biopsy. In fact, a review of cases with ICI-associated AKI without biopsy showed that most of the cases were not attributable to ICI use. Thus, evaluation of ICI-associated AKI involves careful determination of its underlying etiology and may require a kidney biopsy to unequivocally establish the diagnosis.

### A young patient with a family history of hypertension [^117Prsza]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation of causes of hypertension in young adults with a family history of hypertension needs to be methodical to identify potentially treatable causes. Renal- and renovascular imaging and measurement of plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity are at the core of this evaluation in most patients. Pertinent aspects of hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are discussed with a focus on the role of the endothelium in mediating early hypertension and a review of treatment strategies. Finally, the possibility that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and primary aldosteronism are connected beyond coincidence is explored; evidence to support it is scant, although there is a likely role for aldosterone excess and the resultant hypokalemia in promoting cyst growth.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113mHrmt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical clinical features in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — atypical clinical features should prompt evaluation for non-DKD and people with diabetes and CKD may have increased risks of testing and treatments (Moderate). Evaluation of a person with atypical features should include additional diagnostic testing in selected cases, depending on the clinical presentation; for example, refractory hypertension and/or a significant decrease in kidney function after RAS blockade should prompt consideration of renal artery stenosis. Rapidly decreasing kidney function and/or increasing proteinuria (particularly if nephrotic), active urinary sediment, or evidence of other systemic disease should raise concerns about nondiabetic glomerular disease. Diagnosis of these diseases may require invasive testing or interventional procedures, administration of radiographic contrast, with or without angiography, may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in other people, and in the absence of another identifiable and treatable cause of kidney disease, patients with diabetes and CKD should be treated as if they have DKD.

### Evaluation of renal disease in patients with cirrhosis [^113EEpC4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal dysfunction in cirrhosis is common and is associated with increased mortality. Identifying and treating reversible causes of renal disease can significantly improve outcomes. The etiology, approach, and evaluation of renal disease in this group of patients is similar to the noncirrhosis patient, with a few specific caveats. Renal disease may be unrelated to the cause of cirrhosis (eg, prerenal acute kidney injury, acute tubular necrosis), occur as a manifestation of the same systemic disease responsible for the liver disease (eg, chronic viral hepatitis B and C infection) or as a consequence of cirrhosis (hepatorenal syndrome). Kidney impairment may be underrecognized in patients with cirrhosis due to over-reliance on creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate equations used in clinical practice. The first steps of evaluation for the renal disease include a thorough medical history to identify the underlying cause of cirrhosis and any potential trigger for renal dysfunction, physical examination, and review of prior laboratory records for baseline renal function. Renal imaging and urinalysis should be performed on all cirrhotic patients with renal dysfunction to establish the presence of urinary obstruction, chronicity and intrinsic renal disease.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

5.2.9 Kidney dysfunction/injury — Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) (including ACEi, ARB, and MRA) lead to an expected reduction, or dip, in eGFR of up to 30% via vasodilation of efferent arterioles, and this expected short-term dip in eGFR is associated with preservation of kidney function in the long-term and should not lead to discontinuation of the RAASi unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate for evaluation for other causes of AKI, CKD progression, and possible renal artery stenosis. The presence of new kidney dysfunction/injury may also be observed with the addition or dose increase of diuretics; this should prompt evaluation of volume status to rule out hypovolemia and other possible causes of kidney dysfunction, and it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

The clinical calculator "BUN/Creatinine Ratio" for diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, anemia of chronic kidney disease, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, hepatorenal syndrome, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, infection-related glomerulonephritis, kidney transplantation and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a clinical calculator used in the field of nephrology and internal medicine. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, a waste product generated in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, while Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism and also excreted by the kidneys.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is typically suggestive of a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, while a low ratio (< 10:1) is more indicative of intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is applicable to patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, or those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is necessary. It is also used in the evaluation of patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, a waste product generated in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, while Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism and also excreted by the kidneys.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is typically suggestive of a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, while a low ratio (< 10:1) is more indicative of intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is applicable to patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, or those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is necessary. It is also used in the evaluation of patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

### The clinical utility of genetic testing in the diagnosis and management of adults with chronic kidney disease [^115s9q8a]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sample size calculations for this study were based on the observed positive test rate of 9.3%and yielded a minimum of 811 patients to be enrolled to estimate the frequency of positive test results to within ± 0.02. To ensure representation of all clinical disease categories, enrollment was capped for categories that exceeded 10% of the total cohort (per the study protocol). In accordance with this, enrollment of patients categorized with cystic nephropathies, nephropathies associated with hypertension, or nephropathies associated with diabetes mellitus was capped.

Demographic information (age, race, ethnicity, and sex at birth), clinical data, and medical history (including histopathologic diagnosis, when present, imaging and chemistry) were documented at enrollment by clinical research coordinators (pretest). For each patient, ethnicity was reported through defined selections as follows: Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino, or unknown. Race was reported through the selection of any of the following categories: American Indian or Alaska native, Asian, Black or African American, White, other (write in), unknown, or not reported. Referring physicians were asked to provide information about kidney disease categorization/diagnosis and the management of each patient through questionnaires at enrollment (pretest) and 1 month after the return of genetic test results (post-test) (and). Kidney disease categories represent broad clinical presentations to ensure capturing all potential etiologies. In certain cases where a patient's presentation may have fit into more than one category, physicians selected the most appropriate or primary presentation. The primary outcomes of the study included (1) test positive prevalence (i.e. diagnostic yield), (2) diagnostic and reclassification rates after genetic testing, and (3) the effects on patient management after genetic testing, as assessed by the post-test questionnaire. This study was performed in adherence with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging procedure guideline for diagnosis of renovascular hypertension [^116ZyweH]. SNMMI (2022). High credibility.

Prospective investigation of captopril renography versus angiography — this study compared simultaneous 123I-OIH and 99mTc-DTPA captopril renography with angiography and included patients with a high prevalence of renal dysfunction; in subjects with GFR ≤ 50 mL/min, only 15%-20% of test results could be classified as high probability for renovascular hypertension, whereas 80%-85% fell into the intermediate probability category. Among 30 individuals with high probability captopril renograms (all "correct" compared with angiography), the mean serum creatinine concentration was 1.2 ± 0.4 mg/dL, whereas among 30 subjects with either incorrect results (7 false-negatives and 2 false-positives) or intermediate probability results (n = 21), the mean serum creatinine concentration was 1.2 mg/dL. Patients with azotemia tend to have a larger percentage of intermediate probability (abnormal but nondiagnostic) results, and in this subset, a positive captopril test (stimulated plasma renin assay) may improve the true-positive rate without introducing false-positive results.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^111ATaCw]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and is often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool. Indeed many textbooks of internal medicine, nephrology and critical care continue to advocate the use of BCR even though its usefulness in the diagnosis and clinical management of AKI remains unclear.

Under normal conditions, BCR is less than 100 (with urea and creatinine concentrations expressed in mmol/L). In states of renal hypoperfusion with intact tubular function, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is considered to rise out of proportion to plasma creatinine concentration, due to avid urea reabsorption by the proximal tubule, the BCR typically becoming > 100.

One of the first to put forward this tool was Fishberg in 1939 when he observed that " an increase in urea content of the blood may be considerable before the creatinine value rises in prerenal azotemia". However, as soon as 1947, other investigators found no such relationship. Since then, very few studies (human or animal) have addressed the question and their results are conflicting. These studies consisted of small series of patients, essentially from intensive care units, the largest of which included only 103 patients and this study was not specifically aimed at investigating BCR.

AKI is common in Emergency Departments (ED). It can be challenging to differentiate prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in this setting. Indeed, the ED physician has a short time frame to make decisions, he may not have access to current medication or baseline creatinine, have incomplete medical history and doesn't have by definition the responsiveness to a fluid challenge.

The BCR is one of the diagnostic tools recommended to ED physicians for differentiating between PR and I AKI, yet it has never been specifically studied in this setting.

The aim of this study was to determine whether BCR is a reliable parameter for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic AKI in a population of patients admitted to hospital via the ED.

### Losartan potatssium [^114GZFGu]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Hypertension:

Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, including diuretics.

Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy:

Losartan potassium tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but there is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Race and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Reduction in the Risk of Stroke, Race).

Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients

Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g) in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension. In this population, losartan potassium reduces the rate of progression of nephropathy as measured by the occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine or end stage renal disease (need for dialysis or renal transplantation) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects).

### Epidemiologic analyses of risk factors, risk indicators, risk markers, and causal factors. the example of albuminuria and the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetes [^111Mjg7L]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Much of the practice of modern medicine deals with prevention of the consequences of chronic conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. To achieve this end, identifying people at risk for these consequences and then initiating the appropriate, evidence-based preventive therapies are key. Characterization and study of risk factors are at the core of this effort and represent the only way that high-risk individuals can be identified. These risk factors can be any imagined variable, ranging from a genetic mutation to a blood result, a previous disease, exposure to an infectious agent or toxin, a socioeconomic state, ethnicity, birth weight, or country of origin. All causal factors for an outcome are risk factors for that outcome; reducing these risk factors almost certainly reduces the outcome. The converse is usually not true, however: identification of a risk factor reveals little about its causal connection to the outcome in question, and reducing this risk factor may or may not reduce the outcome. Once high-risk individuals are identified on the basis of their risk factor profile, the relevant clinical question relates to which therapies have been identified clearly that will reduce the risk or the outcome. If modification of the level of the risk factor is considered therapeutically, the question of whether the risk factor is also a good surrogate outcome must be answered. Information regarding whether the risk factor causes the disease is highly desirable; however, it is often unavailable and is not required before making therapeutic decisions.

Kidney dysfunction/injury in hypertension — monitoring and medication effects are specified. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) (including ACEi, ARB, and MRA) may lead to an expected reduction, or dip, in eGFR of up to 30% via vasodilation of efferent arterioles. This expected short-term dip in eGFR is associated with preservation of kidney function in the long-term and should not lead to discontinuation of the RAASi unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate for evaluation of other causes of AKI, CKD progression, and possible renal artery stenosis. The presence of new kidney dysfunction/injury may also be observed with the addition or dose increase of diuretics. This should prompt evaluation of volume status to rule out hypovolemia and other possible causes of kidney dysfunction, and it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

### Acute renal failure: diagnosis… [^116UV9QU]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction Although acute renal failure is relatively uncommon, its mortality rate is potentially so high that it is important to recognize this condition in children. Rapid deterioration of renal function is caused by numerous insults and results in typical findings, including extracellular volume expansion, hyperkalemia, hypertension, metabolic acidosis, and azotemia. It usually is reversible, with the majority of patients recovering completely. However, ARF can lead to residual impairment of renal function and progress to end-stage renal disease and death. Conservative medical treatment often is life-saving. Definition ARF represents the rapidly progressive cessation of renal function, which results in the inability of the kidney to control body homeostasis, manifesting in retention of nitrogenous waste products and fluid and electrolyte imbalance.

On the basis of pathophysiologic process, ARF has been divided broadly into three diagnostic categories: prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal failure. Prerenal and early postrenal failures are renal functional disorders and responses of a structurally intact kidney to extrarenal processes. These forms of renal dysfunction recover rapidly as soon as the cause is reversed. However, if these two disorders are not recognized in time, persist too long, or are treated inadequately, they can result in intrinsic renal failure. Comments.

PRERENAL CAUSES Prerenal causes of acute renal failure are common, with intravascular volume depletion being the most common cause. 4 Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea can lead to decreased kidney perfusion. Dehydration from any cause, including diuretics, can precipitate acute renal failure. Prerenal azotemia occurs in diseases that lead to a decrease in the effective arterial blood volume. These diseases include heart failure, liver failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are known to cause prerenal azotemia. NSAIDs affect the kidney by blocking cyclo-oxygenase, leading to an increase in thromboxane A2, which is a potent vasoconstrictor of the preglomerular arterioles. Because these afferent vessels supply blood to the kidney, vasoconstriction causes decreased glomerular perfusion.

5 ACE inhibitors block the production of angiotensin II, causing vasodilation of the postglomerular efferent arterioles. The vasodilation results in a decrease in the glomerular pressure, which may cause azotemia. 6 Large-vessel diseases, such as thrombosis, embolus, and dissection, also can reduce renal perfusion. Injury to the tubules most often is caused by ischemia or nephrotoxins. If prerenal azotemia and poor perfusion continue without treatment, tubular cells begin to die. This condition is termed "acute tubular necrosis. " Acute tubular necrosis is not a separate entity; rather, it is a marker of a more severe ischemic insult to the kidneys. Therefore, prerenal azotemia and tubular ischemia represent stages in the continuum of tubular injury. Efforts should be made to prevent the development of acute tubular necrosis in high-risk patients.

Conditions that place patients at risk for this condition include untreated prerenal azotemia and the use of nephrotoxic drugs or exposure to other nephrotoxins. A second randomized controlled trial 21 evaluated acetylcysteine pretreatment in patients scheduled to undergo coronary angiography and angioplasty. All patients had stable, moderate renal insufficiency and a GFR of less than 60 mL per minute. Patients randomly received acetylcysteine the day before the coronary procedure and the day of the procedure.

### Extrarenal azotemia and tubular disease… [^112top96]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Extrarenal azotemia may be defined as a pronounced retention of nitrogenous metabolites not caused by disease of the kidneys. The term azotemia seems preferable to uremia, since the clinical signs of uremia are not always present. This form of azotemia is not a circumscribed entity but a condition which may result from a number of unrelated causes. The essential features are oliguria or anuria, azotemia, and no anatomic lesion in the kidneys sufficient to explain renal insufficiency. In hospitals in which routine determinations of blood urea are made during the last few days of life a surprisingly large number of patients will be found to have an elevation of blood urea to uremic levels. This report is based on a study of 84 cases of this type in which the blood urea nitrogen concentration of the patient attained a level of 50 mg. per hundred cubic centimeters or higher before.
