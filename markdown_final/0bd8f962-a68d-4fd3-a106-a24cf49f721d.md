## Question

What is the role of semaglutide in the management of type 2 diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about semaglutide's role in type 2 diabetes management, including its mechanism, effects on glycemic control and weight, cardiovascular and renal outcomes, safety, dosing, and how it is positioned in clinical guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and mechanism to anchor downstream effects. Then, I should verify glycemic efficacy from pivotal trials and dose-response. Next, I will examine weight loss and its metabolic implications. After that, I need to review cardiovascular and renal outcomes and how they influence guideline use. I will then assess safety, including retinopathy and hypoglycemia, and reconcile any apparent contradictions. Finally, I should confirm dosing, formulation considerations, and where semaglutide fits in current standards of care, before summarizing a practical clinical role statement.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics endogenous GLP-1, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon, thereby lowering fasting and postprandial glucose with a low intrinsic hypoglycemia risk when used without insulin secretagogues; it also delays gastric emptying and acts centrally to reduce appetite, which explains weight loss and contributes to cardiometabolic improvements [^113ePph8].

> I will now examine glycemic efficacy. In the SUSTAIN and PIONEER programs, semaglutide reduced HbA1c by roughly 1.0–1.8% depending on dose and background therapy, with dose-dependent effects and superiority versus several active comparators including sitagliptin and empagliflozin. For example, oral semaglutide 14 mg reduced HbA1c more than sitagliptin 100 mg and more than empagliflozin 25 mg in head-to-head trials, and higher subcutaneous doses (e.g., 2.0 mg) outperform 1.0 mg for HbA1c lowering, confirming a dose-response relationship [^114Ycy6s] [^113x76C1] [^1156gycf] [^112X91Hj].

> Wait, let me verify the weight outcomes because they are central to T2D management. Semaglutide produces substantial, dose-related weight loss: in STEP 2 (T2D population), 2.4 mg weekly produced about 9.6% mean weight loss vs 3.4% with placebo at 68 weeks, and in STEP 1 (non-diabetic obesity), 2.4 mg achieved ~14.9% mean loss; importantly, much of the insulin resistance improvement with semaglutide appears mediated by weight loss, which reinforces its value in overweight/obese T2D [^115SW1HE] [^112Zwtm3] [^115Nsr4d].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular outcomes because they drive guideline positioning. SUSTAIN-6 demonstrated a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with subcutaneous semaglutide in high-risk T2D (HR ~0.74), establishing a class effect for CV risk reduction; PIONEER-6 showed noninferiority for MACE with oral semaglutide and signals for lower CV and all-cause death, while the large SOUL trial recently showed oral semaglutide reduced MACE in T2D with ASCVD and/or CKD, consolidating the CV benefit across formulations and risk strata [^113aiBrc] [^116ny8bS] [^1165Zumc].

> Hold on, I should verify renal outcomes before concluding. Post hoc and dedicated analyses indicate semaglutide slows eGFR decline and reduces kidney-specific events, with benefits observed across a range of baseline CKD risk. The FLOW renal outcomes program is anticipated to further define kidney protection, aligning with guideline emphasis on GLP-1 RA use in CKD when SGLT2 inhibitors are not suitable or as add-on therapy [^114ejSQS] [^111gnj4N].

> I need to check safety next, and I should double-check retinopathy signals. Gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are common but usually mild-to-moderate and transient; hypoglycemia risk is low unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, in which case dose adjustments are prudent; rare acute pancreatitis has been reported, and semaglutide is contraindicated in patients with a history of pancreatitis; notably, rapid glycemic improvement can transiently worsen diabetic retinopathy, particularly in those with pre-existing retinopathy, so monitoring is warranted [^112UsERW] [^114FuZH2] [^115mUsJe].

> Let me consider dosing and formulation because administration affects uptake and adherence. Subcutaneous semaglutide for T2D is initiated at 0.25 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg weekly, with many patients titrated to 1.0 mg; higher doses (up to 2.0 mg) can be used for additional glycemic lowering, while the obesity dose (2.4 mg) is not approved for T2D glycemic control per se, though it yields greater weight loss; oral semaglutide requires ingestion with limited water 30 minutes before any food or other medications to ensure absorption, and typical maintenance is 7–14 mg daily after a 3 mg initiation period [^115BcxFx] [^1172iGR9].

> I should confirm where semaglutide fits in current standards of care. ADA/EASD guidance prioritizes agents with high glycemic and weight efficacy and proven cardiorenal benefit; semaglutide is among the highest-efficacy options for HbA1c and weight, and GLP-1 RAs with CV benefit (including semaglutide) are recommended for T2D with ASCVD or high risk, often alongside or as an alternative to SGLT2 inhibitors depending on comorbidity profile; in CKD, GLP-1 RAs with CV benefit are appropriate when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or as add-on, and oral semaglutide expands access for patients averse to injections [^111gnj4N] [^114quDv6].

> But wait, what about practical switching and de-intensification scenarios. Evidence and expert consensus support switching from other GLP-1 RAs to semaglutide for greater efficacy, and replacing prandial insulin with once-weekly semaglutide in appropriately selected, well-controlled patients to reduce injection burden and promote weight loss; these strategies should be individualized with attention to hypoglycemia risk and patient preference [^115gX4MQ] [^1163S1FW].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical role to ensure internal consistency. Semaglutide is a cornerstone therapy for T2D when dual goals of glycemic control and weight loss are prioritized, especially in patients with obesity, ASCVD or high CV risk, or CKD; its robust HbA1c lowering, unparalleled weight effects within approved T2D dosing, and proven cardiovascular risk reduction — now reinforced by SOUL for oral semaglutide — justify early use after metformin or as monotherapy in selected high-risk patients, with formulation choice tailored to adherence and access considerations [^111gnj4N] [^1165Zumc] [^112X91Hj].

---

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist [^115YUKJR] that **improves glycemic control** and promotes weight loss in type 2 diabetes [^113AJnGt]. It lowers HbA1c by about 1–1.8% and reduces weight by 4–6 kg in trials, with a low risk of hypoglycemia [^112UsERW]. Semaglutide also provides **cardiovascular risk reduction** [^113aiBrc], including lower rates of MACE and cardiovascular death, and slows kidney function decline in high-risk patients [^114ejSQS]. It is available as once-weekly subcutaneous injection or daily oral tablets [^115YUKJR], with gastrointestinal side effects as the most common adverse events [^113AJnGt]. Current guidelines recommend semaglutide for patients with established cardiovascular disease or high risk, or when weight loss is a priority [^111gnj4N].

---

## Mechanism of action

Semaglutide mimics endogenous GLP-1, binding GLP-1 receptors to **enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion** and suppress glucagon, thereby lowering fasting and postprandial glucose [^111gnj4N]. It also delays gastric emptying, which reduces appetite and caloric intake, aiding weight loss [^113ePph8].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Glycemic control

- **HbA1c reduction**: Semaglutide reduces HbA1c by ~1.0–1.8% in clinical trials, with dose-dependent effects [^113AJnGt] [^112CrDre].
- **Comparison with other agents**: Superior to sitagliptin, empagliflozin, and liraglutide in HbA1c lowering and weight loss [^114Ycy6s] [^113x76C1] [^112X91Hj].
- **Oral formulation**: Oral semaglutide provides comparable glycemic control to subcutaneous semaglutide, offering a non-injectable option [^113AJnGt] [^1172iGR9].

---

### Weight loss

Semaglutide produces **significant weight loss** of ~4–6 kg in T2D trials, with higher doses (2.4 mg) yielding ~9–12% weight loss in obesity trials [^115SW1HE] [^112Zwtm3]. This weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic parameters [^115Nsr4d].

---

### Cardiovascular outcomes

In SUSTAIN-6, semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (**MACE**) by 26% (HR 0.74) in high-risk T2D patients [^113aiBrc]. PIONEER-6 showed **cardiovascular safety** with oral semaglutide, with a favorable trend toward fewer MACE [^116ny8bS]. SOUL demonstrated a **12% reduction in MACE** with oral semaglutide in patients with T2D and ASCVD/CKD [^1165Zumc].

---

### Renal outcomes

Semaglutide slowed eGFR decline and reduced renal adverse outcomes in SUSTAIN-6, suggesting **kidney protection** [^113aiBrc]. Post hoc analyses indicate consistent **renal benefits** across varying baseline CKD risk [^114ejSQS].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are most frequent, typically mild-to-moderate and transient [^113AJnGt] [^112X91Hj].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low risk when used alone; higher with insulin or sulfonylureas, requiring dose adjustment [^112UsERW].
- **Rare adverse effects**: Acute pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, and diabetic retinopathy exacerbation have been reported [^114FuZH2] [^115mUsJe].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Formulation** | **Initial dose** | **Titration** | **Maintenance dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Subcutaneous (Ozempic) | 0.25 mg weekly | Increase to 0.5 mg after 4 weeks | 0.5–2 mg weekly [^115BcxFx] |
| Oral (Rybelsus) | 3 mg daily | Increase to 7 mg after 30 days; then to 14 mg if needed | 7–14 mg daily [^114Ycy6s] |

---

## Patient selection criteria

Semaglutide is **particularly beneficial** for patients with:

- **Established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk** [^1165Zumc].
- **Overweight or obesity**, where weight loss is desired [^115SW1HE].
- **Inadequate glycemic control** on metformin or other oral agents [^112X91Hj].
- **Preference to avoid injections**, with oral semaglutide as an option [^116JB1Ra].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Cost**: Higher cost may limit access or adherence [^notfound].
- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: May lead to discontinuation in some patients [^115bShbi].
- **Long-term safety**: Ongoing surveillance for rare adverse events is needed [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

ADA/EASD recommend GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide, for T2D patients with established CVD or high risk, or when weight loss is prioritized [^111gnj4N] [^116xkx1e]. ESC/EASD similarly endorse GLP-1 RAs with proven **cardiovascular benefit** for T2D patients with CVD or at high risk [^117CPGKC].

---

Semaglutide is a **highly effective GLP-1 RA** that improves glycemic control, promotes weight loss, and reduces cardiovascular and renal risk in T2D. It is recommended for patients with established CVD or high risk, or when weight loss is a priority, with gastrointestinal side effects as the main limitation [^111gnj4N].

### Oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin: the PIONEER 2 trial [^113x76C1]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog oral semaglutide and the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin were compared in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin.

Research Design and Methods

Patients were randomized to once-daily open-label treatment with oral semaglutide 14 mg (n = 412) or empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 410) in a 52-week trial. Key end points were change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c (primary) and body weight (confirmatory secondary). Two estimands addressed efficacy-related questions: treatment policy (regardless of trial product discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (on trial product without rescue medication) in all randomized patients.

Results

Four hundred (97.1%) patients in the oral semaglutide group and 387 (94.4%) in the empagliflozin group completed the trial. Oral semaglutide provided superior reductions in HbA 1c versus empagliflozin at week 26 (treatment policy -1.3% vs. -0.9% [-14 vs. -9 mmol/mol], estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.4% [95% CI -0.6, -0.3] [-5 mmol/mol (-6, -3)]; P < 0.0001). The treatment difference in HbA 1c significantly favored oral semaglutide at week 26 for the trial product estimand (-1.4% vs. -0.9% [-15 vs. -9 mmol/mol], ETD -0.5% [95% CI -0.7, -0.4] [-6 mmol/mol (-7, -5)]; P < 0.0001) and at week 52 for both estimands (P < 0.0001). Superior weight loss was not confirmed at week 26 (treatment policy), but oral semaglutide was significantly better than empagliflozin at week 52 (trial product -4.7 vs. -3.8 kg; P = 0.0114). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with oral semaglutide.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide was superior to empagliflozin in reducing HbA 1c but not body weight at 26 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin. At week 52, HbA 1c and body weight (trial product estimand) were significantly reduced versus empagliflozin. Oral semaglutide was well tolerated within the established safety profile of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Recent updates to diabetes treatment guidelines and recommendations

Since publication of EMPA‐REG 15, CANVAS 12, LEADER 20 and SUSTAIN 6 22, a number of national and international guidelines and recommendations for the management of Type 2 diabetes have been updated to include cardiovascular risk reduction as a key consideration, and specifically the use of anti‐hyperglycaemic agents that have demonstrated cardiovascular protection in those with Type 2 diabetes (Table S1). Indeed, some have explicitly named empagliflozin and liraglutide as appropriate choices for the management of people with Type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.

Recent updates to international guidelines and recommendations

Several major international guidelines and recommendations on the management of Type 2 diabetes specifically cite EMPA‐REG 15, CANVAS 12, LEADER 20 and SUSTAIN 6 22, and recommend a hierarchical approach to drug selection dependent on the strength of this evidence 3, 48, 49, 50. The updated joint American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement emphasizes a stratification of people based on the presence of pre‐existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease before considering which additional glucose‐lowering agent to add as dual therapy (following metformin failure) 51. In those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the ADA/EASD recommend the use of a SGLT‐2i (with a preference for empagliflozin) for those with a diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure or chronic kidney disease, or a GLP‐1RA (with a preference for liraglutide or semaglutide) for those with atherosclerotic disease, as these agents have been shown to reduce cardiovascular death and all‐cause mortality (except semaglutide) when added to standard care 51.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials: a paradigm shift in the current management of type 2 diabetes [^113dyu7z]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

When the oral formulation of semaglutide was compared with placebo in the PIONEER-6 trial, a trend was observed towards reduction in 3P-MACE (HR [95% CI] 0.79 [0.57–1.11], p = 0.17). However, PIONEER-6 was a small study (N = 3183) of short duration, designed to rule out excess risk of 3P-MACE, and not powered to demonstrate superiority. Based on clinicaltrials.gov, a large CVOT investigating an oral formulation of semaglutide, the SOUL trial, is underway (estimated N = 9642). Primary and study completion are scheduled for July 2024.

Across the long-acting GLP-1 RA CVOTs, the outcomes for individual components of 3P-MACE were much less uniform than for the composite endpoint: only two of the five trials demonstrated a significant reduction in CV death, LEADER (liraglutide; HR [95% CI] 0.78 [0.66–0.93], p = 0.01) and PIONEER-6 (oral semaglutide; HR [95% CI] 0.49 [0.27–0.92], p = 0.03); however, neither study showed a significant reduction in nonfatal stroke or nonfatal MI, whereas SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide) and REWIND (dulaglutide) significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal stroke, while HARMONY OUTCOMES (albiglutide) significantly reduced the risk of fatal or nonfatal MI.

### Shifting paradigms in the medical management of type 2 diabetes: reflections on recent cardiovascular outcome trials [^1146LwqA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

An important challenge in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes is cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. While it is well established that intensive glycemic control prevents the onset and slows the progression of certain microvascular complications, such a strategy utilized in multiple clinical trials over the past few decades has failed to show a similar benefit with regard to cardiovascular events, including mortality. Despite this, a major hope has been the discovery of glucose-lowering medications that simultaneously improve cardiovascular outcomes. Over the past year and a half, four randomized clinical trials (involving empagliflozin, pioglitazone, liraglutide, and semaglutide) have reported important benefits in preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or at risk for type 2 diabetes and established CVD. On the basis of these landmark trials, we propose that a paradigm shift in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes, specifically in those with prior macrovascular disease. A transition from current algorithms based primarily on hemoglobin A1c values to a more comprehensive strategy additionally focused on CVD prevention seems warranted.

### Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetes-how far have we come? [^113GgZn2]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies demonstrated the efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs in reducing HbA1c by up to 1.9 percentage points compared with baseline and promote weight loss of up to 6.9 kg. There were also significant reductions in cardiovascular events and some renal outcomes in the absence of hypoglycaemia due to their glucose‐dependent mechanism of action. While all approved GLP‐1 RAs have high glucose‐lowering and weight loss efficacy, there is variation within the drug class. Structural differences among GLP‐1 RAs influence duration of action, and their formulation and dosing may affect efficacy in reducing blood glucose and body weight, as well as side effect profile and cardiovascular effects. However, an increased dosage of multiple approved GLP‐1 RAs has been studied in recent trials. The AWARD‐11 trialcompared dulaglutide at doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus the approved dose of 1.5 mg in people with T2D inadequately controlled with metformin. Indeed, escalation to a higher dose of dulaglutide provided clinically relevant, dose‐related reductions in HbA1c (1.72 percentage points vs. 1.61 percentage points vs. 1.55 percentage points with dulaglutide 4.5, 3.0 and 1.5 mg, respectively) and body weight (4.9 kg vs. 4.0 kg vs. 3.4 kg with dulaglutide 4.5, 3.0 and 1.5 mg, respectively) at 52 weeks with a similar safety profile. Another example is the weekly injectable semaglutide, currently approved at doses of up to 1.0 mg for people with T2D and up to 2.4 mg for obesity management. In the STEP trials, semaglutide plus a lifestyle intervention was tested at the higher dose of 2.4 mg/week, specifically for promoting weight loss, regardless of the presence of T2D (Table 2). Adverse effects were in line with those expected for a GLP‐1 receptor agonist, with mild‐to‐moderate GI events being the most common.,

TABLE 2
STEP‐program phase 3 trials with efficacy results

Both GLP‐1 RAs with good efficacy for weight loss and SGLT2i are recommended as a second‐line monotherapy when there is a compelling need to minimize weight gain, or to promote weight loss. Moreover, the use of GLP‐1 RAs is recommended for people with T2D who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or indicators of high risk, established renal disease, or if there is a compelling need to minimize hypoglycaemia.

### Oral semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk type 2 diabetes [^1165Zumc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study SOUL was published by Darren K McGuire and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2, Diabetic nephropathy, Chronic kidney disease and Coronary artery disease. In the SOUL study, the trial question was: what is the effect of oral semaglutide in patients with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD? In the SOUL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SOUL study, the population was: 9650 patients (2790 female, 6860 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients, aged ≥ 50 years, with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD. The key exclusion criteria were ESRD; receipt of long-term RRT; myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris or TIA within the past 60 days; planned coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery revascularization; treatment with any GLP-1 receptor agonist within the past 30 days. In the SOUL study, the interventions were: n = 4825 semaglutide (3 mg once daily as starting dose, with a maximum dose of 14 mg, plus standard care) n = 4825 placebo (matching placebo PO plus standard care). In the SOUL study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in major adverse cardiovascular events (12% vs. 13.8%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96). In the SOUL study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major kidney disease events (8.4% vs. 9%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.05) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (6.2% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.09) Significant decrease in major adverse limb events (1.5% vs. 2.1%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). In the SOUL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in acute pancreatitis. significant difference in serious adverse events (47.9% vs. 50.3%). In the SOUL study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged ≥ 50 years, with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^116hFDqT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8 is the first direct comparison of semaglutide with another weight‐management medication in a randomized trial. Semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated better efficacy than liraglutide as well as offering more convenient once‐weekly rather than once‐daily injections. Although direct comparisons with other treatments cannot be made because of methodological differences between trials, overall the weight loss with other approved medications appears to be more modest than that seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP trials.,

The STEP trials showed both short‐ and longer‐term improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with overweight or obesity. Earlier data from PIONEER 6 and SUSTAIN 6 suggested a CV benefit of semaglutide at lower doses in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Together, these findings indicate a potential role for semaglutide in the management of cardiometabolic risk factors. The ongoing SELECT trial (NCT03574597) will report on CV outcomes with semaglutide 2.4 mg in a population without diabetes who are at high CV risk.

The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class and was similar to that seen in other trials of subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In clinical practice, the extensive experience with this molecule at the 1.0 mg dose in type 2 diabetes and with the GLP‐1RA class overall should ensure a certain degree of confidence in the safety profile. This includes the rate of severe or blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia, which in STEP 2 was reported in similar proportions of subjects receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1.0 mg (5.7% and 5.5%, respectively).

The encouraging data from validated patient‐reported outcomes (Short Form‐36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version in STEP 1‐4 and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life‐Lite Clinical Trials Version questionnaire in STEP 1 and 2) point towards the benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg being directly perceived by study participants.

### Semaglutide reduces CV events in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^116qwH2t]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Bottom Line Semaglutide significantly reduced the composite outcome of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. It was generally well tolerated, and it reduced body weight by approximately 6. 4 to
9. 5 lb. Synopsis Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue that has a long half-life, allowing once-weekly administration as a subcutaneous injection. This study was designed as a noninferiority trial to demonstrate that the drug does not increase the risk of adverse CV events. The authors recruited a high-risk group of patients: 50 years or older with known CV disease or chronic kidney disease, or 60 years or older with at least one CV risk factor. The authors screened 4, 346 patients for inclusion and ultimately included 3, 297 patients who were randomized to receive semaglutide or matching placebo injections once weekly. Patients were started at a dosage of 0.

25 mg per week for four weeks, and then half of those in the intervention group were escalated to a final dosage of
0. 5 mg per week and the other half to a final maintenance dosage of 1. 0 mg per week. Groups were balanced at baseline with a mean age of 65 years and a mean duration of type 2 diabetes of 14 years; 61% were men. Most had hypertension, and 60% had documented ischemic heart disease. Patients were followed for a median of 2. 1 years, and analysis was by intention to treat. The primary outcome was a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, and occurred significantly less often in the semaglutide group than in those given placebo. The reduction was primarily due to fewer nonfatal events; there was no difference in CV deaths. Glycemic control was better in the intervention group, with A1C decreasing from 8. 7% to
7. 3% or 7.

6% compared with a decrease from
8. 7% to 8. 3% in the placebo group.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral semaglutide versus placebo added to insulin with or without metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER 8 trial [^112CrDre]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral semaglutide added to insulin with or without metformin.

Research Design and Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on insulin with or without metformin were randomized to oral semaglutide 3 mg (N = 184), 7 mg (N = 182), or 14 mg (N = 181) or to placebo (N = 184) in a 52-week, double-blind trial. End points were change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c (primary) and body weight (confirmatory secondary). Two estimands were defined: treatment policy (effect regardless of trial product discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (effect assuming trial product continuation without rescue medication) in randomized patients.

Results

Oral semaglutide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA 1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.5% [95% CI -0.7, -0.3], -0.9% [-1.1, -0.7], and -1.2% [-1.4, -1.0] for 3, 7, and 14 mg, respectively; P < 0.001) and body weight (ETD -0.9 kg [95% CI -1.8, -0.0], -2.0 kg [-3.0, -1.0], and -3.3 kg [-4.2, -2.3]; P = 0.0392 for 3 mg, P ≤ 0.0001 for 7 and 14 mg) at week 26 (treatment policy estimand). Significantly greater dose-dependent HbA 1c and body weight reductions versus placebo were achieved with oral semaglutide at weeks 26 and 52 (both estimands). The most frequent adverse event with oral semaglutide was nausea (11.4–23.2% of patients vs. 7.1% with placebo; mostly mild to moderate).

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA 1c and body weight when added to insulin with or without metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The safety profile was consistent with other glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in obesity without diabetes [^115p5x5C]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SELECT was published by A Michael Lincoff and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SELECT study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with preexisting CVD and overweight or obesity but without diabetes? In the SELECT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SELECT study, the population was: 17604 patients (4872 female, 12732 male). The inclusion criteria were patients, aged ≥ 45 years, with preexisting CVD and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² but no history of diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris; TIA within the past 60 days prior to the day of screening; history of T1DM or T2DM; history or presence of chronic pancreatitis. In the SELECT study, the interventions were: n = 8803 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly, then titrated every 4 weeks (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg, and 2.4 mg) to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16) n = 8801 placebo (matching placebo once weekly). In the SELECT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.5% vs. 8%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9). In the SELECT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (2.5% vs. 3%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01) Significant decrease in first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization or an urgent medical visit for HF (3.4% vs. 4.1%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96) Significant decrease in death from any cause (4.3% vs. 5.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93). In the SELECT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious gastrointestinal disorders. significant differences in serious adverse events (33.4% vs. 36.4%), adverse event leading to discontinuation of trial drug (16.6% vs. 8.2%). In the SELECT study, the conclusion was: in patients, aged ≥ 45 years, with preexisting CVD and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² but no history of diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Meeting the challenge of virtual diabetes care: a consensus viewpoint on the positioning and value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice [^1123EsWf]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide, are among the most effective drugs for treating people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), they are clinically under-utilised. Until recently, the only route for semaglutide administration was via subcutaneous injection. However, an oral formulation of semaglutide was recently licensed, with the potential to address therapy inertia and increase patient adherence to treatment, which is essential in controlling blood glucose and reducing complications. The availability of oral semaglutide provides a new option for both clinicians and patients who are reluctant to use an injectable agent. This has been of particular importance in addressing the challenge of virtual diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic, circumventing the logistical problems that are often associated with subcutaneous medication administration. However, there remains limited awareness of the clinical and economic value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice. In this article, we present our consensus opinion on the role of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice and discuss its value in reducing the burden of delivering diabetes care in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period of chronic disease management.

Most recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning concerning the appearance of counterfeit semaglutide drug supply chain in the USA. The investigations have revealed that needles from these products are also counterfeit, which raises concerns about a lack of needle sterility and the resultant increased risk of infection. Therefore, clinicians who are considering working with compounders should be mindful that these GLP-1 RA "knock-offs" may not be using ingredients that are approved by the relevant regulatory agencies, and they should caution patients of the risks if planning to obtain ore use these potentially dangerous formulations.

Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the single-center, prospective, single-arm study, switching from other GLP-1 RAs to semaglutide resulted in a significant decrease in HbA1c and body weight. Although additional evaluation is considered necessary, semaglutide appears to be a promising agent for blood glucose and body weight control in obese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and could be more potent than existing GLP-1 RAs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes (STEP UP T2D): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116csACM]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight in the presence of at least one obesity-related complication; however, many people with obesity and type 2 diabetes do not reach their bodyweight reduction goals with this dose. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a new 7·2 mg maintenance dose of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

STEP UP T2D was a randomised, phase 3b, double-blind controlled, three-arm, parallel-group trial conducted at 68 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older (BMI ≥ 30·0 kg/m 2, HbA 1c 7·0–10·0% [53–86 mmol/mol]) were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, alongside a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were the percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants reaching a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo. Confirmatory secondary endpoints were the proportion of participants reaching a bodyweight reduction of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, and 20% or greater, and changes in waist circumference (cm) and HbA 1c (%) with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo. Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned participants, and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05649137) and is now closed and completed.

Findings

Between Jan 4 and May 4, 2023, 512 participants were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 307), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 103), or placebo (n = 102). 265 (51·8%) of 512 participants were female, the mean age was 56 (SD 10) years, mean bodyweight was 110·1 (22·9) kg, mean BMI was 38·6 (7·1) kg/m 2, and mean HbA 1c was 8·1% (0·9). Compared with placebo, semaglutide 7·2 mg led to greater reductions in mean bodyweight (-13·2% vs -3·9%; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -9·3% [95% CI -11·0 to -7·7]; p < 0·0001); more participants reaching bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 10·0 [95% CI 6·0 to 16·9]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (11·3 [5·9 to 21·4]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (8·1 [3·7 to 17·7]; p < 0·0001), and 20% or greater (12·3 [3·0 to 51·0]; p = 0·0006); and reduced waist circumference (ETD -6·5 cm [95% CI -9·0 to -4·1]; p < 0·0001) and HbA 1c (ETD -1·5% [95% CI -1·8 to -1·2]; p < 0·0001). Level 2–3 hypoglycaemia risk was low and comparable between semaglutide doses and placebo. Gastrointestinal events were reported by 163 (53·1%) of 307 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 53 (51·5%) of 103 participants with semaglutide 2·4 mg, 26 (25·5%) of 102 participants with placebo; and serious adverse events were reported by 28 (9·1%) participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, nine (8·7%) participants with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and nine (8·8%) participants with placebo. Dysaesthesia was more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (58 [18·9%] of 307) versus 2·4 mg (five [4·9%] of 103) and placebo (none).

Interpretation

Among people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo in reducing bodyweight, waist circumference, and HbA 1c. Safety and tolerability were comparable between semaglutide 7·2 mg and 2·4 mg, except for the imbalance in dysaesthesia.

### Once-weekly semaglutide reduces hbAand body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background common OAD: a subgroup analysis from SUSTAIN 2–4 and 10 [^1115f89a]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), achieving effective glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains a challenge. The objective of this post hoc analysis of data from the SUSTAIN 2, 3, 4 and 10 active-controlled trials was to assess the efficacy and safety of the once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide in patients on background treatment with metformin (MET), with or without a sulphonylurea (SU).

Methods

Data from the randomised phase 3 trials SUSTAIN 2, 3, 4 and 10 for subjects who received background MET alone or MET+SU were analysed. Change from baseline in HbA 1c and body weight at the end of treatment visit (week 30 in SUSTAIN 4 and 10, week 56 in SUSTAIN 2 and 3), and rates of hypoglycaemia and adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation were assessed.

Results

In total, 3411 subjects were included in the full analysis set (3410 in the safety analysis set). Across the four trials, semaglutide significantly reduced HbA 1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.32 to -0.79%-points for semaglutide 0.5 mg, and -0.38 to -1.07%-points for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs comparators; p < 0.01) in subjects receiving both MET and MET+SU. Regardless of background OAD, semaglutide significantly reduced body weight (ETD -2.35 to -4.72 kg for semaglutide 0.5 mg, and -2.96 to -6.76 kg for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs comparators; p < 0.0001). Across the trials, hypoglycaemic events were more common with background MET+SU than MET alone, in subjects receiving either semaglutide or a comparator. The rate of adverse events (AEs) leading to premature treatment discontinuations in subjects treated with semaglutide were generally consistent regardless of background therapy.

Conclusion

Semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg significantly improve glycaemic control (HbA 1c) and body weight in subjects with T2D, with a similar tolerability profile, regardless of whether they receive background MET or MET+SU.

### Semaglutide (SUSTAIN and PIONEER) reduces cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes across varying cardiovascular risk [^115kUziw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations aside, the data reported here add to the growing body of evidence on the CV benefits of GLP‐1RAs, specifically semaglutide, in patients with T2D across the spectrum of CV risk. It will be important to analyse the results of other randomized clinical trials in subjects with T2D by key demographics and baseline disease measures to confirm these findings and further inform optimal T2D care and CV risk management.

In conclusion, this post hoc analysis of a combined population from the SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 CVOTs showed that semaglutide reduced the risk of MACE versus placebo in subjects with T2D by 24%. This effect appeared to be consistent across the s.c. and oral formulations of semaglutide, and across several clinically relevant subgroups, namely those with and without established CVD and/or CKD, and with and without prior MI or stroke. In subjects with prior HF (NYHA Class II–III), no effect of semaglutide versus placebo on MACE was observed, although the overall incidence in the subgroup with prior HF was low. These findings are further supported by an analysis of combined data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER glycaemic efficacy trials, which compared semaglutide with placebo and active comparators in subjects with T2D at a relatively low risk of CV events. Collectively, these analyses suggest a CV benefit of semaglutide not only in those with a history of CVD, but also in lower CV risk subgroups, and that the effect was similar despite different routes of treatment administration.

Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment

The methodological quality of the identified intervention MAs was assessed using the current version of the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Reviews tool (AMSTAR 2). The tool consists of 16 items covering domains relevant to the quality of systematic reviewing, for which possible assessment responses include "yes", "partial yes", or "no". In our assessments, we followed available guidance documents, where items 2 (protocol), 4 (literature search), 7 (justification for study exclusions), 9 (assessment of risk of bias in individual studies), 11 (methods of synthesis), 13 (incorporation of risk of bias assessment in the interpretation of the results), and 15 (assessment of publication bias) were identified as critical domains. Following the guidance, we classified the overall confidence in the results of the review as either high (maximum of one noncritical weakness), moderate (> one noncritical weakness), low (one critical flaw), or critically low (> one critical flaw).

We report in this rapid review the results of SRs of CEAs evaluating overall quality using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard 2022 (CHEERS 2022), a statement that evaluates the literature based on 24 items in six domains. The quality of the reviews is divided into three categories according to the degree of coverage, including "fully satisfactory", "partially satisfactory", and "unsatisfactory".

RWS were evaluated using the Methods Guide for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Five domains of bias (selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias) were assessed. Further, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the quality of the evidence from the MA of RWS and to determine the confidence in effect estimates for our outcomes, which takes into account the risk of bias, publication bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, effect size and other confounding factors. In addition, we reported the grade of evidence provided by the included RCT-based MAs. A single reviewer graded the certainty of evidence, with all judgments (and footnoted rationales) verified by a second reviewer. The assessments of quality or risk of bias were conducted independently by two authors and any divergence was resolved by discussion.

### Study design and baseline profile for adults with type 2 diabetes in the once-weekly subcutaneous SEmaglutide randomized PRAgmatic (SEPRA) trial [^114aksKq]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, is approved in the USA as an adjunct to diet and exercise for adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in people with T2D and established cardiovascular disease. The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) phase III clinical trial program demonstrated the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide; however, determining its effectiveness in a real-world setting could support decision-making by clinicians, payers and policy makers in routine clinical practice.

Research Design and Methods

SEmaglutide PRAgmatic (SEPRA) is an ongoing open-label, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial designed to compare the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide versus standard of care in US health-insured adults with T2D and physician-determined inadequate glycemic control. The primary end point is the proportion of participants achieving glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7.0% at year 1; other key outcomes include glycemic control, weight loss, healthcare utilization, and patient-reported outcomes. Individual-level data will be collected from routine clinical practice and health insurance claims. The last patient last visit is expected by June 2023.

Results

Between July 2018 and March 2021, 1278 participants were enrolled from 138 study sites across the USA. At baseline, 54% were male with mean ± SD age 57.4 ± 11.1 years and body mass index 35.7 ± 8.0kg/m 2. Mean diabetes duration was 7.4 ± 6.0 years and mean HbA1c was 8.5 ± 1.6%. At baseline, concomitant antidiabetes medications included metformin, sulfonylureas, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. The majority of participants had hypertension and dyslipidemia. The trial design was self-assessed using the PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2 tool by the study steering group and was scored 4–5 in all domains suggesting a highly pragmatic study.

Conclusions

SEPRA, a highly pragmatic ongoing study, will provide data on the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in a real-world setting when used during routine management of T2D.

### Safety… [^1172iGR9]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist labeled as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It reduces hyperglycemia by increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion. Effectiveness Oral semaglutide improves glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes better than placebo and is noninferior to subcutaneous semaglutide. The study enrolled 632 adults with type 2 diabetes and a mean age of 57 years, mean A1C of 7. 9%, and body mass index of
31. 7 kg per m 2. Across the oral doses of
2. 5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, oral semaglutide lowered mean A1C by 0. 7%,
1. 2%, 1. 5%, and
1. 7%, respectively, compared with a decrease of 1. 9% with subcutaneous semaglutide. In these patients with mildly elevated baseline A1C levels, all oral doses except 2. 5 mg reduced A1C to less than
7. 0% in more than 80% of those treated.

In one short-term study that included mostly male patients 50 years and older with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, oral semaglutide did not increase the risk of CV events in high-risk patients, and it was associated with a modest delay of mortality.
3. Simplicity The initial dosage of semaglutide is 3 mg per day, titrated to desired effect on A1C up to a maximum dosage of 14 mg per day if needed. To ensure adequate absorption, oral semaglutide should be taken 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day. Bottom Line Oral semaglutide may be considered as an option for patients who need better glycemic control and are unable or reluctant to start or add injectable treatment and for whom weight loss is desired. It does not increase major CV events in higher-risk patients.

The cost and hyperglycemia-lowering benefits of oral semaglutide are similar to those of injectable semaglutide; however, it is much more expensive than other oral agents.

5.8 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a 2-year trial with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg once-weekly injection in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk, diabetic retinopathy complications (which was a 4-component adjudicated endpoint) occurred in patients treated with semaglutide injection (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (semaglutide injection 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide injection 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2for weight reduction (Study 3), diabetic retinopathy was reported by 4% of WEGOVY-treated patients and 2.7% placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

5.9 Heart Rate Increase

Treatment with WEGOVY was associated with increases in resting heart rate. Mean increases in resting heart rate of 1 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed in WEGOVY-treated adult patients compared to placebo in clinical trials for weight reduction. More adult patients treated with WEGOVY compared with placebo had maximum changes from baseline at any visit of 10 to 19 bpm (41% versus 34%, respectively) and 20 bpm or more (26% versus 16%, respectively). In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with normal baseline heart rate, more patients treated with WEGOVY compared to placebo had maximum changes in heart rate of 20 bpm or more (54% versus 39%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor heart rate at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers of palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while at rest during WEGOVY treatment. If patients experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate, discontinue WEGOVY.

### Efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide vs empagliflozin added to metformin in type 2 diabetes: patient-level meta-analysis [^112cfVX1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are established therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Guidelines on hyperglycemic management recommend either GLP-1RAs or SGLT-2is as second-line treatments for patients with T2D on metformin monotherapy, or as first-line treatments in patients with T2D at high or very high cardiovascular risk. Comparative efficacy analyses of GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is could aid physicians in choosing between these 2 classes, particularly because they are similarly positioned in the American Diabetes Association−European Association for the Study of Diabetes Consensus report treatment algorithm for T2D.

Of the 4 US Food and Drug Administration–approved SGLT-2is (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin, only 2 have been compared directly with GLP-1RAs in randomized controlled trials (RCTs): canagliflozin with once-weekly (OW) subcutaneous semaglutide in SUSTAIN 8, and empagliflozin with oral semaglutide in PIONEER 2. Given that there are so few RCTs directly comparing the efficacy of these 2 treatment classes, indirect comparisons of treatments that have not been evaluated in a head-to-head trial can provide valuable and much needed additional insight into this clinically important knowledge gap.

Various indirect treatment comparison methods have different properties that confer advantages and disadvantages. For example, network meta-analyses (NMAs) provide an important and robust method of making indirect comparisons between treatments using all available published data collected in a systematic manner and preserving randomization. However, when individual patient data (IPD) are available, meta-regression analyses of these data present another valid option for indirect treatment comparisons (Fig. 1). In IPD meta-regression analyses, potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers can be adjusted at an individual patient level, allowing for a better isolation of the effect of a single factor (treatment) on an outcome of interest than might be achieved with published aggregate data, thereby enabling a potentially less-biased comparison between trials. In addition, clinically relevant outcomes, including changes in lipid profile, postprandial plasma glucose, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), may differ in how they are reported across published aggregate data, or may not be reported at all. Therefore, these outcomes cannot always be analyzed with NMA methodology; to address this, IPD meta-regression analyses can be used.

### Efficacy and safety of co-administered once-weekly cagrilintide 2. 4 mg with once-weekly semaglutide 2 · 4 mg in type 2 diabetes: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 2 trial [^115pmbeT]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Combining the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide with the long-acting amylin analogue cagrilintide has weight-loss benefits; the impact on glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) is unknown. This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of co-administered semaglutide with cagrilintide (CagriSema) in participants with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This 32-week, multicentre, double-blind, phase 2 trial was conducted across 17 sites in the USA. Adults with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of 27 kg/m 2 or higher on metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema, semaglutide, or cagrilintide (all escalated to 2·4 mg). Randomisation was done centrally using an interactive web response system and was stratified according to use of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment (yes vs no). The trial participants, investigators, and trial sponsor staff were masked to treatment assignment throughout the trial. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA 1c; secondary endpoints were bodyweight, fasting plasma glucose, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) parameters, and safety. Efficacy analyses were performed in all participants who had undergone randomisation, and safety analyses in all participants who had undergone randomisation and received at least one dose of the trial medication. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04982575) and is complete.

Findings

Between Aug 2 and Oct 18, 2021, 92 participants were randomly assigned to CagriSema (n = 31), semaglutide (n = 31), or cagrilintide (n = 30). 59 (64%) participants were male; the mean age of participants was 58 years (SD 9). The mean change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 32 (CagriSema: -2·2 percentage points [SE 0·15]; semaglutide: -1·8 percentage points [0·16]; cagrilintide: -0·9 percentage points [0·15]) was greater with CagriSema versus cagrilintide (estimated treatment difference -1·3 percentage points [95% CI -1·7 to -0·8]; p < 0·0001), but not versus semaglutide (-0·4 percentage points [-0·8 to 0·0]; p = 0·075). The mean change in bodyweight from baseline to week 32 (CagriSema: -15·6% [SE 1·26]; semaglutide: -5·1% [1·26]; cagrilintide: -8·1% [1·23]) was greater with CagriSema versus both semaglutide (p < 0·0001) and cagrilintide (p < 0·0001). The mean change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 32 (CagriSema: -3·3 mmol/L [SE 0·3]; semaglutide: -2·5 mmol/L [0·4]; cagrilintide: -1·7 mmol/L [0·3]) was greater with CagriSema versus cagrilintide (p = 0·0010) but not versus semaglutide (p = 0·10). Time in range (3·9–10·0 mmol/L) was 45·9%, 32·6%, and 56·9% at baseline and 88·9%, 76·2%, and 71·7% at week 32 with CagriSema, semaglutide, and cagrilintide, respectively. Adverse events were reported by 21 (68%) participants in the CagriSema group, 22 (71%) in the semaglutide group, and 24 (80%) in the cagrilintide group. Mild or moderate gastrointestinal adverse events were most common; no level 2 or 3 hypoglycaemia was reported. No fatal adverse events were reported.

Interpretation

In people with type 2 diabetes, treatment with CagriSema resulted in clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control (including CGM parameters). The mean change in HbA 1c with CagriSema was greater versus cagrilintide, but not versus semaglutide. Treatment with CagriSema resulted in significantly greater weight loss versus semaglutide and cagrilintide and was well tolerated. These data support further investigation of CagriSema in this population in longer and larger phase 3 studies.

### Exposure-response analysis for evaluation of semaglutide dose levels in type 2 diabetes [^112KXxE5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The exposure‐response analyses revealed clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c and body weight across semaglutide exposures after 30 weeks of treatment, irrespective of baseline values, indicating that all subgroups will benefit from treatment with semaglutide 0.5 mg. The exposure‐response relationship for HbA1c was influenced by baseline HbA1c; greater effects were observed with higher baseline HbA1c values. Furthermore, the exposure‐response relationship for body weight was influenced by sex, with greater weight loss in women. Other factors had limited impact. The exposure, HbA1c reduction and weight loss for the three relevant subgroups (defined by baseline HbA1c, baseline body weight and sex) indicated that all subgroups obtained a clinically relevant additional benefit with semaglutide 1.0 vs 0.5 mg, supporting findings of improved glycaemic control with the 1.0 mg dose from the individual trials using the full dataset and other trials in the SUSTAIN programme. 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16

The relationship between exposure and HbA1c reduction in this population with T2DM was similar in men and women and across the ranges of body weight, age, race, ethnicity, diabetes duration and renal function. The exposure range associated with semaglutide doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg showed that clinically relevant effects on HbA1c reduction were obtained with both doses, even at the lower end of the exposure range. In fact, the vast majority of participants obtained HbA1c levels < 53 mmol/mol (7%) throughout the exposure range. Nevertheless, the glycaemic response increased with increasing semaglutide exposure within the exposure range, indicating that increasing the dose from 0.5 to 1.0 mg will provide further improved glycaemic control, supporting previous findings. 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16 The proportion of participants achieving ADA and AACE targets also increased with increasing exposure.

### Semaglutide (ozempic) for type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^112UsERW]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

When used alone, semaglutide has not been shown to increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia compared with placebo. 1 However, the risk is increased when semaglutide is added to other treatments such as basal insulin or a sulfonylurea. The effect of semaglutide on hypoglycemia rates has not been studied when used with metformin alone. Pancreatitis will occur about three times per 1, 000 patient-years. Semaglutide should not be used in patients with a history of pancreatitis because it has not been studied in this patient population. Effectiveness Semaglutide has been evaluated as a single treatment and as additional treatment for patients already being treated with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or long-acting insulin in seven clinical trials enrolling more than 8, 400 patients. When added to metformin, semaglutide will reduce A1C levels by 1. 5 to
1. 8 percentage points, depending on the dose.

This reduction is slightly larger than when dulaglutide is added. 3 Comparable results will be achieved when semaglutide is added to other treatments. 1 Patients taking semaglutide will lose an average of 3. 8 to
4. 7 kg. Weight loss is greater when patients are also using metformin or insulin. Although it has not been compared directly, this weight loss is greater than with other treatments. 1 In a study of 3, 297 patients with established cardiovascular disease already on standard treatment, the addition of semaglutide reduced the composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke by 2. 3 percentage points as compared with placebo. Bottom Line Semaglutide can be added to existing treatment to improve glycemic control and induce weight loss.

It may also protect against cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Some patients may find the once-weekly dosing to be appealing. However, gastrointestinal adverse effects may limit its use for some patients. Given the price, potential harms, and tolerability of semaglutide, other less expensive treatments should be considered first for most patients.

### A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis comparing once-weekly semaglutide with other GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes previously receiving 1–2 oral anti-diabetic drugs [^115NRduN]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are incretin mimetics that improve glycemic control and have demonstrated superiority over commonly used oral and injectable anti-diabetic medications while significantly reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. Unlike other anti-diabetic agents, GLP-1 RAs also provide significant weight reduction, and, importantly, a CV risk reduction in patients with T2D has also been observed with some GLP-1 RAs. GLP-1 RAs are typically recommended as either second- or third-line agents (i.e. as an add-on therapy to one or two OADs) in the treatment intensification algorithm recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Specifically, GLP-1 RAs are recommended above all other classes in the hierarchy for obese patients with T2D by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the Canadian Diabetes Association, and UK guidelines, and Finnish clinical guidelines recommend semaglutide and liraglutide for reducing the risk of CV events.

### Oral semaglutide in type 2 diabetes [^116JB1Ra]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Previously, the only available glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were injectable. Approval of oral semaglutide (Rybelsus®) represents the first orally available GLP-1 RA.

Objective

To review the literature and describe pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics properties; clinical safety; and efficacy of oral semaglutide, a newly approved oral GLP-1 RA.

Methods

A MEDLINE (1995-October 2019) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using the terms oral semaglutide, semaglutide, PIONEER, and a combination of those terms. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed. All English-language studies, including abstracts, evaluating oral semaglutide use in humans were included in this review.

Conclusions

The approval of oral semaglutide (Rybelsus®) represents a paradigm shift in the management of T2D as this is the first FDA-approved oral GLP-1 RA. Oral semaglutide may be an attractive option for patients with T2D who require improved glycemic control, would like to lose weight, and who are not interested in injectable therapy. However, the lack of positive cardiovascular (CV) and renal data are significant limitations to its use.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus once-daily sitagliptin as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes in SUSTAIN China: a 30-week, double-blind, phase 3a, randomized trial [^114vheJJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex, multifactorial disease, with a steadily increasing prevalence influenced by increasing obesity and physical inactivity. In China, T2D prevalence was 116.4 million (10.9%) in 2019 and is expected to increase to 140.5 million by 2030, representing a large health burden for society. 1, 2 The focus of T2D management is to optimize glycaemic control to reduce the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. 3, 4, 5, 6

Despite the wide range of treatment options available, 7, 8 less than 20% of Chinese patients with T2D achieve the recommended target of HbA 1c of less than 7%, 9, 10, 11 and many are therefore at risk of developing diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 28 kg/m 2) among the Chinese population is 24.3%. 12 It is known that a weight loss of 5% or more is associated with improved glycaemic control in patients with T2D, and weight loss is therefore a cornerstone of T2D treatment. 7, 13, 14 The pathophysiology of T2D in East Asians involves reduced insulin secretory capacity and less insulin resistance compared with Caucasians. 15, 16, 17

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7·2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2·4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73·7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113·0 (24·1) kg, and mean BMI was 39·9 (7·1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg (-18·7% [SE 0·4] vs -15·6% [0·7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3·1% [95% CI -4·7 to -1·6]; p < 0·0001) and with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (-18·7% [0·4] vs -3·9% [0·6]; -14·8% [-16·2 to -13·4]; p < 0·0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7·2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·3 to 17·6]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (14·5 [9·6 to 21·9]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (20·3 [11·2 to 36·8]; p < 0·0001), 20% or greater (27·3 [10·9 to 68·0]; p < 0·0001), and 25% or greater (127·4 [36·8 to 441·4]; p < 0·0001); and more likely than those in the 2·4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1·8 [1·3 to 2·4]; p = 0·0006) and 25% or greater (2·4 [1·6 to 3·5]; p < 0·0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11·7 cm [95% CI -13·0 to -10·4]; p < 0·0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (711 [70·8%] of 1004) versus 2·4 mg (123 [61·2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42·8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22·9%], 12 [6·0%], and one [0·5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6·8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 22 (10·9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and 11 (5·5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo and 2·4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Effect of additional oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin on glycated hemoglobin in adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin alone or with sulfonylurea: the PIONEER 3 randomized clinical trial [^114Ycy6s]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes of glucose-lowering therapy.

Objective

To compare efficacy and assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin, 100 mg added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at 206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018. Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n = 466), 7 mg (n = 466), or 14 mg (n = 465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n = 467). Semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c and body weight.

Results

Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age, 58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n = 879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed the trial and 298 prematurely discontinued treatment (16.7% for semaglutide, 3 mg/d; 15.0% for semaglutide, 7 mg/d; 19.1% for semaglutide, 14 mg/d; and 13.1% for sitagliptin). Semaglutide, 7 and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, significantly reduced HbA1c (differences, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.4% to -0.1%] and -0.5% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%], respectively; P < .001 for both) and body weight (differences, -1.6 kg [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1 kg] and -2.5 kg [95% CI, -3.0 to -2.0 kg], respectively; P < .001 for both) from baseline to week 26. Noninferiority of semaglutide, 3 mg/d, with respect to HbA1c was not demonstrated. Week 78 reductions in both end points were statistically significantly greater with semaglutide, 14 mg/d, vs sitagliptin.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea, oral semaglutide, 7 mg/d and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1c over 26 weeks, but there was no significant benefit with the 3-mg/d dosage. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness in a clinical setting.

### Oral semaglutide as an opportunity for an appropriate therapeutic switch in people with type 2 diabetes: a Delphi consensus [^114hC8h3]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

After evaluating the level of consensus among participants, each panel member received a summary report including the frequency distribution of ratings across the 9-point scale, the overall median rating for each statement, and a record of their individual ratings. The ratings of other panelists remained anonymous. Each statement was also accompanied by an indication of whether agreement or disagreement had been observed on the basis of the panel's responses. Although second and third rounds were planned to promote consensus in cases of disagreement, full agreement was achieved in the first round for all statements, rendering further rounds unnecessary. The outcomes of the first round were subsequently shared and discussed with all 28 diabetologists during a dedicated meeting.

The study is based on a survey that does not involve the participation of human subjects nor patient data management and does not aim to modify the current clinical practice of participants. Consequently, this study did not require ethical approval.

Ethical Approval

In Italy, the activities of ethics committees are regulated by Legislative Decree of May 14, 2019, No. 52, which implements EU Regulation 536/2014 on clinical trials and defines the scope within which ethics committee evaluation is mandatory. It applies exclusively to studies involving medicinal products or medical devices and to experimental or observational research involving human subjects. Since our project is a simple opinion survey, is addressed to healthcare professionals, is completely anonymous, does not involve the collection of clinical, health-related, or identifiable personal data, does not involve patients or medical interventions, then it is not classified as "research involving human subjects" under current regulations and does not require ethics committee approval.

### Economic evaluation of liraglutide vs dulaglutide or oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^111YhCG5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of type 2 diabetes not only requires effective medications to regulate blood glucose levels, but also needs to consider the economic implications. Liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide, three widely-used glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, have shown significant efficacy in diabetes treatment. This review aimed to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide in comparison to dulaglutide or oral semaglutide for treating type 2 diabetes.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane. Studies published up to December 31, 2024 were retrieved. Two independent reviewers carefully screened the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and any disagreements were resolved with the involvement of a third reviewer. Data extraction was carried out following a pre-designed form.

Results

12 studies were included, evaluating liraglutide vs. dulaglutide (n = 8) and liraglutide vs. oral semaglutide (n = 6). The minimum consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards score for the studies was 0.75. The included studies exhibited similar results in cost-effective. Oral semaglutide would be more effective and cost-saving in the US, Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. According to the available studies, liraglutide vs. dulaglutide or oral semaglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is considered not to be cost-effective.

Conclusion

Cost-effectiveness also plays a vital role in the inclusion of these drugs in healthcare reimbursement policies. The literature suggested that dulaglutide or oral semaglutide may be more cost-effective than liraglutide.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### Cagrilintide-semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes [^1179kSRV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cagrilintide and semaglutide have each been shown to induce weight loss as monotherapies. Data are needed on the coadministration of cagrilintide and semaglutide (called CagriSema) for weight management in adults with type 2 diabetes, including those in a subgroup who are undergoing continuous glucose monitoring.

Methods

In this phase 3a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 12 countries, we assigned adults with a body-mass index of 27 or more, a glycated hemoglobin level of 7 to 10%, and type 2 diabetes in a 3:1 ratio to receive once-weekly cagrilintide-semaglutide (2.4 mg each) or placebo, along with lifestyle intervention, for 68 weeks. The two primary end points were the percent change in body weight and the percentage of patients with a weight reduction of at least 5%. Additional end points were changes in glycemic measures and safety assessments. Effect estimates were calculated with the use of the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle).

Results

A total of 1206 patients underwent randomization to either the cagrilintide-semaglutide group (904 patients) or the placebo group (302 patients). The estimated mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -13.7% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and -3.4% in the placebo group (estimated difference, -10.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -11.2 to -9.5; P < 0.001). More patients in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group than in the placebo group had a weight reduction of 5% or more (P < 0.001); the same was true of reductions of at least 10%, 15%, and 20% (P < 0.001 for the last comparison). The percentage of patients who had a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5% or less was 73.5% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 15.9% in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 72.5% of the patients in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 34.4% in the placebo group, most of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Once-weekly cagrilintide-semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg each) resulted in a significantly lower body weight than placebo in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; REDEFINE 2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05394519.).

### Efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide vs empagliflozin added to metformin in type 2 diabetes: patient-level meta-analysis [^113hk1fL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

No head-to-head trials have directly compared once-weekly (OW) semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, with empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Objective

We indirectly compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions

IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI: -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss responses.

Conclusions

This indirect comparison suggests that OW semaglutide 1 mg provides superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight vs OD empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D when added to metformin monotherapy.

### Effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly on 10-year type 2 diabetes risk in adults with overweight or obesity [^116FCXsH]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) trials, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg plus lifestyle intervention reduced body weight and improved cardiometabolic parameters in adults with obesity (or overweight with weight-related comorbidities). Effects on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) require investigation.

Methods

STEP 1 (68 weeks) and 5 (104 weeks) randomized participants to semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. STEP 4 included a 20-week semaglutide run-in followed by randomization to 48weeks of continued semaglutide or withdrawal (placebo). Ten-year T2D risk scores were calculated post hoc using Cardiometabolic Disease Staging.

Results

In STEP 1 (N = 1583), relative risk score reductions were greater with semaglutide versus placebo (semaglutide: -61.1%; placebo: -12.9%; p < 0.0001). These reductions were maintained to week 104 in STEP 5 (N = 295; semaglutide: -60.0%; placebo: 3.5%; p < 0.0001). Risk scores during the STEP 4 run-in period (N = 776) were reduced from 20.6% to 11.1% and further to 7.7% at week 68 with continued semaglutide, increasing to 15.4% with withdrawal (relative risk score change: semaglutide: -32.1%; placebo: +40.6%; p < 0.0001). Risk score reductions mirrored weight loss.

Conclusions

Cardiometabolic Disease Staging risk assessment suggests that once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg may substantially lower 10-year T2D risk in people with overweight or obesity.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^114quDv6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The PIONEER programme was a robustly designed series of 10 clinical trials and established the premise of oral GLP‐1RA therapy. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Given that injections represent a barrier for some patients and health care providers, the availability of an oral GLP‐1RA should increase the number of eligible patients who receive this effective means of T2D management, and encourage use at an earlier stage. Thus, oral semaglutide addresses an important unmet need in the management of T2D.

In conclusion, the PIONEER programme demonstrated that the novel formulation of oral semaglutide was efficacious across the spectrum of T2D and more effective than comparators for glycaemic control and weight loss. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Tolerability was consistent with the known profile of GLP‐1RAs. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Real‐world data will be required to confirm if the outcomes seen in the PIONEER trials are translated into clinical practice, and whether the availability of semaglutide in an innovative oral formulation will promote earlier and more frequent utilization of the GLP‐1RA class.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of how to weigh the options, select the right patients, and maximize benefits [^116sgAGQ]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

A growing body of data, guideline recommendations, algorithms, and position papers supports the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes (T2D), given their beneficial effects on glycemic control, weight, lipid parameters, and blood pressure, and low risk for hypoglycemia when used in patients who have not achieved glycemic goals with metformin and lifestyle interventions. Exciting new evidence continues to emerge, showing the utility of certain GLP-1 receptor agonists to decrease incident cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, and to bolster glycemic control when combined with other antihyperglycemic therapies, including basal insulin. The recent availability of fixed-ratio GLP-1 receptor agonist and basal insulin coformulations-and a new, first-ever, indication for the use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide) to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE) in adults with T2D and established cardiovascular disease (CVD)-increase options for improved care. In addition, semaglutide (another GLP-1 receptor agonist with positive CV outcomes data) received FDA approval in December 2017 with an indication to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D. These new developments and continuously emerging CV outcomes data should be considered in determining how GLP-1 receptor agonists may be best used in clinical practice. This Q&A presentation with 2 expert endocrinologists provides a pragmatic approach to inform the selection and use of GLP-1 receptor agonists based on the rapidly evolving evidence.

Effects of GLP-1RAs in Patients With T2DM

Current guidelines recommend GLP-1RAs for patients with T2D in need of weight loss or with CVD. Glycated hemoglobin (Hba1c) decreases in a dose-dependent manner (usually between 1% and 2%) linked to a number of patient-related determinants (ie, baseline Hba1c, pretreatment body weight, duration of diabetes) and factors specific to each GLP-1RA (ie, short [exenatide twice daily and lixisenatide] vs long-acting [all others available in clinical practice], relative potency, weight-loss induction). Although there has been variability in the results from GLP-1RAs in cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) in patients with T2DM, the direction of the change has been usually favorable, even if not all reached the primary efficacy endpoint of improvement in major cardiovascular events, such as with lixisenatide (The Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome [ELIXA]) or later with exenatide (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering [EXSCEL]). Clear positive results have been reported with liraglutide (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results [LEADER]) or weekly injectables such as semaglutide (A Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes [SUSTAIN-6]) or dulaglutide (Dulaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes [REWIND]). Treatment with oral semaglutide (A Trial Investigating the Cardiovascular Safety of Oral Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes [PIONEER 6]) also showed a similar positive trend as the injectable semaglutide formulation in SUSTAIN-6, but short of statistical significance (P = 0.17) as not powered as a CVOT. A systematic review of CVOT including 56 004 participants, concluded that treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-RAs) reduce death from cardiovascular causes by 12% (P < 0.003), fatal or nonfatal stroke by 16% (P = 0.0001), fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 9% (P = 0.043), all-cause mortality by 12% (P = 0.001), hospital admission for heart failure by 9% (P = 0.028), and a composite of kidney outcomes by 17% (P < 0.0001). Of interest, cardiovascular benefits of GLP-RA extend to patients age > 65 and even ≥ 75.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2. 0 mg versus 1 · 0 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN FORTE): a double-blind, randomised, phase 3B trial [^1156gycf]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Semaglutide is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes; however, 20–30% of patients given semaglutide 1·0 mg do not reach glycaemic treatment goals. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2·0 mg versus 1·0 mg in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin with or without a sulfonylurea.

Methods

We did a 40-week, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, phase 3B trial (SUSTAIN FORTE) at 125 outpatient clinics in ten countries. Participants (≥ 18 years) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA 1c 8·0–10·0%) with metformin and with or without sulfonylurea were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web-response system to 2·0 mg or 1·0 mg once-weekly semaglutide. Participants, site personnel, the clinical study group, and investigators were masked to the randomised treatment. Outcomes included change from baseline at week 40 in HbA 1c (primary outcome) and bodyweight (secondary confirmatory outcome), evaluated through trial product estimand (no treatment discontinuation or without rescue medication) and treatment policy estimand (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication) strategies. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03989232; EudraCT, 2018–004529–96; and WHO, U1111–1224–5162.

Findings

Between June 19 and Nov 28, 2019, of 1515 adults assessed for eligibility, 961 participants (mean age 58·0 years [SD 10·0]; 398 [41%] women) were included. Participants were randomly assigned to once-weekly semaglutide 2·0 mg (n = 480 [50%]) or 1·0 mg (n = 481 [50%]); 462 (96%) patients in the semaglutide 2·0 mg group and 471 (98%) in the semaglutide 1·0 mg group completed the trial. Mean baseline HbA 1c was 8·9% (SD 0·6; 73·3 mmol/mol [SD 6·9]) and BMI was 34·6 kg/m 2 (SD 7·0). Mean change in HbA 1c from baseline at week 40 was -2·2 percentage points with semaglutide 2·0 mg and -1·9 percentage points with semaglutide 1·0 mg (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·23 percentage points [95% CI -0·36 to -0·11]; p = 0·0003; trial product estimand) and -2·1 percentage points with semaglutide 2·0 mg and -1·9 percentage points with semaglutide 1·0 mg (ETD -0·18 percentage points [-0·31 to -0·04]; p = 0·0098; treatment policy estimand). Mean change in bodyweight from baseline at week 40 was -6·9 kg with semaglutide 2·0 mg and -6·0 kg with semaglutide 1·0 mg (ETD -0·93 kg [95% CI -1·68 to -0·18]; p = 0·015; trial product estimand) and -6·4 kg with semaglutide 2·0 mg and -5·6 kg with semaglutide 1·0 mg (ETD -0·77 kg [-1·55 to 0·01]; p = 0·054; treatment policy estimand). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most commonly reported adverse events (163 [34%] in the 2·0 mg group and 148 [31%] in the 1·0 mg group). Serious adverse events were similar between treatment groups, reported for 21 (4%) participants given semaglutide 2·0 mg and 25 (5%) participants given semaglutide 1·0 mg. Three deaths were reported during the trial (one in the semaglutide 1·0 mg group and two in the semaglutide 2·0 mg group).

Interpretation

Semaglutide 2·0 mg was superior to 1·0 mg in reducing HbA 1c, with additional bodyweight loss and a similar safety profile. This higher dose provides a treatment intensification option for patients with type 2 diabetes treated with semaglutide in need of additional glycaemic control.

Treatment recommendations in relation to CV benefits and reduced all-cause mortality

In light of the significant benefits of certain SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs in reducing the risks of CV death and all-cause death in patients with T2D, major international guidelines have been updated to include evidence from CVOTs to help differentiate between the use of GLDs. The American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and the Europe Society of Cardiology (ESC) and EASD guidelines all recommend specific treatments for patients with T2D and atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) based on CVOT data (Table 2). The general consensus between the guidelines is that patients diagnosed with T2D and CVD should be treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA with proven CVD benefit, either as first add-on to metformin or as monotherapy. The ESC guidelines specifically recommend use of empagliflozin in patients with T2D and CVD to reduce the risk of death, while empagliflozin, canagliflozin, or dapagliflozin are recommended in patients with T2D and CVD, or at very high/high CV risk, to reduce CV events. Regarding choice of GLP-1 RA, the ESC and ACC guidelines recommend the use of dulaglutide, liraglutide or injectable semaglutide for patients with T2D and CVD, based on their CV benefits.

### Oral semaglutide as an opportunity for an appropriate therapeutic switch in people with type 2 diabetes: a Delphi consensus [^115gX4MQ]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The expanding range of therapeutic options for type 2 diabetes (T2D) calls for a reassessment of clinical scenarios in which existing glucose-lowering therapies might be substituted with the oral glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) semaglutide (OS). In light of the numerous unresolved questions, a panel of experts was convened to develop practical guidance for clinicians using the Delphi consensus method.

Methods

A panel of 13 experts formulated 31 statements addressing the following clinical scenarios: switch from injectable GLP-1 RA to OS; switch from sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor to OS; switch from insulin to OS; switch from dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) to OS; switch from "old" oral therapies (i.e., sulfonylureas, glinides, pioglitazone, acarbose) to OS. A panel of 28 diabetologists from the Emilia-Romagna region evaluated each statement by assigning a relevance score on a 9-point scale via a dedicated online platform. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was employed to determine the presence of disagreement among panelists.

Results

Panelists showed agreement for all 31 statements, all considered relevant. Panelists agreed that in many circumstances OS can represent a valuable alternative to injectable GLP-1 RAs, other oral glucose-lowering drugs, and insulin. The selection of OS is justified by its proven effectiveness in reducing glycated hemoglobin and body weight, as well as its positive impact on cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, OS can allow a simplification of therapy in patients treated with insulin.

Conclusion

In an ever-evolving therapeutic landscape, OS therapy stands as a valuable option in the management of patients with T2D.

### Evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide versus dulaglutide for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK [^113GmAVb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Improving glycaemic control remains a key focus of care for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and landmark studies show that good glycaemic control can reduce the incidence of diabetes‐related complications. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for individuals with T2DM who are managed with lifestyle modifications and a single drug, and a target of 7% (53 mmol/mol) for individuals with T2DM who are not adequately controlled by a single glucose‐lowering drug. 6 In addition, there is substantial evidence that multifactorial care, targeting not only glycaemic control but also blood pressure, serum lipids, body weight and hypoglycaemia risk, is associated with a reduced risk of complications. 7, 8, 9, 10 Consequently, NICE guidelines recommend a weight loss target of 5% to 10% of body weight and a blood pressure target of below 140/80 mmHg, in conjunction with glycaemic control targets. 6

A significant number of individuals with T2DM in the UK are not reaching recommended targets. Data from the National Diabetes Audit show that during 2016–2017, one third of the individuals with T2DM in England and Wales had an HbA1c value above 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and one quarter had blood pressure above 140/80 mmHg. 11 In Scotland, over 40% of the individuals with T2DM had an HbA1c value above 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and one quarter had systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg in 2016. 12 Therefore, there is a significant need to improve care for individuals with T2DM in the UK. Bringing a greater proportion of individuals with T2DM to glycaemic control and multifactorial treatment targets can improve long‐term outcomes for patients and reduce the costs of treating diabetes‐related complications for healthcare providers and UK society as a whole. This is key in optimizing the use of the limited resources within the National Health Service (NHS).

### Advances in the management of type 2 diabetes in adults [^1175krbG]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

More recently, the pattern of management of diabetes has begun to shift further, with a renewed focus on looking at the causes of type 2 diabetes and its metabolic comorbidities and long term complications. This pathogenesis centric approach places the management of obesity at the centre of the prevention and treatment of the disease. Even a relatively small amount (5–7%) of weight loss reduced the risk of incident diabetes and improved glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss have been reported to have greater beneficial effects on glycaemic control (including remission of diabetes), metabolic dysfunction, and quality of life. Weight loss achieved with metabolic surgery reduced the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes and reduced mortality.

By contrast, intensive lifestyle treatments in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) randomised controlled trial of 5145 adults with type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events compared to usual care. The likelihood of detecting differences between the intensive lifestyle and conventional treatment groups might have been reduced because the cardiovascular event rate in the Look AHEAD population was much lower than anticipated (0.7% per year v estimated 3.1% per year). A post hoc analysis suggested that those who lost at least 10% of their body weight in the first year had a significantly lower risk of the primary outcome, which was a composite of the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospital admission for angina (adjusted hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.98, P = 0.034). How weight loss achieved with drug treatment, particularly agents such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, compares with metabolic surgery for glycaemic control, microvascular and macrovascular complications, and mortality, should be examined.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^112X91Hj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended for glycaemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Oral semaglutide, the first oral GLP-1RA, has recently been approved for clinical use, based on the results of the randomized, Phase 3a Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) clinical trials. The PIONEER programme tested oral semaglutide in patients with T2D of duration ranging from 3.5 to 15years, from monotherapy through to insulin add-on, in global populations and two trials dedicated to Japanese patients. Outcomes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and body weight reduction, plus other relevant efficacy and safety endpoints) were tested against both placebo and active standard-of-care medications. A separate trial evaluated the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk. Over periods of treatment up to 78weeks, oral semaglutide 7 and 14mg once daily reduced HbA1c and body weight across the spectrum of T2D, and improved other diabetes-related endpoints, such as fasting plasma glucose. Oral semaglutide provided significantly better efficacy than placebo and commonly used glucose-lowering medications from the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) classes, as well as the subcutaneous GLP-1RAs liraglutide and dulaglutide. Oral semaglutide was well tolerated in line with the known safety profile of GLP-1RAs, with transient gastrointestinal events being the most common side effects reported. Cardiovascular safety was demonstrated for oral semaglutide in patients with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk. The results of the PIONEER programme suggest that oral semaglutide is efficacious and well tolerated for glycaemic control of T2D. The availability of oral semaglutide may help to broaden treatment choice and facilitate adoption of earlier GLP-1RA treatment in the paradigm of T2D management.

### A review on semaglutide: an oral glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist in management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114msab9]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide; 31 and 60 million adults live with type 2 diabetes in USA and Europe, respectively. India has 77 million people with diabetes mellitus (DM); currently India has the second highest number of diabetes cases in the world preceded only by China. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and progressive disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality; four million deaths worldwide are attributable to diabetes, with half of these in people aged under 60 years. The risk of death among people with diabetes (aged 20–59 years) is at least double that in those without diabetes. A key factor underlying the global rise in diabetes is the increasing prevalence of obesity, which is a significant risk factor for diabetes. Different terms have been used to describe the association of obesity and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is considered as a diagnostic entity; the word 'diabesity' highlights the etiologic effect of obesity on type 2 diabetes. A body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 kg/m 2 is associated with an increased risk of diabetes of more than 40-fold in men and more than 70-fold in women. When combined with overweight/obesity, the risks of serious long-term complications and overall mortality associated with diabetes are further increased.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^11111JSr]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Oral semaglutide is a welcome addition to diabetes therapy. As evidence and experience accumulate, its use will become more effective and efficient. More evidence is needed, however, regarding the impact of oral semaglutide on absorption of alcohol and other drugs and in those with diabetic gastroparesis. This commentary, based on the expert opinion of the authors and suggestions mentioned in other peer-reviewed published papers, shares clinical tips on how to use the drug, in a safe and smart manner, in a wider spectrum of people living with type 2 diabetes. This will ensure rational use of this molecule in a safer and more effective method. Diabetes care is a dynamic field, and oral semaglutide counseling will continue to be updated as research and real-world experience evolve.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113aiBrc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study SUSTAIN-6 was published by Steven P Marso and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk? In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the population was: 3297 patients (1295 female, 2002 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen. The key exclusion criteria were treatment with a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor within 30 days before screening or with a GLP-1-receptor agonist or insulin other than basal or premixed within 90 days before screening; history of an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 90 days; planned revascularization of a coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery; long-term dialysis. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the interventions were: n = 1648 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for 4 weeks, then titrated to 0.5 mg for another 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1649 placebo (matching placebo for 104 weeks). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.6% vs. 8.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) Significant decrease in death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (7.4% vs. 9.6%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.97) Significant decrease in new or worsening nephropathy (3.8% vs. 6.1%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.88). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe hypoglycemia. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen, semaglutide was noninferior to placebo with respect to the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Oral semaglutide as an opportunity for an appropriate therapeutic switch in people with type 2 diabetes: a Delphi consensus [^113ZLjgV]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Development of Statements

Statements relative to the place of oral semaglutide in the treatment of people with T2D were identified by a steering group composed of 13 experts in diabetes management, operating in different healthcare districts of the Emilia-Romagna region. In a face-to-face meeting, chaired by a panel moderator experienced in facilitating group discussions and criteria development, the experts were asked to identify key aspects regarding the role of oral semaglutide in T2D relative to the following situations: switch from injectable GLP-1 RA to oral semaglutide; switch from sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) to oral semaglutide; switch from insulin to oral semaglutide; switch from inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4i) to oral semaglutide; switch from "old" oral therapies (i.e. sulfonylureas, glinides, pioglitazone, acarbose) to oral semaglutide. A total of 31 statements were identified and grouped into five main topics (Table 1).

### Oral GLP-1 analogue: perspectives and impact on atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients [^116Wnf8Q]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular events related to atherosclerosis are responsible for high morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes. Improvement in care, especially in early stages, is crucial. Oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, controls blood glucose and results in significant body weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. Beyond these well-known effects, an interesting aspect of this drug is its antiatherogenic activity, which should be further explored in clinical practice. This paper reviews the evidence related to oral semaglutide decreasing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes, focusing on the drug's antiatherosclerotic properties. The glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue restores endothelial dysfunction, induces vasodilatation, and reduces plasma lipids. Oral semaglutide showed cardiovascular safety profile, with significant reduced risk of death from cardiovascular events. Based on current data, clinicians should consider oral semaglutide for type 2 diabetes management.

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^113AJnGt]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

Objectives

To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

Interventions

Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -0.7% to -1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-1.9%) and placebo (-0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, -0.4% to -1.6%; p = 0.01 for 2.5 mg, < .001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -2.1 kg to -6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-6.4 kg) vs placebo (-1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, -0.9 to -5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus daily canagliflozin as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 8): a double-blind, phase 3b, randomised controlled trial [^1128HX8r]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines for management of type 2 diabetes recommend a patient-centred approach to guide the choice of pharmacological agents. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly used as second-line agents, direct comparisons between these treatments are insufficient. In the SUSTAIN 8 trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) with canagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This was a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3b, randomised controlled trial done at 111 centres in 11 countries. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA 1c 7·0–10·5% [53–91 mmol/mol]) on stable daily metformin therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web response system to subcutaneous semaglutide 1·0 mg once weekly or oral canagliflozin 300 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA 1c, and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline in bodyweight, both at week 52. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients, using on-treatment data collected before initiation of rescue medication. The safety analysis was done on a population that included all patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product. The trial was powered for HbA 1c and bodyweight superiority under reasonable assumptions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03136484.

Findings

Between March 15, 2017, and Nov 16, 2018, 788 patients were randomly assigned to semaglutide 1·0 mg (394 patients) or canagliflozin 300 mg (394 patients). 739 patients completed the trial (367 in the semaglutide group and 372 in the canagliflozin group). From overall baseline mean, patients receiving semaglutide had significantly greater reductions in HbA 1c and bodyweight than those receiving canagliflozin (HbA 1c estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·49 percentage points, 95% CI -0·65 to -0·33; -5·34 mmol/mol, 95% CI -7·10 to -3·57; p < 0·0001; and bodyweight ETD -1·06 kg, 95% CI -1·76 to -0·36; p = 0·0029). Gastrointestinal disorders, most commonly nausea, were the most frequently reported adverse events with semaglutide, occurring in 184 (47%) of 392 patients; whereas infections and infestations (defined using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 21.0), most commonly urinary tract infections, occurred more frequently with canagliflozin, in 136 (35%) of 394 patients. Premature treatment discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 38 (10%) of 392 patients with semaglutide and in 20 (5%) of 394 patients with canagliflozin. One fatal adverse event confirmed unlikely to be caused by treatment occurred in the semaglutide group.

Interpretation

Once-weekly semaglutide 1·0 mg was superior to daily canagliflozin 300 mg in reducing HbA 1c and bodyweight in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin therapy. These outcomes might guide treatment intensification choices.

### The role of oral semaglutide in managing type 2 diabetes in Indian clinical settings: addressing the unmet needs [^11188q49]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Despite their established benefits, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) remain underutilized for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management, which indicates that subcutaneous injection is an unfavorable mode of delivery from the patient's perspective. This review summarizes existing challenges related to medication adherence and the use of antihyperglycemia injectables, revisits the established safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide, and explores its features and considerations for use among the Indian T2DM population.

Methods

We performed a literature search using MEDLINE and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry from July 1, 2016, to July 1, 2021, to identify publications on oral semaglutide approval, T2DM treatment guidelines, and clinical evidence for oral drug formulation.

Results

Oral semaglutide is the first oral GLP-1 RA approved for T2DM patients based on phase 3, randomized PIONEER trials. The multitargeted action of this drug offers glycemic control, weight control, and cardiovascular, renal, and additional benefits, including patient convenience and enhanced medication adherence. In addition to achieving glycemic control, the cost of semaglutide is reported to be lower than other GLP-1 RA in the West, thus potentially mitigating the economic burden that appears to be high among the Indian population.

Conclusions

Currently, there is no data available on oral semaglutide in Indian clinical settings. However, significant improvements in glycemic control, cardiac and renal benefits, as well as weight loss across clinical trials should encourage clinicians to prioritize oral semaglutide over other antidiabetic agents.

### Meeting the challenge of virtual diabetes care: a consensus viewpoint on the positioning and value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice [^111TukXU]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The findings highlighted in the clinical trial data indicate that oral semaglutide presents a valuable option for managing T2D, with the potential to expand the number of people with T2D benefiting from GLP-1 RAs. As such, oral semaglutide should be considered alongside other recommended OADs as second-line treatment in place of injectable GLP-1 RAs. While both GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy as a second-line treatment for people with T2D with heart failure (HF) and/or CKD comorbidities, SGLT2 inhibitors should be the preferred option for this group of people with T2D, since they provide a greater benefit, but at a significantly lower cost. As a consensus group, we recommend that oral semaglutide should be considered for metabolic control over alternative options, such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SUs and thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Furthermore, in patients with T2D and HF/CKD, for whom SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered a preferential therapy, when additional glucose-lowering effects are required, such as in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, oral semaglutide should be considered as the preferred add-on OAD therapy.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) reduce hyperglycemia, body weight and atherosclerotic disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Post hoc analyses suggest that GLP-1 RAs also slow kidney function decline.
Whether these benefits on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline are consistent regardless of baseline chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk factors is unknown.

This study adds:

Semaglutide slows absolute eGFR decline in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, regardless of glycemic, blood pressure, body mass index or albuminuria status.
This suggests a potential role for semaglutide to confer kidney protection in a broad population of people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk.

Potential impact:

This study suggests a potential impact of semaglutide on kidney outcomes in a broad population with type 2 diabetes.
These results in conjunction with other evidence about kidney and cardiovascular protective effects of GLP-1 RAs, including the FLOW trial, support a role for GLP-1 RA in the management of CKD in type 2 diabetes.

### The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control [^115YUKJR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders. Future research should continue to explore its therapeutic potential in under-studied populations, including individuals with non-diabetic cardiovascular disease and hepatic fibrosis.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease caused by impaired insulin secretion due to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Homeostatic hyperglycemia causes microangiopathy (neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy) and carries a risk of macroangiopathy including cardiovascular disorders. Complications of these vascular disorders are associated with a decrease in patient quality of life, a decrease in healthy life expectancy, and economic disadvantages. Furthermore, because obesity is a risk factor for macroangiopathy and associated with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, obese type 2 diabetes patients require more intensive glycemic control and body weight loss. Lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) along with medication can be effective on treatment. However effective medication is essential in severely diabetic patients.

Incretin, which consists of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), is a small intestine hormone that stimulates the secretion of insulin upon feeding. In type 2 diabetes, excessive secretion of glucagon also plays a role in the mechanism of hyperglycemia. Because incretin inhibits glucagon secretion in addition to promoting insulin secretion, its application as a drug for type 2 diabetes has been aggressively pursued. However, as the reactivity of GIP in β-cells is decreased in type 2 diabetes, efforts to develop GLP-1–related drugs have led to the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are correlated; 80%–90% of patients with T2D have obesity or overweight. Additionally, obesity is associated with a 7‐fold higher risk of developing T2D, while overweight is associated with a 3‐fold higher risk of developing T2D compared to those with normal weight. Obesity management has been shown to improve glycaemic control, metabolic outcomes, cardiovascular health, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and triglyceride concentration levels in patients with T2D and delay or prevent progression from prediabetes to T2D.,

Obesity management and weight reduction are the cornerstones for the prevention and management of T2D, as evidenced by the current Diabetes UK guidelines and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)‐American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus guidelines. Recent European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) guidelines recommend a shift from a sole emphasis on weight reduction to a broader focus on improving overall health outcomes. This includes not only weight reduction but also addressing obesity‐related complications and enhancing the quality of life, mental well‐being, physical functioning and social functioning, reflecting the need for sustained health improvements and a multifaceted management strategy.

### Potential new therapeutic implications of semaglutide: new colours of the rainbow? [^115eXQA5]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is a potent glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to this, it has emerging potential clinical implications. First, there is accumulating preliminary data on its potential role in type 1 diabetes mellitus. In this setting, we need to know which patient subgroups may benefit more. Furthermore, its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver and in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is emerging. Other potential therapeutic implications of semaglutide include kidney disease, Alzheimer disease and pulmonary diseases. Nonetheless, we still need much more information on its long-term efficacy, safety and utility in these new implications before any definitive conclusions may be drawn for everyday practice.

4.5 Cardiovascular outcomes

Among 3183 patients with T2D and high CV risk enrolled in PIONEER 6, oral semaglutide was non‐inferior to placebo for the incidence of first major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (3.8% in the oral semaglutide group and 4.8% in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79 [95% CI 0.57‐1.11], P < .001 for non‐inferiority). 40 A lower incidence of CV‐related death (HR = 0.49 [95% CI 0.27‐0.92]) and all‐cause death (1.4% vs 2.8%; HR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.31‐0.84]) was observed with oral semaglutide versus placebo. 40

In the other PIONEER trials, among patients at lower CV risk, the incidence of CV events between patients receiving oral semaglutide and those receiving placebo or other glucose‐lowering drugs was low. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 Fasting lipid levels (very low, low and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) remained similar or were reduced with oral semaglutide (generally at the 14 mg dose) versus comparators, and reductions were maintained over time. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44

### De-intensification of basal-bolus therapy by replacing prandial insulin with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes: a single-centre, open-label randomised trial (TRANSITION-T2D) [^1163S1FW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, TRANSITION‐T2D is the first randomised trial, to our knowledge, to demonstrate safe and effective de‐intensification of MDI in persons with well‐controlled type 2 diabetes, where nearly 100% of study participants initiating semaglutide were able to stop prandial insulin. Of equal importance, the approach we used is a simple one, making it clinically accessible for both clinicians and patients in real‐world settings. MDI no longer needs to be accepted as the final therapy destination for people with type 2 diabetes. An ostensibly simple therapy transition (simultaneously stopping prandial insulin and starting subcutaneous semaglutide) not only reduces treatment and management burdens (fewer weekly injections, plus an expected reduction in glucose monitoring frequency/intensity), but also facilitates weight loss and, presumably, other weight loss–related benefits. Moreover, in persons with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, there are further benefits of replacing prandial insulin with subcutaneous semaglutide, which is FDA approved to reduce major cardiovascular event risk. This approach has the potential to revolutionise management of persons with reasonably well‐controlled type 2 diabetes who, until now, have been assumed to require lifelong MDI, especially those with obesity.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^113ePph8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide regulates blood glucose via the incretin pathway, stimulating insulin and inhibiting glucagon secretion in a glucose‐dependent manner, leading to lower blood glucose levels with low risk for hypoglycaemia. In STEP 2, insulin treatment was only allowed for rescue therapy and those taking sulphonylureas were to reduce the dose by 50% to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Severe or blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia was reported in 5.7% versus 3.0% of participants treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo. In the SUSTAIN trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, severe or blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia occurred among participants in the semaglutide groups at a similar or lower level than in comparator groups. Clinicians may wish to consider reducing the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.

Semaglutide causes delay of gastric emptying and therefore has the potential to affect absorption of oral medications. While absorption was not affected in clinical pharmacology trials of semaglutide 1.0 mg, monitoring is advised.

### Efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide vs empagliflozin added to metformin in type 2 diabetes: patient-level meta-analysis [^113Jo91d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

No head-to-head trials have directly compared once-weekly (OW) semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, with empagliflozin, a sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Objective

We indirectly compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology.

IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA 1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly reduced mean HbA 1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: −0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): −0.72; −0.49] and −1.65 kg [95% CI: −2.22; −1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA 1c targets and weight-loss responses.

Conclusions

This indirect comparison suggests that OW semaglutide 1 mg provides superior reductions in HbA 1c and body weight vs OD empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D when added to metformin monotherapy.

### Achieving glycaemic control without weight gain, hypoglycaemia, or gastrointestinal adverse events in type 2 diabetes in the SUSTAIN clinical trial programme [^115bShbi]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Across the SUSTAIN 1 to 5 trials, semaglutide was well tolerated, with a similar safety profile to that of other GLP‐1RAs. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 24 The most common AEs leading to discontinuation of semaglutide were GI in nature and, overall, most cases of GI AEs were mild or moderate and of a short duration. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 24 GI AEs are commonly observed across the GLP‐1RA class, 2, 9 and may affect treatment outcomes in the real‐world setting. In SUSTAIN 1 to 5, > 80% of participants experienced no GI AEs, regardless of their randomized treatment; however, the proportion of participants with no GI AEs was lower with semaglutide, vs comparators, except in the semaglutide 0.5 mg group in SUSTAIN 5. With semaglutide 0.5 or 1.0 mg, approximately half of the participants achieved HbA1c concentrations < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) without weight gain, severe or BG‐confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia, or moderate/severe GI AEs, which was significantly more than participants treated with comparators. The overall effect for the post hoc composite endpoint was mostly driven by the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and those experiencing no weight gain. Similar analyses with liraglutide and dulaglutide have not examined the role of GI AEs in participants achieving HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) without weight gain or severe or BG‐confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 21, 22

### Estimated life-years gained free of new or recurrent major cardiovascular events with the addition of semaglutide to standard of care in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk [^115VB3W7]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a post hoc analysis of pooled data from Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) 6 and Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) 6. We estimated the benefit of adding semaglutide to standard of care (SoC) on life-years free of new/recurrent CVD events in people with T2D at high risk of CVD.

Research Design and Methods

The Diabetes Lifetime-perspective prediction (DIAL) competing risk-adjusted lifetime CVD risk model for people with T2D was developed previously. Baseline characteristics of the pooled cohort from SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 (POOLED cohort) (N = 6,480) were used to estimate individual life expectancy free of CVD for patients in the POOLED cohort. The hazard ratio of MACE from adding semaglutide to SoC was derived from the POOLED cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.62–0.92]) and combined with an individual's risk to estimate their CVD benefit.

Results

Adding semaglutide to SoC was associated with a wide distribution in life-years free of CVD gained, with a mean increase of 1.7 (95% CI 0.5–2.9) life-years. Estimated life-years free of CVD gained with semaglutide was dependent on baseline risk (life-years free of CVD gained in individuals with established CVD vs. those with cardiovascular risk factors only: 2.0 vs. 0.2) and age at treatment initiation.

Conclusions

Adding semaglutide to SoC was associated with a gain in life-years free of CVD events that was dependent on baseline CVD risk and age at treatment initiation. This study helps contextualize the results of semaglutide clinical trials.

### Will oral semaglutide be used to reduce cardiovascular risk in subjects with type 2 diabetes instead of subcutaneous semaglutide? [^114LHZCY]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The 'glutides', which stimulate the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor to stimulate insulin secretion, are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is the first glutide to be developed in an oral form. The PIONEER series of clinical trials (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) were undertaken to establish a clinical role for oral semaglutide. Areas covered: This evaluation is of PIONEER 6 in a non-inferiority phase 3a trial. In PIONEER 6, the primary outcome was the time from randomization to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event and this was non-inferior with oral semaglutide, compared to placebo. Expert opinion: In my opinion, there are several reasons why once-daily oral semaglutide may not replace once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Most importantly, subcutaneous semaglutide has already been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing cardiovascular risk, whereas the study of this with oral semaglutide will not be completed until 2024. Secondly, it is debatable whether subjects will find the daily protocol for taking oral semaglutide more convenient than that for the weekly subcutaneous formulation.

Semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) — approvals and pivotal STEP trial outcomes for weight management: it is "approved at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg per week for glycemic control in adults with T2D", and "subcutaneous semaglutide at the higher dose of 2.4 mg/week has been approved for chronic weight management". In STEP 1 (without T2D), placebo-subtracted weight loss was "16.9%" (on-treatment) and "14.9%" (in-trial), with STEP 1/3/4 yielding "16.9% to 18.2%" weight loss with a lifestyle program. In a phase 2 NASH study, semaglutide produced "13% weight loss" with fibrosis improvement in "43%" versus "7%" and "33%" with placebo. In STEP 2 (with T2D and ABCD), randomization included "2.4 mg/week", "1.0 mg/week", and placebo; placebo-subtracted weight loss was "6.2%" with 2.4 mg versus "3.6%" with 1.0 mg, and "10.6% weight loss" with 2.4 mg plus lifestyle, along with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Glucagon-like peptide agonists: a prospective review [^113vE9fY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The increasing number of clinical trials and the subsequent approval of multiple GLP1RAs on the market reflect these agents' growing importance and recognition in diabetes care. Semaglutide, as a frontrunner in this class, has paved the way for improved glycemic control and overall patient outcomes since 2017. In summary, the advent of GLP1RAs has expanded the therapeutic landscape. These medications offer patients various treatment choices, each with its unique benefits and mechanisms of action. As research continues to unravel the potential of GLP1RAs, patients and healthcare providers have access to a range of practical and well‐tolerated options, leading to better management and improved quality of life for individuals with these conditions.

### Reductions in insulin resistance are mediated primarily via weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes on semaglutide [^115Nsr4d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Semaglutide, a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 analog approved for use in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), demonstrated superior body weight (BW) reductions and decreased insulin resistance (IR) vs comparators across the Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) 1–3 clinical trials.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between IR and BW across the SUSTAIN 1–3 trials.

Design

Post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN 1–3 trials.

Setting

Three hundred and eleven sites in 30 countries.

Patients Or Other Participants

2432 subjects with T2D.

Interventions

Semaglutide 0.5 or 1.0 mg, placebo or active comparator (sitagliptin 100 mg, exenatide extended release 2.0 mg).

Main Outcome Measure

To assess the extent of the effect on IR that is mediated (indirect effect) and not mediated (direct effect) by the effect on BW.

Results

Across SUSTAIN 1–3, mean BW was significantly reduced with semaglutide 0.5 mg (3.7 kg to 4.3 kg; P < 0.0001) and semaglutide 1.0 mg (4.5 kg to 6.1 kg; P < 0.0001) vs comparators (1.0 kg to 1.9 kg). There were greater reductions in IR with semaglutide 0.5 mg (27% to 36%) and semaglutide 1.0 mg (32% to 46%) vs comparators (17% to 28%). Greater reductions in BW were generally associated with greater decreases in IR. The effect on IR was primarily mediated by weight loss (70% to 80% and 34% to 94%, for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, vs comparator).

Conclusions

Semaglutide consistently reduced BW and IR in subjects with T2D in SUSTAIN 1–3. In this analysis, IR improvement was positively associated with, and primarily mediated by, the effect of semaglutide on BW.

### Semaglutide in patients with obesity-related heart failure and type 2 diabetes [^113pJL2q]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP-HFpEF DM was published by Mikhail N Kosiborod and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure, Obesity and Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with obesity-related HFpEF and T2DM? In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the population was: 616 patients. The inclusion criteria were patients who had HFpEF, a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², and T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg within 90 days before screening; uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy. In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the interventions were: n = 310 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks, titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, and continued for a total of 52 weeks) n = 306 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 52 weeks). In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score at week 52 (13.7 points vs. 6.4 points; AD 7.3 points, 95% CI 4.1 to 10.4). In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in body weight at week 52 (9.8% vs. 3.4%; ARD 6.4, 95% CI 5.2 to 7.6) Significant increase in improvement in 6-minute walk distance at week 52 (12.7 m vs. -1.6 m; AD 14.3 m, 95% CI 3.7 to 24.9) Significant increase in reduction in CRP level at week 52 (42% vs. 12.8%; AD 29.2%, 95% CI 11.87 to 46.53). In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in serious adverse events (17.7% vs. 28.8%). In the STEP-HFpEF DM study, the conclusion was: in patients who had HFpEF, a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², and T2DM, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to mean improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score at week 52.

### Semaglutide 2. 4 mg once a week in adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes (STEP 2): a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^115SW1HE]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of the GLP-1 analogue once a week subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg versus semaglutide 1·0 mg (the dose approved for diabetes treatment) and placebo for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3, superiority study enrolled adults with a body-mass index of at least 27 kg/m 2 and glycated haemoglobin 7–10% (53–86 mmol/mol) who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 180 days before screening. Patients were recruited from 149 outpatient clinics in 12 countries across Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1) via an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and glycated haemoglobin, to subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2·4 mg, or semaglutide 1·0 mg, or visually matching placebo, once a week for 68 weeks, plus a lifestyle intervention. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and achievement of weight reduction of at least 5% at 68 weeks for semaglutide 2·4 mg versus placebo, assessed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03552757 and is closed to new participants.

Findings

From June 4 to Nov 14, 2018, 1595 patients were screened, of whom 1210 were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 404), semaglutide 1·0 mg (n = 403), or placebo (n = 403) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated change in mean bodyweight from baseline to week 68 was -9·6% (SE 0·4) with semaglutide 2·4 mg vs -3·4% (0·4) with placebo. Estimated treatment difference for semaglutide 2·4 mg versus placebo was -6·2 percentage points (95% CI -7·3 to -5·2; p < 0·0001). At week 68, more patients on semaglutide 2·4 mg than on placebo achieved weight reductions of at least 5% (267 [68·8%] of 388 vs 107 [28·5%] of 376; odds ratio 4·88, 95% CI 3·58 to 6·64; p < 0·0001). Adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide 2·4 mg (in 353 [87·6%] of 403 patients) and 1·0 mg (329 [81·8%] of 402) than with placebo (309 [76·9%] of 402). Gastrointestinal adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate, were reported in 256 (63·5%) of 403 patients with semaglutide 2·4 mg, 231 (57·5%) of 402 with semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 138 (34·3%) of 402 with placebo.

Interpretation

In adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide 2·4 mg once a week achieved a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in bodyweight compared with placebo.

Funding

### Management of patients with type 2 diabetes with once-weekly semaglutide versus dulaglutide, exenatide ER, liraglutide and lixisenatide: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the Danish setting [^112QASX2]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a class of multifactorial T2D medications that have been shown to improve numerous risk factors for diabetes-related complications, including glycemic control and body weight. In addition, recent cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) have shown that long-acting human GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide and albiglutide, are associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D. In Denmark, available GLP-1 receptor agonists include the once-weekly variants semaglutide, dulaglutide and exenatide extended-release (ER) and the once-daily variants liraglutide and lixisenatide. These therapies are recommended as a second-line therapy for patients with T2D with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c > 7.0%) on metformin, particularly those with established cardiovascular disease, in line with the latest American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines. Additionally, ADA guidelines recommend considering dual therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c ≥ 1.5% above their glycemic target.

### Cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: rationale, design and patient baseline characteristics for the PIONEER 6 trial [^112VtKJS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide, the first tablet formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.

Materials and Methods

PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged ≥ 50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration.

Results

Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD.

Conclusions

PIONEER 6 will provide evidence regarding the CV safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk.

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^115eSGmG]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview of Evidence from Clinical Trials on Efficacy of Oral Semaglutide

The efficacy of oral semaglutide was widely assessed in the PIONEER (Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment) program of 10 RCTs, which included more than 9500 patients and examined the use of oral semaglutide in different phases of T2D, on various background therapies. Oral semaglutide showed significant improvements in glycemic control and weight reduction versus various comparators.

As for the comparison of oral semaglutide with other oral agents, in the PIONEER 2 open-label trial, oral semaglutide (14 mg once daily) was evaluated against the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin (25 mg once daily) for 52 weeks in 822 patients with T2D uncontrolled on metformin with a mean HbA1c level of 8.1%. Semaglutide was superior to empagliflozin in reducing HbA1c (− 1.3% vs. − 0.8%; p < 0.001) and body weight (− 4.7 kg vs. − 3.8 kg; p = 0.01) after 52 weeks of treatment. Moreover, a higher number of patients reached the composite endpoint (HbA1c < 7% without severe or symptomatic hypoglycemia and no weight gain) with oral semaglutide compared to empagliflozin. The likelihood of achieving this endpoint was significantly greater with oral semaglutide (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.50–2.74).

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^112QMeus]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

From clinical trials and observational data, oral semaglutide has proven to be the most effective second-line oral therapy for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. This review aims to describe the perspective of an Italian expert panel that addressed the potential challenges arising during the use of oral semaglutide in the free-living conditions of routine clinical care. A group of Italian experts discussed and generated insights into the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice. Key topics included the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, the positioning of the agent to optimize the treatment benefits, the possibility to adopt flexibility in the administration schedule, critical issues encountered, the role of patient communication and information in the importance of dose escalation and management of adverse events. Available data on efficacy and effectiveness of oral semaglutide from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies were reported, along with factors that determine tolerability and persistence on treatment. The debate over a fixed versus a flexible dosing schedule was critically addressed, providing anecdotical clues from a small case series and a real-world database. Additionally, a set of recommendations for clinicians to consider when prescribing oral semaglutide and during the process of patient monitoring were provided.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^115aaKv4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) in people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%-17.4% in individuals with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%-79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%-27% with placebo) and 51%-64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo). In STEP 5, mean weight loss was -15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -2.6% with placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was -9.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -3.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^1128h29W]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management. This paper reviews data on the mechanism of action, weight-loss and cardiometabolic efficacy, and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg/week for obesity. Semaglutide has demonstrated the largest weight loss of any obesity medication to date with reductions of approximately 15% of initial weight at 68 weeks, accompanied by improvements in cardiovascular risks factors and physical functioning. The approval of this medication provides patients with greater options for weight management.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^112Zwtm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.
