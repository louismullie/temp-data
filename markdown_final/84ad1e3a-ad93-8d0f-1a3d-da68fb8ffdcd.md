## Question

Ketamine v Etomidate and adrenal suppression and sepsis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how ketamine compares to etomidate for rapid sequence intubation in sepsis, with particular attention to adrenal suppression and mortality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why the choice matters in septic patients. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanisms that drive adrenal effects. Next, I will appraise the highest-quality randomized evidence and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any apparent contradictions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline alternatives and special scenarios, including pediatrics and trauma, before concluding with a concise bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. In sepsis, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is common and associated with worse outcomes, so an induction agent that transiently suppresses adrenal function could theoretically worsen shock physiology and organ dysfunction; conversely, peri-intubation hypotension is frequent and dangerous, so hemodynamic stability during induction is also crucial, creating a tension between adrenal risk and hemodynamic risk that I need to balance carefully [^9fa29415] [^88af52d2].

> I will now examine the mechanism of etomidate's adrenal effect to ensure I'm precise. Etomidate inhibits mitochondrial 11β-hydroxylase, the final enzymatic step in cortisol synthesis, producing measurable adrenal suppression that can persist 24–72 hours after a single dose; this has been repeatedly documented in critically ill cohorts and is mechanistically distinct from ketamine, which does not directly inhibit steroidogenesis and may even increase cortisol in some contexts, although I should be cautious not to overstate ketamine's endocrine effects in sepsis [^63189c28] [^3e9cbdb9] [^730b3348].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality randomized evidence. The multicenter KETASED trial in critically ill adults found no significant difference in 3-day SOFA but a markedly higher incidence of adrenal insufficiency with etomidate versus ketamine (OR 6.7, 95% CI 3.5–12.7), supporting the mechanistic concern even though mortality was not significantly different in that study, which tempers definitive outcome conclusions from a single RCT [^06a2ac6d]. Wait, let me verify the mortality signal elsewhere; the EvK trial reported improved 7-day survival with ketamine versus etomidate (14.9% vs 22.7%), suggesting a potential early mortality benefit, though 28-day mortality did not differ, so I should not jump to conclusions about long-term effects from that single-center study [^fd94cf9d].

> Hold on, I should verify the pooled evidence. Contemporary meta-analyses consistently show that etomidate increases adrenal insufficiency compared with ketamine, with a pooled relative risk around 0.54 for less adrenal suppression with ketamine, and some analyses suggest a modest mortality signal favoring ketamine, though results vary by inclusion criteria and adjustment; importantly, a 2024 Bayesian meta-analysis found a moderate probability of mortality reduction with ketamine, while acknowledging persistent equipoise and the need for larger trials [^f3fc689b] [^21bd0ea7] [^03f1a02e]. I should double-check older meta-analyses; indeed, earlier pooled data in septic populations associated etomidate with higher mortality, but those analyses were dominated by observational designs and are more susceptible to confounding, which explains some of the heterogeneity and why guideline bodies have been cautious in translating this into firm recommendations [^f7c9d496] [^3e9cbdb9].

> Next, I should review guidelines to see how expert panels weigh this. The Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends against giving corticosteroids solely to counter etomidate-induced adrenal suppression, reflecting that randomized trials of hydrocortisone after etomidate have not shown improved outcomes; this indirectly underscores the concern that etomidate's adrenal effect is real but that routine steroid "reversal" is not a proven solution, so avoidance of etomidate in sepsis is a reasonable default when alternatives exist [^5018b4b6] [^7794b179]. But wait, what if the hemodynamic profile of etomidate is indispensable in profound shock? The same guideline concludes there is no clear mortality difference between etomidate and other induction agents overall, so it issues a conditional suggestion rather than a strong prohibition, which I need to integrate with patient-specific hemodynamic risk [^5ca7e994].

> I need to ensure I weigh hemodynamic trade-offs accurately. Observational cohorts and some RCTs show ketamine is associated with more peri-intubation hypotension than etomidate, whereas etomidate's hemodynamic neutrality is its traditional selling point; however, ketamine may reduce the need for vasopressors downstream, and etomidate's adrenal suppression could theoretically worsen vasopressor-refractory shock, so the net clinical effect is not straightforward and must be individualized [^49040066] [^f3fc689b]. Hold on, I should verify whether etomidate truly reduces hypotension exposure in sepsis; some studies suggest it does, but others show no difference or even worse early hemodynamics when confounding is addressed, reinforcing that the hemodynamic advantage is inconsistent and context-dependent [^85fc29da].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pediatrics. Pediatric sepsis guidelines advise avoiding etomidate when possible due to adrenal suppression and cite observational data linking etomidate to higher mortality; in children with sepsis or recent etomidate exposure, stress-dose hydrocortisone is recommended, which is a stronger stance than in adults and reflects the vulnerability of the developing HPA axis and the lack of pediatric RCTs to refute harm [^64da5903] [^2d607316]. I should confirm that this applies even if etomidate was a single dose; yes, the guidance treats recent etomidate as an indication for stress-dose steroids pending further pediatric-specific trials [^38f70531].

> Now, trauma deserves separate consideration. Trauma societies often still list etomidate as acceptable for RSI because of hemodynamic stability, but they increasingly acknowledge adrenal concerns and support ketamine as a reasonable alternative; in trauma cohorts, outcomes with ketamine appear comparable to etomidate, and some trauma ERAS guidance prefers ketamine over etomidate when sepsis is present or suspected, which aligns with a risk-stratified approach rather than a blanket prohibition [^0b61e60b] [^c5c79807]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought trauma guidance uniformly favored etomidate; let me reconsider — modern trauma recommendations increasingly emphasize agent selection tailored to hemodynamic and infectious risk, so ketamine is a valid first-line choice in many trauma patients, especially if sepsis is a concern [^c5c79807].

> I should double-check the practical implications for steroid strategy. If etomidate is used in sepsis, some clinicians consider early hydrocortisone, but randomized data have not shown mortality benefit from empiric steroids solely to counter etomidate, and guidelines advise against routine steroids for this purpose; thus, steroid decisions should be driven by sepsis severity and vasopressor responsiveness rather than etomidate exposure alone, and I need to ensure I don't conflate CIRCI management with etomidate mitigation [^5018b4b6] [^7794b179]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while some observational propensity analyses suggested lower mortality with etomidate plus hydrocortisone, these are hypothesis-generating and should not override negative RCTs and guideline recommendations, so I should avoid overinterpreting them in practice [^cdde90d1].

> Let me synthesize a balanced, risk–benefit conclusion. Ketamine reduces the risk of etomidate-associated adrenal suppression and may modestly improve early outcomes in some studies, but it carries a higher risk of peri-intubation hypotension; etomidate offers superior hemodynamic stability at induction but imposes a persistent adrenal penalty that is not reliably reversed by routine steroids, so in patients with sepsis or septic shock, ketamine is generally preferred when hemodynamics can be mitigated with fluids and vasopressors, whereas etomidate may be reserved for extreme instability where its pharmacologic profile is indispensable and adrenal risk is accepted [^f3fc689b] [^21bd0ea7] [^5ca7e994]. I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary reviews; yes, recent expert summaries similarly conclude that ketamine's profile is safer overall in septic patients, with etomidate reserved for select scenarios and with awareness that propofol should generally be avoided in unstable patients due to cardiovascular depression [^2a2354ab] [^fd94cf9d].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical steps are clear. If I choose ketamine, I should anticipate and preempt hypotension with aggressive pre-intubation fluids and have push-dose pressors ready; if I choose etomidate, I should document the adrenal risk, avoid reflexive steroid administration solely for etomidate, and manage shock per sepsis protocols while monitoring for refractory vasopressor needs that might reflect CIRCI rather than drug effect; in pediatrics, I should avoid etomidate when possible and give stress-dose hydrocortisone if it was used or if other HPA risk factors are present [^0b61e60b] [^5018b4b6] [^64da5903]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating any claims; given persistent equipoise and ongoing trials, shared decision-making and local protocol alignment are essential, and I should remain open to evolving evidence that could refine this risk–benefit balance over time [^fd94cf9d].

Ketamine is **preferred over etomidate** for RSI in sepsis because etomidate causes **transient adrenal suppression** [^63189c28] that can worsen shock and increase mortality [^f7c9d496] [^3e9cbdb9], whereas ketamine does not suppress the adrenal axis and offers hemodynamic stability [^f3fc689b]. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show etomidate increases adrenal insufficiency [^06a2ac6d] [^f3fc689b] and is associated with higher mortality in sepsis [^f7c9d496] [^3e9cbdb9], while ketamine shows no such effects [^f3fc689b]. Guidelines recommend **avoiding etomidate in sepsis** and using ketamine or other alternatives [^c5c79807]; if etomidate is used, do not routinely give steroids to counter adrenal suppression, as this does not improve outcomes [^5018b4b6] [^7794b179].

## Pharmacological mechanisms and adrenal effects

### Etomidate

- **Mechanism**: Inhibits 11β-hydroxylase, blocking cortisol synthesis and causing transient adrenal suppression lasting 24–72 hours [^63189c28] [^8f1f2ec5].

- **Clinical relevance**: In sepsis, this can worsen shock, increase vasopressor needs, and contribute to mortality [^f7c9d496] [^32319b08].

---

### Ketamine

- **Mechanism**: NMDA antagonist with sympathomimetic effects; does not inhibit 11β-hydroxylase or suppress adrenal function [^730b3348].

- **Clinical relevance**: Maintains hemodynamics without adrenal suppression, making it attractive in sepsis [^f3fc689b].

---

## Clinical outcomes and guidelines

- **Mortality**: Etomidate is associated with higher mortality in sepsis, especially in observational data [^f7c9d496] [^32319b08]; RCTs show no clear mortality difference but consistently show more adrenal insufficiency with etomidate [^06a2ac6d] [^f3fc689b].

- **Hemodynamics**: Ketamine maintains blood pressure via sympathetic stimulation, whereas etomidate is hemodynamically neutral but can worsen shock via adrenal suppression [^f3fc689b] [^63189c28].

- **Guidelines**: SCCM advises against routine corticosteroids after etomidate to counter adrenal suppression, as this does not improve outcomes [^5018b4b6] [^7794b179]. Many trauma and critical care guidelines prefer ketamine in sepsis when available [^c5c79807].

---

## Practical implications and recommendations

- **Preferred agent**: Ketamine is preferred for RSI in sepsis due to lack of adrenal suppression and favorable hemodynamics [^f3fc689b] [^2a2354ab].

- **Etomidate use**: If etomidate is used, avoid routine steroids afterward; manage shock per sepsis protocols and monitor for refractory hypotension [^5018b4b6] [^7794b179].

- **Alternatives**: Consider midazolam or ketamine-propofol combinations when ketamine is contraindicated or unavailable [^f604e571] [^f1b2da30].

---

Ketamine is **preferred over etomidate** for RSI in sepsis because etomidate causes transient adrenal suppression that can worsen shock and increase mortality, whereas ketamine does not suppress the adrenal axis and maintains hemodynamics. Guidelines recommend avoiding etomidate in sepsis; if used, do not routinely give steroids to counter adrenal suppression, as this does not improve outcomes.

### Ketamine versus etomidate for rapid sequence intubation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^f3fc689b]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the safety and efficacy of ketamine and etomidate as induction agents to facilitate emergent endotracheal intubation.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to April 3, 2024.

Study Selection

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ketamine to etomidate to facilitate emergent endotracheal intubation in adults.

Data Extraction

Reviewers screened abstracts, full texts, and extracted data independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random-effects model, assessed risk of bias using the modified Cochrane tool and certainty of evidence using the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We pre-registered the protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42023472450).

Data Synthesis

We included seven RCTs (n = 2384 patients). Based on pooled analysis, compared with etomidate, ketamine probably increases hemodynamic instability in the peri-intubation period (relative risk [RR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07–1.57; moderate certainty) but probably decreases the need for initiation of continuous infusion vasopressors (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57–1.00; moderate certainty) and results in less adrenal suppression (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.45–0.66; moderate certainty). Ketamine probably has no effect on successful intubation on the first attempt (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97–1.05; moderate certainty) or organ dysfunction measured as the maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score during the first 3 days in ICU (mean difference, 0.55 SOFA points lower; 95% CI, 1.12 lower to 0.03 higher; moderate certainty) and may have no effect on mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83–1.21; low certainty) when compared with etomidate.

Conclusions

Compared with etomidate, ketamine probably results in more hemodynamic instability during the peri-intubation period and appears to have no effect on successful intubation on the first attempt or mortality. However, ketamine results in decreased need for the initiation of vasopressor use and decreases adrenal suppression compared with etomidate.

### An expiration date for etomidate? [^195242ca]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Several important questions arise from the data in this study and the recent related literature. First, although this study has limitations, the totality of evidence points to a reasonably consistent signal of increased mortality risk with etomidate. Combined with a mechanistic basis for this concern (i.e. adrenal suppression) and evidence that etomidate might not mitigate hypotension exposure compared with other agents like ketamine, the overall balance of risk versus benefit does not favor the use of etomidate.

Second, safe alternatives to etomidate exist. This study and other prior research focused on ketamine. Another possibility, which still requires further investigation, is the ultra–short-acting benzodiazepine remimazolam, which might provide the hemodynamic benefits of a benzodiazepine-based induction in a fast-acting and short-duration drug.

### Etomidate versus ketamine for rapid sequence intubation in acutely ill patients: a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^06a2ac6d]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Critically ill patients often require emergency intubation. The use of etomidate as the sedative agent in this context has been challenged because it might cause a reversible adrenal insufficiency, potentially associated with increased in-hospital morbidity. We compared early and 28-day morbidity after a single dose of etomidate or ketamine used for emergency endotracheal intubation of critically ill patients.

Methods

In this randomised, controlled, single-blind trial, 655 patients who needed sedation for emergency intubation were prospectively enrolled from 12 emergency medical services or emergency departments and 65 intensive care units in France. Patients were randomly assigned by a computerised random-number generator list to receive 0.3 mg/kg of etomidate (n = 328) or 2 mg/kg of ketamine (n = 327) for intubation. Only the emergency physician enrolling patients was aware of group assignment. The primary endpoint was the maximum score of the sequential organ failure assessment during the first 3 days in the intensive care unit. We excluded from the analysis patients who died before reaching the hospital or those discharged from the intensive care unit before 3 days (modified intention to treat). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00440102.

Findings

234 patients were analysed in the etomidate group and 235 in the ketamine group. The mean maximum SOFA score between the two groups did not differ significantly (10.3 [SD 3.7] for etomidate vs 9.6 [3.9] for ketamine; mean difference 0.7 [95% CI 0.0–1.4], p = 0.056). Intubation conditions did not differ significantly between the two groups (median intubation difficulty score 1 [IQR 0–3] in both groups; p = 0.70). The percentage of patients with adrenal insufficiency was significantly higher in the etomidate group than in the ketamine group (OR 6.7, 3.5–12.7). We recorded no serious adverse events with either study drug.

Interpretation

Our results show that ketamine is a safe and valuable alternative to etomidate for endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients, and should be considered in those with sepsis.

### An expiration date for etomidate? [^88af52d2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Endotracheal intubation to facilitate invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients is a high-risk procedure. For example, cardiovascular instability occurred in nearly 40% of intubations in critically ill patients included in the recent INTUBE study (International Observational Study to Understand the Impact and Best Practices of Airway Management in Critically Ill Patients), which in turn was associated with higher risks of mortality. Given this particularly high-risk nature of endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients, safety and risk mitigation must be prioritized. Consistent with this emphasis, the MACOCHA score (Mallampati score III/IV, Apnea syndrome [obstructive], Cervical spine limitation, Opening mouth 3 cm, Coma, Hypoxia, and Anesthesiologist nontrained) was developed to help identify patients at risk for difficult intubation, whereas several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed strategies implemented across various phases of the periintubation period to support safer airway management.

Critically ill patients pose physiological difficulty when undergoing endotracheal intubation. They are at high risk for cardiorespiratory collapse due to induction agents, conversion to positive-pressure ventilation, and limited physiological reserve rendered by underlying critical illness. As such, the pharmacologic agent of choice to induce anesthesia in critically ill patients is highly debated. Recently, ketamine and etomidate have gained popularity because of their more favorable hemodynamic profiles compared with the prototypical induction agent, propofol. However, particularly in patients with sepsis, there has been a longstanding concern of higher mortality rates in patients who receive etomidate versus other induction agents, possibly related to adrenal suppression that can occur after even a single dose of etomidate. Individual RCTs comparing the two agents have had mixed results. For example, two moderately sized RCTs comparing ketamine and etomidate found no difference in 28-day mortality (secondary outcome in both trials), yet one trial did show a higher 7-day survival rate in the ketamine arm whereas the other demonstrated higher rates of adrenal suppression in the etomidate arm. Overall, pooled data in several meta-analyses point to the potential for increased mortality when etomidate is used to facilitate endotracheal intubation.

### Etomidate for critically ill patients. con: do you really want to weaken the frail? [^f604e571]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Etomidate is an imidazole-derived hypnotic agent preferentially used for rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia because of its favourable haemodynamic profile. However, 11β-hydroxylase inhibition causes adrenal insufficiency with potentially fatal consequences in specific populations. We review the arguments against the liberal administration of etomidate in critically ill, and especially septic, patients. This review considered only high-quality and prospective studies with a low risk of bias. Three major effects have been observed with the clinical use of a single dose of etomidate. First, independent of the clinical setting, etomidate causes adrenal dysfunction via 11β-hydroxylase inhibition ranging from 12 to 48 h, making the drug unsuitable for use in elective interventions. Second, in a systematic review with meta-analyses, including 3715 septic patients, the relative risk of death with etomidate was 1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.35). Based on this statistically significant and clinically relevant increase in mortality, a single dose of etomidate has to be avoided in patients with septic shock. Third, in small randomised controlled trials, a single dose of etomidate in trauma patients was associated with an increased incidence of pneumonia (56.7 vs. 25.9% in controls), prolonged intensive care stay (6.3 vs. 1.5 days) and prolonged hospital stay (11.6 vs. 6.4 days). Based on these randomised controlled trials, the use of etomidate should be avoided in unstable trauma patients. Midazolam and ketamine are two valid alternatives with similar intubation and haemodynamic conditions as etomidate but without its adverse effects. Therefore, for safety reasons, etomidate should be avoided in the critical conditions of sepsis and trauma.

### Etomidate for critically ill patients. pro: yes we can use it [^3eb7e5b4]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Etomidate is used to induce anaesthesia in critically ill patients in many environments, including pre-hospital care, in the emergency and critical care departments and in the operating theatre. It has a favourable cardiovascular profile, but its use has courted controversy because it suppresses adrenal function which some believe is associated with worse outcome, particularly in patients with sepsis. Because there is much evidence of harm associated with hypotension in critically ill patients, it is important to use an anaesthetic induction drug which is less likely to cause hypotension. Etomidate undoubtedly causes adrenal suppression, but the clinical consequences of this remain unclear. There is no convincing or consistent evidence that etomidate is associated with harm, particularly if adjustment is made for pre-existing severity of illness. The etomidate debate is currently in clinical equipoise in which there is genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community. We review briefly the arguments in favour of continuing to use etomidate in critically ill patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^2d607316]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Etomidate for intubation in pediatric sepsis — evidence overview: No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exist in critically ill children with or without sepsis comparing etomidate to another anesthesia/sedative regimen, and observational pediatric-inclusive studies reported higher mortality after use of etomidate (pooled OR, 4.51; 95% CI, 1.82–11.16). Adult data indicate adrenal effects, including cortisol to adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) ratios decreasing by 83% after etomidate exposure, a comparison of 234 versus 235 critically ill adults with higher adrenal insufficiency in the etomidate group (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.37–2.36), and pooled odds across four adult studies of 1.89 (95% CI, 1.47–2.44). The text notes there is no conclusive evidence to recommend an optimal alternative induction agent to etomidate, although ketamine and fentanyl are routinely available and can offer favorable hemodynamic profiles in the setting of shock.

### A prospective observational study of the effect of etomidate on septic patient mortality and length of stay [^863cb2b2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Etomidate is known to cause adrenal suppression after single-bolus administration. Some studies suggest that when etomidate is used as an induction agent for intubation of septic patients in the emergency department (ED), this adrenal suppression leads to increased mortality, vasopressor requirements, and length of hospital stay. The authors sought to determine differences in the in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) between septic patients given etomidate and patients given alternative or no induction agents for rapid-sequence intubation in our ED.

Methods

This was a nonrandomized, prospective observational study of all patients meeting sepsis criteria who were intubated in an ED over a 9-month period. Times of patient presentation, intubation, admission, discharge, and/or death were recorded, as well as the intubation agent used, if any, and corticosteroid use. The authors also recorded relevant laboratory and demographic variables to determine severity of illness using the Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score. Mortality and survivor LOS between the patients given etomidate and those given alternative or no induction agents were compared.

Results

A total of 106 patients with sepsis were intubated over the study period. Of these, 74 patients received etomidate, while 32 patients received ketamine, benzodiazepines, propofol, or no induction agents. Age in years (median = 78; interquartile range [IQR] = 67 to 83), gender (45% male), MEDS score (median = 13; IQR = 10 to 15), and receipt of supplemental corticosteroids (56%) were statistically similar between the two groups. In-hospital mortality of patients given etomidate (38%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 28% to 49%) was similar to those receiving alternatives (44%; 95% CI = 28% to 61%). Surviving patients had a median hospital LOS after receiving etomidate of 10 days compared to those receiving alternatives (7.5 days; p = 0.08).

Conclusions

No statistically significant increase in hospital LOS or mortality in patients given etomidate for rapid-sequence intubation was found. Suggestions that the use of etomidate for intubation in the ED be abandoned are not supported by these data.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^85fc29da]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) induction agents — etomidate versus ketamine and others — are compared in critically ill adults for hypotension, vasopressor use, and mortality. A prospective randomized single-center study assessed etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) versus ketamine (1–2 mg/kg) and reported that Seven-day survival but not 28-day survival was higher with ketamine without differences in ventilation, ICU stay, vasopressor use, SOFA score, or new adrenal insufficiency. In a sepsis propensity score–matched cohort, clinical hypotension defined as MAP decrease > 40% from baseline, MAP < 60 mm Hg, initiation of a vasopressor, or an increase of > 30% of a vasopressor infusion occurred in 51% with ketamine (1.3–2.2 mg/kg) versus 73% with etomidate (0.2–0.4 mg/kg) (OR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22–0.67), and at 6–12 hours and 12–24 hours after RSI the etomidate group had significantly lower MAPs. In sepsis intubations, ketamine (median dose: 100 mg [interquartile range {IQR} 72.2–150 mg]) versus etomidate (median dose: 20 mg [IQR 15–20 mg]) had higher post-RSI hypotension with ketamine even after propensity adjustment (OR 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1–6.7), and in ED RSI, hypotension was 18.3% with ketamine (n = 738) versus 12.4% with etomidate (n = 6,068), with a higher risk for hypotension in the ketamine group (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.7). Less-rigorous trials of combinations, including dose varied based on the study 0.2 mg/kg ± 0.1, mean: 21 mg ± 6, and comparators such as propofol (mean: 127 mg ± 5mg) and methohexital (mean: 1 mg/kg ± 0.2), did not show a higher rate of hypotension in critically ill or acutely injured patients. For vasopressor outcomes, across 469 patients in one study and a small RCT of 79 receiving ketamine/propofol (0.5 mg/kg of each) versus 73 receiving etomidate (0.15 mg/kg), there was no difference in duration or in immediate or delayed vasopressor use. A secondary analysis of the INTUBE trial found propofol for RSI was associated with significantly higher adjusted odds of cardiovascular collapse and increased odds of mortality. Taken together, there was no significant difference between etomidate and other induction agents in mortality, most studies demonstrated favorable peri-intubation hemodynamics with etomidate, and because it is often available, familiar, and low cost, it is a reasonable RSI induction agent for critically ill patients.

### Etomidate for intubation of patients who have sepsis or septic shock – where do we go from here? [^1a1ecae0]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Etomidate is an intravenous induction agent that is associated with hemodynamic stability during intubation. The agent is therefore attractive for use in critically ill patients who have a high risk of hemodynamic instability during this procedure. However, etomidate causes adrenal suppression, which itself has been associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. The ongoing debate surrounding use of etomidate is thus centered on the immediate favorable hemodynamic profile versus the long-term risks of adrenal insufficiency, particularly in patients who have severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^64da5903]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis airway induction — etomidate: Observational pediatric data and adult randomized controlled trials (RCTs) report higher mortality and adrenal insufficiency associated with etomidate, while no pediatric RCTs compare etomidate with alternatives; pooled pediatric mortality signal was large and adrenal suppression has been demonstrated even after a single dose. Studies cited include mixed adult–pediatric cohorts (44 vs 90), a meningococcal sepsis pediatric cohort (23 vs 37), and adult RCTs showing increased adrenal insufficiency (including OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.37–2.36) with pooled adult odds 1.89 (95% CI, 1.47–2.44); one pediatric analysis reported pooled OR, 4.51 (95% CI, 1.82–11.16) for mortality, and cortisol to adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) ratios decreased by 83% after exposure. An optimal alternative induction agent is not established, although ketamine and fentanyl are routinely available and can offer favorable hemodynamic profiles in shock.

### Should we use etomidate as an induction agent for endotracheal intubation in patients with septic shock? a critical appraisal [^e101b142]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Etomidate is commonly used for the facilitation of endotracheal intubation. While etomidate possesses multiple qualities that are beneficial in hemodynamically unstable patients who require a sedative or amnestic, its potential to negatively impact corticosteroid production is well-documented. Given the frequency of relative adrenal insufficiency observed in the critically ill and the increasing use of corticosteroids in patients with septic shock, an appraisal of the status of etomidate as an induction agent in patients with evolving or established septic shock is indicated. A review of the relevant literature suggests that its use in this setting may be harmful. It is proposed that, pending the performance of a randomized, controlled clinical trial, considerable caution should accompany its administration in patients with evolving or established septic shock. The potential role for concomitant empiric steroid replacement and the comparability of alternative induction regimens are also discussed.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^dd0157f4]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with sepsis, induction of anaesthesia can be hazardous. Hypoxaemia, hypotension, volume depletion, and renal impairment may be present. No currently available induction agent is ideal. Possible agents are propofol, thiopental, etomidate, midazolam, and ketamine. In non-septic patients, cardiovascular depression is greatest with propofol, but thiopental can also cause significant hypotension. Etomidate causes less cardiovascular depression than propofol or thiopental, but it can suppress adrenal function through blockade of 11β-hydroxylase. This suppression persists for at least 24 hours, and some authors suggest that it may last up to 72 hours. This could harm patients with critical illness such as severe sepsis or septic shock.

Etomidate has been scrutinised with regard to its safety in critically ill patients. Much of this debate has been fuelled by opinion rather than clear evidence of deleterious clinical effect. Etomidate undoubtedly causes adrenal suppression, but the clinical consequences of this are not clear. Adrenal suppression in critical illness is controversial, particularly 'relative' adrenal insufficiency. The incidence of adrenal suppression in septic shock ranges from 9% to 67%, but there is little evidence that adrenal suppression is related to outcome. Cortisol response to corticotrophin is more frequently impaired in critically ill patients given etomidate, including those with septic shock, than those who receive an alternative induction agent. Retrospective analyses suggest that etomidate may be associated with increased mortality in septic patients. Corticosteroid treatment of these patients appeared to improve outcome, although steroid was administered in a randomised fashion rather than specifically to treat hypotension that did not respond to vasopressors. Annane found circumstantial evidence for a clinically deleterious effect of etomidate on adrenal function; septic patients given etomidate received more fluid and vasopressor therapy than those given other induction agents. If adrenal suppression were clinically important in the critically ill, patients given etomidate would require more vasopressor and steroid support and would have worse outcome than patients who received an alternative induction agent.

### Etomidate, sepsis, and adrenal function: not as bad as we thought? [^d8147283]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The choice of induction agent for endotracheal intubation can have significant downstream effects, especially in critically ill patients. In a retrospective study, Ray and McKeown found that the choice of induction agent had no significant effect on use of vasoactive medications, corticosteroids, or mortality. Given the heated debate regarding corticosteroids in septic shock and the role that etomidate may play in leading to adrenal insufficiency, enthusiasm for etomidate as an induction agent should be tempered by its possible, significant side effects in these critically ill patients.

### Etomidate, pharmacological adrenalectomy and the critically ill: a matter of vital importance [^1b3d2a2a]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Etomidate is a potent suppressant of adrenal steroidogenesis, effectively inducing reversible pharmacological adrenalectomy. Recent evidence suggests that for every five patients with septic shock given etomidate without corticosteroid supplementation, one patient will die as a consequence. Other critically ill patients are also at possible risk, and this risk requires further exploration. Etomidate will also confound investigations into the effects of disease states on adrenal function, and should therefore be avoided. A moratorium on the use of etomidate in critically ill patients outside clinical trials may be prudent until its safety is established.

### Should etomidate be used for rapid-sequence intubation induction in critically ill septic patients? [^31a7bfe4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Etomidate is an agent often used by emergency medicine physicians for rapid-sequence intubation induction of critically ill patients because of its reliable pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular stability. Etomidate is known to inhibit endogenous cortisol production through inhibition of 11beta-hydroxylase. Previous studies in undifferentiated emergency department patients and healthy, elective surgical patients have shown this effect to be only transient and not clinically significant. Recent retrospective studies in the pediatric and adult intensive care literature have shown an association between a single induction dose of etomidate in critically ill septic patients and sustained suppression of the adrenal axis with an increase in mortality. It is unknown at this time if any increase in mortality associated with etomidate-induced adrenal suppression would be offset by concomitant corticosteroid administration. Aggressive resuscitation of septic patients with fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors has been shown to significantly reduce mortality and may allow for the use of alternative agents that had previously been discouraged because of concern for hemodynamic collapse during intubation. A prospective randomized trial in septic patients of etomidate induction with early corticotropin stimulation testing or corticosteroid supplementation vs the use of alternative induction agents with enough power to detect differences in mortality is needed to further address this clinical dilemma.

### Induction agents for tracheal intubation in critically ill patients [^2a2354ab]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Concise definitive review of the use of induction agents in critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation and their association with outcomes.

Data Sources

Original publications were retrieved through a PubMed search with search terms related to induction agents for tracheal intubation in critically ill patients.

Study Selection

We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies that reported patient outcomes.

Data Extraction

Data from included studies, including choice of induction agents and clinically relevant outcomes, were extracted.

Data Synthesis

Etomidate and ketamine have been the most studied induction agents in critical care during last years. Recent studies on etomidate investigated the clinical impact of its recognized adrenal suppression in terms of morbidity and mortality. Etomidate may carry a non-negligible mortality risk without definitive hemodynamic benefits compared with ketamine. Available data then support the use of ketamine over etomidate, since the difference in the hemodynamic profile seems to be of minor clinical relevance. No multicenter randomized studies are available comparing propofol to other induction agents but evidence from a large observational study identified an association of propofol with post-intubation cardiovascular instability in critically ill patients. Despite the observational nature of these findings cannot exclude the role of confounders, the association of propofol with post-induction cardiovascular instability is pharmacologically plausible, justifying its avoidance in favor of drugs with a better safety profile in critical care such as ketamine.

Conclusions

Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn based on the available evidence, recent evidence pointed out the potential negative effect of etomidate on survival and the association of propofol with cardiovascular instability. Ketamine may be considered the drug with a safer profile, widespread availability and low cost but future research should provide definitive data on optimal drug selection, its dosage in the context of critical illness and concomitant interventions to minimize the risk of peri-intubation complications.

### Comparison of clinical outcome variables in patients with and without etomidate-facilitated anesthesia induction ahead of major cardiac surgery: a retrospective analysis [^7b800503]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study found no evidence for differences in key clinical outcome parameters based on anesthesia induction with or without administration of a single dose of etomidate. This holds particularly true for mortality, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, re-admission to the ICU, duration of mechanical ventilation, postoperative systemic inflammatory response or sepsis discriminated by inflammatory parameters, renal failure, or SOFA score. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed better intubation conditions in the etomidate group. Despite the known and undisputable risk of adrenal suppression and taking the beneficial effects for hemodynamic unstable and cardiac impaired patients into account, etomidate should remain an acceptable option in clinical routine for anesthesia induction.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^f9583879]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We conclude that induction agent use cannot be related to patient outcome, vasoactive use, or steroid use in this particular cohort of patients. Steroid treatment for vasopressor-dependent hypotension in patients who received etomidate did not improve survival. There are cogent reasons for choosing etomidate for induction in patients with impaired cardiovascular status. Bolus vasoactive therapy is required less frequently at induction with etomidate; if such therapy is required, the doses used are lower than after other agents. The use of etomidate in critically ill patients should consider all of these issues rather than the single aspect of adrenal suppression.

### A comparison of the effects of etomidate and midazolam on hospital length of stay in patients with suspected sepsis: a prospective, randomized study [^bf7302cc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Etomidate, a widely used induction agent for rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department (ED), causes measurable adrenal suppression after a single bolus dose. The clinical significance of this adrenal suppression in patients with sepsis remains controversial. We seek to determine the difference in hospital length of stay between patients with suspected sepsis who receive either etomidate or midazolam during intubation in our ED.

Methods

We performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized study of patients with suspected sepsis who were intubated in our ED during an 18-month period. Eligible patients who were critically ill and were suspected of having sepsis were randomized to receive either etomidate or midazolam before intubation.

Results

A total of 122 patients were enrolled; 59 received midazolam and 63 received etomidate. Two patients in the etomidate group were lost to follow-up. Patient baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There were no significant differences in median hospital length of stay (9.5 versus 7.3 days), ICU length of stay (4.2 versus 3.1 days), or ventilator days (2.8 versus 2.1) between patients who received midazolam and those who received etomidate, respectively. Inhospital mortality was 21 of 59 (36%; 95% confidence interval 24% to 49%) for patients who received midazolam and 26 of 61 (43%; 95% confidence interval 30% to 56%) for patients who received etomidate. For patients who survived to hospital discharge, the median length of stay was 11.3 days in the midazolam group versus 11.8 days in the etomidate group; for patients who died, the median length of stay was 2.9 days in the midazolam group versus 3.3 days in the etomidate group.

Conclusion

Patients with suspected sepsis and who received a single bolus dose of etomidate for rapid sequence intubation showed no significant increase in hospital length of stay compared with patients who received a single bolus dose of midazolam.

### Ketamine versus etomidate as an induction agent for tracheal intubation in critically ill adults: a Bayesian meta-analysis [^21bd0ea7]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Relationship with the previous literature

Ketamine and etomidate are suggested in clinical guidelines as induction agents for RSI because of their relatively modest cardiovascular effects; however, few meta-analyses have focused on comparing these two agents. In a previous meta-analysis of randomized trials of etomidate in critically ill patients, a subgroup analysis suggested an increased mortality risk of etomidate compared with ketamine (six RCTs with 2399 patients; RR, 1.18; 95% CI 1.02–1.37). The present meta-analysis increased the sample size by adding one recent RCT and one propensity-matched study, and found a moderate probability of mortality reduction with ketamine. However, the inconclusive TSA results and the reduced probability of benefit in the RCT subgroup leave substantial equipoise surrounding the effect of ketamine on mortality.

Hypotension is the most common peri-intubation complication in critically ill patients. While etomidate was associated with less risk of post-intubation hypotension compared to ketamine in a previous meta-analysis (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI 0.31–0.91; P = 0.02), the present meta-analysis showed no significant difference in post-induction MAP. The different results may be mainly attributable to different eligibility criteria. In the previous meta-analysis, no restriction on study design was placed, leading to a predominance of retrospective observational studies in the included articles, while the current meta-analysis selected only randomized and propensity-matched studies.

Since etomidate was the only comparator in this meta-analysis, its common adverse effect of adrenal insufficiency might have affected the mortality result. A recent meta-analysis showed that the risk of adrenal insufficiency was significantly higher in the etomidate group than the ketamine group. The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency following etomidate administration typically is made several hours to a day after induction, which is different from observation timing for SOFA score (1–3 days) and for post-induction MAP (within 1 h). Therefore, adrenal insufficiency might have contributed to the mortality findings without affecting the secondary outcomes.

In addition to ketamine and etomidate, propofol is also listed among induction agents for critically ill patients. Although we identified no randomized or matched study that compared ketamine with propofol, a secondary analysis of a recent international large cohort study found induction with propofol as an independent risk factor for peri-intubation hemodynamic complications in critically ill patients.

### Etomidate is associated with mortality and adrenal insufficiency in sepsis: a meta-analysis* [^f7c9d496]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of single-dose etomidate on the adrenal axis and mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials and observational studies with meta-analysis.

Setting

Literature search of EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Database, and Evidence-Based Medical Reviews.

Subjects

Sepsis patients who received etomidate for rapid sequence intubation.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and observational studies with meta-analysis assessing the effects of etomidate on adrenal insufficiency and all-cause mortality published between January 1950 and February 2012. We only examined studies including septic patients. All-cause mortality served as our primary end point, whereas the prevalence of adrenal insufficiency was our secondary end point. Adrenal insufficiency was determined using a cosyntropin stimulation test in all studies. We used a random effects model for analysis; heterogeneity was assessed with the I statistic. Publication bias was evaluated with Begg's test. Five studies were identified that assessed mortality in those who received etomidate. A total of 865 subjects were included. Subjects who received etomidate were more likely to die (pooled relative risk 1.20; 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.42; Q statistic, 4.20; I2 statistic, 4.9%). Seven studies addressed the development of adrenal suppression associated with the administration of etomidate; 1,303 subjects were included. Etomidate administration increased the likelihood of developing adrenal insufficiency (pooled relative risk 1.33; 95% confidence interval 1.22–1.46; Q statistic, 10.7; I2 statistic, 43.9%).

Conclusions

Administration of etomidate for rapid sequence intubation is associated with higher rates of adrenal insufficiency and mortality in patients with sepsis.

### Death by p-value: the overreliance on p-values in critical care research [^e236285d]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Bayesian approximation

Because patient-level data were unavailable, we conducted approximate Bayesian analyses using each paper's published point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, we:
Defined a neutral prior centered at zero effect (e.g. 0% mortality benefit) with a standard deviation (SD) reflecting typical effect sizes in critical care (± 10%).
Constructed a likelihood based on the reported effect size and derived the standard error from the 95% confidence interval, assuming approximate normality.
Applied Bayes' theorem to combine our neutral prior with the likelihood, producing a posterior distribution for the intervention's true effect.
Calculated the probability that the intervention's actual benefit exceeded a clinically relevant threshold, such as a 10% mortality reduction or a 2-day decrease in length of stay.

While not a full Bayesian reanalysis — ideally requiring patient-level data — this simplified approach can still highlight real clinical value masked by borderline p- values.

Etomidate vs ketamine for rapid sequence intubation

Context

In critically ill patients requiring emergency intubation, the choice of induction agent can affect both hemodynamics and organ function. Etomidate maintains stable blood pressure but may cause adrenal suppression. Ketamine preserves blood pressure but has potential neuropsychiatric effects. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, patients received either etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) or ketamine (2 mg/kg) for rapid sequence intubation across multiple French ICUs.

Key finding

The primary outcome of this study was max SOFA score during a three-day period. The etomidate group demonstrated a SOFA score max of 10.3 (SD 3.7), while the ketamine group had a max of 9.6 (SD 3.9) with a difference of 0.7 points (95% CI, 0.0–1.4, p = 0.056). Notably adrenal insufficiency was significantly more common with etomidate (OR 6.7, 95% CI 3.5–12.7).

Bayesian reanalysis

Neutral prior: Mean difference 0 SOFA points, SD 2 points.
Posterior probability: ~ 75–80% chance that ketamine lowers the 3-day SOFA score by ≥ 0.5 points.

Interpretation

Despite a borderline p- value (0.056), the modest improvement in organ function with ketamine and the high rate of adrenal insufficiency from etomidate suggest that ketamine may be preferable in certain critically ill patients, especially when adrenal compromise is a concern.

### Etomidate for anesthesia induction: friends or foe in major cardiac surgery? [^b2576bfa]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Adrenal suppression

Etomidate use for anesthesia induction has been an important subject of controversy over the past years. Indeed, it has been well known that adrenal mitochondrial 11-β-hydroxylase activity is transiently inhibited by a single dose of etomidate, with consecutive adrenal suppression. Whether etomidate is associated with impaired outcome is still debated and differs depending on patient categories (for example, anesthesia in the operating room, intensive care, emergency department and prehospital area). In critically ill patients suffering from sepsis, studies and meta-analyses found either an increased, an equal or a decreased risk of mortality after induction of anesthesia by etomidate for intubation. In major cardiac surgery, the clinical relevance of adrenal suppression after a single dose of etomidate for induction is controversial. Indeed, to our knowledge, etomidate induction has never been associated with 'conclusive' negative outcome data. Again, in the current study, induction with etomidate was not associated with worse outcomes in comparison with other drugs.

### Ketamine versus etomidate as an induction agent for tracheal intubation in critically ill adults: a Bayesian meta-analysis [^03f1a02e]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tracheal intubation is a high-risk procedure commonly performed in intensive care units (ICUs). Peri-intubation complications are common and are associated with an increased risk of mortality in critically ill patients. Therefore, improving the quality of care in the peri-intubation period may result in better outcomes of these high-risk patients.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI), facilitated by rapidly acting agents, is often used among critically ill patients who are deteriorating quickly. Clinical practice guidelines for RSI suggest ketamine, etomidate, and propofol as induction agents. Among the three drugs, propofol is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular collapse during the procedure, and etomidate carries a major risk of adrenal insufficiency due to inhibition of 11-beta hydroxylase in the adrenal glands. Notably, a recent meta-analysis showed that etomidate was associated with significantly increased mortality in critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation.

Given ketamine's favorable hemodynamic effects and absence of the adverse effects exhibited by other agents, it may represent the optimal option in this particular context. Indeed, in a subgroup analysis of a prior meta-analysis, etomidate had numerically increased mortality when compared to ketamine although this was not statistically significant (risk ratio [RR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94–1.22; P = 0.30).

To further the discussion on potential benefits of ketamine, we performed an updated systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate the probability that ketamine as an induction agent would reduce mortality in critically ill patients requiring tracheal intubation.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^b0203146]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) sedative-hypnotic evidence gaps — focused on etomidate — are noted for future research. Because of the lack of evidence that etomidate-induced adrenal insufficiency causes negative clinical outcomes, additional research focused on this topic may be redundant; however, patients with certain underlying diseases may be more susceptible to long-term outcomes of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, which has not been studied adequately. A correlation between mortality rates and degree of severity of illness following etomidate administration is hypothesis generating for a prospective evaluation, and although it is challenging to design a blinded trial due to the pharmacodynamic effects of some induction agents, such a trial may help adequately answer further questions related to RSI sedative-hypnotic agents.

### Controversies surrounding the use of etomidate for rapid sequence intubation in patients with suspected sepsis [^41863653]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the risk of adrenal insufficiency following a single dose of etomidate in patients with suspected sepsis requiring rapid sequence intubation.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from the dates of database inception until April 2010, utilizing the terms adrenal insufficiency, etomidate, and sepsis.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Data were synthesized in a qualitative manner, as variable study designs were identified. All studies that evaluated the clinical association between etomidate-induced adrenal insufficiency and sepsis in adults were reviewed and included.

Data Synthesis

A search of the literature revealed 7 studies that specifically evaluated clinical endpoints in septic adults receiving etomidate for induction prior to intubation. Three of the studies evaluated risk factors associated with adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients. Each of these studies determined that etomidate exposure was independently associated with an inappropriate response to cosyntropin stimulation testing (CST). Two studies found no significant difference in hospital mortality rates when evaluating patients receiving induction with etomidate compared with alternative regimens. Three studies found an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency in patients exposed to etomidate. The majority of studies that evaluated the use of etomidate in sepsis were underpowered, leading to difficulty in establishing a causal relationship between drug-related adrenal insufficiency, morbidity, and mortality.

Conclusions

Until further studies are available, etomidate should be reserved for hemodynamically unstable patients who cannot tolerate an alternative induction agent despite the administration of fluids or vasoactive agents.

### The incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock after the administration of etomidate [^9c26bf0b]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	Etomidate reversibly blocks adrenocortical synthesis when administered intravenously as a continuous infusion or a single bolus.

- 	The majority of patients with septic shock show evidence of relative adrenal insufficiency when the cosyntropin stimulation test is performed within 24 hours of the administration of etomidate.

### Effects of etomidate on complications related to intubation and on mortality in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone: a propensity score analysis [^17dad370]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endotracheal intubation, one of the most commonly performed procedures in the ICU, is associated with a high incidence of early onset life-threatening complications (25 to 39%) because of the precarious hemodynamic and respiratory status of those patients. To limit intubation-related life-threatening complications, bundle therapy including hemodynamically well-tolerated anesthetics such as etomidate has been suggested in the ICU and is widely used in prehospital or emergency room environments. In critically ill patients, the use of etomidate has been challenged because it inhibits adrenocortical steroid synthesis by reversibly blocking the 11β-hydroxylase enzyme action for at least 24 hours after a single bolus. This inhibition is associated with a risk of reversible failure of the adrenal axis, which can lead to critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI). Because CIRCI is associated with an increased mortality in septic shock patients, etomidate use is controversial in this setting. Moreover, some studies suggest a link between etomidate and poor outcome but others failed to confirm this link.

To limit the potential consequences of etomidate on the adrenal axis, hydrocortisone administration may be of interest. To our knowledge, only one randomized controlled clinical trial, performed in nonseptic critically ill patients, failed to demonstrate any benefit to counteract etomidate's side effect using a short course (48 hours) of hydrocortisone treatment. In our ICU, the anesthesia bundle for intubation strongly recommends the use of a rapid sequence induction and our septic shock bundle therapy includes hydrocortisone for all septic shock patients after a cosyntropin test as is frequently observed and suggested in France. In our operating room, no local bundle is purposed, although ketamine and etomidate are suggested for critically ill patients. Because of its potential protective effect on intubation safety, due to its cardiovascular properties, and its deleterious impact on adrenal gland physiology, etomidate may have contrasting impact on the incidence of life-threatening complications occurring within 1 hour after intubation and on the long-term outcome in septic shock patients.

### In patients with severe sepsis, does a single dose of etomidate to facilitate intubation increase mortality? [^20ba9dc9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, single-dose etomidate has not been shown to cause increased mortality in septic patients requiring intubation; however, sufficiently powered randomized trials are required before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^d818a44d]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Hospital mortality for the 159 patients in the study was 65%, which is comparable with rates found in other studies of septic shock. Patients given etomidate were sicker than those given propofol or thiopental and were less likely to survive. When the standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) (actual hospital mortality/predicted APACHE II mortality) are calculated for each of these groups, outcome is not significantly affected by the induction agent. Thus, etomidate did not have a demonstrable adverse effect on outcome. However, the SMR was higher for etomidate (1.0) than in the other pooled groups (0.96). Although this difference is relatively small, it is possible that etomidate may be associated with a worse 'adjusted' outcome. Despite concerns about etomidate-induced adrenal suppression, etomidate was chosen more frequently for sicker patients, and this did not lead to increased use of vasopressors, inotropes, or steroids. The dose of etomidate given in the present study (approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg) is lower than that given in other studies. It is possible that the amplitude of adrenal suppression is dose-related and that we might have observed a greater difference if we had used larger doses of etomidate. However, even a sub-anaesthetic dose of 0.04 mg/kg can block 11 β-hydroxylase, and we are not aware of any evidence that the clinical consequences of adrenal suppression following a single bolus of etomidate are dose-related. Patients who received hydrocortisone to treat vasopressor-dependent hypotension appeared to be sicker than patients who received no steroid therapy. This may account for our finding that outcome was worse in these patients, but it could be argued that steroids should improve patients more substantially if the vasopressor-dependence is related mainly to adrenal suppression.

### The incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock after the administration of etomidate [^955620b8]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Relative adrenal insufficiency is present in most patients with septic shock after the administration of etomidate. Caution is recommended when using etomidate in these patients.

### Anaesthesia in haemodynamically compromised emergency patients: does ketamine represent the best choice of induction agent? [^37f8f8c5]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

In rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in the emergency setting in shocked or hypotensive patients (e.g. ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, polytrauma or septic shock), prior resuscitation is often suboptimal and comorbidities (particularly cardiovascular) may be extensive. The induction agents with the most favourable pharmacological properties conferring haemodynamic stability appear to be ketamine and etomidate. However, etomidate has been withdrawn from use in some countries and impairs steroidogenesis. Ketamine has been traditionally contra-indicated in the presence of brain injury, but we argue in this review that any adverse effects of the drug on intracranial pressure or cerebral blood flow are in fact attenuated or reversed by controlled ventilation, subsequent anaesthesia and the greater general haemodynamic stability conferred by the drug. Ketamine represents a very rational choice for rapid sequence induction in haemodynamically compromised patients.

### Ketamine / propofol admixture vs etomidate for intubation in the critically ill: KEEP PACE randomized clinical trial [^f1b2da30]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Periintubation hypotension is associated with poor outcomes in the critically ill. We aimed to determine if an admixture of ketamine and propofol for emergent endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients was superior to etomidate. Primary endpoint was the change in mean arterial pressure from baseline to 5 minutes postdrug administration.

Methods

Emergent-use, stratified (shock status and unit type), multiunit, randomized, parallel-group superiority clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center. Adult medical/surgical and transplant/oncologic intensive care unit patients undergoing emergent intubation were assigned randomly to receive either ketamine/propofol admixture (0.5 mg/kg of ketamine and propofol each) or reduced dose etomidate (0.15 mg/kg) for emergent intubation.

Results

One hundred sixty participants were randomized, and 152 (79 ketamine/propofol admixture, 73 etomidate) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in mean arterial pressure change from baseline to 5 minutes postdrug administration (treatment difference [ketamine/propofol admixture-etomidate]: -2.1 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -6.9 mm Hg to +2.7 mm Hg; p = 0.385). In addition, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the change of mean arterial pressure from baseline at 10 minutes and 15 minutes postdrug administration, no statistical difference in the use of new-onset vasoactive agents or difficulty of intubation between groups. More patients in the etomidate group required non-red blood cell transfusions (16 [22%] vs. 8 [10%], p = 0.046). For patients who had adrenal testing performed, more patients in the etomidate group developed immediate adrenal insufficiency (13 [81%] of 16 vs. 5 [38%] of 13, p = 0.027). Serious adverse events were rare, 2 (3%) (cardiac arrest, hypotension) in ketamine/propofol admixture and 4 (5%) (hypertension, hypotension) in etomidate (p = 0.430).

Conclusion

In a heterogeneous critically ill population, ketamine/propofol admixture was not superior to a reduced dose of etomidate at preserving per-intubation hemodynamics and appears to be a safe alternative induction agent in the critically ill.

### The effect of etomidate on adrenal function in critical illness: a systematic review [^3e9cbdb9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although etomidate is a preferred anesthetic agent for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in critical illness, as an inhibitor of cortisol synthesis (11β-hydroxylase), it may be associated with adrenal dysfunction. The objectives are to review the effects of etomidate versus comparator anesthetics in critical illness for: primary outcome of mortality and secondary outcome of adrenal insufficiency (AI).

Methods

Studies were extracted using MEDLINE and SCOPUS, regardless of language, between 1983 and 2010 using the keywords etomidate, intensive care units (ICU), critical illness, intensive care, glucocorticoids, and adrenal insufficiency. Studies of single dose etomidate versus comparator anesthetics with outcomes of adrenal function and/or mortality were included. All reviewers performed electronic data searches. One reviewer extracted data, which were checked by the other reviewers. Authors of trials were contacted for supplemental data. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality. AI was defined per article.

Results

Two hundred sixty-three articles were screened, and 21 articles (19 independent data sets) were evaluated. Meta-analysis comparing etomidate versus non-etomidate anesthesia demonstrated an increased risk ratio (RR) for AI of 1.64 (range 1.52–1.77; 14 studies, 2,854 patients, P < 0.0001, I(2) = 88%) and an increased RR for mortality of 1.19 (1.10–1.30; 14 studies, 3,516 patients, P < 0.0001, I(2) = 64%). Significance of re-analysis for mortality within the subset of sepsis was maintained [RR 1.22 (1.11–1.35), 7 studies, n = 1,767, I(2) = 74%, P < 0.0001], but not for trials without sepsis [RR = 1.15 (0.97–1.35), 7 studies, n = 1,749, I(2) = 53%, P = 0.10].

Conclusions

There is an increased rate of AI and mortality in critically ill patients who received etomidate.

### Comparison of clinical outcome variables in patients with and without etomidate-facilitated anesthesia induction ahead of major cardiac surgery: a retrospective analysis [^9d5a27a7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Etomidate is considered an almost ideal induction agent because of the rapid onset and the predictable short duration of action in combination with minimal implications for the cardiovascular and pulmonary system. These effects and benefits are even more important in high-risk cardiac surgery patients. However, soon after licensing of etomidate for long-term sedation and anesthesia in 1972, an increased mortality in intensive care patients resulted in recommendations to stop long-term use. Even a single dose of etomidate inhibits transiently adrenal mitochondrial 11-β-hydroxylase activity with consecutive adrenal suppression. Ever since, intensive care, emergency, and anesthesia communities have been discussing the use of even a single dose of etomidate controversially. Various studies and meta-analyses found either an increased or an equal risk of mortality and risk variables after administration of etomidate in critically ill patients with sepsis. In trauma patients, an increased susceptibility to pneumonia is attributed to etomidate.

Etomidate is frequently used for anesthesia induction ahead of cardiac surgery. In this context, smaller studies showed that etomidate is associated with increased vasopressor requirements. Other authors report a relative adrenal insufficiency and deny an increase of vasopressor requirements. In a retrospective analysis of 3,127 patients receiving etomidate or propofol, Wagner and colleagues showed no increase in severe hypotension, in-hospital mortality, duration of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Further evidence for postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to adrenal insufficiency is of particular relevance for patients after on-pump cardiac surgery. It is well known that on-pump cardiac surgery per se is a risk factor for postoperative SIRS and infections. The objective of our study was to determine differences in key clinical outcome parameters following anesthesia induction with administration of etomidate or an alternative induction regime. Analyzed parameters for clinical outcome were sepsis-associated serum parameters, duration of mechanical ventilation, morbidity scores, renal failure, length of ICU stay, and ICU and hospital mortality.

### Effects of adding low-dose ketamine to etomidate on serum cortisol levels in critically ill cardiac patients: a randomized clinical trial [^01ccca34]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is frequently seen in critically ill cardiac patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to many causes, including the toxicity of anticoagulation therapy, stress ulceration, chronic peptic ulcers, or neoplasms. Sometimes, the management involves a gastroscopy or a colonoscopy, procedures that should be performed under sedation or general anesthesia. Hemodynamic stability is crucial in this specific cardiac population, and various anesthesia agents could be used.

Etomidate possesses unique, desirable properties such as rapid onset and short duration of action. In addition, it produces less apnea than barbiturates or propofol, no histamine release, infrequent allergic reactions, relative cardiovascular and respiratory stability, and neuroprotective effects, making it an attractive induction agent to facilitate this procedure. However, etomidate side effects also exist, including pain on injection, myoclonic movements during induction of general anesthesia, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, one of the most dangerous etomidate toxicity among anesthetic drugs is the dose-dependent inhibition of adrenal steroid synthesis that far outlasts its hypnotic action, and that may reduce survival of critically ill patients. It has been shown that in patients undergoing elective surgery, cortisol response to surgery was absent 48 h after administering a single bolus of etomidate.

Ketamine is a potent, multimodal dissociative anesthetic. It is one of the well-known N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonists. for several years, NMDA receptors were involved in the physiologic regulation of hormones released from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that ketamine is associated with increased postoperative serum cortisol levels. Low-dose ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) pretreatment was successfully used to reduce the Incidence and severity of etomidate-induced myoclonus. However, no available data about its role in controlling etomidate-induced adrenal suppression. So, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose ketamine pretreatment to etomidate on serum cortisol levels in anesthesia for critically ill cardiac patients.

We hypothesized that adding low dose ketamine to etomidate could be helpful to minimize the decrease in serum cortisol level in critically ill cardiac patients in comparison to a regimen including only etomidate.

### Effects of etomidate on complications related to intubation and on mortality in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone: a propensity score analysis [^3bc250a6]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Our study provides new data on the effect of etomidate in septic shock. In a post-hoc analysis of a multiple-center trial designed to evaluate the impact of hydrocortisone treatment in septic shock patients, the authors reported an increased death rate in patients that had been intubated with etomidate compared with other hypnotics. In contradiction, this increase was not statistically significant after adjustment in a multivariate analysis. Furthermore, Cuthbertson and colleagues showed that administration of etomidate was associated with increased mortality, but in only one of two multiple regression models. Despite higher severity of illness scores in patients intubated with etomidate compared with patients intubated with another hypnotic (Table 1), our study demonstrated a protective effect of etomidate on day-28 mortality using Cox regression. This effect was confirmed after matching (Figure 2).

The consequences of etomidate on long-term outcomes in the present study must be discussed in light of the co-administration of hydrocortisone. In the present study, hydrocortisone treatment was started within the first 12 hours after etomidate administration, earlier than in other studies. To date, studies have failed to demonstrate an improved outcome when supplementing etomidate treatment with corticosteroids and hydrocortisone is not recommended in every patient presenting septic shock but is suggested in those refractory to fluid challenge and dependent on high-dose vasopressors. However, because the inhibition of cortisol synthesis due to etomidate is immediate, hydrocortisone must be administered immediately after an etomidate bolus to counter its effects on steroid synthesis. Evaluating the role of hydrocortisone in patients who received etomidate may thus be interesting. To explain the impact of etomidate, it has also been reported that ketamine - which was the main drug used in the non-etomidate cohort - may have an anti-inflammatory effect in experimental sepsis models. Whether this anti-inflammatory effect may exacerbate late sepsis-induced immunosuppression, however, is unknown.

### Single-dose etomidate does not increase mortality in patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies [^632697ea]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of single-dose etomidate on mortality in patients with sepsis remains controversial. We systematically reviewed the literature to investigate whether a single dose of etomidate for rapid sequence intubation increased mortality in patients with sepsis.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies regarding the effect of single-dose etomidate on mortality in adults with sepsis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs.

Results

Eighteen studies (two RCTs and 16 observational studies) in 5,552 patients were included. Pooled analysis suggested that single-dose etomidate was not associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis in both the RCTs (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.84–1.72; P = 0.31; I(2) = 0%) and the observational studies (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97–1.13; P = 0.23; I(2) = 25%). When only adjusted RRs were pooled in five observational studies, RR for mortality was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.79–1.39; P = 0.748; I(2) = 71.3%). These findings also were consistent across all subgroup analyses for observational studies. Single-dose etomidate increased the risk of adrenal insufficiency in patients with sepsis (eight studies; RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.22–1.64; P < .00001).

Conclusions

Current evidence indicates that single-dose etomidate does not increase mortality in patients with sepsis. However, this finding largely relies on data from observational studies and is potentially subject to selection bias; hence, high-quality and adequately powered RCTs are warranted.

### Effects of etomidate on complications related to intubation and on mortality in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone: a propensity score analysis [^c240d275]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- In septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone, despite its cardiovascular tolerance, etomidate was not associated with a decrease of life-threatening complications following intubation in comparison with other hypnotics.

- Etomidate was associated with a longer period of shock and higher cumulative dose of hydrocortisone than patients intubated with another hypnotic.

- Interestingly, patients treated with etomidate and hydrocortisone presented a lower risk of day-28 mortality, both in unmatched and matched cohorts and multivariate analysis.

### Evidence-based emergency tracheal intubation [^fd94cf9d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Induction Medication

The administration of a sedative medication to induce anesthesia both facilitates the performance of laryngoscopy and intubation by the clinician and aims to ensure that the patient is unconscious and not experiencing discomfort from the procedure. Which induction medication patients receive for emergency tracheal intubation varies significantly by region and provider specialty. Etomidate and ketamine are the most common induction medications in many settings in the United States (,–). Because observational studies have reported propofol to be associated with higher rates of hypotension, recent research has focused on which of the induction medications associated with less hemodynamic instability (e.g. etomidate vs. ketamine) results in better patient outcomes. Etomidate has predictable dosing, rapid onset, a short duration of action, and excellent hemodynamic stability but blocks 11-β-hydroxylase in the adrenal glands, inhibiting cortisol production and causing adrenal insufficiency for up to 3 days. Whether the adrenal insufficiency caused by etomidate affects survival for critically ill adults remains uncertain. Numerous observational studies have reported receipt of etomidate to be associated with increased mortality. Several randomized trials have compared ketamine and etomidate for emergency tracheal intubation. Among 469 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in the KETASED (Ketamine versus Etomidate during Rapid Sequence Intubation) trial, the primary outcome of the maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score during the first 3 days after intubation was a mean of 9.6 in the ketamine group and 10.3 in the etomidate group (difference, −0.7; 95% CI, −1.4 to 0.0; P = 0.056). The incidence of 28-day mortality was 31% in the ketamine group and 35% in the etomidate group (absolute difference, −4 percentage points; 95% CI, −12 to 4). Among 801 critically ill adults in the single-center EvK trial (Etomidate versus Ketamine for Emergency Endotracheal Intubation: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial), death by 7 days occurred in 14.9% in the ketamine group and 22.7% in the etomidate group (absolute difference, −7.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −13.0 to −2.4; P = 0.005). Currently, experts disagree about whether the choice of induction medication during emergency tracheal intubation affects patient-centered outcomes. To address the remaining uncertainty about whether ketamine or etomidate results in better patient-centered outcomes, an ongoing multicenter randomized trial is comparing ketamine with etomidate with regard to 28-day mortality, survival to 12 months, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder among 2,364 critically ill adults in 14 EDs or ICUs (NCT04349501).

### Effects of adding low-dose ketamine to etomidate on serum cortisol levels in critically ill cardiac patients: a randomized clinical trial [^730b3348]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study shows that serum cortisol levels were reduced in both groups at 6 h postoperatively compared to preoperative levels. However, there was a marked reduction in the etomidate group than the ketamine/etomidate group, which was statistically significant. The difference in cortisol we observed could result from giving ketamine or giving less etomidate, and this trial cannot distinguish between the two. These findings meet that A. K. Pandey et al. reported that serum cortisol levels decrease significantly after etomidate administration while increasing significantly after ketamine administration.

Etomidate is well known to decrease serum cortisol levels. Several reports in the literature have described adrenocortical suppression after single-dose administration of etomidate with reversibility in normal healthy subjects. On the other hand, N. Hergovich et al. reported a significant increase in serum cortisol after ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, ketamine infusion has been described as a dose-dependent increase in serum cortisol level.

Etomidate-induced adrenocortical suppression could hinder survival in critically ill patients. On the other hand, increased serum cortisol after ketamine administration worsens surgical-induced stress response. So, we successfully used minimal-dose ketamine as a pretreatment to etomidate to counteract its effect on serum cortisol. Low-dose ketamine pretreatment to etomidate was used safely and successfully to reduce etomidate-induced myoclonus But, to our knowledge, no available studies about the role of ketamine in controlling etomidate-induced adrenocortical suppression.

The mechanism of anesthetic effects on the adrenocortical function and steroidogenesis remains unclear. However, etomidate-induced adrenocortical suppression has been explained by directly inhibiting the enzymes involved in cortisol biosynthesis, especially the final enzyme in the cascade, 11 β-hydroxylase. In their animal study, Besnier E et al. described an effect of ketamine on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis similar to that of etomidate. However, no clinical evidence supports these findings.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^d6f8af4e]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

In seriously ill patients, etomidate gives cardiovascular stability at induction of anaesthesia, but there is concern over possible adrenal suppression. Etomidate could reduce steroid synthesis and increase the need for vasopressor and steroid therapy. The outcome could be worse than in patients given other induction agents.

Methods

We reviewed 159 septic shock patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) over a 40-month period to study the association between induction agent and clinical outcome, including vasopressor, inotrope, and steroid therapy. From our records, we retrieved induction agent use; vasopressor administration at induction; vasopressor, inotrope, and steroid administration in the ICU; and hospital outcome.

Results

Hospital mortality was 65%. The numbers of patients given an induction agent were 74, etomidate; 25, propofol; 26, thiopental; 18, other agent; and 16, no agent. Vasopressor, inotrope, or steroid administration and outcome were not related to the induction agent chosen. Corticosteroid therapy given to patients who received etomidate did not affect outcome. Vasopressor therapy was required less frequently and in smaller doses when etomidate was used to induce anaesthesia. We found no evidence that either clinical outcome or therapy was affected when etomidate was used. Etomidate caused less cardiovascular depression than other induction agents in patients with septic shock.

Conclusion

Etomidate use for critically ill patients should consider all of these issues and not simply the possibility of adrenal suppression, which may not be important when steroid supplements are used.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^39b440f9]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Key messages

In this review of septic shock patients admitted to our intensive care unit:

- Vasopressor use and dose are not influenced by induction agent.

- Steroid use for vasopressor-resistant hypotension is not influenced by induction agent.

- Outcome related to pre-existing risk is not different if etomidate is used for induction.

- Outcome is not improved if steroids are administered to patients given etomidate.

- Induction with etomidate causes less cardiovascular depression than other induction agents.

### The incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock after the administration of etomidate [^853ff5b8]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, three-quarters of the patients with septic shock who received etomidate had relative adrenal insufficiency compared with only half of the patients with septic shock who did not receive etomidate.

A previous study showed that 54% (95% CI, 47–61%) of patients with septic shock had relative adrenal insufficiency, which is similar to our findings. In critically ill patients, a single dose of etomidate suppresses adrenal function for approximately 24 hours. Not surprisingly, we found that 76% (95% CI, 67–87%) of our patients with septic shock had relative adrenal insufficiency when tested after the administration of etomidate. Interestingly, in the study by Annane et al. in which low doses of hydrocortisone and fluodrocortisone reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency, 72 patients received etomidate preceding the stimulation test. Of these 72 patients, 68 patients (94%) had relative adrenal insufficiency.

Our study has some limitations. It was performed in a single tertiary medical center and has a retrospective design. Moreover, the number of patients who received etomidate was relatively small. The smallness of the sample size might account for absence of statistically significant differences in some of the variables, including baseline serum cortisol level and hospital mortality rate, between patients who did and did not receive etomidate. In spite of these limitations, our findings highlight the importance of the ongoing controversies and discussions about the use of etomidate as an induction agent for endotracheal intubation in the intensive care unit, particularly in patients with septic shock, because of the high frequency of relative adrenal insufficiency provoked by this medication. Two alternative approaches have been proposed to resolve the etomidate controversy. One option is to eliminate the use of etomidate altogether in patients with septic shock, and use alternative agents. The second option is to start treatment with corticosteroids after the administration of etomidate. Whether there is a real need to test for adrenal insufficiency, on the basis that our study shows that most patients with septic shock had relative adrenal insufficiency after the administration of etomidate, and what dose of corticosteroids should be administered are questions that must be studied in prospective trials.

### Evaluation of etomidate use and association with mortality compared with ketamine among critically ill patients [^32319b08]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Uncertainty remains regarding the risks associated with single-dose use of etomidate. Objectives: To assess the use of etomidate in critically ill patients and compare outcomes for patients who received etomidate versus ketamine. Methods: We assessed patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and were admitted to an ICU in the Premier Healthcare Database between 2008 and 2021. The exposure was receipt of etomidate on the day of IMV initiation, and the main outcome was hospital mortality. Using multivariable regression, we compared patients who received IMV within the first 2 days of hospitalization who received etomidate with propensity score-matched patients who received ketamine. We also assessed whether receipt of corticosteroids in the days after intubation modified the association between etomidate and mortality. Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,689,945 patients who received IMV, nearly half (738,855; 43.7%) received etomidate. Among those who received IMV in the first 2 days of hospitalization, we established 22,273 matched pairs administered either etomidate or ketamine. In the primary analysis, receipt of etomidate was associated with greater hospital mortality relative to ketamine (21.6% vs. 18.7%; absolute risk difference, 2.8%; 95% confidence interval, 2.1%, 3.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.28, 95% confidence interval, 1.21,1.34). This was consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. We found no attenuation of the association with mortality with receipt of corticosteroids in the days after etomidate use. Conclusions: Use of etomidate on the day of IMV initiation is common and associated with a higher odds of hospital mortality than use of ketamine. This finding is independent of subsequent treatment with corticosteroids.

### Effects of etomidate on complications related to intubation and on mortality in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone: a propensity score analysis [^cdde90d1]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of our study show that, first, intubation in septic shock patients was associated with a 36% rate of short-term life-threatening complications and that this rate was independent of the hypnotic used to facilitate the procedure. Second, to our surprise, in unmatched cohorts and after matching using a propensity score analysis, the administration of a single dose of etomidate in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone was associated with a lower risk of day-28 mortality (Table 3).

Potential confounding factors of the study must be addressed. First, this study was a single-center observational study in which the hypnotic used for induction of anesthesia was not randomized. Second, this was a small study subject to unmeasured or residual confounding (for example, patient heterogeneity, heterogeneity for intubation indication, protocol deviation), which is a limitation. The propensity score, however, is a tool to increase the accuracy of results in cohort studies. Moreover, external validity of observational studies may be higher than for randomized controlled trials. Third, because of the study design, we cannot provide detailed explanations about the protective mechanisms of etomidate on long-term outcomes.

### Newer agents for rapid sequence intubation: etomidate and rocuronium [^2e60d958]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The emergency airway management of children and adolescents with critical illnesses may necessitate rapid sequence intubation with a sedating and a neuromuscular blocking agent. Etomidate and rocuronium have become increasingly popular for the sedation and paralysis, respectively, of pediatric patients in rapid sequence intubation, and there are many advantages to the use of both agents. Both etomidate and rocuronium have a rapid onset of action, and both agents are relatively free of hemodynamic adverse effects. Etomidate does, however, suppress adrenal function, and consequently, its use in patients with septic shock is controversial. Rocuronium can produce optimal intubating conditions without the serious complications that can accompany succinylcholine. The available evidence supports the safety of etomidate and rocuronium in rapid sequence intubation but also suggests that more prospective studies are needed in pediatric patients.

### Medical suppression of hypercortisolemia in Cushing's syndrome with particular consideration of etomidate [^28655f78]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome is associated with excessive cortisol secretion by the adrenal gland or ectopic tumours and may result in diabetes, hypertension, and life-threatening infections with high mortality rates especially in the case of surgical resection. Although surgical resection is the treatment of choice, patients may benefit from preceding medical therapy. This may especially be useful as an adjunctive approach in emergency settings, if patients cannot undergo surgery, if surgery or radiotherapy fails, or if the tumour recurs. Medical therapy can be categorized in three different groups-inhibition of steroidogenesis, suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and antagonism of the glucocorticoid receptor. However, the majority of common drugs are not available for parenteral administration, which may evoke a management problem in emergency settings or in patients unable to tolerate oral medication. The carboxylated imidazole etomidate is a well known parenteral induction agent for general anaesthesia. Besides its hypnotic properties, etomidate also has α-adrenergic characteristics and inhibits the enzyme 11-deoxycortisol ß-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the final step of the conversion of cholesterol to cortisol. Adverse outcomes have been reported when used for sedation in septic or trauma patients probably by its interference with steroid homeostasis. However, its capability of inhibition of the 11-deoxycortisol ß-hydroxylase leads to suppression of cortisol secretion which has been demonstrated to be a useful tool in severe and complicated hypercortisolemia. Within this article, we review the data concerning different pharmacological approaches with particular consideration of etomidate in order to suppress steroidogenesis in patients with Cushing's syndrome.

### Etomidate, adrenal function, and mortality in critically ill patients [^f3119761]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In critically ill patients, induction with etomidate is hypothesized to be associated with an increased risk of mortality. Previous randomized studies suggest a modest trend toward an increased risk of death among etomidate recipients; however, this relationship has not been measured with great statistical precision. We aimed to test whether etomidate is associated with risk of hospital mortality and other clinical outcomes in critically ill patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2005, of 824 subjects requiring mechanical ventilation, who underwent adrenal function testing in the ICUs of 2 academic medical centers. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, comparing subjects given etomidate (n = 452) to those given an alternative induction agent (n = 372). The secondary outcome was diagnosis of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency following etomidate exposure.

Results

Overall mortality was 34.3%. After adjustment for age, sex, and baseline illness severity, the relative risk of death among the etomidate recipients was higher than that of subjects given an alternative agent (relative risk 1.20, 95% CI 0.99–1.45). Among subjects whose adrenal function was assessed within the 48 hours following intubation, the adjusted risk of meeting the criteria for critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency was 1.37 (95% CI 1.12–1.66), comparing etomidate recipients to subjects given another induction agent.

Conclusions

In this study of critically ill patients requiring endotracheal intubation, etomidate administration was associated with a trend toward a relative increase in mortality, similar to the collective results of smaller randomized trials conducted to date. If a small relative increased risk is truly present, though previous trials have been underpowered to detect it, in absolute terms the number of deaths associated with etomidate in this high-risk population would be considerable. Large, prospective controlled trials are needed to finalize the role of etomidate in critically ill patients.

### Effects of adding low-dose ketamine to etomidate on serum cortisol levels in critically ill cardiac patients: a randomized clinical trial [^3df1ed30]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Also, we found no significant difference between both groups regarding some adverse events (hypotension, bradycardia, apnea, and nausea/vomiting) or patient satisfaction, with favorable outcomes. These findings support the hypothesis elicited by the authors that low-dose ketamine pretreatment to etomidate can successfully counteract the impact of etomidate on serum cortisol without additional side effects or aggravation of stress response. This finding is met with Wu GN et al. as they found that ketamine reduced the Incidence and severity of myoclonus without any additional adverse effects.

Based on the current study's findings described by Wu GN et al. low-dose ketamine pretreatment to etomidate could be used safely and has favorable outcomes than etomidate alone. However, survival at day 7 is more remarkable with ketamine. This finding elicits a question about adding ketamine to etomidate to make a new preparation (Ketamine-etomidate) that can achieve the benefits of both drugs without any additional adverse effects.

Bruder et al. and Albert et al. reported that etomidate causes adrenal insufficiency; it was not shown to increase mortality in critically ill patients.

In our study, The total dose of etomidate was significantly different between the two groups. We were collecting the total dose of Etomidate However, the dose of etomidate as varied as the induction dose in the preplanned protocol because we show the effect of the low dose of ketamine and decrease of the total amount of etomidate in cortisol level and patient satisfaction.

Limitations

First, the limit of our study was the short time follow-up (only 6 h), so we could not test the reversibility of serum cortisol to baseline values after anesthesia and hospital and ICU stay and mortality rate assessment. Also, our study population was specific with unique characteristics; all are critically ill cardiac patients with acute anemia, which could limit our data's generalizability. Furthermore, the study is not powered for rare adverse events and several other adverse events related to etomidate and ketamine. And visual analog scores were not assessed as we depend on patient satisfaction only. In addition, lack of available data for comparison as this is the first clinical trial testing the effect of low-dose ketamine pretreatment to etomidate on postoperative cortisol levels. Despite these limitations, our study highlights helpful in decreasing the total dose of etomidate and diminishing the serum cortisol level after ketamine administration and low dose Etomidate.

### The effect of a bolus dose of etomidate on cortisol levels, mortality, and health services utilization: a systematic review [^ee823460]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To synthesize the evidence on the effect of a bolus dose of etomidate on adrenal function, mortality, and health services utilization compared with other induction agents used for rapid sequence intubation.

Methods

We developed a systematic search strategy and applied it to 10 electronic bibliographic databases. We hand searched journals; reviewed conference proceedings, gray literature, and bibliographies of relevant literature; and contacted content experts for studies comparing a bolus dose of etomidate with other induction agents. Retrieved articles were reviewed and data were abstracted with standardized forms. Data were pooled with the random-effects model if at least 4 clinically homogenous studies of the same design reported the same outcome measure. All other data were reported qualitatively.

Results

From 3,083 titles reviewed, 20 met our inclusion criteria. Pooled mean cortisol levels were lower in elective surgical patients induced with etomidate compared with those induced with other agents between 1 and 4 hours postinduction. The differences varied from 6.1 microg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4 to 9.9 microg/dL; P = 0.001) to 16.4 microg/dL (95% CI 9.7 to 23.1 microg/dL; P < .001). Two studies in critically ill patients reported significantly different cortisol levels up to 7 hours postinduction. None of the studies reviewed, nor our pooled estimate (odds ratio 1.14; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.60), showed a statistically significant effect on mortality. Only one study reported longer ventilator, ICU, and hospital lengths of stay in patients intubated with etomidate.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that etomidate suppresses adrenal function transiently without demonstrating a significant effect on mortality. However, no studies to date have been powered to detect a difference in hospital, ventilator, or ICU length of stay or in mortality.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^447e505e]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Most comment has been on the adverse effects of etomidate. However, this agent also has potential benefits. A formal randomised study would allow full evaluation but would be difficult to perform. We have a substantial database that can provide an indication of the value of such a study. To study the association between induction agent and (a) the use of vasopressor, inotrope, and steroids and (b) outcome, we retrospectively analysed the data from septic shock patients admitted over several years to a large general intensive care unit (ICU).

Etomidate and corticosteroid use — critically ill adults receiving rapid sequence intubation (RSI): We suggest against administering corticosteroids following RSI with etomidate for the purpose of counteracting etomidate-induced adrenal suppression (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). There were two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) giving hydrocortisone over 42 hours after etomidate — 200 mg/day (350 mg total) in one and 200 mg total in another — and mortality rates did not differ (28-d mortality: 13% [hydrocortisone] vs 12% [control]; ICU mortality 3% vs 5%). In a multicenter septic shock study, hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours for 5 days tapered for 6 days showed no difference in 28-day mortality between etomidate/hydrocortisone 46% and etomidate/placebo 40%. In propensity score–matched surgical patients, 582 who received etomidate/corticosteroids versus 1,023 who received etomidate and no steroids had in-hospital mortality 4.6% in each group (OR 1.01 [97.5% CI, 0.58–1.76], p = 0.97). In a retrospective septic shock cohort, 74 patients received etomidate and 43 (58%) received hydrocortisone (100 mg every 8 hr) with hospital mortality 32/43 [74%] versus 19/31 [61%], p = 0.12. For organ dysfunction, a three-arm RCT including methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg intravenous (IV) 2–4 minutes before etomidate found within-group decreased Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at 4 hours in groups 1 and 3 but not group 2, and SOFA scores at 24 hours were significantly lower in all three groups compared with baseline; two 42-hour hydrocortisone infusion trials reported decreasing proportions with SOFA 3 or 4 over time in both hydrocortisone and placebo groups with no difference between groups in median SOFA at 48 hours.

### Fentanyl versus placebo with ketamine and rocuronium for patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department: the FAKT study – A randomized clinical trial [^9804cfd6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department (ED) occurs frequently in patients with pathology that is undifferentiated at the time of the procedure. Because significant hemodynamic fluctuations may worsen patient outcomes, notably in conditions such as head injury, myocardial ischaemia, or aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, induction medications that reduce the incidence of both hypotension and hypertension are preferred.

Etomidate has frequently been the induction agent of choice in these circumstances but is not universally available internationally, and concerns regarding adrenal suppression have also limited its use. Previous recommendations against the use of ketamine have been challengedand a recent study has demonstrated an increase in its use.

Ketamine is less likely to cause hypotension than most other induction agents, but tachycardia and hypertension are frequently observed that may in themselves worsen patient outcomes, particularly in patients with conditions such as vasculopathies or intracranial or other critical bleeding. Fentanyl may be used as an adjunctive induction medication with ketamine to moderate hypertension following the induction of anesthesia, but it may increase the risk of hypotension, which is associated with increased mortality rates. It is also unclear whether the addition of fentanyl affects intubating conditions or patient‐centered outcomes such as mortality. A recent systematic review only identified one relevant trial, which was an observational study that demonstrated a risk of postinduction hypotension with fentanyl.

Clinicians need a clear understanding of the hemodynamic effects of ketamine with and without fentanyl in ED patients who require RSI, and as such we aimed to investigate whether the addition of fentanyl to a standardized anesthetic induction regimen of ketamine and rocuronium in adult patients undergoing RSI in the ED improved postinduction hemodynamic stability. The secondary aims were to investigate any effect on intubating conditions and 30‐day mortality.

### Effects of etomidate on complications related to intubation and on mortality in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone: a propensity score analysis [^2cb2f13d]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have reported that etomidate use for intubation in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone did not prevent short-term life-threatening complications following intubation despite its cardiovascular tolerance profile. Our study also suggests that patients co-treated with etomidate and hydrocortisone might not be associated with a worse outcome than another hypnotic used to facilitate intubation. Future randomized controlled studies should be performed to confirm this result and to evaluate early hydrocortisone treatment in septic shock patients who received etomidate.

### Etomidate injection, solution [^8f1f2ec5]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Elderly patients may require lower doses of etomidate than younger patients. Age-related differences in pharmacokinetic parameters have been observed in clinical studies (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Plasma Cortisol Levels: Induction doses of etomidate have been associated with reduction in plasma cortisol and aldosterone concentrations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). These have not been associated with changes in vital signs or evidence of increased mortality; however, where concern exists for patients undergoing severe stress, exogenous replacement should be considered.

The present study was aimed at assessing the short-term safety and the long-term outcomes of septic patients treated with etomidate versus another induction drug for intubation. We designed the present propensity-score-driven study to evaluate, in septic shock patients, first the incidence of immediate life-threatening complications after intubation and second the long-term outcome according to the hypnotic used. The propensity score allowed us to match patients according to their probably to receive etomidate or not and to adjust for confounding factors in the present observational study.

### The effects of etomidate on adrenal responsiveness and mortality in patients with septic shock [^2fe35039]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

Use of etomidate in the critically ill is controversial due to its links with an inadequate response to corticotropin and potential for excess mortality. In a septic shock population, we tested the hypotheses that etomidate administration induces more non-responders to corticotropin and increases mortality and that hydrocortisone treatment decreases mortality in patients receiving etomidate.

Methods

An a-priori sub-study of the CORTICUS multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of hydrocortisone in septic shock. Use and timing of etomidate administration were collected. Endpoints were corticotropin response and all-cause 28-day mortality in patients receiving etomidate.

Measurements and Main Results

Five hundred patients were recruited, of whom 499 were analysable; 96 (19.2%) were administered etomidate within the 72 h prior to inclusion. The proportion of non-responders to corticotropin was significantly higher in patients who were given etomidate in the 72 h before trial inclusion than in other patients (61.0 vs. 44.6%, P = 0.004). Etomidate therapy was associated with a higher 28-day mortality in univariate analysis (P = 0.02) and after correction for severity of illness (42.7 vs. 30.5%; P = 0.06 and P = 0.03) in our two multi-variant models. Hydrocortisone administration did not change the mortality of patients receiving etomidate (45 vs. 40%).

Conclusions

The use of bolus dose etomidate in the 72 h before study inclusion is associated with an increased incidence of inadequate response to corticotropin, but is also likely to be associated with an increase in mortality. We recommend clinicians demonstrate extreme caution in the use of etomidate in critically ill patients with septic shock.

Analgesics and sedatives — ketamine and etomidate considerations state that traditionally ketamine has been considered contraindicated in patients with raised ICP because it increases cerebral blood flow and might increase ICP further, but a level III recommendation on ketamine was not made because the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for patients was not indicated; for etomidate, use for ICP control is described as largely of historical interest since other sedatives and analgesics that do not suppress adrenal function are available, although a single dose of etomidate is commonly used for intubation in pediatric traumatic brain injury, and the clinical investigators do not believe that recommendations from adult guidelines about analgesics, sedatives, and neuromuscular blockade can be used to guide treatment decisions in children.

### The incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock after the administration of etomidate [^fc358d3b]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Relative adrenal insufficiency, defined as a blunted increase in cortisol levels after stimulation with adrenocorticotrophic hormone, is common in patients with septic shock, and replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone has been shown to reduce the risk of death in this setting. Etomidate, an induction agent widely used to facilitate endotracheal intubation, is an imidazole derivative that reversibly blocks adrenocortical synthesis when administered intravenously as a continuous infusion or a single bolus. A single dose of etomidate is a major risk factor for the development of relative adrenal insufficiency for at least 24 hours after its administration. Because most patients with septic shock require endotracheal intubation, and the influence of etomidate administration on the incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock has not been formally investigated, the objective of this study was to determine the incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock after etomidate administration. We hypothesised that the administration of etomidate increases the incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in patients with septic shock.

Results

Population characteristics

During the study period, among 1,632 patients admitted to the ICU, 331 presented septic shock during their stay. Among these 331 patients, 229 either developed septic shock > 48 hours after intubation, did not have a cosyntropin test or data could not be extracted from the charts. Thus, 102 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed; 60 in the etomidate cohort and 42 in the non-etomidate cohort. The hypnotics used to induce anesthesia for intubation in the non-etomidate cohort were ketamine (n = 18), propofol (n = 10), thiopental (n = 13) or none (n = 1). The nonabdominal source of sepsis, higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment severity scores were more frequently observed in the etomidate cohort (Table 1).

### Rapid sequence induction: an international survey [^306b6aec]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Opioids were not considered as a part of classical RSI. However, opioids during RSI reduce the cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and can reduce the dose of the induction agent. Currently, up to 92% of physicians use opioids during RSI. This is in concordance with the results of our survey, where opioids were administered during RSI in 66.0%/54.9% of cases and sometimes administered in 19.6%/25.7% of cases (adult/paediatric). Overall use of opioids in RSI was 85.6% in adults and 80.5% in paediatric patients.

In classical RSI, the drug of choice for anaesthesia induction was thiopentone in combination with suxamethonium. This has changed over the past two decades. In 2001, thiopentone was still used in 88% of RSIbut now propofol is the drug of choice for induction of anaesthesia for RSI. This change is also seen in our survey: propofol was the drug of choice for RSI in haemodynamically stable patients in 90.6%/82.8% of cases (adult/paediatric).

Currently, there are two drugs (ketamine, etomidate) that are considered safer during the induction of anaesthesia in haemodynamically unstable patients, or in patients with a high risk of hypotension. Etomidate is linked with the suppression of corticosteroid synthesis after administration and could be dangerous in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Unlike other intravenous anaesthetics, ketamine can even lead to the elevation of blood pressure and heart rate. The majority of respondents selected ketamine 42.3%/58.4% (adult/paediatric) and etomidate 37.9%/16.8% in haemodynamically unstable patients for RSI. Propofol or thiopentone were selected in 29.5%/29.7% and 8.4% /8.5% (adult/paediatric) of cases. However, as these drugs can lead to a further deterioration of the circulatory status, many consider them to be dangerous in haemodynamically unstable patients.

### Comparison of clinical outcome variables in patients with and without etomidate-facilitated anesthesia induction ahead of major cardiac surgery: a retrospective analysis [^49fc7ab8]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In patients who already have sepsis, the discussion of whether single-dose etomidate increases mortality risk is controversial. Some retrospective analyses suggested an increased risk of mortality in septic patients who received etomidate for intubation. In contrast to these reports, other studies deny an increased risk of mortality for septic patients who received etomidate. It could be hypothesized that cardiac surgery patients with severe comorbidities and impaired ventricular function should more likely have etomidate-triggered adrenal insufficiency and consecutive poor outcome. However, in our cohort, we found no evidence that etomidate leads to increased early or late ICU mortality. Even the total in-hospital mortality showed no difference. Moreover, neither the total length of stay in the ICU nor the total hospital stay differs significantly between the etomidate and the non-etomidate group. Patients of the non-etomidate group show a significantly higher ICU discharge on the first postoperative day. However, on day 2, the discharge rate is already balanced and remains balanced until the end of observation on day 5. The higher rate of emergency interventions in the etomidate group might be causative for a lower discharge rate on postoperative day 1. This theory is supported by the significantly higher peak of CK in the etomidate group which might be higher after myocardial infarction and emergency cardiac surgery. In regard to re-admission to the ICU, our study found no evidence that etomidate given ahead of cardiac surgery leads to a higher ICU re-admission rate. Given all of the postoperative items, the etomidate group showed no statistically significant or clinically relevant poorer outcome in any of the observed variables.

Etomidate with corticosteroids after rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in critically ill adults — panelists do not recommend using corticosteroids when etomidate is used for RSI for the purpose of counteracting etomidate-induced adrenal suppression, and note "The recommendation is exclusive to patients already receiving corticosteroids or those requiring corticosteroids for other indications". In cirrhotic patients with septic shock randomized to hydrocortisone or placebo, ventilator-free days (mean: 3.6 ± 5.6 vs 0.2 ± 0.4, p = 0.04), vasopressor-free days (mean: 4.6 ± 6.9 vs 1.1 ± 3.3, p = 0.05), change in norepinephrine dose between day 1 and 3 (mean: −0.1 ± 0.26 vs 0.31 ± 0.36, p = 0.01), and ICU length of stay (mean: 12.6 ± 7.8 d vs 9.4 ± 5.8 d, p = 0.06) differed between etomidate/hydrocortisone and etomidate/placebo, but "These findings were not evident in other studies". In other studies there was "no difference in ventilator days (median: 2 d [range 1–10] vs 4 d [range 1–10])", and no difference for duration of norepinephrine administration (median: 2 d [range 1–10] vs 8 d [range 4–17]), time-to-resolution of shock (mean: 3 d [95% CI, 2.5–3.5] vs 3.8 d [95% CI, 3.1–4.4], p = 0.42), or ICU length of stay (mean: 4 d [range 1–10] vs 8 d [range 4–17]); additionally, "None of the trials documented adverse events of corticosteroids (i.e., infection)". Evidence gaps state that further research focused on corticosteroid administration with etomidate "is likely futile", though populations "including those with cirrhosis and septic shock and patients who have undergone noncardiac surgery" may merit targeted prospective study.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^813e9d0a]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Anesthetic agents in cardiovascular disease — etomidate and ketamine — are characterized as follows: etomidate is a short-acting hypnotic with gamma-aminobutyric acid–like effects that results in the least cardiovascular depression of all anesthetics, does not appear to elevate plasma histamine or cause histamine release when administered in recommended doses, and is commonly used to induce anesthesia (0.2–0.6 mg/kg over 30–60 seconds) in patients with cardiovascular disease but is not generally used to maintain anesthesia because it suppresses adrenal cortical function; ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist with both direct negative inotropic effects and central sympathetic stimulation and inhibition of neuronal catecholamine uptake, and while these latter effects can result in stable hemodynamics during induction, in patients with significant LV dysfunction they may be inadequate to overcome the negative inotropy, resulting in deterioration in cardiac performance and cardiovascular instability.

### Increased risk of adrenal insufficiency following etomidate exposure in critically injured patients… [^9fa29415]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

In 2002, Annane and colleagues1 published their findings on the effect of low-dose hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone acetate replacement in patients with septic shock. The authors demonstrated that the incidence of adrenal insufficiency was substantially underreported and, when left untreated in the septic shock population, was associated with significant mortality. Treatment of these critically ill patients with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone resulted in a significant reduction in mortality. Numerous subsequent studies attempting to support or refute these findings have resulted in the inclusion of intravenous corticosteroids for patients with AI as a recommendation in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. 2–5 The remaining debate now centers on what test is most appropriate to diagnose AI and application of these recommendations to other appropriate populations. 6–8.

In the trauma and critically ill patient, this drug has gained popularity for its rapid onset of action, cardiovascular stability, and limited respiratory depression. Its well-established adrenal suppression, has, however, brought the use of etomidate into question. 17, 34 In the present study, we identified exposure to etomidate as a significant risk factor for the development of AI. In fact, of all those factors evaluated in the present study, etomidate use appears to be the only modifiable risk factor identified. Following a report by Ledingham and Watt35 documenting an increase in AI and mortality among multitrauma patients receiving etomidate infusions, the use of this agent has been restricted to single-bolus administration. 34 Using etomidate in this single-dose manner has been associated with less risk of AI and observation of only a transient effect.

35 In fact, recent data by Cohan and colleagues14 noted that the effects were not observed after the first postinjury day. Moreover, this risk appears to remain significant regardless of time between exposure to etomidate and CST diagnosis of AI. Until this increased risk of developing impaired adrenal function has been refuted by a randomized, controlled trial, the routine use of etomidate in the critically injured patient should be reevaluated and alternative agents should be considered.

Medications

A variety of medications are available to assist with the rapid sequence of adult trauma patients, but the medications can be broken down into two broad categories of induction agents and paralytics. Options for induction agents include sedative/hypnotics (ie, propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, high dose ketamine, high dose benzodiazepines, very high dose opioids), amnestic agents (lower dose benzodiazepines), analgesic agents (ketamine, opioids), with etomidate used most often. Etomidate is dosed at 0.3 mg/kg IV for an induction dose. Etomidate has advantageous characteristics including rapid onset and limited effect on hemodynamics. The biggest concern with etomidate is adrenal suppression and subsequent decrease in serum cortisol; however, this alteration in lab values has not been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Ketamine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg intravenously, is another option as an induction agent for rapid sequence intubation in trauma patients. It has characteristics that are potentially beneficial in trauma patients including rapid onset, analgesia, amnesia, and sympathomimetic effects and has been shown to have clinical outcomes comparable to etomidate for rapid sequence intubation

Paralytic agents include depolarizing (succinylcholine) and non-depolarizing (rocuronium, pancuronium, vecuronium) agents. Succinylcholine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg intravenously, is the most common paralytic agent used in trauma intubations. It has a rapid onset and short half-life, making it an ideal agent if there is a failed intubation, allowing quick return of spontaneous respirations. The most common non-depolarizing agent is rocuronium, dosed at 1.2 mg/kg intravenously, and approximates the rapid onset of succinylcholine but has a longer duration of action. Although there are not many direct comparisons of the two drugs, rocuronium has fewer side effects and contraindications and may be associated with lower mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. As mentioned previously, push-dose pressors may be used to treat or prevent hypotension around the time of intubation. The two most common agents used are epinephrine and phenylephrine, but epinephrine has the advantage of having both alpha and beta effects. A dilute epinephrine solution may be administered in 5 to 20 μg doses every 2 to 5 minutes to achieve desired effect.

### Comparison of clinical outcome variables in patients with and without etomidate-facilitated anesthesia induction ahead of major cardiac surgery: a retrospective analysis [^28baa672]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is well known that etomidate may cause adrenal insufficiency. However, the clinical relevance of adrenal suppression after a single dose of etomidate remains vague. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the administration of a single dose of etomidate or an alternative induction regime ahead of major cardiac surgery and clinical outcome parameters associated with adrenal suppression and onset of sepsis.

Methods

The anesthesia and intensive care unit (ICU) records from patients undergoing cardiac surgery over five consecutive years (2008 to 2012) were retrospectively analyzed. The focus of the analysis was on clinical parameters like mortality, ventilation hours, renal failure, and sepsis-linked serum parameters. Multivariate analysis and Cox regression were applied to derive the results.

Results

In total, 3,054 patient records were analyzed. A group of 1,775 (58%) patients received a single dose of etomidate; 1,279 (42%) patients did not receive etomidate at any time. There was no difference in distribution of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical score, duration of surgery, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. Postoperative data showed no significant differences between the two groups in regard to mortality (6.8% versus 6.4%), mean of mechanical ventilation hours (21.2 versus 19.7), days in the ICU (2.6 versus 2.5), hospital days (18.7 versus 17.4), sepsis-associated parameters, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and incidence of renal failure. Administration of etomidate showed no significant influence (P = 0.6) on hospital mortality in the multivariate Cox analysis.

Conclusions

This study found no evidence for differences in key clinical outcome parameters based on anesthesia induction with or without administration of a single dose of etomidate. In consequence, etomidate might remain an acceptable option for single-dose anesthesia induction.

### Outcomes of etomidate in severe sepsis and septic shock [^70aaa413]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The use of single-dose etomidate to facilitate intubation in critically ill patients has recently been debated given its suppression of steroidogenesis with possible resultant adverse outcomes. Our objective was to assess the effects of single-dose etomidate used during rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) on various measures of outcome, such as mortality, vasopressor use, corticosteroid use, ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS), and number of ventilator days.

Methods

A retrospective 18-month cohort study was performed in a multidisciplinary ICU of an academic tertiary care institution. Consecutive patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who were intubated and mechanically ventilated were identified and grouped as having received single-dose etomidate during intubation or not. Hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, number of ventilator days, corticosteroid use, vasopressor use, and demographic and clinical variables were recorded.

Results

Two hundred twenty-four patients were identified; 113 had received etomidate. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores in the etomidate and nonetomidate groups were 21.3 ± 8.1 and 21.9 ± 8.3, respectively (P = 0.62). The relative risks for mortality and vasopressor use were 0.92 (CI, 0.74–1.14; P = 0.51) and 1.16 (CI, 0.9–1.51; P = 0.31), respectively, in the etomidate group. There were no significant differences in ICU-LOS (mean, 14 vs 12 days; P = 0.31) or number of ventilator days (mean, 11 vs 8 days; P = 0.13) between the etomidate and nonetomidate groups, respectively. The relative risk for corticosteroid use in the etomidate group was 1.34 (CI, 1.11–1.61; P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis using logistic regression demonstrated no significant association of etomidate with mortality (OR, 0.9; CI, 0.45–1.83; P = 0.78).

Conclusion

Single-dose etomidate used during RSI in critically ill patients with severe sepsis and septic shock was not associated with increased mortality, vasopressor use, ICU-LOS, or number of ventilator days. Patients intubated with etomidate had an increased incidence of subsequent corticosteroid use, with no difference in outcomes.

### Effects of etomidate on complications related to intubation and on mortality in septic shock patients treated with hydrocortisone: a propensity score analysis [^ae7ac912]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study setting and patients

A cohort, observational study was performed in an adult ICU of a university hospital from June 2006 until December 2009. Data were extracted from prospective studies conducted in our ICU and previous databases. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Comité de Gestion et d'Organisation de l'Anesthésie Réanimation, Montpellier University Hospital) and, in accordance with French law, informed consent was waived. We adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

Etomidate blocks cortisol synthesis primarily by inhibiting the activity of 11β-hydroxylase for at least 24 to 48 hours. Therefore, to describe the potential impact of etomidate on early and late outcome in septic shock patients, consecutive patients were eligible if they had received an induction agent for endotracheal intubation within the first 48 hours of septic shock onset. Patients were treated according to international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock but all received hydrocortisone. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, age < 18 years, moribund patients, immunosuppression, and long-term or short-term corticosteroid treatment within the past 4 weeks. A cosyntropin stimulation test with 250 μg cosyntropin was performed in all septic shock patients. A 50 mg intravenous bolus of hydrocortisone was then administered every 6 hours, beginning within the first 12 hours of septic shock, for at least 5 days, tapered and stopped in 5 days according to the reversal of shock. Patients were grouped as those having received etomidate for intubation (etomidate cohort) versus those subjects having received another hypnotic (non-etomidate cohort).

Definitions

Septic shock was defined by evidence of infection and a systemic response to infection, in addition to systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, despite adequate fluid replacement, or a need for vasopressors for at least 1 hour, according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference Committee criteria. Nonresponse to the cosyntropin stimulation test using an immunoradiology assay (SP2100; Beckmancoulter SAS, Roissy, France) was defined by a delta cortisol (60 minutes after 250 μg cosyntropin) < 9 μg/dl. CIRCI was defined by a delta cortisol (60 minutes after 250 μg cosyntropin) < 9 μg/dl or a baseline plasma cortisol level < 10 μg/l.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^61bb19b5]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Tracheal intubation in critically ill patients can cause immediate and severe life-threatening complications. Patients with hypotension are particularly at risk and are more likely to die after tracheal intubation than are normotensive patients. Hypotension at induction is a common feature in anaesthesia-related deaths. Etomidate may be especially useful in critically ill and hypotensive patients because it has little effect on systemic blood pressure. After etomidate, fewer patients required vasopressor agents at induction and less cardiovascular intervention was required than in patients given propofol, thiopental, or other agents. Etomidate appears to cause less cardiovascular depression than propofol or thiopental in critically ill septic patients.

We recognise the limitations of retrospective reviews. A prospective study with randomisation of induction agent might address some of these limitations, but such a study may be difficult to undertake. WardWatcher™ is an excellent, nationally co-ordinated and audited ICU database, which provides the best possible method of obtaining data and assessment, short of undertaking a prospective study. In our review, some patients may have been misdiagnosed with septic shock and others may have been missed if the diagnosis of septic shock was not entered into the WardWatcher™ database. However, we believe ascertainment bias was small. We identified 208 septic shock patients who required tracheal intubation. This accounts for 10% of the patients admitted for intensive care during the review period, giving a prevalence of septic shock similar to other studies. Case notes were not available for 16 patients, and an additional 23 patients were excluded from analysis because of missing data or because induction of anaesthesia had occurred in another hospital. Twenty-six of these patients (67%) died and 36 received vasoactive therapy (92%). It is therefore unlikely that data from the missing patients would significantly alter the main findings of our review.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and international association for trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) society recommendations: paper 2: postoperative and intensive care recommendations [^c5c79807]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding intubation drugs for trauma ICU intubation, there is conflicting evidence, with some studies showing no overt outcome difference between ketamine, etomidate, or propofol, whereas other studies, more likely to include septic patients found etomidate to have higher mortality, but this was not found in purely trauma‐populations. In septic ICU populations, etomidate should be avoided, whereas ketamine is safe. Ketamine–propofol (Ketofol) combination was as safe as lower‐dose etomidate in the trauma ICU. Propofol alone was associated with more adverse events in one of the largest studies in trauma, except when dose reductions were used. German guidelines prefer ketamine over propofol or etomidate as do the recent UK guidelines, in combination with fentanyl and with rocuronium as the paralytic agent of choice.

### Duration of adrenal inhibition following a single dose of etomidate in critically ill patients [^63189c28]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incidence and duration of adrenal inhibition induced by a single dose of etomidate in critically ill patients.

Design

Prospective, observational cohort study.

Setting

Three intensive care units in a university hospital.

Patients

Forty critically ill patients without sepsis who received a single dose of etomidate for facilitating endotracheal intubation.

Measurements and Main Results

Serial serum cortisol and 11beta-deoxycortisol samples were taken at baseline and 60 min after corticotropin stimulation test (250 microg 1–24 ACTH) at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after etomidate administration. Etomidate-related adrenal inhibition was defined by the combination of a rise in cortisol less than 250 nmol/l (9 microg/dl) after ACTH stimulation and an excessive accumulation of serum 11beta-deoxycortisol concentrations at baseline. At 12 h after etomidate administration, 32/40 (80%) patients fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for etomidate-related adrenal insufficiency. This incidence was significantly lower at 48 h (9%) and 72 h (7%). The cortisol to 11beta-deoxycortisol ratio (F/S ratio), reflecting the intensity of the 11beta-hydroxylase enzyme blockade, improved significantly over time.

Conclusions

A single bolus infusion of etomidate resulted in wide adrenal inhibition in critically ill patients. However, this alteration was reversible by 48 h following the drug administration. The empirical use of steroid supplementation for 48 h following a single dose of etomidate in ICU patients without septic shock should thus be considered. Concomitant serum cortisol and 11beta-deoxycortisol dosages are needed to provide evidence for adrenal insufficiency induced by etomidate in critically ill patients.

### Steroidogenesis in the adrenal dysfunction of critical illness: impact of etomidate [^130ffc92]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics

Table 2 shows patient characteristics on admission according to etomidate treatment. Twenty-one percent of patients had received etomidate for intubation within 72 hours before blood sampling and an ACTH test. No group differences were found, except for more-frequent respiratory failure as a reason for admission in the etomidate group. Mortality was unaffected by etomidate. Of note, most patients had received hydrocortisone.

Etomidate in sepsis and nonsepsis

Table 3 shows characteristics according to underlying condition and etomidate use. Although all patients were initially intubated and mechanically ventilated, some of them had been extubated before the ACTH test, and the time from admission to the test was shorter in etomidate than in non-etomidate intubated patients. The patients with sepsis had a lower MAP and higher norepinephrine dose at the time of the ACTH test. Etomidate was associated with a lower MAP, particularly in nonsepsis, and higher norepinephrine requirements.

### Effect of vitamin C on adrenal suppression following etomidate for rapid sequence induction in trauma patients: a randomized clinical trial [^108ba25d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

According to the majority of research done as well as our investigation, it is evident that injecting vitamin C prior to injecting etomidate in the induction stage of intubation can avoid adrenal inhibition and reduce the amount of serum cortisol level suppression caused by etomidate. Although some studies have recommended alternative medications such as midazolam in place of etomidate, this medication is still the first choice for unstable trauma patients due to the minimal adverse effects of etomidate.

However, due to the numerous side effects of corticosteroids, more emphasis is placed on vitamin C, which, in addition to its antioxidant effects, can prevent adrenal inhibition by etomidate.

### Etomidate [^ae6bb67c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Intravenous etomidate should be administered only by persons trained in the administration of general anesthetics and in the management of complications encountered during the conduct of general anesthesia.

Because of the hazards of prolonged suppression of endogenous cortisol and aldosterone production, this formulation is not intended for administration by prolonged infusion.

Pediatric Neurotoxicity:

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans (see PRECAUTIONS /Pregnancy, Pediatric Use, ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOG Y).

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### Effect of induction agent on vasopressor and steroid use, and outcome in patients with septic shock [^59fca9f3]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Results

Complete data were available for analysis in 159 patients. The agents (number of patients) used to induce anaesthesia were etomidate (74), propofol (25), thiopental (26), midazolam (14), ketamine (1), and fentanyl (1). Two patients had inhalational induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane because of coexisting acute upper airway obstruction. Sixteen patients received no agent to induce anaesthesia; 14 of these had tracheal intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac arrest, and two patients had awake fibreoptic intubation. We combined the data for patients given midazolam, ketamine, fentanyl, or inhalational induction into a group entitled 'other'. The median doses (range) of agents administered were etomidate, 12 (5 to 20) mg; propofol, 60 (20 to 180) mg; thiopental, 200 (75 to 450) mg; and midazolam, 2 (2 to 3) mg. Eighty-four patients were intubated in the ICU and 75 were intubated in areas outside the ICU, mostly in an operating theatre or the emergency department. One hundred forty-nine (94%) patients were intubated within six hours of ICU admission and eight others were intubated within 24 hours of admission. All 159 patients were intubated because of septic shock; 153 (96%) were intubated within 24 hours of the onset of shock, an additional five were intubated within 48 hours, and in one patient tracheal intubation occurred 78 hours after the onset of sepsis.

### Steroidogenesis in the adrenal dysfunction of critical illness: impact of etomidate [^3fdd34f1]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patient population and study design

This prospective observational study was carried out in a mixed surgical/medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital from December 2004 to March 2007. Dutch legislation waives the need for informed consent as the ACTH test is routinely performed in the unit for clinical reasons, no extra blood is drawn for this study on precursors, and the provided results are treated anonymously. We included critically ill patients older than 18 years, admitted to the ICU, and being suspected of CIRCI. Suspicion of CIRCI was based on > 6 hours hypotension (< 100 mm Hg systolic) requiring repeated fluid challenges and/or vasopressor/inotropic treatment in the ICU. Patients were excluded if they had a history of HPA axis disease and if they had taken glucocorticosteroids in the preceding 24 hours. Patients were otherwise treated by attending intensivists in rotating shifts, in this 30-bed unit, admitting about 1,500 patients annually. Patients were admitted either after surgery or from medical wards. In our hospital, etomidate is used to facilitate intubation in the operating/recovery room or ICU, at a dose of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg; propofol (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) and/or midazolam (5 to 15 mg) are used as alternatives, at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Risk factors for mortality in septic patients who received etomidate [^0871c808]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterize risk factors for mortality in septic patients who received etomidate for rapid sequence intubation.

Materials and Methods

This study was a retrospective cohort conducted at a large, tertiary, urban, academic medical center that included patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who received etomidate between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012.

Results

A total of 169 patients were included with similar baseline characteristics. There were more men in the nonsurvivor group than in the survivor group (67.1% vs 50.6%, P = 0.03). Septic shock occurred in 91.5% of nonsurvivors and 69% of survivors (P < .01). Nonsurvivors also had a higher initial lactate of (5.1 ± 4.3 mmol/L vs 3.6 ± 3.4 mmol/L, P = 0.02) and more vasopressor therapy (91.5% vs 69%, P < .01), required a higher number of vasopressors (2.2 ± 1.1 vs 1.3 ± 1, P < .01), and were administered hydrocortisone (53.7% vs 34.5%, P = 0.01). Abdominal source of sepsis (P = 0.048) and number of vasopressors (P = 0.01) were predictive of 30-day mortality.

Conclusion

An alternative sedative induction agent may be considered for use in rapid sequence intubation in patients on multiple vasopressors or with abdominal source of infection.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^67066161]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Etomidate — emergency control of severe hypercortisolism and dosing: Etomidate is the only medical treatment available for severe hypercortisolism in seriously ill patients of any age who are not immediate surgical candidates and who cannot take oral medications, and it is useful in emergencies with acute unmanageable symptoms such as respiratory failure or severe psychosis as an effective bridge to other therapies. Subhypnotic doses rapidly decrease steroidogenesis within 12–24 hours; because administration requires intravenous infusion, patients should be managed in an intensive care unit and preparations containing propylene glycol may warrant a central venous line. Measuring cortisol every 4–6 hours is required, and clinicians can titrate infusion to a stable serum cortisol between 10 and 20 μg/dL (280–560 nmol/L) or use a block-and-replace strategy. A loading dose of 3–5 mg is followed by continuous infusion of 0.03–0.10 mg/kg/h (2.5–3.0 mg/h), with sedation not reported at these doses but dose reduction potentially needed if renal failure occurs.

### Etomidate use is associated with less hypotension than ketamine for emergency department sepsis intubations: a NEAR cohort study [^49040066]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study were 1) to describe the current use of etomidate and other induction agents in patients with sepsis and 2) to compare adverse events between etomidate and ketamine in sepsis.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study of the prospective National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR) data set. Descriptive statistics were used to report the distribution of induction agents used in patients with sepsis. Adverse events were compared using bivariate analysis, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted using a propensity score-adjusted analysis of etomidate versus ketamine.

Results

A total of 531 patients were intubated for sepsis, and the majority (71%) were intubated with etomidate as the initial induction agent. Etomidate was less frequently used in sepsis patients than nonsepsis patients (71% vs. 85%, odds ratio [OR] = 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4 to 0.5). Sepsis patients had a greater risk of adverse events, and vasopressor therapy was required for 25% of patients after intubation. Postprocedure hypotension was higher between those intubated for sepsis with ketamine versus etomidate (74% vs. 50%, OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.9 to 4.5). After confounding by indication in the propensity score-adjusted analysis was accounted for, ketamine was associated with more postprocedure hypotension (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1 to 6.7). No difference in emergency department deaths was observed.

Conclusions

Etomidate is used less frequently in sepsis patients than nonsepsis patients, with ketamine being the most frequently used alternative. Ketamine was associated with more postprocedural hypotension than etomidate. Future clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal induction agent in patients with sepsis.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^5ca7e994]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Induction agent selection — critically ill adults undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI): We suggest there is no difference between etomidate and other induction agents administered for RSI with respect to mortality or the incidence of hypotension or vasopressor use in the peri-intubation period and through hospital discharge (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Supporting evidence includes a Cochrane review that analyzed six studies (n = 772 patients) and did not show increased mortality with etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) when used as a single dose for RSI compared with other agents, OR 1.17 (95% CI, 0.86–1.60). Observational trauma data found no mortality difference between regimens, with 19% mortality in each group (OR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.51–1.87), and an institutional before-and-after change from etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) to ketamine (1–2 mg/kg) showed no difference in hospital mortality (20% vs 17%; OR 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92–2.16). A meta-analysis of 29 studies reported an increased overall mortality rate with etomidate (rr = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04–1.29), although only 5 were RCTs, and overall, these data are limited by selection bias, which may affect both mortality and the severity of illness correlation.

### Ketamine and etomidate down-regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in an endotoxemic mouse model [^84fa76e0]. Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We compared the effects of etomidate and ketamine on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during sepsis.

Methods

Mice (n = 5/group) were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (10mg/kg) and 6h later randomized to receive ketamine (100mg/kg), etomidate (30mg/kg), or saline. At two time points (12 and 48h), messenger RNA levels of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone, pituitary proopiomelanocortin, and four adrenal enzymes (P450 side-chain cleavage, 3β-hydroxysteroid deshydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, and 11β-hydroxylase) were measured by in situ hybridization (results are presented as optical density), and plasma levels of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropin hormones were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (mean ± SD).

Results

At 12h, lipopolysaccharide induced an overexpression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (32 ± 5 vs. 18 ± 6, P < 0.01), proopiomelanocortin (21 ± 3 vs. 8 ± 0.9, P < 0.0001), P450 side-chain cleavage (32 ± 4 vs. 23 ± 10, P < 0.05), 21-hydroxylase (17 ± 5 vs. 12 ± 2, P < 0.05), and 11β-hydroxylase (11 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 0.5, P = 0.001), and an elevation of corticosterone (642 ± 165 vs. 98.3 ± 63ng/ml, P < 0.0001). Etomidate and ketamine reduced P450 side-chain cleavage (19 ± 7 and 19 ± 3 vs. 32 ± 4, P < 0.01), 21-hydroxylase (8 ± 0.8 and 8 ± 1 vs. 17 ± 5, P < 0.001), 11β-hydroxylase (4 ± 0.5 and 7 ± 1 vs. 11 ± 4, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05), and corticosterone (413 ± 189 and 260 ± 161 vs. 642 ± 165ng/ml, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Ketamine also inhibited adrenocorticotropin hormone production (2.5 ± 3.6 vs. 36 ± 15 pg/ml, P < 0.05). At 48h, all four adrenal enzymes were down-regulated by lipopolysaccharide administration with corticosterone levels similar to the control group. Ketamine and etomidate did not modify corticosterone plasma levels.

Conclusions

Our endotoxemic model induces an initial activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, followed by a secondary inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis processes. Ketamine and etomidate inhibit the enzyme expression and activity of the adrenal gland at the early stage.
