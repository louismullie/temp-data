## Question

Are flashes after intravitreal VEGF inhibitor injection associated with retinal tears?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether flashes after intravitreal anti-VEGF injection are associated with retinal tears. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical meaning of "flashes" and their usual association with posterior vitreous detachment and retinal tears. Then, I should verify whether anti-VEGF injections themselves increase the risk of retinal tears and how often that happens. Next, I will examine mechanistic explanations that could link injection to flashes and tears. After that, I should review guideline recommendations for evaluating flashes after injection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state the bottom line clearly with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: flashes (photopsias) are classically associated with vitreoretinal traction during posterior vitreous detachment and are a red-flag symptom for retinal tears, with acute PVD carrying a tear risk around 5–8% at initial presentation and a delayed tear risk of about 7% over several years, especially in the presence of lattice degeneration or myopia [^24916ceb] [^559ba1c6].

> Wait, let me verify the causal question precisely. The user is not asking whether flashes alone prove a tear, but whether new flashes after an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection signal an increased likelihood of a retinal tear compared with spontaneous PVD scenarios, and whether the injection itself contributes to that risk mechanistically or temporally.

> I will now examine the direct evidence on retinal tears after anti-VEGF injections. Large retrospective series and registries show that rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and retinal tears are rare after intravitreal anti-VEGF, on the order of roughly 1 per 7500 injections in one large series, with no association to needle gauge, injection site, or physician experience, suggesting that when tears occur, they are uncommon and often related to the injection mechanics rather than the drug itself [^8b83895f] [^8798f30c]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across sources; yes, other summaries align with an incidence around 0.013% per injection, reinforcing that this is a low-frequency event [^8798f30c].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility. Needle passage through the pars plana and injection dynamics can theoretically create vitreoretinal traction or vitreous incarceration, and syringe-related issues may produce negative pressure with vitreous entrapment during needle withdrawal, both of which could precipitate a retinal break in susceptible eyes; these are recognized iatrogenic risks of the injection procedure rather than the pharmacology of anti-VEGF agents [^9c7b0c15] [^ee9fb24e]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the drug itself might directly cause tears, but the balance of evidence points to procedural and tractional mechanisms rather than a direct toxic effect of anti-VEGF on the retina [^9c7b0c15] [^ee9fb24e].

> Let me consider timing and context. When retinal tears or detachments occur after injection, they cluster in the immediate post-injection period, and a meaningful fraction of tears are located near the injection quadrant, which supports a mechanical, traction-related mechanism rather than a delayed pharmacologic effect [^8b83895f]. I should double-check that this spatial correlation was statistically significant; yes, 62.5% of tears clustered within 1.5 clock hours of the injection site, which is highly unlikely by chance [^8b83895f].

> Now, I need to check guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with best practice. The AAO advises that patients who develop new flashes, floaters, or visual field loss after intravitreal injection should be evaluated promptly, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for retinal tears or detachment, reflecting that symptoms are meaningful even if the absolute risk is low [^1a595b50] [^97e086f4]. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies broadly to PVD presentations as well; yes, PVD-related symptom guidance similarly recommends urgent evaluation for new flashes or floaters, reinforcing the symptom-based risk signal rather than attributing causality to the drug itself [^24916ceb].

> But wait, what if the "flashes" are not from a retinal tear at all? I should confirm that flashes can arise from other injection-related phenomena. Transient visual disturbances, including photopsias, are recognized after intravitreal injections and can reflect corneal surface changes, IOP-related effects, or non-tear vitreous dynamics; importantly, these are not equivalent to a retinal tear and should be distinguished by careful history and exam, yet they still warrant cautious assessment when new or persistent [^1a595b50] [^612c1039]. I need to ensure I don't overcall every flash as a tear; indeed, many flashes after injection are benign, but the threshold for dilated retinal examination should remain low given the potential consequences of missing a tear [^1a595b50].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers that make tears more likely when flashes occur. Myopia, lattice degeneration, and aphakia/pseudophakia increase baseline PVD-related tear risk, and these factors remain relevant after intravitreal injections; thus, flashes in such eyes should prompt expedited evaluation even if the injection-specific tear risk is low [^24916ceb] [^559ba1c6]. Hold on, I should verify that these modifiers are consistently cited; yes, both PVD cohorts and guidelines emphasize lattice and myopia as key risks for delayed tears after acute PVD, which is directly applicable when interpreting new flashes after any intraocular procedure [^559ba1c6] [^24916ceb].

> I will now synthesize the clinical answer. Yes, flashes after intravitreal anti-VEGF injection can be associated with retinal tears, but the association is uncommon and primarily reflects the same vitreoretinal traction dynamics that produce flashes and tears in spontaneous PVD, with a small additional iatrogenic risk from the injection mechanics. The absolute risk of a tear after anti-VEGF is on the order of about 1 in 7500 injections, whereas the presence of new flashes after any PVD carries a tear risk around 5–8% initially, with additional delayed risk over time, so new flashes after injection should never be ignored [^8b83895f] [^24916ceb] [^559ba1c6]. I should confirm that this framing distinguishes relative from absolute risk; yes, the relative signal of flashes is high in PVD contexts, but the absolute injection-attributable tear risk remains very low, which is why guidelines still emphasize prompt evaluation rather than alarmism [^24916ceb] [^1a595b50].

> Practically, I need to ensure a clear action plan. Any patient reporting new flashes, floaters, or curtain-like visual field loss after intravitreal injection should have a same-day or urgent dilated retinal examination with scleral depression to exclude a retinal tear or detachment, with heightened vigilance in myopes, those with lattice, or symptoms localized near the injection quadrant; if a tear is found, arrange urgent laser or cryotherapy to prevent detachment, consistent with PVD and injection safety guidance [^24916ceb] [^1a595b50] [^50223141]. Hold on, I should verify that this urgency is consistent with both PVD and injection protocols; yes, both emphasize prompt evaluation of new flashes to mitigate vision-threatening progression [^24916ceb] [^1a595b50].

> Bottom line, with appropriate caveats: flashes after intravitreal anti-VEGF injection are a clinically meaningful warning sign for retinal tear, but the causal contribution of the injection itself to tear formation is rare and largely mechanical. The absolute risk is very low, yet the consequence of missing a tear is high, so new flashes after injection warrant urgent dilated retinal examination rather than reassurance [^8b83895f] [^24916ceb] [^1a595b50].

Flashes after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are a **red flag** for retinal tears because they signal vitreoretinal traction from posterior vitreous detachment or direct mechanical injury [^24916ceb] [^ee9fb24e]. The risk of retinal tear is low but real — about 0.013% per injection (1 in 7,500) — and most tears occur within days to weeks after injection [^8b83895f] [^8798f30c]. Patients with new flashes should have a **same-day dilated exam** to exclude a tear, as early detection prevents detachment and vision loss [^97e086f4] [^f8ae48e3].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking flashes to retinal tears

Several mechanisms can explain why flashes after anti-VEGF injections may herald retinal tears:

- **Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)**: Injection-related vitreous movement or traction can precipitate PVD, causing flashes and increasing the risk of retinal tears [^24916ceb].

- **Direct mechanical trauma**: Needle insertion or vitreous incarceration can cause retinal traction or tears, especially near the injection site [^9c7b0c15] [^ee9fb24e].

- **Vitreous hemorrhage**: Bleeding can obscure visualization and increase traction, further elevating tear risk [^24916ceb].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

The incidence of retinal tears after anti-VEGF injections is low but clinically significant:

| **Study** | **Incidence of retinal tears** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Large retrospective series (180,671 injections) | 0.013% per injection (1 in 7,532) | - 24 RRDs within 3 months of injection <br/> - 62.5% of tears were in the injection quadrant [^8b83895f] |
| Meta-analysis | 0.77 per 1,000 patients (0.077%) | Rare but serious complication [^8798f30c] |
| Clinical guidelines | Rare but recognized | - Retinal tears are a known complication <br/> - Emphasize prompt evaluation of new flashes [^6d7f4098] [^1a595b50] |

---

Risk factors include:

- **High myopia**: Increased risk of PVD and retinal tears [^notfound].

- **Lattice degeneration**: Pre-existing retinal thinning increases tear risk [^559ba1c6].

- **Multiple injections**: Repeated procedures may elevate cumulative risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting association

Multiple studies and guidelines affirm the association between flashes after anti-VEGF injections and retinal tears:

- **AAO guidelines**: Recognize retinal tears as a rare but serious complication; advise prompt evaluation of new flashes or floaters [^6d7f4098] [^1a595b50].

- **Retrospective series**: 62.5% of retinal detachments occurred in the injection quadrant, supporting a mechanical mechanism [^8b83895f].

- **Case reports**: Document retinal tears shortly after anti-VEGF injections, often with PVD or vitreous hemorrhage [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Given the potential for vision loss, new flashes after anti-VEGF injections warrant **immediate attention**:

- **Same-day dilated examination**: Essential to detect and treat retinal tears before progression to detachment [^97e086f4] [^f8ae48e3].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be advised to report flashes, floaters, or visual field defects promptly [^1a595b50] [^f762128f].

- **Preventive strategies**: Careful injection technique and post-injection positioning may reduce vitreous traction and tear risk [^ee9fb24e].

---

## Conclusion

Flashes after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are a **clinically significant warning sign** of retinal tears. Although rare, the risk is real and mandates **urgent evaluation** to prevent retinal detachment and preserve vision [^8b83895f] [^1a595b50].

Background

Intravitreal injections are used to deliver drugs and gases to the retina and choroid to treat various eye diseases. Since pegaptanib, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) aptamer, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2004, the number of intravitreal injections has been increasing. Ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab are commonly used as anti-VEGF agents, and they were originally used to treat eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Their use has expanded and they are being used to treat diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO) with macular edema (ME), and other vascular-related retinal diseases. Many clinical trials have reported on their effectiveness of these agents. In addition, the number of intravitreal injections of ocriplasmin and steroids has increased, and intravitreal injections have become a relatively common procedure.

There are, however, serious side effects such as endophthalmitis, vascular occlusions, retinal tears, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment that can develop after an intravitreal injection. There are also systemic complications such as cerebral and myocardial infarctions that can develop after intravitreal injections of these agents. These findings indicate that these agents can have systemic effects and attention needs to be paid to these possibilities.

Retinal functions can be evaluated by electroretinography (ERG) and can be performed not only by the conventional ERG systems but also by a new RETeval® system. This RETeval® system consists of a handheld, portable ERG device that includes stimulating and recording elements. The ERGs are picked-up by a skin electrode array that is fixed to the lower eyelid. Skaat et al. evaluated the retinal function by conventional ERGs after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab into eyes with AMD and the non-injected normal fellow eye. The ERGs were recorded before and one month after the intravitreal injection. They reported that the a-wave amplitudes of both the scotopic and photopic ERG in injected eyes were significantly larger than that of the controls. To focus on the retinal function immediately after injection of an anti-VEGF agent, we recorded ERGs before and within 2 h and within 24 h of the intravitreal injection. Such recordings have not been reported because the use of a contact lens for the recording electrodes would have raised the risk of infections and injury to the eye. The RETeval® system uses skin electrodes placed on the lower eyelid, and can be used to assess the function of both eyes soon after any intraocular procedures.

### ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RETINAL PIgMENT EPITHELIUM TEAR AND ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR THERAPY: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^157b9ffe]. Retina (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify the prevalence of retinal pigment epithelium tear (RPET) after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and determine the efficacy of continued anti-VEGF therapy in patients with RPET.

Methods

All relevant clinical trials and observational studies in several online databases were screened. The main outcomes were the incidence of RPET after anti-VEGF therapy and changes in visual acuity for patients with RPET treated with continued anti-VEGF.

Results

The pooled incidence of RPET after anti-VEGF therapy from 24 studies with 17,354 patients was 1.9% (95% CI: 1.3–2.7). Most new RPET cases were concentrated in the first month at baseline or after the first injection during anti-VEGF therapy and gradually decreased by the subsequent month or injection. 13 studies with 157 patients reported that for patients who received anti-VEGF therapy after RPET, their pooled best-corrected visual acuity improved, but did not reach a significant level (standardized mean differences 0.34; 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.71).

Conclusion

The incidence of RPET after anti-VEGF therapy is low. The intravitreal anti-VEGF injection may accelerate this process. For patients with RPET, maintenance of anti-VEGF therapy ensures visual acuity stability.

### Outcomes of an intravitreal injection clinic [^a2d71e70]. Retina (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the safety outcomes of an intravitreal injection-only clinic where patients needing long-term anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy are treated with injections at a predetermined interval for a set number of injections without an accompanying clinic visit.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart review of all patients with exudative macular degeneration treated in an intravitreal injection clinic over a 4-year period. Data on the outcome measures of interest were gathered from electronic medical records.

Results

There were 556 patients who received 4,386 injections in the injection-only clinic in a total of 1,524 injection cycles. One hundred six cycles were interrupted. The most common causes for interruption were decreased vision in the injected eye (32), decreased vision in the fellow eye (23), flashing lights (6), pain (5), and irritation in the noninjected eye (2). Of patients who had interruption of the cycle, 32 had a new diagnosis (6 corneal abrasions, 6 exudative age-related macular degeneration in fellow eye). There were six instances of conversion to exudative age-related macular degeneration found in the other eye at a routine follow-up visit following the injection clinic.

Conclusion

An injection-only clinic may provide a reasonable approach to streamline retina practices to ensure that patients receive timely injections.

### Management of retinal pigment epithelium tear during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy [^cb7caac3]. Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

This publication provides an overview of current evidence for the development of retinal pigment epithelium tears during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, and summarizes the recommendations of the Vision Academy Steering Committee on appropriate imaging techniques for documenting retinal pigment epithelium tears, the identification of high-risk patients, and the management of patients who develop retinal pigment epithelium tear.

### Management of retinal pigment epithelium tear during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy [^716a61b2]. Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This article aims to review current evidence on the development, diagnosis, and management of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tear during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE/PubMed databases (cut-off date: August 2019).

Results

Three key recommendations were made based on existing literature and clinical experience: 1) Multimodal imaging with color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, near-infrared reflectance imaging, fundus autofluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography-angiography, and/or fluorescein angiography are recommended to diagnose RPE tear and assess risk factors. Retinal pigment epithelium tears can be graded by size and foveal involvement. 2) Patients at high risk of developing RPE tear should be monitored after each anti-VEGF injection. If risk factors worsen, it is not yet definitively known whether anti-VEGF administration should be more frequent, or alternatively stopped in such patients. Prospective research into high-risk characteristics is needed. 3) After RPE tear develops, anti-VEGF treatment should be continued in patients with active disease (as indicated by presence of intraretinal or subretinal fluid), although cessation of therapy should be considered in eyes with multilobular tears.

Conclusion

Although evidence to support the assumption that anti-VEGF treatment contributes to development of RPE tear is not definitive, some data suggest this link.

### Evaluation of intraocular pressure elevation after multiple injections of intravitreal ranibizumab [^150ab9e6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

With the introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibodies in ophthalmologic therapies, there was a fundamental change in treatment options for various ocular diseases. The indications for anti-VEGF therapy include neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central vein or branch vein occlusion with macular edema, and diabetic maculopathy.–For all indications, an effective therapy with anti-VEGF antibodies can only be achieved by repeated intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.

In general practice, three intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies are given every 4 weeks in the initial upload phase, followed by further intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies when a macular edema persists or increases. Therefore, a monthly ophthalmologic checkup is needed to ensure a correct treatment interval with anti-VEGF antibodies. Another requirement to allow for frequent anti-VEGF therapy is a low rate of side effects. Until now, various efficacy and safety studies have demonstrated very low rates of side effects after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.–Potential side effects of anti-VEGF therapy include retinal tears, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, uveitis, or endophthalmitis.

Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents is increasingly used for the treatment of a wide variety of retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinal vascular occlusions, and retinopathy of prematurity. Despite encouraging results in halting the disease and improving the vision, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents may be associated with systemic adverse events and devastating ocular complications. In this review, we provide an overview of safety data for intravitreal injection of common anti-VEGF agents.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^97e086f4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation guidance states that the guidelines in Table 3 are recommendations for the timing of re-evaluation in the absence of additional symptoms. Patients with new symptoms or a change in symptoms may require more frequent evaluation, while patients with no positive findings at the initial examination should be seen at the intervals recommended in the Comprehensive Adult Medical Eye Evaluation PPP. All patients with risk factors should be advised to contact their ophthalmologist promptly if new symptoms such as flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, or decreased visual acuity develop.

Incidence of Retinal Pigment Epithelium Tear Development During Anti–Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy

Currently, there are no clinical data demonstrating a difference in risk of RPE tear based on anti-VEGF agents used, or indeed that anti-VEGF causes RPE tears. The overall mean incidence of RPE tear during treatment with anti-VEGF agents from key Phase III clinical trials was < 1% across all patients (Table 2), although several trials had excluded patients at high risk of RPE tear (i.e. those with large PED). However, in a recent real-world study of over 6,000 patients treated with ranibizumab, RPE tears were detected in 0.16% of patients, further supporting the rates reported from clinical trials. There are several retrospective case series of the risk of RPE tear with anti-VEGF agents, with most reporting the incidence of RPE tear in patients receiving bevacizumab (Table 3). Several case reports are available for intravitreal aflibercept, – as well as a retrospective review of eight cases, all of which had PED. Although RPE tears have been suggested as being associated with anti-VEGF therapy, they were frequently described before the introduction of anti-VEGF treatment in high-risk patients with PED, with an incidence of 10% to 12% of eyes. This is slightly lower than the 12% to 17% incidence reported following anti-VEGF treatment among very high-risk eyes (eyes with serous vascularized PED), and no association has been documented between the number of anti-VEGF injections administered and the incidence of RPE tear.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^4d5a0ed6]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Intravitreal pharmacotherapy — complication overview and systemic safety — notes that all anti-VEGF treatments may carry theoretical risks for systemic arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) and increased intraocular pressure with inconclusive clinical trial results; a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found no increase in major cardiovascular events but increased nonocular hemorrhages in patients with AMD; another systematic review concluded anti-VEGF treatment intensity had no significant influence on mortality; a literature review concluded anti-VEGF therapy is safe and effective for neovascular AMD; risks in pregnant or lactating women have not been studied; intravitreal pharmacotherapy can cause endophthalmitis, noninfectious inflammation, retinal tear, or detachment; and retinal pigment epithelium rips (tears) are not a contraindication to continued anti-VEGF therapy.

### Early and late retinal pigment epithelium tears after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^af4a539f]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate when retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears occur and their associated treatment patterns and long-term visual outcomes in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment.

Design

Case-control analysis from a prospectively designed observational database.

Participants

Treatment-naïve eyes enrolled in the Fight Retina Blindness! observational study that commenced anti-VEGF treatment for nAMD between January 2006 and January 2017 were identified. Cases were defined as eyes in which an RPE tear developed during treatment. Three control eyes per case were matched for age, baseline visual acuity (VA), lesion size, treatment duration before tearing, and duration of follow-up.

Methods

Cases were classified as having early or late tears using a segmented regression model. Baseline characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Comparisons of VA and injections received between tear eyes and control eyes were performed at baseline, before and immediately after the tear, and then 12 and 24 months later. Visual acuity also was compared among different visits within each group.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity, time to tear, and injections received.

Results

Fifty-five cases and 165 matched control eyes were included. The segmented regression estimated a breakpoint for the time to tear at 182 days. We therefore defined eyes as having early tears if they tore before the breakpoint (38/55 eyes [69%]), and as late tears if they tore afterward (17/55 eyes [31%]). Baseline VA was significantly lower in early compared with late tears (53.6 vs. 63.4 letters; P = 0.009). Visual acuity had improved in early tears before the tear (+5.6 letters from baseline; P = 0.01), decreased immediately after the tear (-8.3 letters; P = 0.002), then recovered with no difference compared with control eyes 12 and 24 months later (P > 0.05 for both). Late tear eyes had significantly lower VA than control eyes before tearing (55.5 vs. 66.9 letters; P < 0.001). Visual acuity did not decrease significantly after the tear, but continued to decline compared with control eyes at all end points. Both early and late tear eyes received more injections than control eyes after tearing.

Conclusions

Retinal pigment epithelium tears act differently depending on when they occur. Long-term visual outcomes in eyes affected by RPE tearing may be related more to the patient's response to therapy than to the tear itself.

### Flashes, floaters and fuzz [^eb9ec782]. British Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, eye floaters can be caused by macular degeneration, retinal hemorrhage, posterior uveitis, retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, intraocular foreign body, ocular lymphoma, vitreous hemorrhage, posterior vitreous detachment, pars planitis, retinal tear, hypertensive retinopathy, retinal vein thrombosis, migraine with aura and retinitis. In addition, eye floaters can be caused by medications such as bromfenac, patisiran, aflibercept, entrectinib, pegcetacoplan, ranibizumab, tedizolid, gentamicin, avutometinib/defactinib, ganciclovir, revakinagene taroretcel, brimonidine and avacincaptad pegol.

### Immediate effect of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab on intraocular pressure [^d09834ad]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intravitreal injection of antivascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) has assumed a growing role in the treatment of several vitreoretinal diseases in the last few years.

Ranibizumab and aflibercept are the only approved anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization resulting from age-related macular degeneration.–In addition, ranibizumab has been approved for the treatment of macular edema associated with vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema. Despite this fact, the off-label use of bevacizumab (Avastin ®; Genentech, Inc. South San Francisco, CA, USA) for these–and other, entities has become globally widespread because of its low cost and similar results.

Issues concerning safety with the intraocular use of these agents, particularly bevacizumab, are still being raised and widely discussed in scientific, managerial, and public circles. Ocular adverse effects are well known and include endophthalmitis, cataract, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tear, and detachment. With regard to systemic adverse effects, bevacizumab and ranibizumab have been compared, with no significant difference found between the drugs in terms of rates of death or arteriothrombotic events.

Given the addition of fluid into the vitreous cavity, an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) should be expected after intravitreous anti-VEGF delivery.–This is usually transient, but occasionally, it can persist.–An acute IOP rise has been shown to decrease both optic nerve head and juxtapapillary retinal blood flow proportionally to the quantitative rise in IOP. The axonal transport to the optic nerve head has also been proved to be blocked by an acute IOP increase in animal models. Although the real consequences of these findings are not clear, possible ganglion cell loss cannot be underestimated, mostly in patients with previous glaucoma or other optic neuropathies.

This prospective study was meant to quantify the IOP rise that occurs immediately after intravitreal bevacizumab injection and to investigate potential risk factors associated with this rise.

### Acute-onset floaters and flashes: is this patient at risk for retinal detachment? [^f8ae48e3]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Acute onset of monocular floaters and/or flashes represents a common presentation to primary care physicians, and the most likely diagnosis is posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). A significant proportion of patients with acute PVD develop an associated retinal tear that can lead to retinal detachment and permanent vision loss if left untreated.

Objective

To quantify the association between relevant clinical variables and risk of retinal tear in patients presenting with acute-onset floaters and/or flashes and PVD.

Data Sources

Structured MEDLINE (January 1950-September 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980-September 2009) searches and a hand search of references and citations of retrieved articles yielded 17 relevant studies.

Study Selection

Studies of high-level methods that related elements of the history or physical examination in patients presenting with floaters and/or flashes and PVD to the likelihood of retinal tear.

Results

For patients with acute onset of floaters and/or flashes who are self-referred or referred to an ophthalmologist, the prevalence of retinal tear is 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12%-16%). Subjective visual reduction is the most important symptom associated with retinal tear (likelihood ratio [LR], 5.0; 95% CI, 3.1–8.1). Vitreous hemorrhage on slitlamp biomicroscopy is the best-studied finding with the narrowest positive LR for retinal tear (summary LR, 10; 95% CI, 5.1–20). Absence of vitreous pigment during this examination is the best-studied finding with the narrowest negative LR (summary LR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.12–0.43). Patients initially diagnosed as having uncomplicated PVD have a 3.4% chance of a retinal tear within 6 weeks. The risk increases with new onset of at least 10 floaters (summary LR, 8.1–36) or subjective visual reduction (summary LR, 2.3–17) during this period.

Conclusions

Primary care physicians should evaluate patients with acute-onset floaters and/or flashes due to suspected PVD, or patients with known PVD and a change in symptoms, for high-risk features of retinal tear and detachment. Physicians should always assess these patients' visual acuity. Patients at increased risk should be triaged for urgent ophthalmologic assessment.

### Incidence and long-term visual acuity outcomes of retinal pigment epithelium tears after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^2d01fb11]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report the incidence of retinal pigment epithelium tears in eyes treated with aflibercept for neovascular age-related macular degeneration and compare it with ranibizumab, and to describe long-term visual outcomes of retinal pigment epithelium tears after intensive anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of clinical charts, spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus fluorescein angiography imaging of consecutive naive patients treated with intravitreal aflibercept or ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

Results

Eight hundred consecutive eyes were included in the study (300 treated with ranibizumab and 500 with aflibercept) with 34.0 ± 9.1 months of follow-up. The incidence of tears in the aflibercept group was 3.2% and 2.3% after ranibizumab (P = 0.52). Twenty-nine eyes with retinal pigment epithelium tears were followed for a mean of 30.76 months. Visual acuity at baseline was 20/100 (50.7 ± 19.3 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters) and 20/200 (36.1 ± 26.1 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters) at the end of follow-up. The mean number of injection was 7.3 at 12 months and 13.9 ± 8.1 at the end of the study. The number of injections positively correlated with the final visual outcome.

Conclusion

There was a low rate of retinal pigment epithelium tears after aflibercept injections, similar to ranibizumab. The correlation between the number of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors received and visual outcomes supports the need for continuing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

### Intravitreal injections – 2025 [^b69d004b]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy — clinical role in retinal disease: Anti-VEGF agents have become the first-line of therapy for treating and stabilizing most cases of neovascular AMD, and are used for treatment of many other retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion; multiple well-designed studies have shown intravitreal anti-VEGF agents provide more effective treatment for center-involved diabetic macular edema than laser monotherapy, and therefore anti-VEGF agents are the preferred initial treatment choice when visual acuity is affected.

### Retinal pigment epithelium tears after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (avastin) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^7bda41ec]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA) treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has become an important part of clinical retinal practice. We describe retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears that were noted after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab.

Methods

In this multimember, retrospective case series, data on eyes that developed RPE tears after intravitreal bevacizumab injection were collected and analyzed. Previous treatments, type of lesion, time to tear, and preinjection and final visual acuities were all compared. The total numbers of bevacizumab injections were available from all four institutions and compiled to estimate the incidence rate.

Results

Four retina centers administered a total of 1,455 intravitreal 1.25-mg bevacizumab injections for neovascular AMD during the 9-month study period. Twelve patients presented with RPE tears within 4 days to 8 weeks of injection (mean ± SD, 24.3 ± 15.2 days from injection to tear). In each case, the RPE tear was preceded by an RPE detachment, and all had a component of serous sub-RPE fluid. On the basis of our collective data, we estimate an incidence rate of approximately 0.8%.

Conclusions

RPE tears can occur after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. The low incidence of this adverse event should not preclude anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy counseling for patients with neovascular AMD, but eyes with serous RPE detachments appear to be most vulnerable to this adverse event.

### Evaluation and management of suspected retinal detachment [^01c22cce]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment often is a preventable cause of vision loss. There are three types of retinal detachments: exudative, tractional, and rhegmatogenous. The most common type is rhegmatogenous, which results from retinal breaks caused by vitreoretinal traction. Risk factors for retinal detachment include advancing age, previous cataract surgery, myopia, and trauma. Patients typically will present with symptoms such as light flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, and blurred vision. Early intervention facilitates prevention of retinal detachment after formation of retinal breaks and improves visual outcomes of retinal detachment surgery. Patients with acute onset of flashes or floaters should be referred to an ophthalmologist.

### Interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for preventing retinal detachment [^50223141]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are visible lesions that are risk factors for later retinal detachment. Retinal detachments occur when fluid in the vitreous cavity passes through tears or holes in the retina and separates the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Creation of an adhesion surrounding retinal breaks and lattice degeneration, with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy, has been recommended as an effective means of preventing retinal detachment. This therapy is of value in the management of retinal tears associated with the symptoms of flashes and floaters and persistent vitreous traction upon the retina in the region of the retinal break, because such symptomatic retinal tears are associated with a high rate of progression to retinal detachment. Retinal tears and holes unassociated with acute symptoms and lattice degeneration are significantly less likely to be the sites of retinal breaks that are responsible for later retinal detachment. Nevertheless, treatment of these lesions frequently is recommended, in spite of the fact that the effectiveness of this therapy is unproven.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to treat asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for the prevention of retinal detachment.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2014), PubMed (January 1948 to February 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 19 February 2014. Textbooks regarding retinal detachment and the reference lists of relevant reports were reviewed for additional study reports. We contacted experts in the field for details of other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

This review was designed to include randomized controlled trials in which one treatment for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration was compared with another treatment or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Initially, one author assessed the search results and collected relevant studies. Since no studies met the inclusion criteria, no studies were assessed for risk of bias. No data were extracted and no meta-analysis could be performed.

Main Results

No trials were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions could be reached about the effectiveness of surgical interventions to prevent retinal detachment in eyes with asymptomatic retinal breaks or lattice degeneration, or both. Current recommendations for treatment, based upon a consensus of expert opinion, should be assessed in a randomized controlled trial.

Treatment with anti-VEGF was initiated. C. Color fundus photograph/(D) OCT: 21 weeks later after four injections, the development of a large RPE tear with associated subretinal hemorrhage and a large "bare-area" were observed supero-temporally. A zone of retracted RPE tear was visible inferonasally, with severe vision loss (visual acuity of 20/200).

Color fundus photography is used to document subretinal blood and follow its resorption. Optical coherence tomography should be used both to detect the presence of RPE tear and to assess risk; for example, in patients with large serous PED or irregular choroidal thickness. Fluorescein angiography is commonly used and can provide information on PED diameter and fluid leakage due to CNV. Optical coherence tomography-angiography has the added benefit over FA in that a more accurate CNV/PED ratio can be calculated, because it is less affected by dye leakage, although there may be difficulties with the interpretation of OCT-A in the presence of PED because of segmentation errors. In addition, near-infrared reflectance imaging can be used to detect radial hyperreflective lines that may indicate changes in the RPE. Finally, small tears may be detectable using fundus autofluorescence due to the high contrast of the hypoautofluorescent areas that lack RPE, compared with areas of intact retina.

### Tears of the retinal pigment epithelium: an old problem in a new era [^6ae51c34]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Recent attention has focused upon several reports of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears following vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-modulating therapy. The authors review the clinical features, etiologies, imaging characteristics, and pathogenesis of RPE tears and their relationship with intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments.

Methods

The authors conducted a comprehensive literature search of RPE tears or rips of any etiology using the PubMed database. They have also included a retrospective analysis of an additional five cases of RPE tears following anti-VEGF therapy, four after bevacizumab and one after ranibizumab.

Results

Thirty-three cases of RPE tear after treatment with pegaptanib, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab have been previously reported in the literature. The authors have collected and analyzed the clinical features for 25 of these cases for which this information was available. The authors have also included analysis of an additional five cases. Common features of each of these 30 cases included advanced age of the patient, the presence of fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment (PED) or PED associated with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and diagnosis of the tear within 4 to 8 weeks of the first or second injection.

Conclusions

RPE tears may develop during the course of anti-VEGF therapy for age-related macular degeneration-related PED. Patients with high-risk lesions, especially large irregular PED associated with CNV, should be counseled and monitored for this complication, which may limit visual prognosis.

Intravitreal injections — post-injection risks and patient instructions note that "the overall risk of complications is low in the hands of experienced ophthalmologists", yet "known post-injection risks of intravitreal injections can be vision-threatening and require prompt diagnosis, treatment, and possibly surgical intervention". Serious but rare complications listed include "acute-onset endophthalmitis", "intraocular inflammation or pseudo-endophthalmitis", "cataract development/progression", "retinal detachment", "hemorrhage", and "sustained elevated IOP", with "additional infrequent complications" such as "hypotony, angle closure, retinal vein occlusions, retinal pigment epithelial tears, iritis/uveitis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, corneal epitheliopathy or abrasion, maculopathy, retinal vasculitis, and allergic or anaphylactic reactions". For counseling, "patients must be instructed to promptly report any symptoms of pain, worsening redness, reduced vision, increased sensitivity to light, or increased floaters, which may indicate endophthalmitis". A Cochrane review summarized on the page "found a rate of endophthalmitis of less than 1%" for anti-VEGF injections for neovascular AMD through January 2018.

Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Patients With Retinal Pigment Epithelium Tear

Although a range of retinal imaging modalities are recommended for the diagnosis and monitoring of RPE tear, there are currently no officially recognized guidelines, and a multimodal approach provides the most complete information. These modalities include color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA), OCT-angiography (OCT-A), near-infrared reflectance imaging, and fundus autofluorescence. Examples of RPE tear are provided in Figures 1–3. These examples show signs indicating a higher risk of RPE tear, including RPE wrinkling, radial lines on near-infrared imaging, and multilobular RPE detachment.

### Retinal pigment epithelial tear after intravitreal ranibizumab [^74ecde80]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report two cases of a retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear after intravitreal injection of 0.05 mg ranibizumab.

Design

Observational case report.

Methods

Two patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) resulting from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were treated with an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab.

Results

Both patients were found to have a RPE tear on follow-up visits at one month, confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and by fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography.

Conclusions

RPE tears may occur after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. Further study is needed to determine whether CNV membranes associated with pigment epithelial detachments (PED) are more likely to develop RPE tears after treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents.

### Mechanism of retinal pigment epithelium tear formation following intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy revealed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography [^c713a319]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To demonstrate the mechanism by which retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears occur in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).

Design

Retrospective observational case series.

Methods

OCT images of 8 eyes that developed RPE tears following the administration of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents for neovascular AMD were evaluated. Pretear and posttear images were compared in order to elucidate the mechanism by which RPE tears occur in this setting.

Results

In all eyes, pretear images revealed a vascularized pigment epithelial detachment (PED) containing hyperreflective material consistent with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). This CNV was adherent to the undersurface of the RPE and created contractile folds in the RPE contour. In 6 eyes, contractile neovascular tissue spanned the PED, causing outward bowing of the Bruch membrane and a peaked appearance to the overlying RPE monolayer. RPE tears occurred after the first anti-VEGF injection in 6 of 8 eyes. The posttear OCT images showed a discontinuity in the RPE with the CNV adherent to the retracted RPE. In all eyes, the RPE ruptured along a segment of bare RPE not in contact with the CNV or Bruch membrane.

Conclusions

Eyes with vascularized PEDs secondary to AMD may show specific OCT findings that increase the risk for RPE tear following intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. Rapid involution and contraction of neovascular tissue adherent to the undersurface of the RPE may impart a substantial contractile force that tears this already-strained tissue layer.

### Ocular complications after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in Medicare patients with age-related macular degeneration [^41a7cc71]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine longitudinal rates of ocular complications after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a nationally representative longitudinal sample.

Design

Retrospective, longitudinal case-control study.

Methods

Using the Medicare 5% claims database, diagnoses of neovascular AMD and anti-VEGF injections of ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or pegaptanib were identified from International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology procedure codes. Six thousand one hundred fifty-four individuals undergoing anti-VEGF treatment for neovascular AMD (total of 40 903 injections) were compared with 6154 matched controls with neovascular AMD who did not undergo anti-VEGF treatment. Propensity score matching was used to match individuals receiving anti-VEGF injections with controls. Rates of postinjection adverse outcomes (endophthalmitis, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear, uveitis, and vitreous hemorrhage) were analyzed by cumulative incidence and Cox proportional hazards model to control for demographic factors and ocular comorbidities.

Results

At the 2-year follow-up, the rates of endophthalmitis per injection (0.09%; P < .01), uveitis (0.11%; P < .01), and vitreous hemorrhage per injection (0.23%; P < .01) were significantly higher in the anti-VEGF treatment group. With Cox proportional hazards modeling, the anti-VEGF treatment group had a 102% higher risk of severe ocular complications overall and a 4% increased risk per injection, both of which were statistically significant (P < .01).

Conclusions

Rates of endophthalmitis, uveitis, and vitreous hemorrhage were higher in the group treated with anti-VEGF injection than in the control group, although these nevertheless were rare in both groups. The overall risk of severe ocular complications was significantly higher in the anti-VEGF treatment group.

### Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [^8b83895f]. Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report the rate, risk factors, and outcomes of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medications.

Design

Single-center, retrospective, consecutive review.

Participants

All patients receiving ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept for neovascular age-related macular degeneration or retinal vein occlusion between October 1, 2014, and October 1, 2017.

Methods

The total number of eyes and injections were determined from billing codes. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment patients were determined from billing records and confirmed with chart review.

Main Outcome Measures

Rate of retinal detachment and visual acuity outcomes.

Results

A total of 180671 intravitreal injections in 12718 unique patients were included. An RRD occurred in 24 patients within 3 months after injection, giving a rate of 1 RRD per 7532 intravitreal injections (0.013%) and 1 RRD per 530 patients (0.19%). No association was found between RRD risk after injection and diagnosis (P = 0.54), physician experience (P = 0.23), injection site (P = 0.41), caliper use (P = 0.75), or 31- versus 30-gauge needle use (P = 0.18). A retinal tear was found located in the quadrant of the injection site (within 1.5 clock hours of the injection) in 15 of 24 patients (62.5%; P < 0.0001). At the time of RRD diagnosis, the macula was attached in 9 patients (37.5%). Interventions for RRD repair included pars plana vitrectomy (PPV; 15 patients), combined scleral buckle and PPV (4 patients), pneumatic retinopexy (3 patients), and laser or cryotherapy alone (2 patients). Single-surgery success rate was 54.2%, with 54.5% of recurrent detachments caused by proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Average loss from visual acuity recorded at the visit before diagnosis of RRD was 1.0 line for macula-on detachments versus 6.8 lines for macula-off detachments (P = 0.027) at final follow-up (average, 16.3 months).

Conclusions

Retinal detachment after intravitreal injection is uncommon, with a rate of approximately 1 in 7500 injections. Macular status at the time of RRD diagnosis significantly affects visual outcomes.

### Additional anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for eyes with a retinal pigment epithelial tear after the initial therapy [^97debb65]. Retina (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effects of additional anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy for eyes with a retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear after anti-VEGF therapy and treated with additional anti-VEGF injections for recurrent or persistent exudative change.

Patients and Methods

Ten eyes (10 patients) followed up for > 12 months after a recurrent RPE tear were evaluated retrospectively. The RPE tears on fundus autofluorescence images were measured and changes in the best-corrected visual acuity were evaluated.

Results

Patients were followed up for > 12 months (mean, 27.3; range, 13–44 months). During 12 months of follow-up, additional anti-VEGF injections (mean, 3.3; range, 1–7) were administered. The mean size of the RPE tear at the onset was 6.5 mm² (range, 1.3–16.3 mm²). At 12 months, the RPE tear increased in size > 20% in 5 eyes and remained unchanged or decreased in the remaining half of eyes. The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity was 0.43 at the time the RPE tear developed and 0.85 at 12 months. The RPE tear grade and age were prognostic factors for best-corrected visual acuity at 12 months.

Conclusion

Under continued anti-VEGF therapy, RPE tears may be stable in size and visual acuity could be maintained in some eyes; however, the visual acuity prognosis is still unsatisfactory in nonresponsive eyes.

### Effect of high-dose intravitreal aflibercept, 8 mg, in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration: the phase 2 CANDELA randomized clinical trial [^3dbc8e67]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Safety

No new safety signals were identified for aflibercept, 8 mg, at week 4 (primary safety end point) and through the 44-week study period. The overall safety of aflibercept, 8 mg, was similar to that of 2 mg. Over the 44-week study, 20 participants (37.7%) from each treatment group experienced 1 or more ocular TEAEs in the study eye, most commonly nAMD (aflibercept, 8 mg: 2 [3.8%]; aflibercept, 2 mg: 4 [7.5%]) and vitreous detachment (aflibercept, 8 mg: 4 [7.5%]; aflibercept, 2 mg: 2 [3.8%]) (Table 2). No vascular occlusive events occurred in either group. One case of iritis in the aflibercept, 8 mg, group (mild anterior chamber cells) was reported after the last scheduled dose of the study drug (week 32) and resolved with topical therapy by the week 36 visit. Three participants experienced ocular serious TEAEs in the study eye: 1 (1.9%) each in the aflibercept, 8 mg, group experienced a retinal tear and visual impairment and 1 (1.9%) in the aflibercept, 2 mg, group experienced reduced visual acuity. All ocular serious TEAEs were considered unrelated to study drug. The event of retinal tear was graded as severe and related to the injection procedure. The events of visual impairment and reduced visual acuity were considered as mild in severity. For all 3 events, no changes to the participant's study treatment were required. Overall, 28 participants (52.8%) in the aflibercept, 8 mg, group and 24 (45.3%) in the aflibercept, 2 mg, group experienced nonocular TEAEs (Table 2), most commonly fall (aflibercept, 8 mg: 3 [5.7%]; aflibercept, 2 mg: 2 [3.8%]). Nonocular serious TEAEs were recorded in 5 participants (9.4%) in the aflibercept, 8 mg, group and 4 (7.5%) in the aflibercept, 2 mg, group. In both groups, predose IOP remained stable through week 44 with no clinically relevant increases (Figure 3 A). No participant in the 8-mg and 2-mg aflibercept groups had IOP (predose and postdose) of 35 mm Hg or more in the study eye at any visit.

### Incidence of retinal pigment epithelial tears after intravitreal ranibizumab injection for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^bb61e234]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the association between treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and incidence and timing of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears in ranibizumab-treated patients versus control treatment.

Design

Results from 3 phase III clinical trials (ANti-VEGF antibody for the treatment of predominantly classic CHORoidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration [ANCHOR], Minimally classic/occult trial of the Anti-VEGF antibody Ranibizumab In the treatment of Neovascular Age-related macular degeneration [MARINA], and A Phase IIIb, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Masked, Sham Injection-Controlled Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab in Subjects with Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization [CNV] with or without Classic CNV Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration [PIER]) were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients who developed RPE tears during the study period, detected on fluorescein angiography performed at prespecified intervals.

Participants

Patients with baseline and post-baseline angiographic assessments.

Methods

Patients received intravitreal ranibizumab (0.3 or 0.5 mg) or control treatment (verteporfin photodynamic therapy [PDT] in ANCHOR and sham intravitreal injections in ANCHOR, MARINA, and PIER).

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence and timing of RPE tears during the treatment period.

Results

Data from 1298 patients were analyzed. No statistically significant differences in RPE tear incidence were observed. The pooled rate of RPE tears was 1.8% with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, 3.0% with 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and 1.6% in the control group. Most (76%; 16/21) RPE tears in ranibizumab-treated patients were identified within 3 months of initiating treatment, whereas the majority (80%; 4/5) of late-onset RPE tears occurred in control patients. In patients who developed RPE tears, better visual acuity (VA) outcomes were observed in those treated with ranibizumab versus control treatment.

Conclusions

As studied in these trials, no statistically significant differences in the incidence of RPE tears within a 2-year treatment period were observed in patients who received ranibizumab (0.5 or 0.3 mg) versus control treatment, although most RPE tears with ranibizumab occurred within 3 months of initiating treatment. Mean VA was better in patients who developed RPE tears while receiving ranibizumab than in those who received control treatment, suggesting a potential benefit of continued ranibizumab therapy in patients with neovascular AMD who developed RPE tears.

### CompaRative safety analysis of innovator and bioSimilar ranibizumab in chorioretinal vascular diseases-the CRsIBS study [^75ffb62e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedure-related complications, such as hyphema and vitreous haemorrhage, were observed in both groups in similar numbers and generally resolved with conservative treatment. Cases of lens injury during the injection procedure led to cataract development, necessitating subsequent phacoemulsification. Chi-square tests were conducted for each adverse event to assess statistical significance. The results consistently indicated non-significant p-values, confirming that the safety profiles of biosimilar and innovator ranibizumab are comparable. These complications are consistent with observations from other real-world studies.

Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears have been reported following the administration of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents. In our study, the incidence of RPE tears in both groups was consistent with findings from other investigations, where less than 1% of patients experienced RPE tear. The occurrence of RPE tears is typically linked to pre-existing ocular conditions rather than the intravitreal agent or the injection procedure itself. Although its exact mechanism remains uncertain, contributing factors may include the baseline size of the PED and mechanical stress exerted on the RPE. These tears may arise spontaneously or during anti-VEGF treatment, which is considered a potential risk factor.

### Retinal pigment epithelial tear following intravitreal pegaptanib sodium [^41e72b9c]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report two cases of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after intravitreal injection of pegaptanib sodium. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this finding after intraocular antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

Design

Observational case reports.

Methods

Two patients presented with occult choroidal neovascularization and associated serous pigment epithelial detachment that was a result of age-related macular degeneration. Both patients were treated with an intravitreal injection of pegaptanib sodium.

Results

One patient developed a retinal pigment epithelium tear one week after the intravitreal injection. The second patient developed a retinal pigment epithelium tear eight weeks after treatment.

Conclusions

Although these cases may represent natural history, there should be a high index of suspicion for retinal pigment epithelium tears in patients who report significant visual deterioration after intravitreal injection of pegaptanib sodium. Further studies are needed to determine whether angiographic subtypes of choroidal neovascular membranes are more susceptible to developing retinal pigment epithelium tears after treatment with antivascular endothelial growth factor agents.

### The effect of intravitreal injections on dry eye, and proposed management strategies [^7fc06c31]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents has become a commonly used treatment method for a number of ophthalmic conditions, including age-related macular degeneration. Although anti-VEGF therapy has shown promising results for many patients, there are several aspects of its application that have not been thoroughly investigated. One of these is the development and/or escalation of concurrent dry eye syndrome. Many patients undergoing treatment are already predisposed to dry eye disease due to their age and overall ocular health. As dry eye can have a substantial impact on quality of life, it has become increasingly apparent that the clinical signs and symptoms should be closely monitored and aggressively managed. This will allow for the optimization of patient comfort and visual potential. Here, we discuss the reasons why dry eye may develop during the course of repeated ocular anti-VEGF therapy, highlighting the key concerns about current practices and proposing possible solutions to improve the outcome for the patients.

Some of the reported adverse effects of ocriplasmin are transient decrease in VA, which generally improves after injection, photopsias (sparkles, flashes, lines), pupillary abnormalities/impaired reflex, zonular dehiscence, and lens subluxation.–Willekens et alobserved a change in the cup-to-disk ratio in patients after ocriplasmin injection. There was a decrease in the cup-to-disk ratio in those with persistent VMT after injection. However, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was higher in all patients regardless of injection. This may be of clinical importance in patients who are being monitored for glaucoma. This anatomical change in the ON was statistically significant; however, the power of this study was low.

One case of sterile endophthalmitis presumed to be caused by ocriplasmin injection was found in the literature. A 67-year-old gentleman presented with symptoms of acute endophthalmitis within 24 hours after ocriplasmin injection; he was treated with topical steroids and cycloplegics, improving most of his symptoms. There was no tap and inject; therefore, no culture was performed.

Retinal toxicity after ocriplasmin injection has variable manifestations. Reported structural changes include vascular constriction, ellipsoid layer abnormalities (thinning, disruption, irregularity),–decreased reflectivity that persisted for 2 months after treatment, abnormal autofluorescence, SRF collection, temporary separation of retina from RPE, macular hole enlargement, and macular detachment. Interestingly, central serous chorioretinopathy, a type of SRF collection, has been noted up to 17 months after injection of ocriplasmin, and despite FTMH resolution. In some instances, there has been resolution of post-ocriplasmin SRFand ellipsoid layer abnormalities,–after ~1 year from injection. Most patients had a good VA outcome.

### Full thickness macular hole case after intravitreal aflibercept treatment [^abd4c88c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD) is the major cause of legal blindness among the elderly people in many countries. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is now the major treatment in order to prevent severe vision loss and possibly improve vision. Tears of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are recognized as complication of wet AMD in patients with pigment epithelial detachments (PED). Although several recent reports indicated that anti-VEGF antagonists, such as pegaptanib, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab might increase the risk of tears of RPE compared to natural course. Cunningham et al. reported that there aren't significantly differences of the incident of RPE tear after ranibizumab treatment for wet AMD patients in ANCHOR, MARINA, and PIER study compared to natural course. Idiopathic macular holes are full-thickness retinal defects in the foveal neurosensory retina. The pathogenesis of macular hole formation is widely accepted as an abnormal anteroposterior and tangential vitreous traction performed in foveal retinal surface. We present a recent case of macular hole after intravitreous aflibercept injection associated with contraction of the RPE at the edge of a PED.

### Effect of intravitreal aflibercept injection for age-related macular degeneration with a retinal pigment epithelial tear refractory to intravitreal ranibizumab injection [^c503e862]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears are known to develop in eyes affected by exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and commonly occur in patients with retinal pigment epithelial detachment. RPE tears occur spontaneously in 10% of patients with AMD, and also occur in association with various treatments for exudative AMD, such as photodynamic therapy, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Sometimes, additional treatments are required for the persistent exudative change after development of RPE tear. However, there is no clinically proven guideline for how to manage this condition. Here, we report three cases of AMD with RPE tears, which developed after intravitreal ranibizumab injection (IVR, 0.5 mg/0.05 mL) and finally became resistant to additional IVR, that were treated with intravitreal aflibercept injection (IVA, 2.0 mg/0.05 mL). For this study, we reviewed the medical records of AMD patients with RPE tears after IVR that were treated with IVA after acquisition of resistance to additional IVR.

### Switching to faricimab from the current anti-VEGF therapy: evidence-based expert recommendations [^d39ca6ed]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears

Intravitreal injections are associated with a risk of detachment of the RPE that increases with more frequent injections (~1% per injection). The incidence of RPE tears with faricimab injection in TENAYA and LUCERNE was 0.3%and was 3% in overall clinical experience among patients with nAMD. In real-world studies reporting RPE data, the incidence of tears was 1%‒3.9%. In these studies, faricimab also had favourable effects on the PED height. Clinical study experience with aflibercept determined the incidence of RPE tears to be 2%, and pooled incidences of RPE tears in Phase 3 nAMD trials of ranibizumab were 1.8% for 0.5 mg and 3.0% for 0.3 mg.

The PED size and vascularisation should be evaluated. Fluorescein angiography is the gold standard to determine PED vascularisation; however, optical coherence tomography angiography may identify vascularisation if B-scan and en face techniques are used. In consideration of the risk of RPE tears, there is no clear evidence on the best management for large PEDs; that is, the height is greater than 400 µm. The present faricimab data do not preclude the use in these large PEDs; however, treating PEDs of this size with any therapy warrants careful discussion with the patient that RPE tears may occur with potential worsening of vision.

Retinal detachments and tears

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a rare complication of anti-VEGF therapy, with a reported incidence of 1.4 (95% CI 1.0–1.9) per 10 000 injections; however, older patients were at significantly higher risk (HR 1.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.6) for every decade increase in age; p < 0.01). Retinal detachments occurred in < 0.1% of the faricimab groups in YOSEMITE and RHINE and in 0.2% of the faricimab groups in TENAYA and LUCERNE to 2 years.

### Deformation of aflibercept and ranibizumab syringes causes variation in intravitreal injection volume and risks retinal tear formation [^ee9fb24e]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Potential Mechanism for Retinal Tear Formation

Storey et alshowed that there is approximately a 1:7500 chance of a retinal tear developing after an intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent. However, no association was found between the various medications examined and the rate of retinal tear formation. The rarity of retinal tears and the many factors that contribute to their formation may account for this finding.

When additional force applied to a plunger is released, the stopper retracts to its original position, creating vacuum, which causes the fluid to retract into the needle and syringe. As fluid is drawn back into the needle, the vitreous humor could become incarcerated, and withdrawal of the needle from the eye could lead to the formation of a retinal tear (Fig 4). This proposed mechanism warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, we advise ophthalmologists performing intravitreal injections to consider not releasing pressure applied to the plunger while the needle is within the vitreous cavity to guard against potential vitreous incarceration via this mechanism.

Figure 4
Proposed mechanisms for intravitreal injections to cause vitreoretinal traction capable of inducing a retinal tear. During an intravitreal injection, a retinal tear (∗) may be created when the needle is passed through the pars plana (A) or at the time of medication injection (B). An alternative hypothesis, one supported by the present study, is that the vitreous humor may be drawn into the needle because of the negative pressure created by the recoil of the syringe stopper after medication administration (C). A retinal tear (#) forms as the needle is withdrawn from the eye because of vitreoretinal traction (D, E).

Adverse Drug Reactions and Ocular Symptoms

During the course of the study, 45 of 134 patients (33.6%) experienced at least one ADR in the study eye (Table 2). The most frequently reported adverse reactions, irrespective of vitrectomy, were vitreous floaters (12.7% of patients), reduced VA (10.4% of patients), SRF (9.0% of patients), and photopsia (flashing lights, flashing vision, 8.2% of patients). No cases of endophthalmitis or vitreoretinal dehiscence were reported.

Table 3 lists the most frequently reported ocular symptoms, the reporting of which was solicited using a list of 19 terms which do not correspond to the MedDRA terms used for ADR collection. For symptoms starting at or after ocriplasmin treatment, the most common were vitreous floaters (31.3%), decreased VA (23.9%), photopsia (23.9%), and eye pain/ocular discomfort (21.6%). At the end of the follow-up period, ocular symptoms were resolved in 23 of 42 patients with floaters (54.8%) and in 14 of 32 patients with decreased VA (43.8%). By LO, photopsia resolved for 25 of 32 patients (78.1%), and eye pain/ocular discomfort resolved for 26 of 29 patients (89.7%).

### Long-term results of repeated anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in eyes with retinal pigment epithelial tears [^89d49470]. Retina (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term results of retinal pigment epithelium tears in eyes treated with repeated anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.

Methods

Five patients with retinal pigment epithelial tears (without foveal center involvement) after anti-VEGF injection were studied retrospectively. Mean follow-up time was 52 months, with measurements of visual acuity and evaluation of macular findings by angiography and optical coherence tomography during this period. All eyes had a persistent submacular neovascular membrane 30 days after the tear. An anti-VEGF drug was reinjected until the membranes stopped leaking.

Results

The mean initial visual acuity immediately after the tear was 20/160, and the mean final visual acuity was 20/60. The number of anti-VEGF reinjections varied from two to eight during the follow-up period. Long-term optical coherence tomography analysis showed reduced fluid and remodeling of the torn retinal pigment epithelium.

Conclusion

Long-term visual results with repeated anti-VEGF therapy are not as devastating as suggested previously. Visual acuity and metamorphopsia improve with time as long as the neovascular membrane is inactive. Optical coherence tomography changes in the macular area reflect the visual acuity improvement.

### A systematic review of the adverse events of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections [^25abfe5f]. Retina (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Intravitreal ranibizumab and pegaptanib are registered for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. No formal safety study has been conducted for intravitreal bevacizumab. These anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs are being used on a large scale in daily practice for different ocular diseases. The objective of the present study was to systematically assess and compare the incidences of adverse events of anti-VEGFs.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in April 2009 with no date restrictions in PubMed, Embase, Toxline, and the Cochrane library. We used the terms pegaptanib, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, intravitreal, and specific and general terms for adverse events. Studies describing adverse events after anti-VEGF injections and the official safety data were included.

Results

Two hundred and seventy-eight articles were included, and the incidences of adverse events were calculated separately for effect, safety, and specific side effect studies. The incidences of serious ocular and nonocular adverse events were approximately below 1 per 100 injections for intravitreal bevacizumab, intravitreal ranibizumab, and intravitreal pegaptanib. Most mild ocular adverse events were below 5 per 100 injections.

Conclusion

The reported rates of serious adverse events were low after anti-VEGF injections. There is no sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference in incidences between the anti-VEGFs.

### Particulate matter from syringes used for intravitreal injections [^915b9b1f]. Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs to treat neovascular retinal diseases is one of the most commonly performed procedures in all of medicine. In the future, pipeline drug developments are expected to improve anti-VEGF treatment durability and reduce injection frequency. However, given the aging population, the expanding indications for anti-VEGF therapy, and the recognition that chronic injection therapy may be required to maintain visual acuity gains over time, the number of intravitreal injections is expected to continue to grow.

Also growing is an awareness around the potential for the presence of particles in intravitreal injections. Given the fact that the vitreous is a small, contained space and that neovascular retinal diseases typically require ongoing treatment, the risks associated with injecting particulate matter (including silicone oil) into the vitreous may be cumulative, and particles may have association with complications such as floaters, sustained increase in intraocular pressure, and endophthalmitis. –

### Potential risk factors for ocular pain in patients undergoing multiple intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [^6d080bc7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) delivered by intravitreal injection (IVI) is standard for treating chorioretinal vascular diseases such as diabetic macular edema, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion, among others. Currently, this therapy has a favorable safety profile, with patient pain tending to be mild regardless of topical anesthesia. However, multiple treatments are often required because of the short half-life of these drugs and the high rate of disease recurrence.

The objective of the current study was to assess ocular pain in patients receiving multiple IVIs of anti-VEGF who have previous factors that may influence the degree of pain.

### Double retinal pigment epithelium tears in neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^de60c3e0]. Retina (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the occurrence and treatment outcomes of double retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears in neovascular age-related macular degeneration and to elucidate the mechanism of tear development by means of multimodal imaging analysis.

Methods

Fundus autofluorescence, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography were retrospectively studied before and after the occurrence of first and second RPE tears and at the final visit.

Results

Twelve eyes of 10 patients that developed double RPE tears, either simultaneously (6 eyes) or at variable intervals after repeated intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor administration (6 eyes), were included. First RPE tears developed after a mean of 4.5 ± 2.7 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections; second RPE tears developed after a mean of 7.1 ± 5.2 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections. Mean best-corrected visual acuity was 20/63 at baseline evaluation, 20/76 after occurrence of first tear, 20/90 after occurrence of second tear, and 20/95 at final visit (P > 0.05 for all). Multimodal imaging revealed in all cases a Type 1 neovascular lesion adherent to the posterior surface of the RPE and spanning a significant portion of the pigment epithelium detachment with variable orientation; after development of double tears, the RPE seemed retracted on both borders of the neovascular network.

Conclusion

Double RPE tears may occur on opposite sides of a vascularized pigment epithelium detachment, in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, because of neovascular contraction of a Type 1 neovascular complex, adherent to the posterior surface of the RPE and spanning a significant portion of the pigment epithelium detachment area.

### RETINAL PIgMENT EPITHELIAL TEAR AND ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR THERAPY IN EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION: clinical course and long-term prognosis [^0e9cd360]. Retina (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To document the long-term outcome in cases of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears after treatment of vascularized pigment epithelial detachments with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of eyes with RPE tear developed during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for pigment epithelial detachment associated with choroidal neovascularization or retinal angiomatous proliferation (vascularized pigment epithelial detachment) was performed. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and autofluorescence images and also fluorescein angiograms were analyzed to determine the functional and morphologic development over time.

Results

The long-term outcome of 22 eyes (21 patients, 13 women and 8 men; 65–85 years; mean: 76 years) with RPE tear was performed with minimal follow-up of 3 years (range: 3–5 years, mean: 44 months) and re-treatment with different therapeutic strategies. The eyes were differentiated in 2 groups according to the course of BCVA after the first 2 years of follow-up: Group 1 (11 eyes) demonstrated a stabilized or improved BCVA after 2 years and Group 2 (11 eyes) demonstrated a decrease in BCVA after 2 years. The initial BCVA between both groups was comparable. Also the mean initial size of the RPE tear was the same between the 2 groups, the area of the RPE tear decreased continuously during follow-up in Group 1, whereas this was the case in Group 2 only at the beginning of treatment with a further increase of the size of the RPE tear with longer follow-up. This corresponded with a different morphologic development between the two groups. In Group 1, increasing recovery of autofluorescence at the RPE-free area was visible beginning from the outer border, whereas in Group 2, further growth of the neovascular complex in the area of the RPE tear was observed resulting in larger fibrovascular scars. In addition, in both groups, the development of hyperreflective tissue was seen on spectral domain optical coherence tomography in the RPE-free area. The major therapeutic difference between the 2 groups was a significantly larger number of injections especially during the first year in Group 1.

Conclusion

The development of RPE tear after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for vascularized pigment epithelial detachment in exudative age-related macular degeneration does not necessarily result in large disciform scars and functional loss, but multiple injections seem to be beneficial especially in the first year. With this strategy, RPE tears seem to be covered by autofluorescent and hyperreflective tissue and a regrowth of the neovascular complex can be prohibited. As a result, photoreceptor cells regain their metabolic support with functional recovery.

Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks and lattice degeneration — patient education emphasizes postoperative planning and urgent symptom reporting: "Formulate a postoperative care plan and inform patient of these arrangements", and "Patients should be advised to contact ophthalmologist promptly if they have a substantial change in symptoms such as flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, or decreased visual acuity". Education also states that "Patients at high risk of developing retinal detachment should be educated about the symptoms of PVD and retinal detachment and the value of periodic follow-up exams", and "Patients who undergo refractive surgery should be informed they remain at risk of RRD despite reduction of their refractive error".

### Retinal pigment epithelial tear after intravitreal bevacizumab injection [^0d8c1383]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report two cases of a retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear after intravitreal bevacizumab injection for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Design

Observational case series.

Methods

Two patients presented with occult choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD. Both patients received intravitreal bevacizumab injections.

Results

The first patient developed a RPE tear shortly after a third intravitreal bevacizumab injection. The second patient developed a RPE tear 10 days after a second intravitreal bevacizumab injection.

Conclusions

Although RPE tears may occur spontaneously as part of the natural history of exudative AMD, patients may develop visually devastating RPE tears after repeat intravitreal bevacizumab injection. Further studies are needed to determine the incidence of RPE tears after intravitreal bevacizumab injections.

### Posterior vitreous detachment-prevalence of and risk factors for retinal tears [^06ee1389]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

When comparing PVD patients without (n = 320) or with (n = 106) retinal tears (Table 2), there was no significant difference in age, laterality, or symptomatology with regard to floaters and flashes. The mean age of patients with uncomplicated PVD versus those with retinal tears was 63.7 (± 10.8 SD) and 62.6 (± 10.3 SD) years, respectively; the IQR was similar for both groups, with the majority of patients being between 59 and 70 years of age. Floaters were present in > 90% of the patients within both groups whereas about half of the patients had experienced flashes, P = 0.499 and P = 0.135, respectively. On the other hand, subjective visual decrease was significantly more frequent among patients with retinal tears (20.4%) than in those without a retinal tear (10.9%, P = 0.024). Women were in majority in both groups, but the proportion of men was increased in those presenting with retinal tears, a borderline significant difference (P = 0.051).

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to complications of treatment (intravitreal pharmacotherapy, general principles), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that a review of the literature concluded that anti-VEGF therapy is safe and effective for neovascular AMD. The risks of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents in pregnant or lactating women have not been studied. Intravitreal pharmacotherapy can result in endophthalmitis, noninfectious inflammation, retinal tear, or detachment.

### Pigment epithelial tears associated with anti-VEGF therapy: incidence, long-term visual outcome, and relationship with pigment epithelial detachment in age-related macular degeneration [^8845855e]. Retina (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the prevalence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears associated with anti-VEGF therapy and its relation with retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED).

Methods

A total of 226 patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF were included retrospectively in the study. The presence of RPE tears; the effect of the presence, height, and duration of PED on the rate of RPE tears; and change in visual acuity during follow-up were recorded.

Results

Among 226 study patients, 28 (12.3%) had RPE tears. The RPE tear rate was significantly higher in patients with vascularized PED (vPED) than in those without PED (19.7% vs. 2.1%; P < 0.001). The change in visual acuity after the formation of RPE tear was not statistically significant (on logMAR scale: 0.92 ± 0.49 initially, 0.89 ± 0.41 after the RPE tear, 0.96 ± 0.45 at the last follow-up; P = 0.613). Pigment epithelial detachment height > 580 μm (odds ratio = 69.4; 95% confidence interval = 16.7–288.1) and PED duration ≤ 4.5 months (odds ratio = 166.7; 95% confidence interval = 15.2–1000) were found to be significant risk factors for RPE tear formation.

Conclusion

The RPE tears are not infrequent among eyes treated with intravitreal anti-VEGFs. The presence, increased height, and shorter duration of vPED are potential risk factors for RPE tears associated with anti-VEGF therapy.

### Adverse events with intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors: nested case-control study [^24cb0a38]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of exposure to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors

We identified intravitreal injections of ranibizumab by using the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and Ontario Drug Benefit databases. Ranibizumab has been covered by the Ontario Drug Benefit Program since 25 March 2008. Before that date, use of ranibizumab in Ontario was minimal. Bevacizumab does not have approval from Health Canada for use in age related macular degeneration and is not covered by the Ontario Drug Benefit Program for this indication. However, bevacizumab received Health Canada approval for use in colorectal cancer in September 2005, and physicians can bill the provincial physician insurance plan for off-label intravitreal injections of this drug. Our previous work has documented the widespread use of off-label bevacizumab in the period before coverage of ranibizumab by the public drug insurance plan.

We assigned exposure to bevacizumab injection indirectly. We identified all intravitreal injection procedures that were not associated with a prescription for ranibizumab by using the Ontario Drug Benefit and Ontario Health Insurance Plan databases and used several strategies to reduce misclassification of intravitreal injections of gas, antibiotics, or steroids. Firstly, because gas is injected as part of retinal detachment therapy, we excluded injections given to patients with a proximate diagnosis of retinal detachment, defined as having had a vitreous exchange procedure or a retinal reattachment procedure within 42 days before or seven days after the intravitreal injection. Secondly, because intravitreal steroid is used for retinal conditions that are also treated with laser, we excluded injections given to patients who had had retinal laser treatment in the previous 180 days. Additionally, we did a sensitivity analysis in which this time frame was shortened to 42 days. Finally, because antibiotics are injected for postoperative endophthalmitis, we excluded injections given to patients who had had retinal surgery, cataract surgery, corneal surgery, or glaucoma surgery in the 42 days before the injection.

Covariates

We adjusted for several potential confounders. We used the number of distinct drugs dispensed in the year before the index date as a measure of comorbidity. We estimated income from neighbourhood fifths of income based on census data. We defined diabetes status on the basis of the validated Ontario diabetes database. We identified patients with hypertension by using a validated algorithm. We also adjusted for exposure to several specific drugs within the year before the index date, grouped by mechanism of action to avoid over-fitting the statistical models. We also included specific comorbidities (including atrial fibrillation, cancer, and renal failure) in the models.

### Real-world anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy outcomes in myopic choroidal neovascularization [^57954e77]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are potential risks associated with administration of anti-VEGF treatment. In terms of safety, our series had no cases of endophthalmitis, retinal tear or detachment following anti-VEGF injection for myopic CNV. Myopes in general are at a higher risk of developing retinal detachments and tears following an intravitreal injection. We did not record any patients with lattice degeneration in our series; however, in such patients, consideration of laser treatment prior to intravitreal injections may be warranted. In pathological myopia, the result of treatment of CNV with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents may induce contraction of the CNV with the resultant development of chorioretinal structural changes leading to fibrosis and atrophy, which may lead to poor visual prognosis.

A recent retrospective studyof 96 eyes comparing real-world outcomes of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies in patients with myopic CNV demonstrated no significant difference in visual improvement after 1 year of treatment between bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept. By year 3, visual improvement was not significant in the ranibizumab and bevacizumab groups. No difference in the number of injections between the three groups was recorded. Our results differ in that we did not include any patients treated with bevacizumab in our series as this is not a licensed or NICE approved treatment in the UK. Patients ≥ 51 years required more ranibizumab injections than those ≤ 50 years and were followed for a longer period.

Our study is limited by its small cohort size. In particular, differences in lens status and refractive correction with younger individuals more likely to wear contact lenses will have influenced visual outcomes. Furthermore, the small sample size introduces a source of bias into interpretation of visual outcomes due to outliers. We did not record axial length as a parameter to define pathological myopia. These factors are important limitations to our study and therefore our results must be interpreted with caution and may not be directly comparable to large scale prospective randomized controlled trials. However, this is a reflection of the real-world nature of our study and our results are useful as a guide to inform patients on likely outcomes for myopic choroidal neovascularization in a practical setting.

We found that myopic CNV requires less frequent anti-VEGF intravitreal therapy over a shorter follow-up period than both neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Increased frequency of administration of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment did not improve vision. Younger age is associated with a better final visual outcome. These findings may help to advise patients about the prognosis of treatment and help guide treatment decisions.

### Adverse events with intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors: nested case-control study [^d04ef2e8]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Age related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in Western nations; the neovascular ("wet") subtype is responsible for most cases of severe vision loss. Because vascular endothelial growth factor plays an important role in the growth of the pathological blood vessels that underlie neovascular age related macular degeneration, the development of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of this disease. However, vascular endothelial growth factor functions in many physiological and pathological processes, including maintenance of normal blood vessels, wound healing responses, blood clotting processes, and stabilisation of atheromatous plaques. These wide ranging effects make the hypothesis that adverse vascular events may stem from inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor biologically plausible. Furthermore, empirical clinical evidence suggests an association between inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and adverse vascular events. In particular, intravenous administration of the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab has been associated with increased risks of stroke, venous thromboembolism, and congestive heart failure. Whether this risk of systemic adverse events can be extrapolated to the small doses used in age related macular degeneration remains unclear.

Direct injection of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors into the eye decreases the concentration of drug reaching the systemic circulation. Clinical trials comparing intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab with sham treated controls did not detect increased risks of vascular adverse events with either drug. In contrast, a small meta-analysis of early trials with ranibizumab found an increased risk of stroke in patients receiving ranibizumab injections. The Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials, which directly compared intravitreal bevacizumab against intravitreal ranibizumab, found a higher risk of adverse events among participants receiving bevacizumab. However, this finding is difficult to interpret given that most of the observed adverse events were conditions not previously associated with inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, and that participants who received fewer doses of bevacizumab had a greater risk than did those who received more.

### Bevacizumab (avastin) and ranibizumab (lucentis) for choroidal neovascularization in multifocal choroiditis [^0e2b4c26]. Retina (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) is an inflammatory condition, occasionally associated with choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (Lucentis) are therapies that target vascular endothelial growth factor. Bevacizumab and ranibizumab have been used successfully to treat CNV in age-related and myopic macular degeneration.

Purpose

To describe the treatment of MFC-associated CNV with intravitreal bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab.

Design

Retrospective interventional case series.

Participants

Six eyes of five patients with MFC-associated CNV were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity at 1, 3, and 6 months after the initial injection.

Results

Previous therapies (number of eyes treated) included sub-Tenon's corticosteroids (2), intravitreal corticosteroids (1), photodynamic therapy (1), and thermal laser (1). The mean number (range) of antivascular endothelial growth factor injections per eye was 2.3 (1–6). The mean duration (range) of follow-up per patient was 41.5 (25–69) weeks. Five of six eyes improved to 20/30 acuity or better at 6 months. One eye suffered a subfoveal rip of the retinal pigment epithelium with 20/400 acuity. There was a qualitative decrease in clinical and angiographic evidence of CNV.

Conclusions

Bevacizumab and ranibizumab were effective at improving visual acuity over 6 months in a small series of patients with MFC-associated CNV. Tears of the retinal pigment epithelium may occur after intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy in MFC-associated CNV.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^14fbe59c]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to general principles of management and follow-up, AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that early detection and prompt treatment of active neovascular AMD improves visual outcomes. Intravitreal injection therapy using anti-VEGF (VEGF) agents, which may or may not target other factors such as placental growth factor or angiopoietin-2, is the most effective way to manage neovascular AMD and is the first-line treatment. Symptoms suggestive of post-injection endophthalmitis or retinal detachment require prompt evaluation.

### Intravitreal injections – 2025 [^9c7b0c15]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Intravitreal injections — technique and intra-procedural risks specify that "The needle should be inserted perpendicularly through the sclera with the tip aimed toward the center of the globe to avoid the posterior lens", and "Injections are generally performed inferotemporally or superotemporally to optimize exposure and to avoid damage to the retina and other eye structures". Iatrogenic injuries described include that "the lens capsule can become damaged during the injection and a traumatic cataract can result, requiring subsequent cataract surgery", with possible "complications during cataract surgery caused by posterior capsule rupture", as well as "The retina may also be damaged, resulting in tears or even a detachment that requires surgical repair", and "corneal abrasions and intraocular hemorrhages". During the procedure, intraocular pressure (IOP) considerations are that "IOP can increase transiently, and the ophthalmologist may need to reduce IOP", which "may require an anterior chamber paracentesis", wherein "the surgeon must insert a needle into the anterior chamber of the eye to remove fluid and reduce the pressure", and this "procedure carries many of the same risks of the first injection".

### Adverse events with intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors: nested case-control study [^d98c2c28]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

Because of the enormous costs involved, policies on the use of intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors have broad implications for healthcare systems. For instance, despite considerable use of bevacizumab, ranibizumab sales in the United States surpassed $1.6bn (£1.0bn; €1.3bn) in 2011, making ranibizumab the single greatest drug expenditure covered under Medicare part B. Bevacizumab costs approximately $50–70 per injection, and ranibizumab is priced at about $2000 per injection, and public leaders in the United States have recently requested a national coverage determination supporting the use of bevacizumab for age related macular degeneration. Similarly, the UK Department of Health, through the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, has begun working towards formally evaluating bevacizumab for age related macular degeneration, and corresponding evaluations are anticipated in many other countries.

Our results suggest that, overall, intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and ranibizumab are not associated with significant risks of ischaemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, or congestive heart failure. In conjunction with data from efficacy trials including the Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials and the Inhibit Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Age-related Choroidal Neovascularisation studies, our safety data support the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of age related macular degeneration. However, several important questions require clarification. In particular, further studies focusing on the risk of acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes treated with intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are warranted. Additionally, the potential for bevacizumab's low price to discourage investment in innovative treatments for age related macular degeneration, and the need to design safe and accountable processes to support distribution of bevacizumab for intravitreal use, remain important. Furthermore, the entrance of additional vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors onto the market will necessitate further comparative studies of effectiveness and safety. Clearly, with billions of dollars of healthcare at stake, stakeholders on all sides — from patients and physicians to governments, third party payers, and industry — must continue to evaluate all available data to ensure that accessibility, affordability, and quality of care are maximised.

Treatment characteristics and recurrence rates

The 5 patients with an active CNV lesion received intravitreal antiangiogenic treatment as primary treatment for CNV. On average, 4.2 injections (SD 3.1, range 1–8) were given per eye. Four eyes were treated with bevacizumab, 1 eye with ranibizumab. The decision about the injection scheme was made individually and was dependent on the size and activity of the lesion. In two (40%) eyes, which received a single anti-VEGF load at the beginning, this single injection was sufficient to control the disease. The other 3 (60%) eyes were treated with an upload of three monthly injections. After a three month treatment pause 2 of these patients needed another 2 or 3 injections to control the CNV activity over a period of 3 to 6 months. In one of these patients recurrence occurred after a six-month treatment pause and was controlled by a single re-injection. The third patients with an initial upload of three injections had a two month treatment pause and another five injections afterwards over a period of half a year.

### Ophthalmology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic [^009f4b2f]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Retina service

The retina clinic has a large component of patients who are elderly and with comorbid diseases. New measures were adopted in treating retina patients to reduce their exposure to each other and to the medical team as much as possible.

Patients with urgent sight-threatening conditions (eg, retinal tears, retinal detachments, trauma and so on) should be examined and treated through the emergency room. Appointments for all non-urgent patients were cancelled (eg, patients with epiretinal membranes, more than 6 months of follow-up since vitreoretina surgery and all patients with retinal dystrophy).

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is provided under a modified regimen. Each day different teams of injecting retina specialists, nurses and residents are present at the clinics, with a minimum number of staff possible; teams scheduled on different days should not meet each other. Patients treated with anti-VEGF may be triaged to identify those where treatment can be delayed.

Patients under monthly intravitreal injections continued to receive the injections as planned in their last visit to the clinic. Visual acuity assessment and clinical examination may be postponed, and treatment decision may be based on OCT findings. OCT images may be reviewed by a retina specialist at home with a remote connection, who decides on the interval of injections for each patient following a treat and extend protocol.

Telemedicine has been suggested as the innovative solution to provide care for patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), as it allows evaluation of DR in the primary care setting using digital fundus images, which are evaluated remotely by trained graders. Ocular telehealth programmes for DR can effectively diagnose sight-threatening DR in the primary care setting and recommend appropriate care interventions. The use of telemedicine has been described also for evaluation of other retinal abnormalities such as acute floaters and age-related maculopathy. Yet improved home-based retina imaging is a major limiting factor in increasing the reliability of home-based monitoring.

### Retinal breaks due to intravitreal ocriplasmin [^130958ff]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

While ocriplasmin represents a potent new tool in the treatment of vitreomacular traction, careful monitoring of treated patients, as with any novel therapy, remains paramount in assessing both its efficacy and safety.

While the above represents the first case series of retinal breaks occurring after intravitreal ocriplasmin administration, their occurrence in and of themselves is not without precedent. The MIVI I trial (Phase I/II clinical trial), which enrolled 60 patients, reported a far peripheral retinal tear with an associated retinal detachment noted on post-injection day 1. A later Phase II trial, in which 92 patients received varying doses of ocriplasmin, also reported two retinal tears. These tears occurred within 7 days of intravitreal injections but the exact timing of their occurrence is unclear. Similarly, the MIVI-TRUST studies (Phase II/III clinical trials) reported two post-injection retinal tears with associated retinal detachments in the 464 patients treated with ocriplasmin though the exact timing of these tears with respect to the injections was again not reported. Given the timing of each of the prior reported instances, the breaks may have been a result of the intravitreal injection itself rather than the pharmacologic action of ocriplasmin. There is some evidence supporting this theory: the MIVI I trial authors reported that during surgical repair of the aforementioned retinal tear and detachment, the vitreous was found still firmly adherent to the retina.

### Prevalence and clinical implications of subretinal fluid in retinal diseases: a real-world cohort study [^dec19372]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic macular oedema (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) are important causes of vision impairment in patients of working age with approximately 103 million, 19 million and 28 million people globally affected by diabetic retinopathy, clinically significant DME and RVO, respectively. In both DME and RVO, the mainstay of treatment for macular oedema is intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. Despite the well-documented success and safety of anti-VEGF agents, there is variability in response to therapy, with some patients experiencing an incomplete response or developing pharmacological resistance.

One factor that may be associated with differential response to anti-VEGF agent is the presence of subretinal fluid (SRF), which is the accumulation of serous fluid in the subretinal space in the absence of retinal breaks or tears. The prevalence of SRF ranges from 18% to 32% in DMEand 40% to 57% in RVO, suggesting a complex disease pathophysiology that involves the breakdown of the outer retinal-blood barrier. Several studies have evaluated the prognostic utility of SRF at baseline. Notably, a previous study of DME patients in the RISE and RIDE trials demonstrated that SRF at baseline was correlated with better visual outcomes and resolution of retinal thickening on optical coherence tomography (OCT) after 24 months of therapy. In a post hoc analysis from BRAVO and CRUISE trials, SRF at baseline did not influence the visual outcomes of RVO after 12 months of ranibizumab. In a separate post hoc analysis for BRAVO/CRUISE patients followed up to 2 years, a large amount of SRF was associated with central subfield thickness (CST) ≤ 250 μm in branch RVO, while absence of SRF was associated with CST ≤ 250 μm in central RVO. These pivotal trials, however, evaluate the effects of mandatory monthly injections of a single agent as opposed to real-world variable dosing. Furthermore, the current literature is still controversial regarding the effects of baseline SRF on the visual outcomes and response to therapy, and most data were obtained at 1 year or less.

Herein, we study the prevalence of SRF in both DME and RVO to determine the effects of SRF on the anatomical and visual outcomes in eyes treated with real-world variable dosing regimen of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents for macular oedema. We also evaluate the prognostic utility of baseline SRF for long-term treatment outcomes in DME and RVO patients and characterise both the eye with SRF and fellow eye in patients requiring anti-VEGF injections.

### Safety of receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injection in office-based vs operating room settings: a meta-analysis [^8856823f]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

First described at the turn of the 20th century for repairing retinal detachments (RDs), intravitreal injections (IVIs) have become the most widely performed procedures in the ophthalmic field. IVIs with anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents have significantly improved management and visual prognosis of angiogenic retinal diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization, and other visual impairments.

Endophthalmitis (EO) is a severe form of eye inflammation that may result in irreversible blindness if the intraocular infection is not properly treated. To our knowledge, the largest meta-analysis on EO to date revealed an overall rate of 0.06% (197 of 350 535 injections) following IVIs with all anti-VEGF agents. Anti-VEGF injections require repeated injections on a regular basis. Despite that subsequent injections did not increase the risk of EO compared with the first one, awareness of the risk remains clinically relevant as the number of injections increases.

IVIs with anti-VEGF agents are predominantly performed in the operating room (OR) in Europe and in resource-limited countries, such as Chinaand India, owing to the perception of a decreased risk of infection. Given the high volume of IVIs performed annually with limited availability of ORs, these injections were typically administered in an office setting in the US. Iatrogenic infection remains a primary concern for office-based IVI, yet evidence from primary research remains controversial; while Abell et alfound a significantly higher risk of EO following office-based IVIs than in the OR (relative risk, 13.1; 95% CI, 1.5–112.4), no significant difference was observed between the 2 settings in the study by Tabandeh et al(odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.09–3.18). These findings suggest a need for systemic evidence on EO rates and other safety outcomes following anti-VEGF IVIs in the 2 settings. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis evaluating the safety of anti-VEGF IVI in the office and OR settings and discuss the implications for future practice.

### Incidence and risk factors for delayed retinal tears after an acute, symptomatic posterior vitreous detachment [^559ba1c6]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the long-term incidence of and risk factors for delayed retinal tears after acute, symptomatic posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) without concurrent retinal tears.

Design

Retrospective, observational case series.

Subjects

Patients diagnosed with an acute, symptomatic PVD without concurrent retinal tears at a tertiary eye center between 2013 and 2018.

Methods

This is a retrospective, consecutive, and observational case series. Acute and symptomatic PVD was defined as experiencing flashes or floaters for 1 month or less at the time of diagnosis. Patients with a retinal tear or detachment at or before the time of diagnosis were not included. The occurrence and timing of subsequent retinal tears after initial PVD diagnosis were recorded. The age, sex, race, refractive error, lens status, lattice degeneration status, and type of physician (retina specialist vs. nonretina specialist) who saw the patient were also recorded.

Main Outcome Measures

Time to the development of a delayed retinal tear.

Results

A total of 389 eyes from 389 patients had acute and symptomatic PVDs without concurrent retinal tears or detachments at diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 7.39% of eyes developed delayed retinal tears by 6.24 years after initial PVD diagnosis. Of these tears, 50% occurred within 4.63 months of PVD diagnosis, and 63.46% occurred within 1 year of PVD diagnosis. Cox-Mantel log-rank analysis showed that those who were younger (age < 60 years), myopic, or had lattice degeneration were more likely to develop tears. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models controlling for other significant risk factors supported lattice degeneration as a likely risk factor for delayed retinal tear.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that 7.39% of patients with acute, symptomatic PVD without concurrent retinal tears develop delayed retinal tears by 6.24 years after PVD diagnosis, with many developing tears well after a typical 6-week follow-up time for PVD. Lattice degeneration is a significant risk factor for delayed tears. These findings can guide clinicians in establishing optimal follow-up protocols for patients with acute, symptomatic PVD.

Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) symptoms and acute tear risk — PVD leads to vitreous traction that is thought to cause most symptomatic retinal breaks that may lead to an RRD; symptoms include light flashes (photopsias) and floaters (myodesopsias) and such patients are at higher risk for RRD; at initial examination with acute PVD symptoms, the rate of retinal tears ranges from 5.4% to 8%; and there is a direct correlation between the amount of vitreous hemorrhage and the likelihood of a retinal tear.

### Endophthalmitis following intravitreal injections at a tertiary center: real-life data on incidence, risk factors, management strategies, and visual outcomes [^98b71516]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective study conducted at a tertiary center, endophthalmitis was observed in 13 cases (0.081%) after 21,339 intravitreal injections. Given that each intravitreal injection represents an independent risk exposure for endophthalmitis, the analysis was conducted at the injection level. In cases where patients received bilateral injections or multiple injections over time, endophthalmitis occurred following only one specific injection, while other injections remained uneventful. Our study presents real-life data from patients who received intravitreal injections under the same standard conditions at a single center, with a higher number of injections.

Intravitreal injections are frequently used in the treatment of retinal diseases. Although they are a quick and relatively simple procedure, complications such as retinal tears, detachments, cataracts, inflammation, and endophthalmitis — potentially resulting in vision loss — can occur.

The reported per-prosedure incidence of endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents ranges from 0.02 to 0.08. The largest study reporting the rates of endophthalmitis following anti-VEGF injections, a meta-analysis by Fileta et al. which reviewed 43 studies, identified 197 cases of endophthalmitis out of 350,535 intravitreal injections, resulting in an overall incidence rate of 0.056%. Another study by Dossarps et al. reported an endophthalmitis incidence of 0.021% after 316,576 intravitreal injections. Brynskov et al. did not report any case of endophthalmitis after 20,293 intravitreal injections, while another study found an incidence of 0.039%. Overall, the incidence of endophthalmitis observed in our study is consistent with the rates reported in the literature.

### Use of artificial tears in patients undergoing treatment with anti-VEGF intravitreal injections [^ef3b5800]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we consider that the use of intravitreal injections might affect the ocular surface, and we suggest that the use of artificial tears could help to keep the tear film stable, and therefore, lead to an improved quality of life for those patients receiving intravitreal injections. Future studies should be conducted with large samples, long follow-up periods, and considering more types of artificial tears available on the market to elucidate whether the tendency reported in our study becomes significant.

### Dual pathway inhibition with faricimab for previously treated neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular oedema: guidance from a UK panel of retina specialists [^31ba4cc4]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

General considerations when switching to faricimab among previously anti-VEGF-treated nAMD and DMO

Bilateral involvement

For bilateral involvement, clinicians ideally use the same intravitreal anti-VEGF agent for both eyes; clinicians should therefore consider switching both eyes at the same time if possible when switching between these agents. If bilateral injections are planned during the same visit, clinicians should use a separate batch of medication for each eye or reschedule another appointment if separate lots are not available. The safety and efficacy of faricimab administered in both eyes concurrently have not been studied.

Patient counselling and consent

Patients should be informed of potentially serious risks of intravitreal injection procedures as well as risks associated with intravitreal VEGF inhibitors. Evidence suggests that treatment with faricimab has similar adverse events to aflibercept and ranibizumab (Lucentis, Novartis).
Intraocular inflammation rates in phase III clinical trials with faricimab were low and comparable to aflibercept (Table 1). Post marketing, rare cases of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal occlusive vasculitis have been reported with the use of faricimab and aflibercept. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency, according to product label updates.
When initiating intravitreal VEGF inhibitor treatment, caution is advised in nAMD patients with a large and/or high PED who may be at increased risk of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear development. Several reports suggest that eyes with a baseline PED height ≥ 600 µm have an increased risk of RPE tear following intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. The frequency of RPE tear development through 2 years in the TENAYA and LUCERNE nAMD trials (pooled) was 2.9% with faricimab and 1.5% with aflibercept; most of these adverse events were reported as mild to moderate, without impact to vision and occurred during the loading phase.
Documented patient consent obtained prior to first intravitreal injection procedure typically applies for a course of repeated anti-VEGF treatments. Professional guidance recommends that repeat written consent should be obtained if there is a change to the treatment plan or drug used, change in the clinical condition and/or change in perceived benefit-risk to the patient.
Some patients may need a period of continued monthly faricimab dosing after a loading phase to maximise treatment response.

### Current and emerging treatment options for myopic choroidal neovascularization [^980b1c2e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment with aflibercept (VEGF trap-eye)

Aflibercept (Eylea®; Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc and Bayer) is the most recent member in the anti-VEGF arsenal. Its efficacy and safety for mCNV was evaluated in the ongoing phase III, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, 12-month MYRROR study in Asian patients (N = 121; NCT01249664). A single intravitreal aflibercept injection is administered, followed by a PRN regimen. After 6-month follow-up, a 12.1-letter improvement in BCVA is reported, compared with a 2-letter loss in those receiving sham injections. BCVA gains are maintained up to 12 months, as mentioned by Wong et al.

In conclusion, once mCNV is diagnosed, prompt treatment is suggested with a single intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF, followed by PRN dosing. Then, patients should be followed monthly to monitor the signs of activity of mCNV, seeking by questioning a decrease in vision, new or persistent metamorphopsia, and detecting disease activity by both clinical evaluation such as new hemorrhage on fundus examination and relevant imaging: OCT and/or angiography showing intraretinal or subretinal fluid or persistent leakage. Spectral domain OCT is actually the most useful tool for evaluating neovascular activity. A decrease in BCVA alone is not sufficient. It could indicate additional pathologies, such as myopic traction maculopathy (foveoschisis), macular hole, retinal tears, and rhegmatogenous detachments.

If there is a disease activity, another intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF is performed. A favorable long-term outcome can be achieved with a notably lower number of injections in cases of mCNV compared to other conditions such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). As the long-term safety and efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment of mCNV are unknown, we must not forget that, because VEGF has an important role in neuroprotection and retinal development also, anti-VEGF treatment may produce retinal impairment after a long period of administration. Moreover, we must not forget the likely risk of retinal detachment in myopic eyes submitted to repeated intravitreal injections. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF should be given only in case of resumption of activity of the mCNV. If there is no disease activity, patients should be controlled monthly the first 3 months. Then, visits will be considered every 3 months for the first year.

### Evaluation of safety for bilateral same-day intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy [^2e0e4803]. Retina (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore the incidence of complications after bilateral same-day intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapies in this retrospective interventional case series.

Methods

An electronic review of billing records was performed to identify all bilateral same-day intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections performed within a single group retina practice between January 6, 2006 and June 1, 2009. The charts were reviewed to identify the complications of endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, retinal tear, and retinal detachment.

Results

A total of 1,534 bilateral intravitreal injections (326 bevacizumab and 1,208 ranibizumab: 3,068 injections total) were performed in 367 patients. Three complications were identified. Two cases of unilateral culture-proven endophthalmitis occurred after bilateral intravitreal ranibizumab, and one case of unilateral acute intraocular inflammation occurred after bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab. In all three of these eyes, visual acuity returned to its preinjection level. No cases of retinal tear or retinal detachment were identified. The incidence of culture-proven endophthalmitis was 0.065%, and the incidence of acute intraocular inflammation was 0.033%.

Conclusion

The complication rates after bilateral same-day intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections seem to be similar to those after unilateral injections. Severe acute intraocular inflammation can occur unilaterally after same-day bilateral injections of bevacizumab.

### Suspending treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in cases of futility [^1aaf7409]. Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of retinal detachment, whereby fluid accumulation leads to the separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying RPE. Although the overall incidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment after anti-VEGF therapy is low (0%–0.67%), it may confound the ability of anti-VEGF to have a beneficial effect on the treatment of nAMD in affected patients.

In clinical practice, RPE tears typically occur in around 0% to 5% of nAMD cases during anti-VEGF treatment, – and the risk may increase in the presence of pigment epithelial detachment (PED). Similarly, in major clinical trials of aflibercept and ranibizumab, RPE tear was reported in < 1% of patients with nAMD after anti-VEGF treatment; however, this lower incidence could be due to the exclusion of patients with large PEDs from entering the trials. Clemens and Eterprovided evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients at high risk of developing RPE tear. Patients with PED at high risk of developing RPE tear were defined as showing one or more RPE tear risk factors at the beginning or during the course of anti-VEGF treatment. In such high-risk patients, it was recommended that a thorough examination should be performed after each anti-VEGF injection. If risk factors worsened or accumulated during anti-VEGF treatment, discontinuation of therapy was recommended pending re-evaluation of the PED lesion 1 to 2 weeks later; however, postponing therapy further carries the risk of progression of choroidal neovascularization.

Subretinal hemorrhage is an uncommon manifestation of nAMD whereby blood from the retinal or choroidal circulation accumulates between the RPE and the neurosensory retina. Large subretinal hemorrhage may result from anti-VEGF injection and cause severe visual impairment when the fovea is involved, requiring immediate intervention to reduce the risk of severe or permanent damage to vision. – Although anti-VEGF monotherapy is often advocated for the treatment of small subfoveal hemorrhages secondary to nAMD, vitrectomy in combination with tissue plasminogen activator and pneumatic displacement may be necessary for the treatment of extensive subretinal lesions of short duration, based on lesion thickness, diameter, and location. To address the lack of rigorous guidelines for the management of nAMD, the Vision Academy has issued a consensus Viewpoint article offering recommendations on defining, imaging, and treating subfoveal hemorrhage in nAMD.

### Current perspectives on ranibizumab [^70d70b25]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Safety

Numerous trials examining the efficacy and safety of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies have showed that, while frequent injections of anti-VEGF agents greatly reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with posterior segment neovascularization, these medications can also be associated with ocular and nonocular AEs and SAEs. In MARINA, presumed endophthalmitis, uveitis, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear, vitreous hemorrhage, and lens damage were reported with an incidence varying from 0% to 1.3% in treated groups. Additionally, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and vitreous detachment were reported in 0.4% and 0.8% of patients, respectively, in the sham group. In some patients, sterile uveitis was not distinguished definitively from endophthalmitis, and treatment with intravitreal antibiotics in a culture-negative patient was reported as endophthalmitis. An endophthalmitis rate of 1.0% or 0.05% per injection was reported in MARINA, and similar rates were also reported in ranibizumab-treated patients with RVO and DME. No endophthalmitis or serious intraocular inflammation was reported in PIER, and the AEs that occurred more frequently in treated groups were those commonly associated with intravitreal injections.

Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently. In infants with ROP, treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring.

### RISK OF INTRAOCULAR INFLAMMATION AFTER INJECTION OF ANTIVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR AGENTS: a meta-analysis [^001d1a0f]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This meta-analysis investigates the incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) after intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections in neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

Methods

A systematic search was performed on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central from January 2005 to April 2021. Randomized controlled trials comparing IOI after intravitreal bevacizumab, ranibizumab, brolucizumab, or aflibercept in neovascular age-related macular degeneration were included. Primary outcomes were sight-threatening IOI, final best-corrected visual acuity, and change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of other IOI events. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

Results

Overall, 11,460 unique studies were screened, of which 14 randomized controlled trials and 6,759 eyes at baseline were included. There was no difference between agents for the risk of endophthalmitis and retinal vascular occlusion. Compared with aflibercept, brolucizumab had a higher incidence of generalized IOI (risk ratio = 6.24, 95% confidence interval = [1.40–27.90]) and vitreous haze/floaters (risk ratio = 1.64, 95% confidence interval = [1.00–2.67]). There were no significant differences between comparators for other secondary end points.

Conclusion

There was no difference in the risk of severe sight-threatening IOI outcomes between intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor agents. There was a significantly higher risk of generalized IOI after brolucizumab relative to aflibercept. Our results alongside other recent safety findings suggest the need for further investigation in the risk-benefit profile of brolucizumab for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

### Retinal pigment epithelial tears after intravitreal bevacizumab injection for neovascular age-related macular degeneration [^6a74ffea]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To study retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears after off-label intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA) injection for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Eyes with a vascularized pigment epithelial detachment (PED) that developed an RPE tear were compared with eyes with a vascularized PED but without an RPE tear.

Methods

Nine retina specialists across the United States and in Europe participated in this retrospective case series. All eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab injection for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) over 12 months (October 2005 to September 2006) were included. Eyes without all three confirmed tests (fluorescein angiography, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography) were excluded from analysis. Statistical analyses were performed on multiple characteristics of eyes with a vascularized PED that did and did not develop an RPE tear.

Results

Among 2,785 intravitreal bevacizumab injections for 1,064 eyes, RPE tears were found in 22 eyes in 22 patients (2.2%). A vascularized PED was present in 21 of 22 eyes that developed an RPE tear (17.1% of PED eyes; 15, 100% occult CNV; 6, predominantly occult CNV). Mean interval from bevacizumab injections to RPE tears was 37.3 days. Mean follow-up time was 124.9 days. Mean subfoveal PED size was larger for eyes with tears than for those without tears (13.97 mm vs 9.9 mm, respectively; P = 0.01; odds ratio, 1.09). There was substantially smaller mean ratio of CNV size to PED size for eyes with tears than for those without tears (27.9% vs 67.6%, respectively; P = 0.005). Mean pre-bevacizumab injection best-corrected Snellen visual acuity was 20/162, and mean post-RPE tear best-corrected visual acuity was 20/160 (P = 0.48).

Conclusion

Large PED size is a predictor for RPE tears, and a small ratio of CNV size to PED size (< 50%) is more common in eyes with RPE tears. Vision may be preserved despite RPE tears.

### Treatment patterns and long-term outcomes in anti-VEGF-treated macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion: a retrospective observational study [^2caea9d4]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

This study reported real-world visual acuity (VA), treatment patterns, and ocular safety outcomes from patients with macular oedema secondary to branch, central, or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (BRVO, CRVO, HRVO) treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Methods

Data were collected from Medisoft electronic medical records across 16 NHS ophthalmology sites in England over 60 months.

Results

3511/3465 eyes/patients with BRVO and 3568/3514 eyes/patients with CRVO or HRVO were included; < 2% of patients had bilateral RVO and had both eyes included. VA change from index anti-VEGF treatment was lower with longer follow-up. In BRVO eyes, mean (95% CI) change in VA from index was +11.2 (10.6, 11.7) approximate Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters at Month (M)6 and +8.3 (6.7, 10.0) at M60. Mean (95% CI) change in VA for CRVO/HRVO eyes was +11.5 (10.7, 12.3) approximate ETDRS letters at M6 and +7.0 (4.8, 9.2) at M60. Eyes receiving more injections displayed greater average VA gains. Median (Q1-Q3) annual number of anti-VEGF injections was lower in BRVO and CRVO/HRVO eyes with longer follow-up: M12, 7.0 (5.0–8.0) and 6.0 (4.0–8.0); M60, 2.0 (0.0–5.0) and 1.0 (0.0–5.0). Ocular safety outcome incidence through 60 months was low (endophthalmitis, retinal tears, and retinal detachment < 1%).

Conclusions

VA improvements were observed soon after anti-VEGF treatment, but were lower with longer follow-up through 60 months, alongside lower annual injection numbers, suggesting that current single-target intravitreal anti-VEGFs may not be sufficiently durable for long-term RVO management in routine practice.

### Optimal management of idiopathic macular holes [^69079ef9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Retinal tears and detachment

Paradoxically the incidence of retinal breaks and detachments was lower in the OCP group than the placebo (1.9% versus 4.3%, respectively) in the Phase III trials. In both groups, however, the majority of retinal tears and detachments were noted during or shortly after vitrectomy.

Since launch a further 17 cases (0.4%) of retinal tears and/or breaks have been reported separately from vitrectomy surgery as might be expected with the creation of vitreous separation. The mean time to onset of these cases has been reported as 20 days (range 8–68 days).

Comment

OCP is a new treatment option for small- and medium-sized IMH with VMA, although its exact clinical role is an evolving story. Its price is greater than vitrectomy surgery in some health care systems. It is important to counsel patients realistically, regarding the rates of success with intravitreal OCP which are much lower than with vitrectomy surgery particularly in medium-sized holes. It should not be used in large holes. Further factors predicting success in individual cases are needed to refine its optimum use. The incidence and characteristics of AEs have been generally similar between the premarketing and postmarketing periods, although more experience will be needed to assess the long-term morbidity in some patients particularly those with photoreceptor dysfunction and visual loss. In patients treated with OCP, careful monitoring and immediate evaluation of any symptomatic patient are paramount. Surgical treatment should not be delayed if closure does not occur by 4 weeks post OCP injection.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factors in combination with vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^b0f18d08]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitrectomy is an established treatment for the complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). However, a number of complications can occur during and after vitrectomy for PDR. These include bleeding and the creation of retinal holes during surgery, and bleeding, retinal detachment and scar tissue on the retina after surgery. These complications can limit vision, require further surgery and delay recovery. The use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents injected into the eye before surgery has been proposed to reduce the occurrence of these complications. Anti-VEGF agents can reduce the amount and vascularity of abnormal new vessels associated with PDR, facilitating their dissection during surgery, reducing intra- and postoperative bleeding, and potentially improving outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of perioperative anti-VEGF use on the outcomes of vitrectomy for the treatment of complications for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 22 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at the use of anti-VEGFs and the incidence of complications in people undergoing vitrectomy for PDR. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed and extracted the data. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The critical outcomes of the review were the mean difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between study arms at six (± three) months after the primary vitrectomy, the incidence of early postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH, within four weeks postoperatively), the incidence of late POVCH (occurring more than four weeks postoperatively), the incidence of revision surgery for POVCH within six months, the incidence of revision surgery for recurrent traction/macular pucker of any type and/or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment within six months and vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) measures. Important outcomes included the proportion of people with a visual acuity of counting fingers (1.8 logMAR or worse), the number of operative retinal breaks reported and the frequency of silicone oil tamponade required at time of surgery.

Main Results

The current review includes 28 RCTs that looked at the pre- or intraoperative use of intravitreal anti-VEGFs to improve the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries (11 from China, three from Iran, two from Italy, two from Mexico and the remaining studies from South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia and Pakistan). The inclusion criteria for entry into the studies were the well-recognised complications of proliferative retinopathy: non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment involving the macula or combined tractional rhegmatogenous detachment. The included studies randomised a total of 1914 eyes. We identified methodological issues in all of the included studies. Risk of bias was highest for masking of participants and investigators, and a number of studies were unclear when describing randomisation methods and sequence allocation. Participants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better BCVA at six months compared to people undergoing vitrectomy alone (mean difference (MD) -0.25 logMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.11; 13 studies, 699 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduced the incidence of early POVCH (12% versus 31%, risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58; 14 studies, 1038 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Perioperative anti-VEGF use was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of late POVCH (10% versus 23%, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74; 11 studies, 579 eyes; high-certainty evidence). The need for revision surgery for POVCH occurred less frequently in the anti-VEGF group compared with control, but the confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (4% versus 13%, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; 4 studies 207 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Similar imprecisely measured effects were seen for revision surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (5% versus 11%, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.66; 4 studies, 145 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Anti-VEGFs reduce the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks (12% versus 31%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59; 12 studies, 915 eyes; high-certainty evidence) and the need for silicone oil (19% versus 41%, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.80; 10 studies, 591 eyes; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available on quality of life outcomes or the proportion of participants with visual acuity of counting fingers or worse.

Authors' Conclusions

The perioperative use of anti-VEGF reduces the risk of late POVCH, probably results in lower early POVCH risk and may improve visual outcomes. It also reduces the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks. The evidence is very uncertain about its effect on the need for silicone oil tamponade. The reported complications from its use appear to be low. Agreement on variables included and outcome standardisation is required in trials studying vitrectomy for PDR.

### Revakinagene taroretcel-lwey (Encelto) [^a553f9c8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Vision Loss

Severe vision loss defined as three or more lines of visual acuity loss [≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters] has occurred following ENCELTO implantation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of vision loss and manage as clinically indicated.

5.2 Infectious Endophthalmitis

Infectious endophthalmitis may occur following ENCELTO implantation. Signs and symptoms of infectious endophthalmitis include progressively worsening eye pain, vision loss, or scleral and conjunctival injection. To mitigate the risk of endophthalmitis, use proper aseptic surgical technique for ENCELTO implantation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of infectious endophthalmitis. Remove ENCELTO implant if infectious endophthalmitis occurs and manage symptoms according to clinical practice.

5.3 Retinal Tear and Detachment

Retinal tears and retinal detachment may occur following ENCELTO implantation. Signs and symptoms of retinal tears include acute onset of flashing lights, floaters, and/or loss of visual acuity. Signs and symptoms of retinal detachment may include progressive visual field loss and/or loss of visual acuity. Use standard vitreoretinal surgical techniques during ENCELTO implantation to minimize the risk of retinal tears and retinal detachment. Monitor for any signs or symptoms of retinal tear and/or retinal detachment. Treat rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and retinal tears promptly. Remove ENCELTO implant, if vitrectomy with a complete gas fill or silicone oil fill is required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

5.4 Vitreous Hemorrhage

Vitreous hemorrhage, which may result in temporary vision loss, has occurred following ENCELTO implantation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients receiving antithrombotic medication (e.g., oral anticoagulants, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be at increased risk of vitreous hemorrhage. To reduce the risk of vitreous hemorrhage, interrupt antithrombotic medications prior to the ENCELTO implantation. Vitrectomy surgery may be necessary to clear severe, recurrent, or non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage. If the patient has a late onset vitreous hemorrhage (greater than one year following ENCELTO implantation surgery), examine the ENCELTO implantation site for possible implant extrusion. If implant extrusion has occurred, surgically reposition ENCELTO [see Implant Extrusion (5.5)].

### Effect of oral tranexamic acid on macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion or diabetes [^20184626]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Macular edema (ME) is a major cause of visual impairment in patients with retinal vascular disorders, such as retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and diabetic ME (DME). Although the pathogenesis of ME is complex, the most direct mechanism is the disruption of the blood–retinal barrier. Because vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is believed to play a key role in the disruption of the blood–retinal barrier, the use of intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents to treat ME has been increasing during the last decade. Anti-VEGF therapy is regarded as the first-line treatment in a majority of ME cases, and numerous studies have demonstrated its efficacy. However, there is a risk of severe complications, including infectious endophthalmitis and retinal detachment, arising from the use of intravitreal injection, although these are relatively rare. Systemic side effects, including an increase in thromboembolic events, and kidney toxicity, have also been reported. Although ocular side effects have not yet been clearly defined, some unfavorable phenomena have been reported, including choroidal thinning, retinal pigment epithelium tear, uveitis, retinal venous occlusion, retinal artery occlusion, and ocular hypertension.–In addition, prolonged and extreme inhibition of VEGF, which is induced by repeated injections, may interfere with the physiological function of the retina. Moreover, commercially available anti-VEGF agents are expensive and so have important social implications. Given the concerns surrounding the use of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, alternative treatments and methods to decrease the frequency of injection require investigation.

### Retinal pigment epithelium tear after intravitreal aflibercept injection [^1cda827e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

To report a case complicated with a retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tear after intravitreal aflibercept injection. A 78-year-old man had deteriorated visual acuity in his left eye. Fluorescein angiography showed occult choroidal neovascularization. Optical coherence tomography showed a serous retinal detachment and fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment. He was diagnosed as typical age-related macular degeneration associated with pigment epithelial detachment and treatment consisting of three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of aflibercept was planned. A month after the initial injection, his visual acuity had not improved. The red-free photograph showed an area of RPE defect inferior to the fovea. The fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography clearly demonstrated the presence of an RPE tear. A second injection of aflibercept was performed due to a remaining serous retinal detachment. Although this is a single case and RPE tears may occur as a spontaneous complication of age-related macular degeneration patients, the risk of a tear should be discussed when considering aflibercept treatment for typical age-related macular degeneration patients with pigment epithelial detachment as there might be a risk for developing an RPE tear.

### Prospective evaluation of the incidence and risk factors for the development of RPE tears after high-and low-dose ranibizumab therapy [^6b51cb99]. Retina (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To prospectively determine the incidence and risk factors for retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears in eyes with vascularized pigment epithelial detachments (PED) and exudative age-related macular degeneration receiving antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

Methods

Eyes were prospectively randomized into 1 of 4 arms: 1) 0.5 mg of ranibizumab monthly for 12 months; 2) 0.5 mg of ranibizumab monthly for 3 months and then pro re nata on the basis of clinical and optical coherence tomography-guided indications; 3) high-dose 2.0 mg of ranibizumab monthly for 12 months; or 4) 2.0 mg of ranibizumab monthly for 3 months and then pro re nata thereafter. All PEDs were measured for height, greatest linear diameter, and surface area at baseline. The incidence of RPE tears in the entire 4-arm cohort was determined at the end of 12 months. Eyes were divided into two groups (tear vs. nontear) and statistically compared to determine risk factors for the development of RPE tear.

Results

Of 37 eyes, a total of 5 developed postranibizumab RPE tears during the course of the study (incidence 14%). Four of the 5 tears occurred in the high-dose 2.0-mg groups. Baseline PED height, surface area, and greatest linear diameter were significantly greater in the group that developed RPE tears versus the nontear group (P = 0.018, 0.031, and 0.048, respectively). There were significantly more eyes with PED height > 550 microns in the RPE tear group (4 of 5, 80%) compared with the nontear group (9 of 32, 18%) (P = 0.042). The presence of PED height > 550 microns was associated with an increased tear rate from 14% to 31%. Furthermore, retrospective identification of a ring sign or Grade 1 tear at baseline, in addition to PED height > 550 microns, was associated with a further increase in the tear rate to 67%.

Conclusion

In this study, the prospective incidence of RPE tears was ∼14%. A baseline PED height > 550 microns and presence of a Grade 1 tear, or positive ring sign, were identified as high-risk factors for the subsequent development of an RPE tear.
