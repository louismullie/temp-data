## Question

first-line tx for esbl bacteremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line treatment for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales bacteremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why ESBL bacteremia is high-stakes. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials and contemporary guidelines. Next, I will examine alternatives like piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and cephamycins, and check where they fit. After that, I need to consider special populations such as critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients and source control. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note exceptions and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and stakes. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales bloodstream infections carry higher mortality and treatment failure risks than non-ESBL bacteremias, and delays in appropriate therapy worsen outcomes, so empiric and definitive choices matter for survival and recurrence risk [^7b547b83] [^97c65295].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence base. The MERINO randomized controlled trial directly compared piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem for ceftriaxone-resistant E. coli or Klebsiella bacteremia and found a 30-day mortality of 12.3% with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 3.7% with meropenem, establishing meropenem's superiority for ESBL bacteremia; this is the pivotal trial that shifted practice toward carbapenems as first-line for ESBL bloodstream infections [^be16052a] [^70e3a939].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify how guidelines interpret this. Multiple IDSA guidance documents consistently recommend a carbapenem as preferred therapy for ESBL-E infections outside the urinary tract, with meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem as acceptable options, and they explicitly advise against piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL bacteremia even if in vitro susceptibility is reported, given MERINO and related data [^be16052a] [^38b90ac5] [^ad9c486b].

> I will now examine piperacillin-tazobactam more closely. Observational and meta-analytic data had previously suggested noninferiority of BL/BLIs to carbapenems, but MERINO overturned that inference in the RCT setting; moreover, CLSI breakpoint changes and PK/PD considerations show that susceptibility on paper does not reliably translate to clinical success in ESBL bacteremia, reinforcing that piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used for ESBL bloodstream infections outside of narrow, stewardship-defined contexts like low-risk urinary-source infections with very low MICs and close monitoring [^4fe70cfb] [^5b280017] [^ad9c486b].

> Wait, let me verify the stance on cefepime. I initially thought cefepime might be reasonable if the MIC is low, but I should double-check that. IDSA advises avoiding cefepime for ESBL-E infections, including bacteremia, because ESBLs can hydrolyze cefepime, MIC testing is unreliable for ESBL detection, and retrospective data show higher failure and mortality with cefepime compared with carbapenems in ESBL bacteremia; so cefepime should not be used for ESBL bloodstream infections despite in vitro susceptibility [^9c8963d8] [^e6589f87].

> Let me consider cephamycins like cefoxitin. Several retrospective ICU studies suggest cefoxitin may perform comparably to carbapenems in selected ESBL-Klebsiella bacteremias, with less selection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas, but these are observational, heterogeneous, and not guideline-endorsed; IDSA does not recommend cephamycins for ESBL-E infections pending better data, so I should not elevate cefoxitin to first-line status despite intriguing signals [^a15966c1] [^e8ab118e].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In critically ill patients or those with hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred over ertapenem due to pharmacokinetic considerations and observational data linking ertapenem to higher mortality in hypoalbuminemia; ESCMID allows ertapenem in non-shock ESBL bacteremia, but I should caution that this is a conditional recommendation and may not apply to ICU or hypoalbuminemic patients [^be16052a] [^e8ab118e].

> Next, I should review source control and duration, because antibiotics alone are insufficient. Prompt identification and management of the source of bacteremia, along with appropriate early effective therapy, improve outcomes; typical durations are about 7–14 days depending on source control and clinical response, with step-down to oral TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones only if the patient is stable, source control is adequate, and susceptibility is confirmed [^12f4724c] [^4cb0586c].

> But wait, what if carbapenem resistance is a concern or the isolate is non-CTX-M? I should confirm that newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors and cefiderocol are generally reserved for carbapenem-resistant organisms rather than ESBL-E, and that emerging data on non-CTX-M ESBLs are hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing; thus, these agents should not displace carbapenems for straightforward ESBL bacteremia without CRE risk factors [^edefd257] [^e0bba9db].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation. For ESBL-producing Enterobacterales bacteremia, first-line definitive therapy is a carbapenem, with meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin preferred in critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients, and ertapenem reasonable in selected non-critically ill patients with normal albumin; piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and cephamycins should not be used for ESBL bloodstream infections outside of research or exceptional stewardship contexts, and source control plus timely therapy remain essential to good outcomes [^be16052a] [^38b90ac5] [^b8fade50].

Carbapenems are the **first-line therapy** for ESBL bacteremia, with meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin preferred in critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients [^be16052a] [^38b90ac5]. Piperacillin-tazobactam is **not recommended** due to higher mortality and clinical failure in RCTs and observational studies [^be16052a] [^694efa1f]. Cefepime should be avoided even if susceptible because of inferior outcomes [^9c8963d8] [^e6589f87]. For stable patients with adequate source control and susceptible isolates, oral step-down with TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone is reasonable after clinical improvement [^4cb0586c] [^be16052a].

---

## Recommended first-line therapy

Carbapenems are the **preferred first-line therapy** for ESBL bacteremia [^be16052a] [^1eb525b5]. Meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred in critically ill patients or those with hypoalbuminemia due to superior pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes [^be16052a] [^38b90ac5]. Ertapenem is an alternative for stable patients without severe illness or hypoalbuminemia, offering once-daily dosing and convenience [^be16052a] [^b8fade50].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting carbapenems

- **MERINO trial**: A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that piperacillin-tazobactam was inferior to meropenem for ESBL bacteremia, with significantly higher 30-day mortality (12.3% vs 3.7%) and clinical failure rates [^be16052a] [^70e3a939].

- **Observational studies**: Multiple observational studies have consistently shown improved survival and lower treatment failure with carbapenems compared to piperacillin-tazobactam and other alternatives [^694efa1f] [^b8b72a89].

- **Guideline recommendations**: IDSA and ESCMID guidelines strongly recommend carbapenems as first-line therapy for ESBL bacteremia, particularly in severe infections or critically ill patients [^be16052a] [^1eb525b5].

---

## Alternative therapies and their limitations

| **Alternative therapy** | **Limitations and considerations** |
|-|-|
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | - Higher mortality and clinical failure in RCTs and observational studies [^be16052a] [^694efa1f] <br/> - Not recommended for ESBL bacteremia [^ad9c486b] |
| Cefepime | - Inferior outcomes even when in vitro susceptible [^9c8963d8] [^e6589f87] <br/> - Avoided due to ESBL hydrolysis and clinical failure risk [^9c8963d8] |
| Cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin) | - Limited evidence and mixed results [^e8ab118e] <br/> - Not recommended by IDSA pending more data [^e8ab118e] |
| Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) | - Useful for oral step-down if susceptible and patient stable [^4cb0586c] [^be16052a] <br/> - Not recommended as initial IV therapy due to resistance concerns [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific considerations

- **Critically ill patients**: Meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred due to superior pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes [^be16052a] [^38b90ac5].

- **Stable patients without severe illness**: Ertapenem is a reasonable alternative offering once-daily dosing and convenience [^be16052a] [^b8fade50].

- **Patients with hypoalbuminemia**: Meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred due to concerns with ertapenem clearance and clinical failure [^be16052a] [^38b90ac5].

- **Oral step-down therapy**: TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones are reasonable options for stable patients with adequate source control and demonstrated susceptibility [^4cb0586c] [^be16052a].

---

## Duration of therapy

The **typical duration** is 7–14 days, tailored to clinical response, source control, and patient-specific factors [^12f4724c]. Shorter courses (7–10 days) may suffice with adequate source control and clinical response, whereas longer courses (10–14 days) are reserved for complicated infections, slow response, or immunocompromised hosts [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Carbapenems are the **first-line therapy** for ESBL bacteremia, with meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin preferred in critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients [^be16052a] [^38b90ac5]. Piperacillin-tazobactam is not recommended due to inferior outcomes, and cefepime should be avoided even if susceptible [^be16052a] [^9c8963d8]. For stable patients with adequate source control and susceptible isolates, oral step-down with TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone is reasonable after clinical improvement [^4cb0586c] [^be16052a].

## References

### Is It time to rethink the notion of carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections? A critical review [^0122c8f3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To present systematic recommendations for carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections (BSIs) derived from a critical review of clinical data.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE databases (January 1, 2012, to June 30, 2017) was performed using key MESH terms: ESBL or extended-spectrum β-lactamases and bacteremia or bloodstream infection with piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, cefepime, cephamycins, carbapenem, doripenem, meropenem, and ertapenem. References within articles of interest were also evaluated.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language trials were considered, and results were limited to clinical efficacy trials. Articles were screened by title and abstract for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Studies comparing noncarbapenem versus carbapenem therapy for ESBL BSIs were critically analyzed to identify heterogeneity among studies. Data abstracted included empirical or definitive therapy, patient population, dosing, source of infection and severity, infectious etiology, and outcome.

Conclusions

Completely sparing carbapenem therapy cannot be justified among patients with ESBL BSIs. Determining the source of infection is critical to identify patients for whom carbapenem-sparing therapy is appropriate.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection — carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

### Current evidence for therapy of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia [^b5e05467]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article aims to give a state-of-the-art assessment of treatment options for bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In particular, this review assesses whether current data support 'carbapenem-sparing options' for treatment of these serious infections.

Recent Findings

The MERINO trial refuted earlier observational studies some of which showed equivalence in outcomes between beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and carbapenems for treatment of bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Although numerous factors influence mortality following bloodstream infection, the variability in piperacillin/tazobactam MICs observed in the MERINO trial make this a less secure option than meropenem. However, the search for carbapenem-sparing options continues with four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in progress and a number of other options in clinical development.

Summary

Hard outcomes from RCTs are still needed before intravenous carbapenems can be displaced as the treatment of choice for ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^868445cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^9c8963d8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamases infections: what is the current role of new β-lactams / β-lactamase inhibitors? [^17c476c7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The widespread diffusion of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriales currently represents a major threat for public health worldwide. Carbapenems are currently considered the first-line choice for serious ESBL infections. However, the dramatic global increase in ESBL prevalence has led to a significant overuse of carbapenems that has promoted the selection and spread of carbapenemases, which might further prejudicated our ability to treat infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, strategies to limit the use of carbapenems should be implemented.

Recent Findings

Although piperacillin-tazobactam should no longer be considered an alternative to carbapenems for definitive treatment of bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing strains, it might still represent an alternative for step-down therapy or for low-to-moderate severity infection originating from urinary or biliary sources and when piperacillin-tazobactam minimum inhibitory concentration of 4mg/l or less. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious ESBL infections. New β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI), including cefepime-enmetazobactam, ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam, aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam, are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy relative to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/β-lactamase inhibitors remain to be clarified.

Summary

New BL/BLI have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their administering for ESBL infections.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: an emerging public-health concern [^54a21c7e]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

The medical community relies on clinical expertise and published guidelines to assist physicians with choices in empirical therapy for system-based infectious syndromes, such as community-acquired pneumonia and urinary-tract infections (UTIs). From the late 1990s, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (mostly Escherichia coli) that produce extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs), such as the CTX-M enzymes, have emerged within the community setting as an important cause of UTIs. Recent reports have also described ESBL-producing E coli as a cause of bloodstream infections associated with these community-onset UTIs. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Thus, more rapid diagnostic testing of ESBL-producing bacteria and the possible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteraemia associated with UTIs are required.

### Diagnosis and treatment of extended-spectrum and ampC β-lactamase-producing organisms [^6505c50d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the laboratory diagnosis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and evaluate potential treatment options.

Data Sources

A PubMed search, restricted to English-language articles, was conducted (1966-May 2007) using the search terms ESBL, AmpC, diagnosis, detection, carbapenem, ertapenem, fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin, cefepime, tigecycline, and colistin. Additional references were identified through review of bibliographies of identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that evaluated laboratory methods for the detection of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases and/or the treatment of these organisms were reviewed. All articles that were deemed to be clinically pertinent were included and critically evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Numerous laboratory techniques are available for the detection of ESBLs. In contrast, laboratory techniques for detection of AmpC beta-lactamases are limited, particularly for plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Routine microbiologic testing may not detect ESBLs or AmpC beta-lactamases. Optimal antibiotic treatment options are derived from limited observational studies and case reports. Randomized clinical trials evaluating appropriate antibiotic treatment options are lacking. In vitro susceptibility does not always correlate with clinical outcomes. The use of imipenem was associated with the lowest incidence of mortality in patients with bacteremia due to ESBL-producing organisms.

Conclusions

Laboratory detection of ESBLs for most organisms is possible with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-recommended testing. However, these tests can be associated with both false negative and false positive results, particularly with organisms that harbor both ESBL- and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. No established guidelines exist for the detection of AmpC beta-lactamases. Imipenem and meropenem are superior to other antibiotics for the treatment of serious infections due to ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. While in vitro data demonstrate that tigecycline, ertapenem, and colistin might be potential choices, clinical experience is lacking.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^6742a4f7]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Although our study shows no difference in the total number of cefoxitin-resistant bacteria selected between the two groups, some results are interesting. Firstly, as expected, there were more beta-lactamase AmpC-producing Enterobacterales selected in patients previously treated with cefoxitin. Secondly, carbapenem-treated patients selected significantly more Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including carbapenem-resistant strains, within 30 days of bacteremia. Cefoxitin therefore might be interesting to avoid the administration of carbapenems, in line with the current policy of carbapenem sparing.

There are some limitations with our study. First, this was a non-randomized retrospective observational study with the inherent shortcomings of these studies. At baseline, our two treatment groups were not comparable on several criteria, with more severe patients overall in the carbapenem group, probably due to an indication bias. Nevertheless, the variables with potential impact on outcome were searched and a PS-based matched analysis was performed to control for potential bias on antibiotic selection. It should be emphasized that considering SMD values, some differences existed between the two groups after PS matching but with a SMD value < 0.5. Second, although our study contains, to our knowledge, the largest published number of patients with ESBL-KP bacteremia treated with cefoxitin in ICU, the sample size was still small. Third, although there were no significant differences in primary and secondary endpoints, using a PS-based matched analysis, we acknowledge that the 95% confidence intervals for propensity-matched outcomes are very wide and include the possibility of harm. Fourth, cefoxitin was mainly administered on a discontinuous basis, whereas several recent studies confirm that continuous administration of large doses of cefoxitin appeared necessary to achieve the recommended beta-lactam PK/PD target in critically ill patients.

In conclusion, our results suggest that cefoxitin as definitive antibiotic therapy could be an alternative for ESBL-KP bacteremia in intensive care unit, especially if its origin is a central catheter or urinary tract infection, allowing carbapenem sparing and less selection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Further research, such as prospective interventional studies, is needed to define the exact efficacy of cefoxitin and confirm our findings.

### Antibiotic therapy for Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: implications of production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^01310e43]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta -lactamase (ESBL) production by Klebsiella pneumonia approaches 50% in some countries, with particularly high rates in eastern Europe and Latin America. No randomized trials have ever been performed on treatment of bacteremia due to ESBL-producing organisms; existing data comes only from retrospective, single-institution studies. In a prospective study of 455 consecutive episodes of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in 12 hospitals in 7 countries, 85 episodes were due to an ESBL-producing organism. Failure to use an antibiotic active against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was associated with extremely high mortality. Use of a carbapenem (primarily imipenem) was associated with a significantly lower 14-day mortality than was use of other antibiotics active in vitro. Multivariate analysis including other predictors of mortality showed that use of a carbapenem during the 5-day period after onset of bacteremia due to an ESBL-producing organism was independently associated with lower mortality. Antibiotic choice is particularly important in seriously ill patients with infections due to ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^335c2343]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

In a recent review, Harris et al. suggested three clinical scenarios in which β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors might be appropriate instead of using a carbapenem in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms: urinary tract infections (including with bacteremia); nonurinary tract infections in which the isolate is susceptible at a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); and when adequate source control has been achieved.

In a retrospective study of monomicrobial bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing organisms, patients were definitively treated with cefepime if there was in vitro activity to that antibiotic or with a carbapenem. Patients who received cefepime as definitive therapy were more likely to have clinical failure, and the survival analysis consistently found that individuals who received cefepime therapy had a lower survival rate. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that cefepime empirical therapy was inferior to carbapenem in the treatment of patients with bacteremia due to cefepime-susceptible ESBL-producing bacteria. It is noteworthy that the cefepime breakpoint for susceptibility in this study was ≤ 8 μg/ml, which may have overstated the susceptibility rate, compared with the more recent breakpoints of ≤ 2 μg/ml from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and ≤ 1 μg/ml from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), which would result in lower rates of susceptibility.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^be16052a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^358b9dc6]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary and secondary endpoints

The primary endpoint was the 30-day clinical success rate defined as a composite endpoint: 30-day survival after inclusion, absence of relapse and no change of antibiotic therapy before the planned end of treatment.

Secondary endpoints were (i) all-cause mortality at 7 and 30 days post-inclusion, (ii) relapse of infection, defined as a new ESBL-KP bacteremia between the end of treatment and 30 days, (iii) change of antibiotic therapy before the scheduled end of treatment due to the onset of a new co-infection, or caused by clinical or microbiological failure, (iv) microbiological failure defined as the persistence of ESBL-KP-positive blood culture after two days of definitive antibiotic therapy until the end of treatment and (v) selection of all bacteria resistant to cefoxitin or carbapenems identified in any microbiological sample after 24 h of definitive antibiotic therapy until the end of follow-up.

### Antibiotic resistance and the risk of recurrent bacteremia [^a6919ebe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

In our study, the estimated crude population attributable effect of nonsusceptibility to first-line antibiotic treatment among all species combined is 40 recurrent episodes of bacteremia per year, of which almost half are caused by the widely considered low-grade enterococcal pathogens. This finding emphasizes that antibiotic resistance currently has — at most — a very minor impact on the population health in the Netherlands. This most likely results from effective infection control in Dutch hospitals and the continuing efforts made to reduce unnecessary and inappropriate antibiotic use. Naturally, numbers of recurrent bacteremia in general, and bacteremia attributable to antibiotic nonsusceptibility in particular, will be higher in countries with less effective infection control and more liberal antibiotic use. Yet, our analysis quantifies the risk of recurrent infection in individual patients, and we consider this risk to be mostly independent from the level of antibiotic resistance in other patients.

In our study, the absolute risk of developing recurrent infections with an antibiotic nonsusceptible variant, after a first bacteremia episode caused by a susceptible strain, was low. The highest risk (0.4%) was observed for bacteremia caused by Pseudomonas species, in which resistance to ceftazidime in Pseudomonas species may develop during treatment due to selection of mutants with changed porins and/or expressing efflux pumps. The transition from susceptibility to resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae requires the acquisition of either a plasmid with an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) gene or overexpression of ampC mutations, which may largely depend on the presence of such genes in other bacteria of the microbiome. Yet, with current estimates of the prevalence of intestinal carriage with ESBL-producing bacteria of 5%–10% among Dutch inhabitants, the observed absolute risk of 0.1% suggests that such within-host horizontal gene transfer events do not occur with high frequency. This also holds for S. aureus where a phenotype switch (from MSSA to MRSA) would require acquisition of the mec A gene. In the setting of Dutch hospitals, with low prevalence of MRSA, such a change in susceptibility would be more indicative of an infection caused by a different bacterial species, rather than a relapse of the initial infection. This is different for enterococci, where the prevalence of carriage with ARE in hospitalized patients is high (up to 35% in high-risk wards such as hematology and the intensive care unit). Antibiotic treatment for susceptible enterococci may select for acquisition through cross-transmission of ARE carriage and subsequent infection, which occurred in 0.2% of all first bacteremia episodes in our study.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases and clinical outcomes: current data [^a86cc37b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Nosocomial infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria complicate therapy and limit treatment options. However, the clinical significance of infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria remains unclear. A critical examination of the literature provides divergent views of the effect of ESBL carriage on morbidity and mortality and suggests that ESBL production may have its most marked effect on ceftazidime. Effective strategies for the empirical and directed treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens include the use of carbapenems and, possibly, the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Studies indicate that the use of cefepime to treat serious nosocomial infections (e.g., bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections) is associated with high rates of microbiological and clinical success. The probability of attaining time above the minimum inhibitory concentration targets of at least 70% of the dosing interval, an important pharmacodynamic indicator of clinical success, is higher with cefepime than with other antimicrobials against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exhibiting ESBL phenotypes. However, for non-ESBL-producing strains, there is no difference in the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration between ceftazidime and cefepime. When used appropriately in institutional settings, cefepime reduces the overall use of cephalosporins, thereby decreasing selection pressure for presumptive ESBL-producing pathogens.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^9d38d9f2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial-resistant infections are commonly encountered in US hospitals and result in significant morbidity and mortality. This guidance document provides recommendations for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa).

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated common questions regarding the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Based on review of the published literature and clinical experience, the panel provide recommendations and associated rationale for each recommendation. Because of significant differences in the molecular epidemiology of resistance and the availability of specific anti-infective agents globally, this document focuses on treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the United States.

Results

Approaches to empiric treatment selection, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are briefly discussed. The majority of guidance focuses on preferred and alternative treatment recommendations for antimicrobial-resistant infections, assuming that the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing results are known. Treatment recommendations apply to both adults and children.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections will continue to challenge clinicians. This guidance document is current as of 17 September 2020. Updates to this guidance document will occur periodically as new data emerge. Furthermore, the panel will expand recommendations to include other problematic gram-negative pathogens in future versions. The most current version of the guidance including the date of publication can be found at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^3ad70182]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^eda3ea0d]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1990s, the emergence and diffusion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) has been a global concern. In 2021, the rate of invasive ESBL-E isolates has reached 7.5% in French healthcare settings. ESBL-E infections treatment is becoming challenging due to high frequency of co-resistance mechanisms to other antibiotics classes, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; therefore, therapeutic options are often very limited. Carbapenems have long been considered to be the reference treatment for infections caused by ESBL-E. Unfortunately, their large prescription constitutes a strong selective pressure, which has led to the emergence and rapid worldwide spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.

One possible alternative to carbapenems could be cefoxitin, a cephamycin developed in the 1970s, resistant to ESBL hydrolysis and highly active against ESBL-E in vitro. Currently, cefoxitin is the standard treatment for perioperative surgical prophylaxis, and is proposed as second-line antibiotic therapy for acute ESBL- Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) pyelonephritis in adults. Indeed, cefoxitin and other cephamycins have been shown to be effective in several small cases series of mild infections, such as urinary tract infections and bacteremia without signs of severity. In a multicenter retrospective study, Senard et al. showed no significant difference in clinical and microbiological success between cefoxitin and carbapenems as the definitive treatment of ESBL-EC urinary tract infections in men.

ESBL- Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) infections are also common nosocomial infection, but clinical data on their treatment with cefoxitin are scarce. In Guadeloupe University Hospital, the observed incidence rate of nosocomial ESBL-E infections is one of the highest in France, with a large predominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Since 2015, to limit the use of carbapenems, antibiotic guidelines in our intensive care unit (ICU) proposed cefoxitin rather than carbapenems as definitive treatment in cefoxitin-susceptible ESBL-E systemic infections, whenever clinical condition and microbiological findings are compatible. Until now this therapeutic strategy had not been formally evaluated. The aim of our study was thus to compare the clinical efficacy of cefoxitin as definitive antibiotic therapy for ICU patients with ESBL-KP bacteremia, versus standard carbapenem therapy. Selection of cefoxitin- and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales in both groups was also analyzed.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^0d3b1576]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The available therapeutic options for the multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria are limited.

In recent years, clinicians have become dependent on carbapenems for treating ESBL infections. This emphasizes the importance of carbapenem-preserving antimicrobial stewardship.

The role of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations towards ESBLs has been debated and controversial even if recent reports suggest their use in ESBL infections.

Although tigecycline does not feature in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa or certain Enterobacteriaceae (Proteus spp. Serratia spp. Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii), it is still an option for complicated IAIs because of its favorable in vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, enterococci, several ESBLs, and some strains of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Because of poor plasma concentrations, tigecycline performs poorly in bacteremic patients, with a much higher risk of failing to clear bacteremia. Tigecycline should not be considered as first-line therapy in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia and bacteremia.

The recent challenges in the management of Gram-negative MDROs infections, especially in critically ill patients, have revived the clinical use of polymyxins and fosfomycin. There are still open questions about the need of combination therapy and the role of carbapenems, administered at high doses and by extended infusions, in the treatment of infections with carbapenem-resistant entetobacteriaceae.

Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam have recently been approved in some national agencies for the treatment of IAIs. Ceftolozone/tazobactam is a new antibiotic that has been approved for treatment of cIAIs (in combination with metronidazole) including infection by ESBLs and P. aeruginosa and associated with metronidazole may be valuable for treating infections caused by Gram-negative MDROs in order to preserve carbapenems. It may be useful as empirical therapy to preserve the use of carbapenems in critical patients with risk factors for ESBL isolation or as targeted therapy in patients with isolation of an ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa MDR. It should be considered that in some countries, the production of metallo -β- lactamase s enzymes, that are not inactivated by ceftolozane/tazobactam, may be one of the mechanisms for carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^7d546efc]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Hospital setting and study design

This retrospective single-center study was conducted between January 2013 and January 2023 at the University Hospital of Guadeloupe (UHG), a 800-bed tertiary-care medical center in Guadeloupe, a Caribbean island forming part of the French West Indies. All consecutive adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) hospitalized in ICU with cefoxitin-susceptible ESBL-KP bloodstream infections were included. Definitive antibiotic therapy was defined as the treatment administered after bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing, regardless of the initial empirical antibiotic therapy. The choice of definitive antibiotic therapy, either cefoxitin or carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin), was guided by local recommendations, but the final decision was left to the treating physician's discretion. Exclusion criteria were positive blood cultures with multiple bacteria, treatment by another antibiotic, lack of access to clinical records, patient's death within 24 h of the onset of bacteremia, definitive monotherapy administered for less than 50% of the total duration of antimicrobial therapy and patient refusal to participate.

Data collection

Medical charts were retrospectively reviewed for data collection. Baseline characteristics were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index, surgery during the previous 30 days, immunosuppressive therapy, sickle cell disease, radio or chemotherapy in the previous 3 months, underlying disease and time between admission to ICU and bacteremia occurrence. Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II was used to assess the patient's severity on admission to the intensive care unit. Illness severity at the time of bacteremia was assessed using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Pitt bacteremia score, septic shock and mechanical ventilation. Other variables included source of bacteremia, appropriate empirical therapy and duration, time to effective antibiotic therapy, co-infections, other antibiotic therapy administered for another reason and antibiotic posology. Co-infections were defined as any bacterial infections occurring prior to ESBL-KP bacteremia and still being treated. Empirical antibiotic therapy was considered appropriate if treatment regimens demonstrated in vitro activity against ESBL-KP and if the first dose was administered within the first 24 h after the blood culture. Time to effective antibiotic therapy was defined as the time elapsed between blood culture collection and start of active antibiotic therapy against the bacteria. K. pneumoniae isolates were considered as community-acquired if obtained within 48 h of admission, and hospital-acquired beyond that time. Follow-up was carried out up to 30 days after inclusion.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^12f4724c]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Management of bacteremia includes prompt initiation of antibiotics at an appropriate dose based on a priori knowledge of guidelines, prompt microbial identification, and source control wherever possible. Empiric coverage may include piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime plus metronidazole or a carbapenem (if concern for ESBL) with vancomycin or daptomycin. The recommended duration is 7 days for Gram-negatives and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 14 days for MRSA and Candida species, and longer for complicated and resistant infections, immunocompromised patients, as well as endocarditis and osteomyelitis, as shown in table 3. For S. aureus bacteremia, an ID consultation should be considered. Stepdown to oral antibiotics is appropriate based on organism identified, severity of illness, and suspected source.

### Carbapenem therapy is associated with improved survival compared with piperacillin-tazobactam for patients with extended-spectrum β-lactamase bacteremia [^694efa1f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) bacteremia is controversial. We compared 14-day mortality of PTZ vs carbapenems as empiric therapy in a cohort of patients with ESBL bacteremia who all received definitive therapy with a carbapenem.

Methods

Patients hospitalized between January 2007 and April 2014 with monomicrobial ESBL bacteremia were included. A decrease of > 3 doubling dilutions in the minimum inhibitory concentration for third-generation cephalosporins tested in combination with 4 µg/mL of clavulanic acid was used to confirm ESBL status. The primary exposure was empiric therapy, defined as antibiotic therapy administered to a patient before ESBL status was known. Patients were excluded if they did not receive a carbapenem after ESBL production was identified. The primary outcome was time to death from the first day of bacteremia. Propensity scores using inverse probability of exposure weighting (IPW) were used to estimate the probability that a patient would receive PTZ vs carbapenems empirically. We calculated overall hazard ratios for mortality censored at 14 days using Cox proportional hazards models on an IPW-adjusted cohort.

Results

A total of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia were identified. One hundred three (48%) patients received PTZ empirically and 110 (52%) received carbapenems empirically. The adjusted risk of death was 1.92 times higher for patients receiving empiric PTZ compared with empiric carbapenem therapy (95% confidence interval, 1.07–3.45).

Conclusions

PTZ appears inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL bacteremia. For patients at high risk of invasive ESBL infections, early carbapenem therapy should be considered. Our findings should not be extended to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in development, as limited clinical data are available for these agents.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^dc8c195b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Further addressing the question of whether PTZ is clinically as efficacious as carbapenems in the treatment of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing organisms, investigators compared 14-day mortality when PTZ versus a carbapenem was used as empiric therapy (defined in this trial as antibiotic therapy administered to a patient before their ESBL status was known) in a cohort of 331 patients with ESBL bacteremia who received definitive therapy with a carbapenem. The adjusted risk of death was 1.9 times higher for patients receiving empiric PTZ compared with empiric carbapenem (95% confidence interval 1.07–3.45).

It is important to acknowledge that the data regarding the role of PTZ in the treatment of ESBL-producing bacteria may not be an accurate predictor of how new β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. avibactam or relebactam) or new combinations (e.g. ceftolozane/tazobactam) may perform in the treatment of these infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam in combination with metronidazole was shown to be noninferior to meropenem in a multinational, double-blind randomized phase 3 trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated intraabdominal infections. Of the isolated pathogens, 7.2% were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and for this group of patients clinical cure rates were 95.8% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 88.5% in the meropenem group. Similar findings were reported from a randomized trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated lower urinary tract infections or pyelonephritis, in which 7.6% of the isolated pathogens were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^4cb0586c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Enterobacterales bloodstream infection — oral step-down therapy for ESBL-E: Data from observational studies support the use of oral step-down therapy for Enterobacterales bloodstream infections, including those caused by AMR isolates, after appropriate clinical milestones are achieved. Based on the high bioavailability and sustained serum concentrations of oral TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones, these agents should be treatment considerations for patients with ESBL-E infections if (1) susceptibility to 1 of these agents is demonstrated, (2) the patient is hemodynamically stable, (3) reasonable source control has occurred, and (4) concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption are not present. Clinicians should avoid oral step-down to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, omadacycline, or doxycycline for ESBL-E bloodstream infections.

### Controversies over the management of infections caused by amp-C-and ESBL-producing enterobacterales: what questions remain for future studies? [^c66b99dc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The continuous rise in infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales) is a major health concern. Carbapenems are regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of these infections. However, their indiscriminant use is not without consequences, and has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. In this review, we discuss the available evidence supporting the use of other betalactams, nonbetalactams and the new betalactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLA/BLI) to treat these infections. We also analyze unresolved issues in this field.

Recent Findings

Piperacillin tazobactam (PTZ) was classically recommended as a carbapenem-sparing agent. However, data have emerged against its use and it is now a controversial recommendation. IDSA, European and British guidelines reject the empirical use of PTZ for these pathogens, reserving its use for rare clinical situations. Other issues that continue to generate debate are the use of extended infusion (3h) PTZ, the use of older antibiotics, a shortened course of carbapenems and reserving the new BLA/BLI for these infections.

Summary

New treatment strategies should be based on clinical evidence, local epidemiology and the microbiological activity of these drugs.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^d23e3528]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for treating patients with the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. To avoid excessive carbapenem use, however, de-escalation to other agents, such as piperacillin-tazobactam when a MIC ≤ 8 mg/L (according to the EUCAST breakpoint) is detected, can be considered. Several studies compared piperacillin-tazobactam with carbapenems in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. In the MERINO trial, the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem in the treatment of BSIs caused by ceftriaxone-resistant E. coli or K. pneumoniae was compared, showing an overall 30-day mortality rate threefold higher in the piperacillin-tazobactam arm than in the meropenem one (12.3% versus 3.7%, p = 0.90). Since the low mortality rate in the meropenem group was an unexpected finding, the results of this study have been debated and several issues may have influenced the outcomes of this trial. Among the debated biases, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment of piperacillin-tazobactam was not optimized, as the trial favoured intermittent 1-h infusion over a prolonged infusion protocol. Also, from a microbiological point of view, the use of the E-test to determine piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility led to an elevated percentage of OXA-1-producing pathogens being incorrectly identified as piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible (E-test method cannot detect OXA-1). In a second comparative study (MERINO-2 trial), 72 patients with BSIs due to chromosomal AmpC producers were enrolled in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, where they were assigned 1:1 to receive piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. Piperacillin-tazobactam led to more microbiological failures, although fewer microbiological relapses were observed. Despite several pieces of evidence coming from observational studies showed no significant difference in efficacy and mortality rate between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems among patients with ESBL-producing BSIs, the use of a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) for severe infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales is generally recommended in critically ill patients.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, or ertapenem as preferred options for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer meropenem or imipenem/cilastatin as the preferred carbapenem in critically ill patients and/or patients experiencing hypoalbuminemia. Consider transitioning to oral TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin after an appropriate clinical response is achieved, assuming susceptibility is demonstrated.

Catheter-related bloodstream infection

Question

What is the most effective approach and antibiotic therapy for the management of CRBSI?

Recommendation

Effective management of CRBSI involves timely diagnosis, prompt removal of vascular access if at all possible (source control), and appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7–14 days depending on the causative microorganism, as shown in table 3. Vancomycin plus a beta-lactam (such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a ceftazidime) is usually a good empiric regimen if the risk of ESBL is not high. Reference to the local antibiogram and hospital recommendations is recommended for the selection of empiric therapy.

Table 3
Summary of antibiotic durations for common ICU infections

Discussion

The diagnosis of CRBSI should be distinguished from secondary bacteremia due to other sources. Surveillance cultures for patients with central lines are not recommended when CRBSI is not suspected such as in an asymptomatic patient and should not be done when other cultures are more appropriate to evaluate for the clinically suspected infection (eg, respiratory cultures for a suspected pneumonia).

The choice of antibiotic therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns and the severity of illness and should be de-escalated when culture data become available. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 days for Gram-negative bacilli,14 days for S. aureus (unless a complicated infection is present); and 14 days for Candida (in the absence of retinitis or risk factors for it, as described in the 'Bacteremia' section). Examples of when a S. aureus infection is considered complicated include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, foreign body or implant, metastatic infection, low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), immunocompromise, and recurrent infection. An infectious disease consultation should be sought in S. aureus CRBSI.

The management described here applies to non-tunneled lines. When a CRBSI is suspected, the central line should be removed. Catheter salvage options when the line cannot reasonably be removed are beyond the scope of this text.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^7159bc0f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### Β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae: time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options? [^e79c12ba]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in-vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies. Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers, and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2022 guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^d72ebdc6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. The initial guidance document on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) was published on 17 September 2020. Over the past year, there have been a number of important publications furthering our understanding of the management of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections, prompting a rereview of the literature and this updated guidance document.

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections reviewed, updated, and expanded previously developed questions and recommendations about the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States.

Results

Preferred and alternative treatment recommendations are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Recommendations apply for both adult and pediatric populations.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This document is current as of 24 October 2021. The most current versions of IDSA documents, including dates of publication, are available at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^7186ff1c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Coque and coll. highlighted the growing threat posed by increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae all over Europe, even in countries traditionally showing low prevalence rates of resistance. Increase of this resistance pattern has led to a progressive expansion of carbapenems use, because this class of antibiotics was traditionally considered the last resort for managing ESBL producers Enterobacteriaceae.

The inevitably increased carbapenem consumption has been associated to increasing carbapenemase production among Enterobacteriaceae. The recent rapid spread of serine carbapenemase in Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) is now an additional major threat for antimicrobial therapy in hospitals worldwide, and stresses the concept that the use of carbapenems must be mandatorily optimized in terms of indication and exposure.

Also Acinetobacter spp have worldwide shown similar alarming rates of increasing resistance to antibiotics. Today, Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii-producing oxacillinases retaining susceptibility to only colistin and tigecycline is an ominous reality in hospitals worldwide and compounding this problem is the paucity of new antibiotics under development to address it.

In hospital acquired IAIs also P. aeruginosa plays an important - although less critical than in other settings - role. The high intrinsic antibiotic resistance of this pathogen, together with its extraordinary capacity for acquiring additional resistances through chromosomal mutations, should be always taken into consideration.

Among multidrug resistant Gram positive bacteria, Enterococci remain a challenge despite the availability of large number of antimicrobial agents theoretically active against this species. The clinical management of enterococcal infection remains challenging, mainly because no single agent could be anticipated to exert strong bactericidal activity against them.

### Ertapenem versus meropenem for the treatment of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacterales bacteremia in critically ill patients [^3214d78f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The preferred carbapenem for treatment of infections caused by extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) in critically ill patients is debated.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference in clinical failure between ertapenem and meropenem for treatment of ESBL-E bacteremia in critically ill patients. Of concern is ertapenem use in hypoalbuminemia given the potential for higher drug clearance.

Methods

This retrospective, matched cohort study compared critically ill patients treated with ertapenem or meropenem for ESBL-E bacteremia between October 2016 and August 2022. Patients were matched on age, sex, lowest albumin, and in a 1:2 ratio of ertapenem to meropenem. The primary outcome, clinical failure, was a composite of 30-day mortality, antibiotic escalation, and microbiological failure. Secondary outcomes included all-cause readmission and development of superinfection.

Results

Of 54 patients, 18 received ertapenem and 36 meropenem. Most had a urinary infection source (55.6% vs 41.7%, P = 0.393). There was no difference in clinical failure (50.0% vs 38.9%, P = 0.436). Ertapenem patients had antibiotic escalation more often (33.3% vs 2.8%, P = 0.002). There was no difference in 30-day mortality (11.1% vs 27.8%, P = 0.298), microbiological failure (27.8% vs 11.1%, P = 0.142), all-cause readmission (22.2% vs 13.9%, P = 0.461), or development of superinfection (11.1% vs 13.9%, P = 1.000).

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in clinical failure in a small, retrospective cohort of critically ill patients receiving ertapenem or meropenem for ESBL-E bacteremia. Ertapenem may be appropriate in some critically ill and hypoalbuminemic patients, though additional data are needed.

### Is carbapenem therapy necessary for the treatment of non-CTX-M extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales bloodstream infections? [^e0bba9db]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Investigations into antibiotics for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infections (BSIs) have focused on blaCTX-M genes. Patient outcomes from non-CTX-M-producing ESBL-E BSIs and optimal treatment are unknown.

Methods

A multicenter observational study investigating 500 consecutive patients with ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacterales BSIs during 2018–2022 was conducted. Broth microdilution and whole-genome sequencing confirmed antibiotic susceptibilities and ESBL gene presence, respectively. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) using propensity scores ensured patients with non-CTX-M and CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs were similar before outcome evaluation.

Results

396 patients (79.2%) were confirmed to have an ESBL-E BSI. ESBL gene family prevalence was as follows: blaCTX-M (n = 370), blaSHV (n = 16), blaOXY (n = 12), and blaVEB (n = 5). ESBL gene identification was not limited to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. In the IPW cohort, there was no difference in 30-day mortality or ESBL-E infection recurrence between the non-CTX-M and CTX-M groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI].87–1.11; P = 0.83 and OR, 1.10; 95% CI, .85–1.42; P = 0.47, respectively). In an exploratory analysis limited to the non-CTX-M group, 86% of the 21 patients who received meropenem were alive on day 30; none of the 5 patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam were alive on day 30.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that non-CTX-M and CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs are equally concerning and associated with similar clinical outcomes. Meropenem may be associated with improved survival in patients with non-CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs, underscoring the potential benefit of comprehensive molecular diagnostics to enable early antibiotic optimization for ESBL-E BSIs beyond just blaCTX-M genes.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^6afe05af]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In fact in critically ill patients the possibility that the normal flora may be modified and that the IAI could be caused by several unexpected pathogens and by more resistant flora must be considered. In these patients antimicrobial regimens with broader spectrum of activity are recommended.

Therefore in a stable and low risk patient a simpler antibiotic choice, not including ESBL in the spectrum of activity is correct, while in critical and high risk patients any antibiotic regimen must take into account the risk of ESBL.

The available therapeutic options for the treatment of ESBL-associated infections are limited by drug resistance conferred by the ESBLs. The frequently observed co-resistances include various antibiotic classes (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Carbapenems, stable against hydrolyzing activity of ESBLs, are considered as the drug of choice for the treatment of these infections. Tigecycline and polymyxins have a strong in vitro antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing bacteria, and the first should be considered a reasonable alternative. This is particularly true from an epidemiological point of view; in fact today any large hospital should implement carbapenems-sparing stewardship programs to control the spread of carbapenemase producing gram negative bacteria.

Although in the prospective French survey by Montravers and coll, a higher percentage of isolation of Enterococcus faecalis in non surviving patients was reported (23% versus 9%), empirical treatment against Enterococci and has not been generally recommended for patients with community-acquired IAI. In fact in several clinical trials comparing different therapeutic options inclusion/exclusion of agents with enterococcal coverage provides no impact in outcomes for patients with community-acquired infections.

In the setting of community acquired IAIs, antimicrobial therapy for enterococci should be considered on a patient-by-patient basis, mainly in high risk patients, in immunocompromised patients and in patients with valvular heart disease or prosthetic materials.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is not commonly isolated from patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection. Therefore empirical treatment against MRSA is not recommended in this setting.

Enterobacterales infections during HCT — treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): Carbapenems are recommended for treating invasive ESBL-E infections despite frequent in vitro susceptibility of ESBL-E to piperacillin-tazobactam (A-I), because mortality was increased by 3-fold when piperacillin-tazobactam was compared with a carbapenem in a randomized trial of ESBL-E bacteremia therapy in the general population. The majority of ESBL-E are resistant to cefepime and even patients with a cefepime "susceptible" ESBL-E infection have worse outcomes when treated with cefepime compared with carbapenems, and the newer agents ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam are active against ESBL-E in vitro.

### Β-lactam / β-lactam inhibitor combinations for the treatment of bacteremia due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a post hoc analysis of prospective cohorts [^4fe70cfb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum ß-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) is an important cause of invasive infections. Alternatives to carbapenems — considered the drugs of choice — are needed because of the emergence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria. The efficacy of ß-lactam/ß-lactam inhibitors (BLBLI) in such infections is controversial.

Methods

The authors performed a post hoc analysis of patients with bloodstream infections due to ESBL-EC from 6 published prospective cohorts. Mortality and length of hospital stay in patients treated with an active BLBLI (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [AMC] and piperacillin-tazobactam [PTZ]) or carbapenem were compared in 2 cohorts: the empirical therapy cohort (ETC) and the definitive therapy cohort (DTC). Confounding was controlled by multivariate analysis; for patients in the ETC, a propensity score for receiving carbapenem was also used.

Results

The ETC included 103 patients (BLBLI, 72; carbapenem, 31), and the DTC included 174 (BLBLI, 54; carbapenem, 120). Mortality rates at day 30 for those treated with BLBLI versus carbapenems were 9.7% versus 19.4% for the ETC and 9.3% versus 16.7% for the DTC, respectively (P > .2, log-rank test). After adjustment for confounders, no association was found between either empirical therapy with BLBLI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI].29–4.40; P = 0.84) or definitive therapy (adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI, .28–2.07; P = 0.5) and increased mortality. Furthermore, BLBLI therapy, with respect to carbapenem, was not found to influence length of hospital stay.

Conclusions

These results suggest that AMC and PTZ are suitable alternatives to carbapenems for treating patients with bloodstream infections due to ESBL-EC if active in vitro and would be particularly useful as definitive therapy.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^281cd7ce]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Carbapenems

For decades, carbapenems have been the antibiotics of first choice for ESBLs. The best option for targeting ESBLs (though with no coverage of P. aeruginosa) is ertapenem, a once daily administered carbapenem that otherwise shares the activity of imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against most species, including ESBL producing pathogens. Imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem and doripenem provide coverage for Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (e.g. P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii). However, inappropriate use of carbapenems should be avoided because there is an association with the increase in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, e.g. the rapid spread of carbapenemases in K. pneumoniae or NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.

Regarding Enterococcus coverage among carbapenems, impipenem/cilastatin is most active in vitro against ampicillin-susceptible E. faecalis while ertapenem, meropenem, and doripenem have limited activity against both E. faecalis and E. faecium. In addition, carbapenems are not generally recommended for use to treat bacteremia due to Enterococcus spp. In carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae with an MIC ≤ 8 μg/ml, carbapenem-containing combinations, including meropenem or doripenem, is suggested.

Aminoglycosides

Aminoglycosides are particularly active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and act synergistically against certain Gram-positive organisms. They are effective against P. aeruginosa, but are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria. Because of their serious toxic side effects including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, some authors do not recommend aminoglycosides for the routine empiric treatment of community-acquired IAI. They may be reserved for patients with allergies to beta-lactam agents or when used in combination with beta-lactams for treatment of IAI secondary to MDRO. However, other authors have questioned the clinical importance of the toxic side-effects, and their decreased activity in acidic environment such as pus. In any case, this class of antibiotics remains an important option in the antimicrobial armamentarium for combating Gram-negative bacteria and widening the spectrum of the empirical therapy when MDRO are suspected.

### Cefepime therapy for monomicrobial bacteremia caused by cefepime-susceptible extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: MIC matters [^e6589f87]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates are important clinical pathogens. In addition, the efficacy of cefepime for such infections is controversial.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of monomicrobial bacteremia caused by ESBL producers at 2 medical centers between May 2002 and August 2007. The patients definitively treated with in vitro active cefepime (cases) were compared with those treated with a carbapenem (controls) in a propensity score-matched analysis to assess therapeutic effectiveness. The 30-day crude mortality is the primary endpoint.

Results

A total of 178 patients were eligible for the study. Patients who received cefepime (n = 17) as definitive therapy were more likely to have a clinical failure (odds ratio [OR] 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7–22.5; P = 0.002), microbiological failure (OR 5.5; 95% CI, 1.3–25.6; P = 0.04), and 30-day mortality (OR 7.1; 95% CI, 2.5–20.3; P < .001) than those who received carbapenem therapy (n = 161). Multivariate regression revealed that a critical illness with a Pitt bacteremia score ≥ 4 points (OR 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4–20.9; P = 0.016), a rapidly fatal underlying disease (OR 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5–12.6; P = 0.006), and definitive cefepime therapy (OR 9.9; 95% CI, 2.8–31.9; P < .001) were independently associated with 30-day crude mortality. There were 17 case-control pairs in the propensity scores matched analysis. The survival analysis consistently found that individuals who received cefepime therapy had a lower survival rate (log-rank test, P = 0.016).

Conclusions

Based on the current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute susceptible breakpoint of cefepime (minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 8 μg/mL), cefepime definitive therapy is inferior to carbapenem therapy in treating patients with so-called cefepime-susceptible ESBL-producer bacteremia.

### Bacteremia due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in the CTX-M era: a new clinical challenge [^c236d59e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, particularly those producing CTX-M types of ESBL, are emerging pathogens. Bacteremia caused by these organisms represents a clinical challenge, because the organisms are frequently resistant to the antimicrobials recommended for treatment of patients with suspected E. coli sepsis.

Methods

A cohort study was performed that included all episodes of bloodstream infection due to ESBL-producing E. coli during the period from January 2001 through March 2005. Data on predisposing factors, clinical presentation, and outcome were collected. ESBLs were characterized using isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing.

Results

Forty-three episodes (8.8% of cases of bacteremia due to E. coli) were included; 70% of the isolates produced a CTX-M type of ESBL. The most frequent origins of infection were the urinary (46%) and biliary tracts (21%). Acquisition was nosocomial in 21 cases (49%), health care associated in 14 cases (32%), and strictly community acquired in 8 cases (19%). Thirty-eight percent and 25% of patients had obstructive diseases of the urinary and biliary tracts, respectively, and 38% had recently received antimicrobials. Nine patients (21%) died. Compared with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor and carbapenem-based regimens, empirical therapy with cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones was associated with a higher mortality rate (9% vs. 35%; P = 0.05) and needed to be changed more frequently (24% vs. 78%; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

ESBL-producing E. coli is a significant cause of bloodstream infection in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients in the context of the emergence of CTX-M enzymes. Empirical treatment of sepsis potentially caused by E. coli may need to be reconsidered in areas where such ESBL-producing isolates are present.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This guidance document focuses on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This updated document replaces previous versions of the guidance document.

Methods

A panel of six infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-E, AmpC-E, CRE, DTR-P. aeruginosa, CRAB, and S. maltophilia. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States.

Results

Preferred and alternative suggested treatment approaches are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, transitioning to oral therapy, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Suggested approaches apply for both adult and pediatric populations, although suggested antibiotic dosages are provided only for adults.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial resistant infections.

### A clinical decision tree to predict whether a bacteremic patient is infected with an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organism [^85a62422]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Timely identification of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) bacteremia can improve clinical outcomes while minimizing unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including carbapenems. However, most clinical microbiology laboratories currently require at least 24 additional hours from the time of microbial genus and species identification to confirm ESBL production. Our objective was to develop a user-friendly decision tree to predict which organisms are ESBL producing, to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Methods

We included patients ≥ 18 years of age with bacteremia due to Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species from October 2008 to March 2015 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Isolates with ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations ≥ 2 µg/mL underwent ESBL confirmatory testing. Recursive partitioning was used to generate a decision tree to determine the likelihood that a bacteremic patient was infected with an ESBL producer. Discrimination of the original and cross-validated models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and by calculation of C-statistics.

Results

A total of 1288 patients with bacteremia met eligibility criteria. For 194 patients (15%), bacteremia was due to a confirmed ESBL producer. The final classification tree for predicting ESBL-positive bacteremia included 5 predictors: history of ESBL colonization/infection, chronic indwelling vascular hardware, age ≥ 43 years, recent hospitalization in an ESBL high-burden region, and ≥ 6 days of antibiotic exposure in the prior 6 months. The decision tree's positive and negative predictive values were 90.8% and 91.9%, respectively.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that a clinical decision tree can be used to estimate a bacteremic patient's likelihood of infection with ESBL-producing bacteria. Recursive partitioning offers a practical, user-friendly approach for addressing important diagnostic questions.

### Clinical outcomes with ertapenem as a first-line treatment option of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria [^4f7aa318]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative organisms are a growing concern in hospitalized patients. Traditionally, these infections can be effectively treated by the carbapenem class of drugs. In 2005, our institution initiated a protocol for use of ertapenem, a carbapenem, as the first-line treatment option for these infections. It is unknown whether ertapenem is associated with similar clinical response and microbiologic cure rates as those achieved with group 2 carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem).

Objective

To describe clinical response and microbiologic cure rates associated with ertapenem as first-line treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

Methods

This case series included patients who received ertapenem for more than 48 hours to treat a documented infection with a positive culture for an ESBL-producing organism. Efficacy was determined by the clinical response and microbiologic cure rates achieved with ertapenem.

Results

Seventy-three patients received ertapenem for a mean (SD) of 10.7 (5.9) days. The most common (59%) infection site was urine. The most common causative organisms were ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (47%) and Escherichia coli (48%). Clinical response was observed in 78% of patients. Microbiologic cure was achieved in 92% of the evaluable population (n = 50). There were no significant differences in clinical or microbiologic cure rates across important subgroups.

Conclusions

Patients treated with ertapenem achieved favorable clinical response and microbiologic cure rates. Our data suggest that ertapenem can be used as an alternative to group 2 carbapenems for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing gram-negative organisms.

### Renal abscess with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a case report [^05757a0b]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment for renal abscesses involves a combination of appropriate antibiotics and percutaneous or open surgical drainage. Only intravenous antibiotics were used in this case, because the abscess was too small to drain. In adult populations, it is recommended that renal abscesses less than 3 cm are treated without drainage, and this recommendation is also frequently applied to pediatric patients. Case studies in children have reported that renal abscesses less than 3 cm can be successfully treated without drainage.

Although the preferred antibiotic for ESBL-positive microorganisms is carbapenem, the selection of other antibiotics is under discussion due to antimicrobial resistance. Carbapenem treatment needs to be given intravenously and requires a longer duration of hospital stay. Two previous retrospective studies showed that the initial empiric antibiotic therapy for pediatric UTIs caused by ESBL did not worsen the outcome, and the authors concluded that switching to appropriate antibiotics after detection of ESBL-producing microorganisms was sufficient. The efficacy of non-carbapenem antibiotics such as amikacin, fosfomycin, cefmetazole, and flomoxef for UTIs with ESBL-producing bacteria has been reported. However, the efficacy of antibiotics other than carbapenem for blood culture-positive UTIs caused by ESBL-producing pathogens among children is unknown. Because the use of piperacillin-tazobactam as a "carbapenem-sparing" option was inferior to meropenem with bacteremia of an ESBL-producing pathogen in an adult population, selection of carbapenem-sparing antibiotics for similar cases should be carefully considered. Thus, there is an opinion that carbapenem be recommended from the beginning of treatment for renal abscesses in children to avoid worsening of the outcomes. Regardless of a longer hospital stay, we continued meropenem for 3 weeks in the present case, which was blood culture positive with a renal abscess caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. We did not suspect an ESBL-producing pathogen infection at first and therefore treated the patient with non-carbapenem antibiotics before switching to carbapenem after confirming the results of the culture. Although we successfully treated the patient, it required us to investigate appropriate empiric and definitive therapies for a pediatric renal abscess with bacteremia caused by ESBL-positive microorganisms.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^7eca961a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E background — enzymatic activity, prevalence, and laboratory detection are outlined as follows: ESBLs are enzymes that inactivate most penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and ESBLs do not inactivate non-β-lactam agents such as ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), gentamicin, and doxycycline, although organisms carrying ESBL genes often harbor additional genes or mutations in genes expanding their resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. ESBL genes are most prevalent in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis. Routine ESBL testing is not performed by most clinical microbiology laboratories; rather, non-susceptibility to ceftriaxone (ie, ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] ≥ 2 μg/mL), is often used as a proxy for ESBL production, although this threshold has limitations, and for this guidance document, ESBL-E refers to presumed or confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or P. mirabilis.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^f9490780]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of piperacillin/tazobactam in treating patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales has been debated. Gram-negative bacteria may express multiple ESBLs as well as AmpC beta-lactamases concomitantly, and can manifest other mechanisms of resistance, limiting the activity of piperacillin/tazobactam. On the other hand, the activity of beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin/tazobactam, is influenced by the "inoculum effect", an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic when the inoculum size is larger. A RCT conducted in patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales blood stream infections showed inferior results of piperacillin/tazobactam compared to carbapenems. Although piperacillin/tazobactam is not considered the first-choice antibiotic to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, it may be an option for IAIs with adequate source control when bacteria are susceptible (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L). A high dose or prolonged/continuous infusion should be prescribed to optimise pharmacokinetics (PK) targeting in critically ill patients.

### Bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in vientiane, lao PDR: a 5-year study [^7b547b83]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Several studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate associated with ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae bacteremia is significantly (30–50%) higher than that of non–ESBL-producing organisms, – as it was in our study and associated with longer hospital stays and costs. The selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is an essential intervention to improve patient outcomes. This is particularly important during empirical treatment, although susceptibility results are still pending or in patients who are critically ill and are not responding to initial treatment with agents such as third-generation cephalosporins. This study has shown that local ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae causing bacteremia in Vientiane have a high rate of co-resistance to other groups of antibiotics but remain susceptible to meropenem and mostly to amikacin. This is consistent with previous studies from other centers. – The suggested empirical treatment for patients with suspected sepsis in Mahosot Hospital is currently ceftriaxone, but this study raises the question as to whether this should be changed. However, carbapenems are expensive and not readily available in Laos and amikacin, although often used when indicated, is potentially toxic, especially as therapeutic drug monitoring is not locally available. There is also a risk of the emergence of resistance if these agents were more widely used. – Carbapenemase screening is already in place in Mahosot Hospital. We are currently investigating the use of rapid methods to detect ESBL production in patients with positive blood cultures growing Gram-negative bacilli in the hope that more targeted use of these valuable agents may be possible.

Our study has several limitations. Because of its retrospective nature, some hospital charts could not be retrieved, and so it was not possible always to capture data about risk factors, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes related to ESBL-E bacteremia. Second, this study was carried out in a single center and might not be applicable to other settings across Laos. Third, the estimated number of presumed hospital-acquired bacteremias is small and possibly exaggerated (maximum 10% overall) and we have, therefore, not attempted to analyze the data by whether episodes were hospital or community acquired. Furthermore, blood cultures are not always collected on admission. Reported antibiotic use data are also limited in scope, particularly timings and class. Last, the data relate to 2010–2014 and because the epidemiology of AMR is likely to be changing constantly, expanded surveillance is essential.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^40c4fd2e]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Despite the progress made in medical management over the past few decades, sepsis remains an important global health problem causing millions of deaths around the world. One essential facet of sepsis management is the administration of appropriate antimicrobials. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that failure or delay in the administration of appropriate antimicrobials is associated with substantial increases in the mortality of sepsis. On the basis of the evidence, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover all likely pathogens as soon as possible after sepsis is recognized.

Broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics are commonly used as empiric therapy for sepsis. Among them, carbapenems offer an exceptionally broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The existing evidence suggests that carbapenems are associated with relatively low mortality in several infectious diseases, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens. For these reasons, carbapenems are the preferably used antibiotics for the initial treatment of sepsis, and consumption of carbapenem has been reported to be increasing in different parts of the world. However, indiscriminate use of carbapenems against sepsis should be avoided because it has contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, updating knowledge on the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens for sepsis is required.

The fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime and cefpirome, and piperacillin/tazobactam are nearly equal to carbapenems in antimicrobial activity and thus are considered alternative therapies against sepsis. Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of carbapenems compared with these antibiotics against several specific pathogens, such as Acinetobacter species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. However, there is little evidence of the efficacy of carbapenems against unidentified mixed pathogens. Causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis because of the strong recommendation to initiate immediate treatment, ideally within 1 hour after sepsis is first suspected. Thus, there is a significant need to comprehensively evaluate differences in mortality and morbidities between carbapenems versus noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics as initial treatment of sepsis, including various underlying infectious diseases and causative pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate mortality and morbidities in patients with community-acquired sepsis treated with carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy compared with those treated with noncarbapenem antibiotics.

### Genomic epidemiology reveals geographical clustering of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli ST131 associated with bacteraemia in wales [^d95fc8d7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In 2018, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidelines concerning acute pyelonephritis. This recommended urine culture susceptibility testing and promoted the use of several β -lactams, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolone), or amoxicillin and clavulanic acid as first-line antibiotics. This could be contributing to increasing rates of ESBL-producing E. coli across the UK. Between 2017–2018, data from England and Wales showed that at least 14.1% (n = 4950/35,050)and 13.3% (n = 354/2,663)of E. coli bloodstream isolates presented resistance to 3GCs, respectively. In England, this translates to approximately 5,000 annual cases, often due to ST131. Resistance to β -lactams like 3GCs can lead to increased usage of last-line therapies like carbapenems, with carbapenem resistance in UPEC also associated with ST131. In 2017, rates of resistance to fluoroquinolones in ECB cases across Wales were at least 20.3% (n = 540/2663). NICE also promotes the use of nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim (first-line), and pivmecillinam or fosfomycin (second-line) antibiotics against lower UTIs. However, trimethoprim is no longer recommended in Wales for the treatment of UTIs in the 65 and over age group. The increase in antimicrobial-resistant infections is problematic on several levels. For example, patients are more likely to receive inappropriate empirical therapy involving an agent to which the pathogen is resistant. The circulation of strains with extensive levels of resistance to key antimicrobials, such as 3GCs, increases the likelihood of UTI treatment failures, prolonging the length of infection, potentially allowing the bacteria to flourish by removing commensal bacteria which compete for bacterial growth, and increases severe outcomes such as the risk of a patient developing bacteraemia, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^45deca07]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

How should the correct antibiotic be chosen in patients with IAIs?

14. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the local microbiological epidemiology, clinical severity, and individual patient risk factors for resistant bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

15. In most patients with IAIs, agents with a narrow spectrum of activity should be preferred. In community-acquired IAIs, the most common resistance problem is posed by alarmingly prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

16. The following risk factors for ESBLs-producing Enterobacterales infections should be always considered: (a) hospitalization for 48 h within the last 90 days, (b) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days, (c) gut colonization by ESBLs within 90 days and (d) patients coming from healthcare settings with a high incidence of MDR bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

17. Antibiotic therapy aimed at enterococcal coverage should not be routinely prescribed in patients with community-acquired IAIs unless they are immunocompromised (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

18. Empirical antibiotic therapy covering MDR Gram-negative bacteria should be considered only in specific settings, and based on country-wide epidemiological conditions, clinical severity, immunological impairment, knowledge of colonization status, prolonged exposure to carbapenems and/or quinolones (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

In the setting of IAIs, inappropriate choice of initial antibiotic therapy in patients leads to more clinical failure, resulting in a longer hospital stay and higher costs of hospitalization compared with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Before causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant bacteria and patient risk factors for them as long as available microbiological data (e.g. colonization status).

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^9e47fcf6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy for extra-biliary community-acquired IAIs

Once the diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection is suspected, it is necessary to begin empiric antimicrobial therapy.

However routine use of antimicrobial therapy is not appropriate for all patients with intra-abdominal infections.

In uncomplicated IAIs, when the focus of infection is treated effectively by surgical excision of the involved tissue, the administration of antibiotics is unnecessary beyond prophylaxis.

In complicated IAIs, when infectious process proceeds beyond the organ, causing either localized peritonitis (intra-abdominal abscess), or diffuse peritonitis antimicrobial therapy is mandatory.

The choice of antimicrobial regimen depends on the source of intra-abdominal infection, risk factors for specific microorganisms and resistance patterns and clinical patient's condition (Recommendation 1 C).

The principles of empiric antibiotic treatment should be defined according to the most frequently isolated germs, always taking into consideration the local trend of antibiotic resistance.

The major pathogens involved in community-acquired IAIs are Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and anaerobes. The main resistance problem is represented by ESBL producers Enterobacteriaceae, even today frequently found in community acquired infections.

Many factors can raise the risk of selection of ESBL but prior exposition to antibiotics (mainly third generation cephalosporins) and comorbidities that make frequent the exposure of patients to multiple antibiotic treatments, are the most significant.

Many others factors can contribute to the severity of an intra-abdominal infection and to a patient's risk for a poor outcome, like patient age, underlying co-morbidities, extent of infection, nutritional status and the success of initial source control procedures. Dividing patients with intra-abdominal infections into lower and higher risk categories is not always simple, but attempting to assess a patient's risk of treatment failure is essential to optimize a treatment plan. In this context adding a standardized evaluation of the clinical condition, represented by the sepsis grading, may be extremely helpful.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^d557eb99]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLBLI), including ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, have an in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobe organisms. However, increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae including community-acquired isolates, during the last decade, has compromised clinical utility of these agents for empirical therapy of serious Gram-negative infections. This is likely due to excessive use of amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate in both children and adults, particularly in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection. The combination of over use of these oral antibiotics in the community and potential for household transmission of resistant E. coli strains among family members make ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate resistance unpredictable. Fortunately, most isolates remain susceptible to other beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

A meta-analysis of PubMed and Scopus databases providing data for mortality among patients treated with carbapenems, BLBLI or non- BLBLI (mainly cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones), preferably as monotherapy was published in 2013. The study reported no statistically significant difference in mortality between carbapenems and BLBLI administered as either empiric or definitive therapy. The authors concluded that the role of BLBLI should be further evaluated for definitive treatment. In a recent study of 331 unique patients with ESBL bacteremia, piperacillin/tazobactam appeared inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of ESBL bacteremia; the use of piperacillin/tazobactam in ESBLs infections is still controversial.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^a15966c1]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite cefoxitin's in vitro resistance to hydrolysis by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), treatment of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infections with cefoxitin remains controversial. The aim of our study was to compare the clinical efficacy of cefoxitin as definitive antibiotic therapy for patients with ESBL-KP bacteremia in intensive care unit, versus carbapenem therapy.

Methods

This retrospective study included all patients with monomicrobial bacteremia hospitalized in intensive care unit between January 2013 and January 2023 at the University Hospital of Guadeloupe. The primary outcome was the 30-day clinical success defined as a composite endpoint: 30-day survival, absence of relapse and no change of antibiotic therapy. Cox regression including a propensity score (PS) and PS-based matched analysis were performed for endpoint analysis.

Results

A total of 110 patients with bloodstream infections were enrolled. Sixty-three patients (57%) received definitive antibiotic therapy with cefoxitin, while forty-seven (43%) were treated with carbapenems. 30-day clinical success was not significantly different between patients treated with cefoxitin (57%) and carbapenems (53%, p = 0.823). PS-adjusted and PS-matched analysis confirmed these findings. Change of definitive antibiotic therapy was more frequent in the cefoxitin group (17% vs. 0%, p = 0.002). No significant differences were observed for the other secondary endpoints. The acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly higher in patients receiving carbapenem therapy (5% vs. 23%, p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that cefoxitin as definitive antibiotic therapy could be a therapeutic option for some ESBL-KP bacteremia, sparing carbapenems and reducing the selection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.

Empirical antibacterial therapy adjustments for suspected bacteremia, sepsis, or meningitis in communities with extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing E coli specify that gentamicin should be used instead of ceftazidime for suspected bacteremia or sepsis, meropenem should be used instead of ceftazidime when bacterial meningitis is suspected, and use of fourth- and fifth-generation cephalosporins may also be considered with expert consultation. Because cephalosporins do not provide adequate coverage for Listeria or enterococci, ampicillin generally should be used as part of empirical therapy when these microbes are suspected.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^00ed5cab]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this original study is the first to compare the efficacy of cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment in ESBL- Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in ICU. The study's main finding, confirmed by PS-matched analysis, shows that there was no statistical difference in 30-day clinical success when cefoxitin was used as definitive antibiotic therapy for ESBL-KP bacteremia, compared with carbapenems. The second interesting finding is that the use of cefoxitin instead of carbapenems reduced the selection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in these critically ill patients, often at risk of new nosocomial infection.

In our work, cefoxitin appears to be effective in severe infections compared with carbapenems. As expected in ICU, the overall clinical success rate was low (57% in the cefoxitin group), but not lower than in the carbapenems group (53%) and slightly higher than results recently published in a study of ESBL-E infections (including 25 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates) treated with cefoxitin in critical care which reported a therapeutic success rate of 37%. Although patient severity appeared similar in both studies, our recurrence rate seemed lower (11% vs. 27%) as was the rate of antibiotic change (17% vs. 32%). This may be due to the higher number of pneumonias in their study, which was an independent risk factor for clinical failure in ours. However, 30-day mortality does not seem to be different in both studies (29%). Similar to our findings, the mortality rate between patients treated with flomoxef or cefmetazole, another cephamycins and those treated with carbapenem for ESBL-E bacteremia was not significantly different in previous studies. In contrast to our results, two studies comparing flomoxef with carbapenems showed excess mortality in patients treated with cephamycin. The first, conducted in a hemodialysis unit, focused on ESBL-KP bacteremia related to fistula, graft or catheter infections, while the second involved a large sample (n = 389) of ESBL-EC and ESBL-KP bloodstream infections of various origins and from any hospital ward. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) thus does not suggest the use of cephamycins for the treatment of ESBL-E infections until more clinical outcomes data are available.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — cefepime for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Cefepime is suggested for the treatment of infections caused by organisms at moderate risk of significant AmpC production (ie, E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii)". For isolates in the susceptible dose-dependent range, dosing is defined as "2 grams every 8 hours, infused over 3 hours" for "MICs 4–8 µg/mL". Although effective for AmpC-E, cefepime "remains suboptimal against infections caused by ESBL-E", illustrated by a Taiwan study where "89% of E. cloacae isolates with cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL… were ESBL-producing", in which "all 10 patients… died within 30 days", whereas "none of the 6 patients… died within 30 days" when ESBL was absent. U.S. data show ESBL gene prevalence varies — among E. cloacae, "3% contained a blaCTX-M gene", and in older Pittsburgh data "15 of 45 (33%)… produced SHV-type ESBLs" with "no association" to cefepime MIC. In a Baltimore series, ESBL genes were found in "22% of K. aerogenes (4/18), 14% of E. cloacae (7/51), and in no C. freundii (0% [0/106])", and "none of the ESBL-producing isolates had cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL". Overall, "Available data do not suggest there is a clear association between cefepime susceptible dose-dependent MICs (ie, MICs of 4–8 µg/mL) and ESBL production".

Piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: Piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections caused by Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant inducible AmpC production. Tazobactam is less effective at protecting β-lactams from AmpC hydrolysis than newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, and the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in treating Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production remains uncertain. A 2019 meta-analysis of observational studies did not identify a difference in mortality between patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp., or Serratia spp., though significant heterogeneity and confounding by indication likely existed. A pilot unblinded clinical trial randomized 72 patients with bloodstream infections to piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 grams IV every 6 hours as a standard infusion) or meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a standard infusion) and found no significant differences in the primary composite outcome, with notable and seemingly conflicting findings among individual components.

### Cefepime vs other antibacterial agents for the treatment of Enterobacter species bacteremia [^fb697a55]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Carbapenems are recommended for treatment of Enterobacter infections with AmpC phenotypes. Although isolates are typically susceptible to cefepime in vitro, there are few data supporting its clinical efficacy.

Methods

We reviewed all cases of Enterobacter species bacteremia at 2 academic hospitals from 2005 to 2011. Outcomes of interest were (1) persistent bacteremia ≥ 1 calendar day and (2) in-hospital mortality. We fit logistic regression models, adjusting for clinical risk factors and Pitt bacteremia score and performed propensity score analyses to compare the efficacy of cefepime and carbapenems.

Results

Three hundred sixty-eight patients experienced Enterobacter species bacteremia and received at least 1 antimicrobial agent, of whom 52 (14%) died during hospitalization. Median age was 59 years; 19% were neutropenic, and 22% were in an intensive care unit on the day of bacteremia. Twenty-nine (11%) patients had persistent bacteremia for ≥ 1 day after antibacterial initiation. None of the 36 patients who received single-agent cefepime (0%) had persistent bacteremia, as opposed to 4 of 16 (25%) of those who received single-agent carbapenem (P < .01). In multivariable models, there was no association between carbapenem use and persistent bacteremia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.52; 95% CI, .58–3.98; P = 0.39), and a nonsignificant lower odds ratio with cefepime use (aOR, 0.52; 95% CI, .19–1.40; P = 0.19). In-hospital mortality was similar for use of cefepime and carbapenems in adjusted regression models and propensity-score matched analyses.

Conclusions

Cefepime has a similar efficacy as carbapenems for the treatment of Enterobacter species bacteremia. Its use should be further explored as a carbapenem-sparing agent in this clinical scenario.

### Carbapenems versus piperacillin-tazobactam for bloodstream infections of nonurinary source caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^b8b72a89]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

A recent, frequently quoted study has suggested that for bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL) Escherichia coli, treatment with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLIs) might be equivalent to treatment with carbapenems. However, the majority of BSIs originate from the urinary tract. A multicenter, multinational efficacy analysis was conducted from 2010 to 2012 to compare outcomes of patients with non-urinary ESBL BSIs who received a carbapenem (69 patients) vs those treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (10 patients). In multivariate analysis, therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with increased 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 7.9, P = 0.03). For ESBL BSIs of a non-urinary origin, carbapenems should be considered a superior treatment to BLBLIs.

### Timing of appropriate empirical antimicrobial administration and outcome of adults with community-onset bacteremia [^97c65295]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Definitions

Community-onset bacteremia indicates that the place of onset of the episode of bacteremia is the community, which includes long-term healthcare facility-acquired and community-acquired bacteremia, as previously described. Polymicrobial bacteremia was defined as the isolation of more than one microbial species from a single bacteremia episode. Blood culture samples with potentially contaminating pathogens were considered to be contaminated in accordance with the previous criteria.

As previously described, the antimicrobial therapy was considered appropriate when all the following criteria were fulfilled: (1) the route and dosage of antimicrobial agents were administered as recommended in the Sanford Guide and (2) the bacteremia pathogens were susceptible in vitro to the administrated antimicrobial agent based on the contemporary breakpoints of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The time to appropriate antibiotic (TtAa) measured in hours was defined as the period between the arrival at the ED (i.e. ED triage) and the administration of appropriate antimicrobials. The bacteremia severity was graded according to the PBS using a previously validated scoring system based on vital signs, use of inotropic agents, mental status, receipt of mechanical ventilation, and cardiac arrest. Comorbidities were defined as described previously and malignancies included hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The prognosis of preexisting diseases was assessed by a previous delineated classification system (McCabe classification). Bacteremia sources were determined clinically on the basis of the previous definitions. Crude mortality was used to define death from all causes.

Microbiological methods

Blood cultures were incubated in a BACTEC 9240 instrument (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) for 5 days at 35 °C. Bacteremia aerobic isolates were prospectively collected during the study period. The bacterial species was identified by means of the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Durham, NC, USA), and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method, based on the performance standards of CLSI in 2016. The tested drugs included ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, ertapenem, imipenem, and levofloxacin. If the patient was empirically treated by other agents, the susceptibility of the indicated agent was measured. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus mirabilis (EKP), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was detected by the phenotypic confirmatory test with the cephalosporin-clavulanate combination disks recommended by the previous CLSI guidelines in 2009.

### IGNITE4: results of a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, prospective trial of eravacycline vs meropenem in the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections [^cb4b4168]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Microbiology Encountered

The microbiology of infection and resistance encountered in this study is representative of that seen in other recent registration trials. The interpretation of clinical trial data for intraabdominal infection is made complex by the polymicrobial nature of these infections, the varying organ-specific processes, and the central role of source control in determining outcome. In the current study, polymicrobial infections were predominant, and known synergistic pairs, including gram-negative facultative and aerobic isolates and gram-positives along with Bacteroides and Clostridia species, were present in a large percentage of patients. Of note, among the 3 patients in the meropenem group with CRE isolates, 2 had polymicrobial infections.

The high rate of clinical cure among patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified as a baseline pathogen is likely another consequence of this complexity; eravacycline has limited activity against P. aeruginosa, yet patients harboring this organism did equally well when treated with either eravacycline or meropenem in this study. Other trials with similar inclusion criteria have obtained the same result. We note that in the current study, of the 43 patients with P. aeruginosa identified as a baseline pathogen, 38 (20/22 in the eravacycline group and 18/21 in the meropenem group) had polymicrobial infections. In these cases, disruption of bacterial synergy may have contributed to the high rate of clinical cure, particularly in the eravacycline group. For patients in whom P. aeruginosa is suspected to be the predominant pathogen or who are at high risk of poor outcomes from this organism, such as those who are severely immunocompromised, specific therapy against P. aeruginosa should be considered.

As in other recently reported trials, we encountered a variety of ESBL enzyme types and CREs, and most organisms contained multiple ESBL types. Cure rates for ESBLs were uniformly high. Carbapenemase-producing pathogens were found only in patients who received meropenem, so a comparison cannot be made. To specifically address questions of the pathogenicity of ESBL-containing organisms in the presence of adequate source control, we refer to systematic reviews and observational studies that confirm improved outcomes if effective empiric treatment is provided to patients found to be infected with ESBL organisms and/or CRE. In ESBL bacteremia studies, cIAIs are a common source of bacteremic isolates. A recent high-quality, randomized, controlled trial confirmed these findings, with 16% of the bacteremias arising from intraabdominal sources. That study found significant differences in mortality by agent used (comparing piperacillin/tazobactam with meropenem).

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (third-generation cephalosporin-resistant), ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem for the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales in the absence of septic shock.

Other options include aminoglycosides, particularly for suspected infections by gram-negative bacteria. They are effective against P. aeruginosa, but are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria and need association with metronidazole. Because of their toxic side effects, some guidelines did not recommend aminoglycosides for the routine empiric treatment of community-acquired IAI, reserving them for patients with allergies to beta-lactam agents or in combination with beta-lactams for treatment of IAI with suspected MDR gram-negative bacteria.

Tigecycline is a viable treatment option, especially in empiric therapy, for complicated IAIs due to its favorable in vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, enterococci, several ESBL- and in association carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. It does not feature in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa or P. mirabilis. Caution is always advised for its use, in suspected bacteremia and healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The recent challenges of treating multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections, especially in critically ill patients, have renewed interest in the use of "old" antibiotics such as polymyxins and fosfomycin, now routinely used for treatment of MDR bacteria in critical ill patients.

Ceftolozone/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are new antibiotics that have been approved for treatment of cIAIs (in combination with metronidazole) including infection by ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. These antimicrobials will be valuable for treating infections caused by MDR gram-negative bacteria in order to preserve carbapenems. Ceftolozone/tazobactam has excellent in vitro activity against MDR P. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime/avibactam seems to have an in vitro activity against K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Although many reviews have been written, their precise role as empiric treatment for complicated IAI remains to be defined.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection: risk factors and clinical outcome [^39bef2c1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the risk factor for nosocomial bacteremia caused by Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and the influence on patient outcome.

Design

Retrospective, single-center study of consecutive bacteremic patients.

Settings

A university-affiliated teaching hospital.

Patients

A total of 85 patients with nosocomial bacteremia due to E. coli or K. pneumoniae were enrolled.

Intervention

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The demographic characteristics and clinical information including treatment were recorded upon review of patients' records. The primary end point was hospital mortality. Twenty-seven percent of isolates produced ESBLs. Previous treatment with 3rd-generation cephalosporins was the only independent risk factor for bacteremia due to ESBL-producing pathogens [odds ratio (OR) 4.146, P = 0.008]. Antibiotic treatment was considered appropriate in 71 cases (83%), and failed in 23 patients (27%). Twenty-one patients (25%) died in the hospital. Antibiotic treatment failure was the only independent risk factor for hospital mortality (OR 15.376, P = 0.001). Inappropriate antibiotic treatment might lead to significantly higher mortality rate (7/14 vs 14/71, P = 0.016). Patients treated with imipenem were more likely to survive while those receiving cephalosporin treatment tended to have a poorer outcome (1/19 vs 14/40, P = 0.023).

Conclusions

More judicious use of cephalosporins, especially 3rd-generation cephalosporins, may decrease ESBL-producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae bacteremia, and also improve patient outcome.

### Antimicrobial resistance as risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^00ede419]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health issue, associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Although the effects of AMR on clinical and economic outcomes have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the effects of AMR on infection recurrence, a significant event that results in substantial illness, death, and healthcare costs. Recurrence is of particular concern among bacteremia patients, who are often fragile and have underlying conditions, because bacteremia is associated with high rates of death and AMR. AMR in bacteremia is associated with greater infection severity, higher risk for treatment failure, and longer length of hospital stay, all of which may affect risk for recurrence.

Few studies have investigated AMR as a potential risk factor for recurrent bacteremia, and all have been limited to recurrence of infection attributable to the same bacterium that caused initial infection. Conversely, the few studies not targeting a specific bacterial species or patient population (e.g. those with underlying conditions) and studying risk factors associated with recurrence within 1 year did not consider AMR as a potential risk factor. However, when studying the link between AMR and recurrence, it is important to consider the prolonged microbial imbalance that broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure (i.e. standard bacteremia treatment) can induce on the host microbiome. This imbalance includes ensuing effects on host susceptibility to colonization and infection and effects on selection and duration of carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which, for instance, can exceed 1 year for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae. AMR in an initial bacteremia episode may thus increase risk for recurrence attributable not only to the same bacterium that caused the initial infection but to any bacterium, whether acquired in the community or hospital. As such, studying bacteremia recurrence across all bacterial species and sources of infection seems clinically relevant. Moreover, it is particularly important to focus on community-onset infections, given the increasing spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community settings globally.

In this study, we investigated the effect of AMR in incident community-onset bacteremia on the probability of bacteremia recurrence within 1 year. We restricted incident bacteremia episodes to infections caused by S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. 3 leading pathogens responsible for community-onset bacteremia, and to their leading forms of AMR of major public health concern: methicillin resistance for S. aureus and third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) resistance for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. the major mechanism of which is ESBL production.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

### Molecular mechanisms of re-emerging chloramphenicol susceptibility in extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales [^d94dbce5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health. Drug-resistant bacterial infections were estimated to be associated with 4.95 million deaths in 2019, with sub-Saharan Africa being the worst affected region. Among the most problematic drug-resistant bacteria are extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) which are resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) and classified as priority pathogens by the WHO. ESBL-E infections are associated with higher morbidity, mortality and economic burden in the treatment of bloodstream infections in Malawi, and in low resource settings such as Malawi access to effective treatment alternatives (e.g. carbapenems, or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) is often lacking. The prevalence of ESBL-E rapidly increased in Malawi after the 3GC ceftriaxone replaced chloramphenicol (CHL) as first-line empiric therapy for suspected sepsis from 2004.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^6a1dcfce]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Eravacycline, a broad-spectrum fluorocycline tetracycline antibiotic, was investigated in the treatment of cIAI by two prospective randomized clinical trials in which a non-inferior clinical cure rate in eravacycline population at the test-of-cure visits was found when compared to ertapenem and meropenem (IGNITE 1 trial: 87.0% for eravacycline versus 88.8% for ertapenem; IGNITE 4 trial: 90.8% versus 91.2%). Also, a very low risk of C. difficile infection after eravacycline treatment was observed. In a recent meta-analysis, Meng et al. revised the results of 25 randomized clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eravacycline compared with other seven regimens commonly used for cIAIs treatment (tigecycline, meropenem, ertapenem, ceftazidime/avibactam + metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, and ceftriaxone + metronidazole). In terms of microbiological response rate, eravacycline was significantly better than tigecycline [tigecycline versus eravacycline: RR = 0.82, 95% CI (0.65,0.99)], and there was no significant difference between the other 6 regimens and eravacycline (p > 0.05). In terms of safety, the incidence of serious adverse events, discontinuation rate, and all-cause mortality of eravacycline were not significantly different from those of the other 7 treatment therapies (p > 0.05). Both the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidance suggest using eravacycline as an alternative option for the treatment of infections secondary to ESBL-producing and CPE (including KPC, metallo-beta-lactamases [MBLs], OXA-48 producing strains), except for the treatment of bloodstream or urinary tract infections. Finally, in Hobbs Real-World experience, a possible clinical efficacy of eravacycline in treating infections due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was hypothesized, even though further evidence is needed. Like tigecycline, eravacycline presents large volume of distribution with excellent tissue penetration, which is supposed to limit its use in primary BSIs, and high biliary secretion. However, a post-hoc analysis conducted by Lawrence et al. eravacycline demonstrated a similar microbiological eradication rate as comparator agents in patients with cIAI associated with secondary bacteraemia.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^8aac9817]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics of patients

Over a ten-year period, a total of 220 patients with ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia were examined, and 110 patients (50%) were included in the final analysis (Fig. 1). Sixty-three patients (57%) received definitive antibiotic therapy with cefoxitin, while forty-seven (43%) were treated with carbapenems. In the carbapenem group, 22 patients (47%) were treated before 2015 and twenty-five (53%) after 2015. In the cefoxitin group, all patients but one were treated after 2015. Baseline characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1. Notable differences in clinical characteristic existed between the two treatment groups. Patients who received carbapenems as definitive antibiotic therapy had a higher SOFA score at the time of bacteremia (11 ± 5 vs 9 ± 4, p = 0.046) and more often required mechanical ventilation (87% vs 63%, respectively p = 0.005) than patients who received cefoxitin. Pneumonia and neuromeningeal infections as a source of bacteremia were statistically more frequent in the carbapenem group (30% vs 11% p = 0.014, 8% vs 0% p = 0.031, respectively), while urinary tract infections tended to be more frequent in patients treated by cefoxitin (6% vs 21%, p = 0.054). Cefoxitin administration was mostly discontinuous, with dosing of 6 g per day (n = 30/55, 58%), 8 g per day (n = 17/55, 32%) or adapted to renal function (n = 5/55, 10%). Three patients (6%) received continuous administration of cefoxitin. In the carbapenem group, 35 patients (74%) were treated with the combination of imipenem and cilastatin, while 12 patients (26%) received meropenem.

THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR MBL-PRODUCING CARBAPENEMASE-PRODUCING ENTEROBACTERALES

Limited therapeutic landscape and clinical impact

The management of infections caused by MBL-producing Enterobacterales represents a challenge in the clinical practice due to limited treatment options. This therapeutic gap might contribute to the poor outcomes in patients infected with MBL-producing strains. In the prospective ALARICO study including more than 1200 patients with BSIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, the attributable mortality for MBL-producing Enterobacterales was 35%, substantially higher than that reported for KPC-producing strains (5%). This difference likely reflects the lack of effective antimicrobial options for MBL, in contrast to the last decade's wave of development targeting KPC. Currently available and new treatment options for MBL-producing CRE are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Therapeutic options for MBL-producing CRE

Ceftazidime/avibactam plus aztreonam

Current guidelines recommend the use of ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) in combination with aztreonam (ATM) as preferred option for the treatment of severe infections due to MBL-producing Enterobacterales. Avibactam inhibits serine β-lactamases (e.g. ESBLs, AmpC), thereby protecting ATM from degradation by serine enzymes, that are coproduced in these isolates. This combination was found to be active against MBL in more than 97% of isolates. Clinical studies support the efficacy of this combination. A large recent cohort study including 343 patients with infections caused by MBL-producing CRE showed that the combination CZA plus ATM was associated with reduced mortality compared to colistin-containing regimens, also after propensity score matching.

However, some limitations to the use of CZA plus ATM should be underlined:
(1) a major challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to assess the in vitro activity. Several approaches, including the disc approximation method, the broth disc elution method, and the gradient test superposition method, are used but all these methods are not standardized and results are prone to subjective interpretations;
(2) the simultaneous administration of CZA plus ATM may be difficult in patients without multiple vascular lines. It is not known whether the nonsimultaneously administration of CZA plus ATM may affect the serum levels and pharmacokinetics of the drugs;
(3) some cases of NDM-producing Escherichia coli resistant to ATM/AVI have been reported, potentially limiting the use of CZA plus ATM.

### Risk factors for and clinical outcomes of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^bbff7c0f]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate risk factors and treatment outcomes of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP).

Design

Retrospective case-control study. Stored blood isolates of K. pneumoniae were tested for ESBL production by NCCLS guidelines, double-disk synergy test, or both.

Setting

A 1,500-bed, tertiary-care university hospital and referral center.

Patients

Sixty case-patients with bacteremia due to ESB-KP were compared with 60 matched control-patients with non-ESBL-KP.

Results

There were no significant differences in age, gender, APACHE II score, or underlying diseases between the groups. Independent risk factors for infections caused by ESBL-KP were urinary catheterization, invasive procedure within the previous 72 hours, and an increasing number of antibiotics administered within the previous 30 days. Complete response rate, evaluated 72 hours after initial antimicrobial therapy, was higher among control-patients (13.3% vs 36.7%; P = 0.003). Treatment failure rate was higher among case-patients (35.0% vs 15%; P = 0.011). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 30% for case-patients and 28.3% for control-patients (P = 0.841). Case-patients who received imipenem or ciprofloxacin as a definitive antibiotic had 10.5% mortality. The mortality rate for initially ineffective therapy was no higher than that for initially effective therapy (9.1% vs 11.1%; P = 1.000), but statistical power was low for evaluating mortality in the absence of septic shock.

Conclusion

For K. pneumoniae bacteremia, patients with ESBL-KP had a higher initial treatment failure rate but did not have higher mortality if antimicrobial therapy was appropriately adjusted in this study with limited statistical power.

### Assessment of three antibiotic combination regimens against Gram-negative bacteria causing neonatal sepsis in low-and middle-income countries [^054ab89c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are a major cause of neonatal sepsis in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 80% of these sepsis deaths could be prevented through improved treatment, the efficacy of the currently recommended first- and second-line treatment regimens for this condition is increasingly affected by high rates of drug resistance. Here we assess three well known antibiotics, fosfomycin, flomoxef and amikacin, in combination as potential antibiotic treatment regimens by investigating the drug resistance and genetic profiles of commonly isolated GNB causing neonatal sepsis in LMICs. The five most prevalent bacterial isolates in the NeoOBS study (NCT03721302) are Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae complex. Among these isolates, high levels of ESBL and carbapenemase encoding genes are detected along with resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and cefotaxime, the current WHO recommended empiric regimens. The three new combinations show excellent in vitro activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. Our data should further inform and support the clinical evaluation of these three antibiotic combinations for the treatment of neonatal sepsis in areas with high rates of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

### About ESBL-producing enterobacterales… [^36ad4a71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales are resistant to common antibiotics and may require complex treatments.
- Infections caused by ESBL-E can occur both in and outside of healthcare settings.
- Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales Some Enterobacterales produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Antimicrobial resistance ESBLs break down certain antibiotics, making some infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales difficult to treat. Prevalence In 2017, there were an estimated 197, 400 cases of ESBL-E among hospitalized patients and 9, 100 estimated deaths in the United States. Types ESBL-producing Enterobacterales include germs like Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Signs and symptoms ESBL-E can cause several different infections, including urinary tract and bloodstream infections. These bacteria can also live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, known as colonization. Reducing risk Patients and caregivers
- Wash their hands often with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Wash their hands after using the bathroom and before eating or preparing food.
- Remind people to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
- Follow recommended practices for food and water safety when traveling abroad. Healthcare providers Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Testing To determine if someone has an ESBL-E infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

CDC provides data that can be used for setting breakpoints for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Treatment and recovery Antimicrobial resistance and its effect on treatment ESBL-E infections are resistant to many prescribed antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. These infections might require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Carbapenems and risk of greater resistance Carbapenems are often used to treat serious ESBL-E infections, but resistance is on the rise for them, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

### Current options for the treatment of infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in different groups of patients [^800ad962]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are a frequent cause of invasive infections worldwide. Carbapenems are nowadays the most used drugs to treat these infections. However, due to the increasing rates of resistance to these antimicrobials, carbapenem-sparing alternatives are being investigated.

Objectives and Sources

The aim of this narrative literature review is to summarize the published information on the currently available antibiotics for the treatment of ESBL-E infections, providing specific information on three subgroups of patients: Group 1, patients with severe infections or infections from high-risk sources or in severely immunocompromised patients; Group 2, patients with non-severe infections from intermediate-risk source; and Group 3, patients with non-severe urinary tract infection.

Content and Implications

For patients in Group 1, the current data would support the use of carbapenems. For milder infections, however, particularly urinary tract infections, other non-carbapenem antibiotics can be considered in selected cases, including beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations, cephamycins, temocillin and aminoglycosides. While specific studies should be performed in these situations, individualized decisions may be taken in order to avoid overuse of carbapenems.

### Impact of a restrictive antibiotic policy on the acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in an endemic region: a before-and-after, propensity-matched cohort study in a caribbean intensive care unit [^8103fe16]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Procedures

The 2-year study period was split into two 1-year periods, which differed by the antibiotic policy employed. During the first year, the "conventional strategy period" (CSP), antibiotic therapy was prescribed at the physician's discretion based on national and international guidelines. This strategy included the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic as initial empirical treatment in the case of sepsis or suspected infection, followed by de-escalation after 48 to 72 h, based on microbiological data. The main regimens were combination therapies with a cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for community-acquired infections, and carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam combined with amikacin for hospital-acquired infections. Dosage, timing and duration followed French guidelines.

As part of a stewardship program, a new set of guidelines with a restrictive antibiotic protocol was established by the ICU team, approved by a multidisciplinary team and implemented on 1 January 2015. The "restrictive strategy period" (RSP) was based on seven principles. (1) For suspected infection, microbiological samples were taken immediately, and antibiotic therapy was initiated only after microbiological identification, except for septic shock, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and meningitis. (2) For non-documented septic shock and severe ARDS, an empiric combination therapy including a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside was immediately started after microbiological sampling according to the ICU protocol. Combined therapy included either second or third cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) for community-acquired septic shock, or cefoxitin for hospital-acquired septic shock (owing to the resistance to the previously listed cephalosporins and the high rate of susceptibility to cefoxitin of the ESBL-E) or an anti- Pseudomonas aeruginosa cephalosporin (ceftazidime or cefepime) for late (> 5 days) ventilation-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The second antibiotic was amikacin, unless a Gram-positive pathogen was highly suspected. Due to the low prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in our hospital, the first-line anti-staphylococcal treatment was cefazolin. (3) No use of piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems for empirical treatment, only for a documented infection without an alternative option. (4) Limited coverage on P. aeruginosa, unless indicated. (5) Limited coverage on subdiaphragmatic anaerobes, unless indicated. (6) Monotherapy as a definitive treatment. (7) Other characteristics of antibiotic treatment were short duration, high doses and de-escalation as soon as possible to the narrowest alternative, with a focus on penicillin, first- and second-generation cephalosporins, according to the attending physician and following ICU protocols (see detailed protocol in Additional file 1). The local epidemiology of resistant strains according to the unit and origin of samples in 2014–2015 is provided in Table 1: Additional file 1.

VABOMERE demonstrated efficacy with regard to clinical and microbiological response at the EOIVT visit and TOC visits in the m-MITT population as shown in Table 6.

In the m-MITT population, the rate of clinical and microbiological response in VABOMERE- treated patients with concurrent bacteremia at baseline was 10/12 (83.3%).

In a subset of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, genotypic testing identified certain ESBL groups (e.g. TEM, CTX-M, SHV and OXA) in both treatment groups of the Phase 3 cUTI trial. The rates of clinical and microbiological response were similar in the ESBL-positive and ESBL-negative subset at EOIVT; at TOC, clinical and microbiological response was lower in the ESBL-positive as compared to ESBL-negative subset in both treatment groups.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^df8e6b94]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines — empiric treatment options for resistant gram-negative pathogens in HA-IAI state that carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with de-escalation to piperacillin–tazobactam, cefepime, an aminoglycoside, a cephamycin, a fluoroquinolone, or tigecycline considered once susceptibilities are known, although ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are frequently resistant to these other agents and clinical experience with ceftolozane–tazobactam or ceftazidime–avibactam is still limited. Patients with extensive hospital exposure may be infected with AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacter or other Enterobacteriaceae, for which broad-spectrum carbapenems are generally considered the treatment of choice; ceftazidime–avibactam shows good in vitro activity and cefotaxime–tazobactam has activity against 70% of these strains, but clinical experience is quite limited. For KPC-producing strains, combining a carbapenem with an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, or tigecycline has been associated with the highest efficacy when the minimum inhibitory concentration to carbapenems is not too high, and ceftazidime–avibactam has activity against KPC-producing strains. Treatment of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is more problematic because these bacteria are resistant to nearly all β-lactam antibiotic agents, although aztreonam may be an exception, and combination therapy using agents such as a polymyxin, tigecycline, or fosfomycin is generally advocated. For these MDR, XDR, and PDR pathogens, combination regimens are generally used and may or may not include a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic agent, an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, tigecycline (not applicable for Pseudomonas), rifampin, or fosfomycin.
