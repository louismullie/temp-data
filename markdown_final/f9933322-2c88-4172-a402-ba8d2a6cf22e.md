## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for unilateral arm swelling?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for unilateral arm swelling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediately dangerous causes that require urgent exclusion, particularly upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. Then, I should organize the differential by pathophysiology and risk context. Next, I will align the initial and second-line imaging to pretest probability. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios such as catheter-related thrombosis, thoracic outlet pathology, primary and secondary lymphedema, infection, and malignancy, and close with a pragmatic diagnostic pathway and management touchpoints.

> Let me first confirm the triage priority: unilateral arm swelling mandates prompt exclusion of upper extremity venous thrombosis. Wait, let me verify the imaging hierarchy before I proceed; the ACR states venous thrombosis is the primary diagnosis to exclude, with duplex ultrasound as the first-line test for accessible peripheral veins and contrast venography as the reference standard when noninvasive studies are nondiagnostic, while gadolinium-enhanced MR or delayed CT venography are reasonable for central veins if suspicion remains high. I need to ensure I do not miss catheter-associated thrombosis, which often adds neck or facial edema, hoarseness, or shoulder pain in the right context [^116Zo6sj] [^111GjXtv].

> I will now examine effort-related thrombosis and dynamic venous compression because missing these can delay definitive therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in healthy adolescents or athletes with sudden arm swelling and pain after repetitive overhead activity, Paget-Schroetter syndrome should be suspected, with dynamic imaging often revealing subclavian vein compression and management that may include thrombolysis and decompression. Let me also consider venous thoracic outlet syndrome that can present with swelling even when no frank thrombus is seen, where dynamic venography or cross-sectional imaging can uncover costoclavicular compression amenable to decompression in selected patients [^114gTUEw] [^115xYEV5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially jotted the category as "Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (()" which is clearly malformed. Hold on, I should verify and correct that: it should read venous thoracic outlet syndrome, encompassing subclavian vein compression with or without thrombosis, sometimes with atypical associated symptoms such as headaches that resolve after thoracic outlet decompression, reminding me to keep a broad symptom map when swelling is provoked by arm maneuvers [^113qFQio] [^115xYEV5].

> Next, I should review lymphatic etiologies, both primary and secondary, because they commonly underlie persistent unilateral swelling once thrombosis is excluded. Let me consider objective quantification first; I need to ensure baseline measurements, as expert consensus recommends quantifying swelling to track disease and response. I should confirm imaging choices: lymphoscintigraphy can demonstrate impaired uptake or functional aplasia in primary lymphatic dysplasias such as WILD syndrome, while near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging may reveal decreased contractile function even with intact anatomy in pediatric primary lymphedema. I should also remember that breast cancer treatments, including sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary surgery, can produce persistent arm swelling that impacts function over time and requires longitudinal surveillance and lymphedema-directed care [^111BAQEj] [^112fTPri] [^111uWZog] [^1139YZC6] [^1142NLop].

> But wait, what if the swelling heralds an occult malignancy or venous hypertension from central venous stenosis. I should double-check for red flags such as constitutional symptoms, palpable masses, or device and dialysis access history. Breast cancer can rarely present first with unilateral arm edema due to axillary nodal disease, while lymphoma and other tumors can cause unilateral limb swelling by venous or lymphatic compression. I need to ensure I consider central venous stenosis, particularly in patients with ipsilateral dialysis access or prior intrathoracic devices, where fistulography or venography may be decisive and intervention may promptly relieve symptoms [^112iSP7n] [^111zuGgv] [^112FTtEb] [^114Kuv5n].

> I will now examine infectious and inflammatory mimics because they can look like venous disease but require different management. Hold on, I should verify the key discriminators: fever, focal myalgic tenderness, and systemic inflammatory signs point toward pyomyositis, where CT and pathogen identification guide early antibiotics and potential debridement. I need to remember iatrogenic or reactive causes too; extensive post-immunization limb swelling in children after DTaP can involve both subcutaneous tissue and muscle on ultrasound but generally resolves with supportive care, preventing unnecessary anticoagulation if DVT has been appropriately excluded [^113snZjN] [^111VgU3x].

> Let me think about how to structure the diagnostic pathway pragmatically. I should confirm laterality and time course, then risk factors such as central venous catheter, repetitive arm activity, cancer treatment, or dialysis access. Next, I need to ensure accurate physical examination with circumference or volume quantification to establish a baseline and assess for venous collaterals, skin changes, or masses. I should obtain urgent duplex venous ultrasound to evaluate for UEDVT; if negative but suspicion remains high, especially for central involvement, I will escalate to MR or CT venography or conventional venography depending on availability and clinical urgency. If venous studies are unrevealing and lymphedema is suspected, I should review lymphoscintigraphy or other lymphatic imaging, and if dialysis access or prior device history is present with signs of venous hypertension, I should pursue targeted fistulography or central venous imaging to evaluate for stenosis [^112zZJxU] [^116Zo6sj] [^111BAQEj] [^114Kuv5n].

> I need to check pediatric nuances because etiologies and imaging yield can differ in children. Primary lymphatic disorders may present at or soon after birth with unilateral arm swelling and can be functional rather than structural on advanced imaging, which supports conservative therapies like compression and manual drainage. Effort thrombosis from athletic activity can occur in adolescents, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion when swelling follows strenuous upper extremity loading, and use dynamic studies to uncover positional venous compromise [^111uWZog] [^114gTUEw].

> Finally, I should review management linkages aligned to the diagnosis. For confirmed UEDVT or catheter-related thrombosis, I need to ensure prompt anticoagulation and address the catheter when indicated per institutional protocols, acknowledging the iatrogenic contribution to recurrence risk. For venous thoracic outlet or dynamic subclavian vein obstruction, I should consider referral for decompression after thrombus management or when nonthrombotic obstruction drives symptoms. For lymphedema, I should confirm initiation of comprehensive decongestive therapy with compression, skin care, and exercise and document objective response over time. For pyomyositis and other infections, I need to ensure timely antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage when required to prevent mislabeling as DVT and consequent delays in care [^111GjXtv] [^115xYEV5] [^111BAQEj] [^113snZjN].

Unilateral arm swelling has a broad differential, but the most common and urgent causes are **DVT/venous obstruction** [^116Zo6sj] and **lymphedema** [^111BAQEj]. Other important etiologies include **infection**, **trauma**, **malignancy**, vascular anomalies, and systemic or medication-related causes [^112zZJxU]. A focused history and exam, with **targeted imaging** (ultrasound [^116Zo6sj], CT/MRI [^116Zo6sj], lymphoscintigraphy [^112fTPri]), are essential to determine the cause and guide management [^111BAQEj].

| **Category** | **Etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Venous | - DVT (axillary/subclavian) [^116Zo6sj] [^114gTUEw] <br/> - Catheter-related thrombosis [^111GjXtv] <br/> - Central venous stenosis/obstruction [^114Kuv5n] <br/> - Venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^113qFQio] [^115xYEV5] |
| Lymphatic | - Primary lymphedema [^113Z1ckS] [^111uWZog] <br/> - Secondary lymphedema (post-surgical, radiation, malignancy) [^111BAQEj] <br/> - Lymphatic malformations [^112fTPri] |
| Infectious | - Cellulitis [^112zZJxU] <br/> - Lymphangitis <br/> - Abscess <br/> - Pyomyositis [^113snZjN] |
| Traumatic | - Fractures (clavicle, humerus) [^114MziZv] <br/> - Soft tissue injury <br/> - Compartment syndrome |
| Malignancy | - Breast cancer [^112iSP7n] <br/> - Lymphoma [^112FTtEb] <br/> - Metastatic disease |
| Vascular anomalies | - AV fistula [^114Kuv5n] <br/> - Venous malformations [^113oXciA] <br/> - Hemangioma |
| Systemic/medication | - Angioedema [^113n32sz] <br/> - Drug-induced edema (NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers) [^111nJDny] [^112zZJxU] |

---

Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical [^112zZJxU], with **duplex ultrasound** [^116Zo6sj]; further imaging (CT/MRI, lymphoscintigraphy [^112fTPri]) is guided by clinical suspicion [^111BAQEj].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [^116Zo6sj]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Upper-extremity venous thrombosis often presents as unilateral arm swelling. The differential diagnosis includes lesions compressing the veins and causing a functional venous obstruction, venous stenosis, infection causing edema, obstruction of previously functioning lymphatics, or the absence of sufficient lymphatic channels to ensure effective drainage. The following recommendations are made with the understanding that venous disease, specifically venous thrombosis, is the primary diagnosis to be excluded or confirmed in a patient presenting with unilateral upper-extremity swelling.

Contrast venography remains the best reference-standard diagnostic test for suspected upper-extremity acute venous thrombosis and may be needed whenever other noninvasive strategies fail to adequately image the upper-extremity veins. Duplex, color flow, and compression ultrasound have also established a clear role in the evaluation of the more peripheral veins that are accessible to sonography. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI is routinely used to evaluate the status of the central veins. Delayed CT venography can often be used to confirm or exclude more central vein venous thrombi, although substantial contrast loads are required.

Imaging: lymphoscintigraphy and abdominal imaging

Lymphoscintigraphy in 17 patients demonstrated little or no uptake in the affected limb, suggesting functional aplasia of the initial lymphatic vessels. Affected and unaffected limbs were compared using a paired Student's t-test. Rates of technetium 99 retention in the hand and foot and rates of uptake in the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were significantly different between affected and unaffected limbs in those with unilateral arm or leg involvement (p < 0.05).

### Venous thoracic outlet syndrome as a cause of intractable migraines [^113qFQio]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) refers to the compression of the neurovascular bundle within the thoracic outlet. Cases are classified by primary etiology: arterial, neurogenic, or venous. In addition to the typical symptoms of arm swelling and paresthesias, headaches have been reported as a potential symptom of TOS. In this report, we describe a patient with debilitating migraines, which were consistently preceded by unilateral arm swelling. Resolution of symptoms occurred only after thoracic outlet decompression. Patients with migraines and concomitant swelling and/or paresthesias, especially related to provocative arm maneuvers, should be considered a possible atypical presentation of TOS and evaluated in more detail.

### Update and audit of the St George's classification algorithm of primary lymphatic anomalies: a clinical and molecular approach to diagnosis [^113Z1ckS]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

In the category of congenital onset lymphoedema, this condition is defined as lymphoedema that is present at birth or develops within the first year of life. Bilateral lower limb swelling is the most frequent presentation, but the swelling may be unilateral and/or involve the arms, genitalia, and/or face, depending on the underlying cause. There are a number of genetic disorders presenting with congenital lymphoedema.

Milroy disease (ORPHA79452; OMIM 153100) is the most common form, occurring as a result of pathogenic variants in FLT4/VEGFR3. The mutation may occur de novo, so a family history is not essential for this diagnosis. The lymphoedema is always confined to the lower limbs but may be unilateral and may (rarely) involve the genitalia. Approximately 10% of mutation carriers do not have lymphoedema. Fetuses with Milroy disease may present antenatally with pedal oedema in the third trimester and, in a few cases, with bilateral hydrothoraces, which resolve before birth.

Pathogenic variants in VEGFC, the ligand for VEGFR3, have also been identified in association with congenital primary lymphoedema of Gordon (OMIM 615907), also affecting the lower limbs.

The congenital category represents 21% of the patients seen in 2016 compared with 24% in 2010. A pathogenic variant was identified in 19 of the 47 (40%) patients genetically tested in this category. The majority had pathogenic variants identified in FLT4/VEGFR3 and, in one patient, a pathogenic variant in the GJC2 gene.

### Severe thoracic pyomyositis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113snZjN]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pyomyositis may mimic deep vein thrombosis and be misdiagnosed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report here on a patient with SLE who presented with severe thoracic pyomyositis, right upper arm swelling, and fever. The patient fully recovered after serial surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy. Pyomyositis, as well as deep vein thrombosis, should be considered during the differential diagnosis of patients with SLE experiencing fever and unilateral limb oedema. CT scans and identification of causal pathogens are crucial in the diagnosis of pyomyositis. Early effective antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention can together bring about a better outcome.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as a presenting symptom of central venous stenosis secondary to an ipsilateral upper arm arteriovenous PTFE graft [^114Kuv5n]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old man presented with a swollen left arm and unilateral pulsatile tinnitus two weeks following a left upper arm polytetrafluoroethylene graft was created for hemodialysis access. A fistulogram of the left upper arm showed a central venous stenosis and significant retrograde flow up the left internal jugular vein. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was attempted unsuccessfully, and fistula ligation was subsequently performed. This led to the immediate resolution of the tinnitus. The venous stenosis was likely secondary to a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, which had been removed one year previously.

Central venous stenosis is a common but often asymptomatic complication of a cardiac device, with the exception of patients with upper extremity arteriovenous fistulas, who frequently develop symptomatic venous hypertension. This generally presents with ipsilateral arm swelling and/or high venous pressures during dialysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pulsatile tinnitus arising in this context.

### American academy of orthopaedic surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^114MziZv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Clavicle fractures can be associated with several symptoms and conditions, including arm numbness, shoulder pain, and shoulder swelling. They are often related to sports participation, motor vehicle accidents, and traumatic injuries. Other associated conditions include decreased shoulder active and passive range of motion (ROM), chest pain, pneumothorax, and shoulder deformity. Patients may also experience shoulder crepitus, osteoporosis, chest wall ecchymosis, falls, arm pain, arm weakness, bone cancer, and an external rotation lag sign.

Tests such as the belly press test and signs like decreased shoulder active ROM are also pertinent in the diagnosis and assessment of clavicle fractures.

### Down in the mumps [^113hesg7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

A 10-week-old female infant presented with right-sided facial swelling without any constitutional symptoms. The swelling was nontender, nonfluctuant, with no erythema or induration. Based on the clinical picture, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and serology, a diagnosis of unilateral mumps parotitis was made. The United Kingdom is currently experiencing a mumps epidemic, with a 28-fold rise in the number of cases over the last 10 years. Infants are increasingly affected. Mumps parotitis, which was previously unreported in infants, needs to be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when a small child presents with swelling of the parotid gland.

### A case of unilateral proptosis secondary to prostatic metastasis [^115kKD3A]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer metastases involving the orbit and/or paranasal sinuses represent a rare oncological presentation. Patients can experience a myriad of symptoms such as proptosis, periorbital swelling, blurry vision, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, and anosmia, among others, depending on the structures involved. The differential diagnosis of paranasal sinus masses on imaging studies is broad and can include inflammatory, congenital, or neoplastic masses, leading to the requirement of a biopsy for definitive diagnosis. A tissue sample is usually obtained via an endoscopic approach. The prognosis of such a presentation is not well described in the literature, but it is usually guarded due to the advanced stage of the disease and generally a poorly differentiated primary tumor. Treatments usually aim to reduce the burden of disease and debulk the tumor mass for palliative purposes. We present a case of a 71-year-old male presenting with unilateral proptosis and periorbital swelling secondary to prostatic metastasis.

### Large birth mark and unilateral swelling of the lower extremity in a young teenager [^111wydRx]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

We describe an early adolescent male who was diagnosed with vascular malformation associated with unilateral limb overgrowth. This diagnosis was based on the clinical findings of a persistent port-wine stain since birth and gradually progressing right lower limb oedema since early childhood. Clinicians should keep in mind to clinically evaluate such malformations in detail, as well as contemplate genetic testing in patients presenting with a large port-wine stain at birth, particularly if well demarcated and lateral in a lower extremity.

### Metastatic Crohn's disease in a boy presenting with genital swelling [^116Xbhgg]. Pediatric dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Cutaneous manifestations of Crohn's disease are uncommon and occasionally can affect the genitals with varying symptomatology. When cutaneous features precede or occur in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, this condition may remain undiagnosed. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented for evaluation of persistent penile edema with clinicopathological features consistent with a diagnosis of genital metastatic Crohn's disease, successfully treated with infliximab.

### Management of an external jugular vein aneurysm in a young patient [^114PwiFr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

External jugular vein aneurysm (EJVA) is a rare clinical entity. A 23-year-old man presented with a spontaneous unilateral cervical swelling. Physical examination revealed a soft, nonpulsatile mass at the left supraclavicular region. Color duplex ultrasound combined with computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of an EJVA. A surgical excision was accomplished without any complications during the early follow-up. EJVA mandates a high index of suspicion in the differential diagnosis of a neck mass. The open surgical approach seems to be a safe and effective therapeutic strategy.

### Risk factors and prediction model for persistent breast-cancer-related lymphedema: a 5-year cohort study [^113Uj1N1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

This study involved 342 patients with breast cancer with unilateral arm swelling and a mean age of 52.31 ± 11.25 years. Among them, 229 (67%) were patients with persistent lymphedema (PLE). The comparison of demographics, disease, treatment, and swelling characteristics between PLE and transient lymphedema (TLE) are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

As shown in Table 1, the average age at surgery or onset of swelling was significantly higher for patients with PLE than those with TLE (p = 0.017 and p = 0.011, respectively). The risk of PLE for patients with breast cancer (after the onset of swelling) significantly increased with respect to the severity of the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) cancer stage (p = 0.001). A similar phenomenon was observed for the AJCC node stage (p = 0.004), but not the AJCC tumor stage (p = 0.169).

As shown in Table 2, patients treated with MRM had the highest risk of PLE among the four types of surgery. The average number of lymph node metastases was significantly higher for patients with PLE than for those with TLE (p < 0.001). The risks of PLE were significantly associated with radiation therapy (RT) (p = 0.004) and RT to regional lymph nodes, including SC-RT, IM-RT, and axillary-RT (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively).

The results in Table 3 indicate that, among the various swelling characteristics, significant differences existed between the two types of lymphedema in the following variables: weight changes from presurgery to the onset of swelling (p = 0.012), the maximal circumference difference (CD) of both arms (p < 0.001), and the initial severity of lymphedema (p < 0.001).

### Clinical effectiveness of unilateral single-armed vasoepididymostomy in obstructive azoospermia: A single-center experience [^1122ePRc]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Vasoepididymostomy (VE) is an important surgical treatment to achieve natural conception for patients with obstructive azoospermia (OA). Only unilateral VE can be performed under certain conditions, such as in OA patients with congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) and some acquired OA cases. There is a lack of relevant reports assessing the clinical outcomes of unilateral VE in OA patients with different causes. This study aims to describe the clinical features and evaluate treatments and outcomes of unilateral single-armed VE in OA patients.

- **Methods**: From December 2015 to June 2021, 46 OA patients (including 13 with CUAVD-associated OA and 33 with acquired OA) underwent unilateral single-armed VE at Shanghai General Hospital (Shanghai, China). Patient information, semen analysis, hormone profiles, and treatment information were collected, and the clinical outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: Obstruction in the distal portion of the unilateral vas deferens was the most common cause for OA patients who underwent unilateral VE (16/46), with CUAVD accounting for 28.4% (13/46). The overall patency rate was 50.0% (23/46), with 38.5% (5/13) for the CUAVD group and 54.5% (18/33) for the acquired group (p > 0.05). The natural pregnancy rates in the CUAVD group and acquired group were 20.0% and 33.3%, respectively (p > 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest that unilateral single-armed VE can achieve high patency and pregnancy rates in OA patients, whether for those with CUAVD or acquired OA.

### Unilateral leg swelling and liver enzyme elevation in an adolescent [^116mLSjL]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 15-year-old female developed sudden onset right lower extremity swelling, pain, and erythematous linear streaking from the ankle to mid-thigh. Duplex venous ultrasound revealed multiple superficial and deep venous thrombi in the right lower extremity. Incidentally, the patient was also noted to have elevated transaminases and microcytic anemia with significant iron deficiency. Additional evaluation ultimately led to the diagnosis of two distinct but interconnected chronic conditions, one of which progressed to requiring liver transplantation.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113c9qu6]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of acute epididymitis, particularly in terms of differential diagnosis, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend referring patients who present with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset and test results that do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection (UTI). If the diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, these patients should be immediately referred to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion.

### Large cystic tumour at the chest wall mimicking an echinococcosis: A case report [^115PzCyY]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The authors report an atypical late onset of a large axillary lymphatic malformation in a 41-year-old male. Considering the patient's history and clinical findings at first presentation, the swelling was highly suspicious for malignancy or cystic echinococcosis. A subsequent CT scan showed non-infiltrative growth with inhomogeneous density but remained inconclusive regarding the diagnosis. An incision biopsy subsequently revealed lymphatic tissue and raised suspicion for lymphatic malformation. The tumour was excised completely and showed no recurrence in a 1-year follow-up. Late-onset lymphatic malformations can mimic malignant tumours or other rare conditions, such as echinococcosis, which must be considered as a differential diagnosis, especially in known areas of hydatid disease.

### Spontaneous subclavian vein thrombosis in a healthy adolescent cheerleader: A case of Paget-Schroetter syndrome [^114gTUEw]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

We present the case of a healthy 13-year-old female adolescent who developed acute progressive swelling and pain in her right upper extremity, which was secondary to an acute deep venous thrombosis of her right subclavian vein. Dynamic imaging revealed subclavian vein compression at the junction of the first rib and proximal third of the clavicle, consistent with Paget-Schroetter syndrome, also known as effort-related thrombosis. The compressive etiology of her thrombus was most likely related to her cheerleading activity, in which she served as the pyramid base. The patient received multimodal therapy, including anticoagulation, mechanical and site-directed thrombolysis, and a first rib resection. This case illustrates that frontline providers should have a high index of suspicion for an upper extremity thrombosis in pediatric patients who present with unilateral arm swelling.

### Adult woman presenting progressive enlargement of mass on the left leg [^11591ZXF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Answers**:

	- A. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Lower extremity lymphedema is caused by the excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. The initially affected area of lower extremity lymphedema is usually the distal part of the leg, such as the ankle, foot, and toes. However, the foot of the patient is completely spared.

	- B. Chronic venous disease (CVD) – Incorrect. CVD is associated with telangiectasias, varicose veins, swelling, and skin changes. Leg swelling in CVD often occurs in the ankles and calves, while the feet are usually spared, and it can be effectively improved by leg elevation.

	- C. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) – Correct. PNs are benign nerve sheath tumors that commonly occur in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The family history of NF1 is significant in her father and aunt. The MRI result showed a well-demarcated, encapsulated, ≥ 3 cm lesion matching the imaging features of PNs. Histologically, they exhibit a typical composition of spindled cells with wavy, tapered, and comma-shaped nuclei.

	- D. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) – Incorrect. KTS is a congenital disorder characterized by capillary, lymphatic, and venous system malformation, as well as bone and/or soft tissue hypertrophy. MRI can identify the asymmetric soft tissue hypertrophy and osteohypertrophy of the leg. Leg function impairment secondary to hypertrophy can be observed in KTS, but many patients demonstrate reduced body area rather than increased growth. In comparison, most PNs are characterized by continuous growth, and PN shrinkage mainly occurs in adults.

- **Thromboembolic events**: Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events. These include swelling, warmth, pain, or redness of the skin which could indicate blood clots in the legs or arms; shortness of breath or severe chest pain which may be symptoms of blood clots in the chest, affecting the heart and lungs; headache, confusion, difficulty with speech or movement, numbness of the face, eye pain or swelling, or vision problems, potentially indicating blood clots in the brain or eyes; and sudden pain in the stomach or lumbar area, which could suggest blood clots in the gut or kidneys. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider for mild reactions and to seek urgent medical attention for moderate to severe reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Conditions with tissue factor overexpression**: In conditions where tissue factor is overexpressed, such as advanced atherosclerotic disease, crush injury, cancer, or septicemia, there may be a risk of thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with Alhemo treatment.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Inform patients of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions. These include rash, redness, hives, itching, facial swelling, tightness of the chest, and wheezing. Additionally, signs of an anaphylactic reaction may include itching on large areas of skin; redness and/or swelling of lips, tongue, face, or hands; difficulty swallowing; and shortness of breath.

### Split notochord syndrome with congenital unilateral Horner's SIGN [^111Z4shz]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old boy exhibited congenital right Horner's sign and right finger, wrist, and elbow flexion arthrogryposis. He had dyspnea and feeding difficulty 12 hours after birth. Radiologic examination revealed a thoracoabdominal intestinal tube and mediastinal cystic lesion on the right side, with a vertebral anomaly at the cervical level. Histopathologically, the intestinal tube was diagnosed as bowel duplication. Because the mediastinal lesion could not be resected surgically, no histopathological diagnosis was made.

Embryologically, the combination of transdiaphragmatic duplication, mediastinal cystic lesion, anterior spina bifida, and hemivertebra suggested notochord malformation. The diagnosis was split notochord syndrome, an extremely rare embryological malformation syndrome. Congenital unilateral Horner syndrome often has an unknown etiology. In this case, cervical vertebral anomalies and the mediastinal cystic lesion implied a compressed nerve root, resulting in Horner syndrome and right finger, wrist, and elbow flexion joint contracture. Split notochord syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of congenital unilateral Horner syndrome.

### Facial infiltrative lipomatosis [^113i5oLq]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Although multiple case reports and small series exist concerning facial infiltrative lipomatosis, there is no composite radiological description of the condition.

- **Objective**: Radiological evaluation of facial infiltrative lipomatosis using plain film, sonography, CT, and MRI.

- **Materials and methods**: We radiologically evaluated four patients with facial infiltrative lipomatosis. Initial plain radiographs of the face were acquired in all patients. Three children underwent an initial sonographic examination to evaluate the condition, followed by MRI. One child had a CT scan and then an MRI.

- **Results**: One child displayed abnormalities on plain radiographs. Sonographically, the lesions appeared as ill-defined, heterogeneously hypoechoic areas with indistinct margins. On CT images, the lesions did not exhibit a homogeneous fat density but showed some relatively denser areas in the deeper parts of the lesions. MRI provided better delineation of the exact extent of the process and characterization of facial infiltrative lipomatosis.

- **Conclusion**: Facial infiltrative lipomatosis should be considered a differential diagnosis of vascular or lymphatic malformation when a child presents with unilateral facial swelling. MRI is the most useful single imaging modality to evaluate the condition, as it provides the best delineation of the exact extent of the process.

### Near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging of a toddler with congenital lymphedema [^111uWZog]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Primary lymphedema in the pediatric population remains poorly diagnosed and misunderstood due to a lack of information on the causation and underlying anatomy of the lymphatic system. Consequently, therapeutic protocols for pediatric patients remain sparse and with little evidence to support them. In an effort to better understand the causation of primary pediatric lymphedema and to better inform clinical care, we report the use of near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging on the extremities of an alert, 21-month-old boy who presented with unilateral right arm and hand lymphedema at birth. The imaging results indicated an intact, apparently normal lymphatic anatomy with no obvious malformation, but with decreased lymphatic contractile function of the affected upper extremity relative to the contralateral and lower extremities. We hypothesized that the lack of contraction of the lymphatic vessels, rather than an anatomic malformation, was the source of the unilateral extremity swelling, and that compression and manual lymphatic drainage could be effective treatments.

### Lymphoedema praecox in a young woman: a rare disease [^115eHxEW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Primary lymphoedema is a rare disorder that often presents at a young age with asymptomatic limb oedema and gradual progression. We present a 16-year-old woman with a history of swelling in the left lower limb for 6 years. She exhibited isolated left lower limb oedema, which was non-pitting. Imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis of primary lymphoedema. The patient was managed conservatively, as she did not have any other issues besides the left lower limb oedema.

### An atypical case of Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome presenting with crossed-bilateral limb hypertrophy and postaxial polydactyly: A case report [^115Tn1Co]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

This patient had multiple cystic masses, all identified as lymphatic malformations. Lymphatic malformation presents as localized or generalized overgrowth caused by micro- and macrocystic anomalies, sometimes in association with lymphedema. Often, there is lymphatic swelling and fatty deposition on the contralateral foot. The lymphatic anomalies can also occur in the pelvis, bladder, and lower gastrointestinal tract, while lymphatic cysts in the spleen are common. Lymphatic malformation is documented by ultrasonography and/or MRI. Lymphography shows that lymphedema results from a diminished number or absence of lymphatic channels.

Our patient had port wine stains on the trunk, back, and extremities, along with cross-bilateral hypertrophy of the right lower limb and left upper limb, which is unusual. Limb involvement is most often unilateral (85%), sometimes bilateral (12.5%), and only rarely crossed-bilateral (2.5%). Varicose veins were not present on physical examination or imaging. Furthermore, this patient had postaxial polydactyly of the left hand, which has only been described in four other KTS cases, none with cross-bilateral limb involvement. Other limb anomalies including macrodactyly, syndactyly, clinodactyly, camptodactyly, ectrodactyly, and congenital hip dislocation have been reported in association with KTS. However, this case represents the first KTS case with both cross-bilateral limb involvement and polydactyly. The patient had a history of polydactyly in a maternal grandfather. Polydactyly can be inherited and may also form part of the KTS syndrome.

### Unilateral mydriasis after maxillary osteotomy: A case series and review of the literature [^111nHKB6]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To present four cases of unilateral mydriasis associated with orthognathic surgery and to review the differential diagnosis and management related to this condition, four cases were identified from the authors' institutional experience. All maxillary osteotomies performed by the authors' department from 2001 to 2013 were identified based on Procedural Terminology codes. Four cases of unilateral mydriasis were found and are presented alongside a review of the literature.

Two male and two female patients, aged between 16 and 34 years, developed unilateral mydriasis after maxillary osteotomy; the estimated prevalence is 0.004%. Although determining the precise cause can be challenging, the series attributed one case to swelling affecting the contents of the superior orbital fissure, another to edema or medications, and two to pharmacological induction.

Although rare, reviewing the differential diagnosis for and management of unilateral mydriasis associated with orthognathic surgery is important for those performing corrective jaw surgery.

### Ultrasound examination of extensive limb swelling reactions after diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis or reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis immunization in preschool-aged children [^111VgU3x]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the site, extent, and resolution of tissue involvement when extensive limb swelling occurred in the injected limb for children who received the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) or reduced-antigen content DTaP vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age.

- **Methods**: Children who experienced an injection site reaction at 18 months of age were assigned randomly to receive an intramuscular injection of either the reduced-antigen content DTaP vaccine or the DTaP vaccine between the ages of 4 and 6 years. Those who developed extensive limb swelling were assessed through clinical examination. Ultrasound studies of the affected and opposite (control) arms were performed 24 to 48 hours after immunization and again 48 to 96 hours later.

- **Results**: Twelve children with extensive limb swelling were enrolled in the study. Ultrasound examinations demonstrated swelling in both the subcutaneous and muscle layers of the vaccinated arm. The ultrasound assessment showed that the swelling exceeded the clinical measurements of skin redness and swelling. Subcutaneous and muscle tissues expanded to 281% and 111% of the tissue thicknesses of the control arm, respectively. Repeat ultrasound examinations conducted after 48 to 96 hours showed considerable resolution of muscle swelling compared with subcutaneous tissue swelling. There was no significant difference in the extent of swelling detected between children who received the DTaP vaccine.

The EADV 2021 guidelines provide recommendations regarding the screening and diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis, particularly focusing on its differentiation from other autoimmune bullous diseases. These include:

- **Linear IgA dermatosis**: Differentiate based on clinical presentation and serological findings.
- **Bullous pemphigoid**: Identify through specific immunofluorescence patterns.
- **Anti-laminin gamma-1 pemphigoid**: Requires distinct serological markers for differentiation.
- **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita**: Characterized by specific skin fragility and scarring.
- **Bullous SLE**: Distinguished by systemic lupus erythematosus features.
- **Pemphigus herpetiformis**: Requires clinical and immunopathological correlation.
- **IgA pemphigus**: Identified through unique immunopathological features.

Careful clinical and serological evaluation is crucial for accurate differentiation.

### Worsening solid facial edema: An unusual case of angiosarcoma [^111zN6jg]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A man in his 70s was referred for evaluation of worsening right-sided facial edema of 4 months' duration. At initial onset, he experienced fever and generalized malaise, which resolved. The edema steadily progressed to encompass the entire right side of his face with serous drainage that soaked through his pillow at night. He denied pruritus, dysphagia, or difficulty breathing. He also noted a 14-pound weight loss along with a decreased appetite. He had completed two courses of clindamycin and was taking cephalexin, 500 mg twice daily, for a suspected infectious etiology, but experienced only mild improvement.

On physical examination, erythematous, nonpitting, and indurated edema was observed involving his right eyelid, cheek, postauricular skin, scalp, and anterior neck. Serous drainage on the right malar area and a superficial erosion on his postauricular skin were noted. The area was warm and tender to palpation. Flexible laryngoscopy did not find any abnormalities in the pharynx and larynx.

The subacute onset of hemifacial erythema and edema was concerning for vascular or lymphatic obstruction. A neck ultrasound scan did not show thrombosis of the neck veins. Head computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast found patent vascular structures and diffuse skin and soft tissue thickening on the right side, with several small right-sided enlarged lymph nodes. A biopsy of the right postauricular skin found acanthosis.

### Vascular malformation masquerading as sialolithiasis and parotid obstruction: A case report and review of the literature [^113oXciA]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Salivary gland obstruction caused by sialolithiasis or duct stricture is one of the more common causes of non-infectious unilateral facial swelling. Vascular malformations of the head and neck are less common but may present with intermittent facial swelling. Phleboliths can be found in venous malformations of nearly all adult patients and are a key diagnostic imaging finding. The clinical and radiographic appearance of phleboliths may resemble sialolithiasis, making the diagnosis more difficult. We present a case of intermittent unilateral facial swelling caused by a venous malformation involving the buccal space, where the phleboliths were initially misdiagnosed as parotid sialolithiasis.

- **Study design**: Illustrative case report and literature review.

- **Methods**: A 48-year-old woman presented to our office with 9 months of intermittent left facial swelling. On bimanual examination, multiple small firm nodules were palpated in the left cheek. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated multiple oval-shaped radiopaque lesions in the buccal space, initially interpreted as sialoliths. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained, confirming the diagnosis of venous malformation with phleboliths. Sialendoscopy revealed a normal appearing parotid duct system without stricture or sialolithiasis. Ultrasound revealed a buccal space vascular lesion surrounding the distal Stensen's duct.

- **Results**: Currently, the patient is being observed and is clinically stable. Illustrative CT scan and MRI images are presented. A literature review shows that vascular malformations mimic similar conditions, which can complicate diagnosis.

### Surgical management of perineal masses in patients with anorectal malformations [^115feRDy]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to review the outcome of surgical management of various types of perineal masses encountered in patients with anorectal malformations (ARM).

- **Methods**: Retrospective review from two large pediatric anorectal referral centers.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients with a perineal mass were identified among more than 2000 patients treated for an ARM over a 15-year period. The 22 patients (4 men) represented all levels of severity of ARMs. The lesions were of three types: lipomas (n = 10), vascular anomalies (n = 4), and hamartomas/choristomas (n = 8). The lipomas were carefully removed from between the muscle fibers during the posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. The vascular anomalies, three of which were hemangiomas, underwent magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively but none were found to invade deeply; all were excised at the time of the posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. The hamartomas/choristomas all occurred in women, and 50% arose as a pedunculated mass from the vulva. The lesions contained tissues such as glia, osteoid, nephrogenic rests, and endocervical-type mucosa. One was initially misinterpreted as a teratoma, prompting a wider excision; however, this and all subsequent patients were correctly diagnosed pathologically as having either hamartomas or choristomas, which were not widely excised. Follow-up ranges from 5 months to 12 years. Six of the 10 lipoma patients are continent. One vascular anomaly was re-excised and there was minor wound separation in another. None of the hamartoma/choristoma lesions recurred.

- **Conclusion**: The presence of unusual perineal masses requires careful diagnostic and surgical approaches to avoid misinterpretation and inappropriate treatment strategies.

### Unilateral lower extremity swelling as a rare presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^111zuGgv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Lower extremity oedema is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The challenge is to correctly identify the aetiology of oedema and hence manage the cause effectively. Oedema can be classified into venous oedema and lymphoedema. Lymphoedema of the lower extremities is usually bilateral. Unilateral leg lymphoedema may occur secondary to radiation, surgery, compression by a tumour, or early filariasis infection. Unilateral lower extremity lymphoedema has been reported as a rare initial presentation for lymphoma, mostly in women, usually without B-symptoms, and often with inguinal lymphadenopathies or abdominal masses. In this paper, we report a rare case of unilateral lower extremity oedema in a healthy male presenting to the outpatient clinic following trauma; further work-up revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy compressing the iliac veins.

### A 12-year-old boy presenting with unilateral proximal interphalangeal joint swelling [^1174Zvgv]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Pachydermodactyly is a rare and benign superficial dermal fibromatosis characterized by asymptomatic soft tissue hypertrophy of the lateral and dorsal aspects of the proximal interphalangeal joints. The condition primarily affects males, with only few reported cases in females, and typically begins to develop around puberty. Pachydermodactyly usually involves the second, middle, and ring fingers of the hand symmetrically and bilaterally. Most reported cases show bilateral joint involvement, with only a minority reporting unilateral involvement. In this case report, the authors review the literature and discuss a case of pachydermodactyly presenting as unilateral swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joints of only the left hand in a right-handed young male.

### Patient-reported outcomes for the Intergroup Sentinel Mamma study (INSEMA): A randomised trial with persistent impact of axillary surgery on arm and breast symptoms in patients with early breast cancer [^1139YZC6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The 3-item arm symptoms scores showed major differences between the first randomization treatment arms. Arm functioning worsened in both groups, but the deterioration was much greater in the SLNB group than in the no SLNB group (P < 0.001). The BRAS scores favor the no SLNB group in all post-baseline assessments. Patients in the SLNB group showed persistently higher scores for BRAS, with differences in mean values ≥ 5.0 points at all times of evaluation, including pain, arm swelling, and impaired mobility in all postoperative visits. The highest difference was observed at one month after the final surgery, with mean scores of 23.6 vs. 12.6.

- **Curves for PROs concerning QLQ-BR23 arm symptoms (BRAS scales) and first randomization**:
	- A: Overall with P-values for treatment, time, and treatment by time
	- **B**: Pain in arm or shoulder
	- **C**: Swelling in arm or hand
	- **D**: Arm mobility limited

The most remarkable differences between treatment arms were observed for pain in the arm or shoulder and limited arm mobility at one month postoperatively. Each item, including arm swelling, showed a persistent impact by treatment arms at all time points, favoring the no SLNB group.

The second randomization with a greater extent of axillary surgery revealed more significant differences using BRAS mean scores favoring SLNB alone at all post-baseline visits (P < 0.001). The prominent impairment occurred between 1 and 3 months following surgery.

### Chiari malformation type 1 presenting as unilateral progressive foot drop: A case report and review of literature [^113FKq7D]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Foot drop is a disabling neurological condition that requires careful evaluation to identify the cause. The differential diagnosis for foot drop is broad; however, it mostly involves disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Here, we present an extremely rare central cause of foot drop in a child, which, if not recognized early, could lead to multiple complications.

### Severe thoracic pyomyositis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus [^111QG118]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pyomyositis may mimic deep vein thrombosis and be misdiagnosed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report here on a patient with SLE who presented with severe thoracic pyomyositis, characterized by right upper arm swelling and fever. The patient fully recovered after serial surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy.

- **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Pyomyositis, as well as deep vein thrombosis, should be considered during the differential diagnosis of patients with SLE experiencing fever and unilateral limb oedema.
- **Diagnostic tools**: CT and identification of causal pathogens are crucial in the diagnosis of pyomyositis.
- **Treatment outcomes**: Early effective antibiotic treatment, combined with surgical intervention, can lead to better outcomes.

Acute onset upper extremity edema can pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency physician, with conditions ranging from mild local allergic reactions to deep venous thrombosis to underlying life-threatening conditions. We discuss a case of a 10-year-old female with upper extremity edema and the diagnostic considerations, which ultimately led to uncovering a malignant etiology. This case represents a rare presentation of her underlying diagnosis, anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

### Penile and scrotal swelling: An underrecognized presentation of Crohn's disease [^114Lfo2N]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Penile and scrotal swelling can occur as an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) and is thought to be an uncommon form of metastatic CD (MCD). Because of the rarity of this manifestation, much is unknown concerning the presentation, treatment, and response to therapy in children with genital MCD.

- **Methods**: Boys aged 1 to 17 years presenting with genital edema and a confirmed diagnosis or strong suspicion of CD who were evaluated at the Mayo Clinic between 1996 and 2014 were included for review. We sought to characterize the clinical and pathological features of genital MCD and the response to treatment in our cohort of patients.

- **Results**: Eight patients with genital MCD were identified from our institution (mean age 11.4 years, range 7–16 years). Seven (88%) patients experienced cutaneous symptoms before a formal diagnosis of CD was made, and two of the seven had no adverse gastrointestinal symptoms at that time. Patients were prescribed an average of 3.4 medications (topical and systemic) for the management of their gastrointestinal CD and MCD.

- **Conclusions**: Penile and scrotal swelling can occur as an extraintestinal manifestation of CD and is thought to be an uncommon form of MCD. In boys, genital swelling typically precedes intestinal CD. Treatment of the underlying CD with systemic medications was most helpful in this series. An evaluation for CD is necessary in all patients presenting with unexplained genital swelling.

### Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis: The Manchester experience [^115iEyhK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

The majority of patients in our cohort presented with a short history of unilateral periocular swelling. Periocular swelling is a common, non-specific symptom which may be associated with many less serious infective conditions, such as pre-septal cellulitis. Given the severity of the swelling in our cohort, the differential diagnosis in most patients was orbital cellulitis, and urgent ophthalmology input was sought. Early commencement of antimicrobial therapy for probable orbital cellulitis was common and preceded the clinical diagnosis of PONF in all cases. In most cases, the clinical diagnosis of PONF was delayed until the patient was referred and transferred from the presenting trust to our centre for ophthalmic assessment, which caused a delay in diagnosis and appropriate management for PONF.

Patient 4 of this case series presented to a different centre with unilateral periocular swelling and scab-like lesions in the periocular region. She was initially treated for HZO for around 12 hours, followed by a rapid increase in periocular swelling and systemic deterioration with the development of sepsis. Several cases of NF following herpes zoster infection have been reported. Unfortunately, at the centre to which she presented, patient 4 had no microbiological testing at the onset of the initial vesicular rash, and no viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was sent as the disease progressed. It remains unclear if the presumed preceding viral infection led to the development of PONF or if there was a misdiagnosis at presentation.

### Subclavian vein obstruction without thrombosis [^115xYEV5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Unilateral arm swelling caused by subclavian vein obstruction without thrombosis is an uncommon form of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Among 87 patients with venous TOS, only 21 patients did not have thrombosis. This study describes the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

- **Material and methods**: Twenty-one patients with arm swelling, cyanosis, and venograms demonstrating partial subclavian vein obstruction were treated with transaxillary first rib resection and venolysis.

- **Results**: Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients experienced good-to-excellent improvement of symptoms. There were two failures (9%).

- **Conclusions**: Unilateral arm swelling without thrombosis, when not caused by lymphatic obstruction, may result from subclavian vein compression at the costoclavicular ligament. This compression may be due to the ligament or the subclavius tendon, most often because of congenital close proximity of the vein to the ligament. Arm symptoms of neurogenic TOS, pain, and paresthesia often accompany venous TOS, while neck pain and headache, other common symptoms of neurogenic TOS, are infrequent. Diagnosis was made by dynamic venography. First rib resection, which included the anterior portion of the rib and cartilage plus division of the costoclavicular ligament and subclavius tendon, proved to be an effective treatment.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^112SQW9H]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A 54-year-old male ultramarathoner presented with severe swelling, redness, and pain in bilateral lower extremities. Symptoms began a few hours after finishing a 100-mile trail-running race in eastern Texas. The race occurred in February, with ambient temperatures ranging from 44 to 76 °F. The swelling progressively worsened, and he presented to the clinic approximately 3 days after finishing. He reported having run almost continuously for over 30 hours but denied any specific injury. He denied any changes in urine color, fever, severe or focal pain, or numbness/tingling. He reported running three prior races of 100+ miles but denied any history of similar symptoms. His medical and surgical histories were unremarkable.

The patient arrived in a wheelchair but transitioned to the examination table unassisted. His vital signs were normal, and he was in no distress. Upon inspection, prominent 4+ pitting edema and moderate diffuse erythema and warmth were noted from the knees to the toes bilaterally (Fig 1). There was no purpura. The knees, ankles, and feet were nontender, and there was only mild tenderness to palpation of the lower leg muscular compartments. There was mild pain on passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Strength testing revealed mild weakness (4+/5) in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The neurovascular examination was unremarkable.

- **Figure 1**: Photographs taken of the patient's legs on day 5 after completion of the 100-mile ultramarathon race, showing mild confluent erythema and pitting edema, with a lack of petechiae or purpura.

### Unilateral parotid mass as an unusual presentation of lupus erythematosus profundus [^113dU8gp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Unilateral parotid swelling or mass in a person with lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare or underreported clinical scenario in the existing literature. This case involves a 49-year-old man who presented with such symptoms, for whom medical management of the underlying condition led to the resolution of the swelling. Lupus erythematosus profundus must be considered a differential diagnosis for unexplained parotid swelling to prevent incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary surgical intervention (e.g. parotidectomy), and the associated morbidity (e.g. facial nerve weakness, Frey's syndrome).

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rare, life-threatening necrotizing polymicrobial infection of the perineal, perianal, and genital structures, commonly occurring in diabetics, with a striking male predominance (male-to-female ratio 10:1). FG may further complicate a lower UTI or originate from different infections such as colorectal infections, anal fistulas, or pressure ulceration. Clinical presentation includes local pain, swollen edematous or gangrenous overlying skin, sometimes with appreciable crepitus, and progressive hyperthermia. FG represents a surgical emergency: aggressive surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics are required to prevent a fatal outcome.

CT is by far the best modality for imaging FG; it quickly and comprehensively visualizes the extent of FG involvement. CT features include subcutaneous fat stranding at the involved areas, fascial thickening, superficial or deep fluid, and air-attenuation collections. Subcutaneous emphysema produced by anaerobic bacteria is the hallmark of FG and is present in approximately 90% of cases. Furthermore, CT can define the starting point of the infectious process, thereby allowing differentiation of complicated perineal infections from urinary versus an alternative source, particularly cryptogenic perianal sepsis.

Clinically unsuspected, surgically treated Fournier's gangrene in a 60-year-old man with diabetes, recurrent UTIs, and scrotal swelling was initially depicted by ultrasound with prominent inflammatory thickening.

### Soft-tissue considerations in shoulder surgery in the patient with lymphedema [^1142NLop]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and often debilitating condition that results in swelling of the affected tissue. Secondary lymphedema is most commonly recognized by unilateral swelling of the ipsilateral extremity after the treatment of cancer. It is estimated that nearly 1.45 million women suffer from breast cancer-related lymphedema in the United States. The number of patients suffering from upper extremity lymphedema is expected to increase because multimodal treatment of breast cancer increases long-term survival after diagnosis. As this population ages, the likelihood of encountering a patient with concurrent lymphedema and shoulder pathology requiring orthopaedic intervention is likely to rise.

A patient with an already edematous arm and/or impaired drainage of that arm is likely to have different and more complex intraoperative and postoperative courses than patients with normal lymphatic drainage. Although a lymphedematous arm should not preclude surgical intervention, there are considerations when approaching shoulder surgery in the setting of upper extremity lymphedema that may help mitigate complications and aid the patient in their orthopaedic recovery.

### Intracranial angioleiomyoma: A case series of seven patients and review of the literature [^114brKeU]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Gadolinium enhancement showed different behaviors, with some lesions enhancing homogeneously and others inhomogeneously. Partial enhancement in the form of a "flame-like" appearance has been described by some authors to be a specific radiographic feature for angioleiomyoma, often being referred to as progressive enhancement, describing enhancement arising centrally and spreading towards the outer tumor borders. Interestingly, the partial gadolinium enhancement in our illustrative case was the decisive reason to suggest angioleiomyoma as a differential diagnosis on preoperative imaging. In all other cases, meningioma was the most common suggested differential diagnosis, along with hemangiopericytoma and neurinoma. Notably, according to our literature review, our illustrative case is only the second case ever suspected to be an angioleiomyoma preoperatively.

The difficulty in identifying angioleiomyomas preoperatively underlines the need for a better understanding of the radiographical features. However, some distinctive features compared to other entities have been reported. Meningiomas tend to show rapid maximal gadolinium enhancement and arterial blush rather than venous pooling in MR perfusion signal-time curves. Angiographically visualized arterio-venous blush in the late venous phase in iALM is shown in one of the latest iALM publications. In contrast, the dural attachment with a "dural tail sign" occurs in both meningiomas and angioleiomyomas. Furthermore, calcification and perifocal edema on CT imaging might favor the differential diagnosis of meningioma over angioleiomyoma.

### Axillary swelling and a reduced general condition in a middle-aged man [^1138n77B]. Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old man presented to his GP with an indolent swelling in his left axillary region. He also complained of a cough, a feeling of pressure in his chest, general poor health, and had increasingly suffered from night-time sweating and fever. Physical examination and an ultrasound revealed an enlarged lymph node of almost 4 cm in the left axillary region and several smaller lymph nodes of 1.5–2.0 cm in the left cervical region. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

- **Investigations**: Excisional biopsy, radiography, ultrasound, CT scan, bone marrow biopsy, radionuclide imaging, echocardiography, and lung function tests.

- **Diagnosis**: Early-stage unfavorable (intermediate) lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

- **Management**: Chemotherapy (treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and involved-field radiotherapy.

### A rare mutation causing autosomal dominant STAT1 deficiency in a South African multiplex kindred with disseminated BCG infection [^117CDhQL]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Five years after the proband presented, his well-grown, HIV-uninfected, 10-month-old maternal half-brother presented with intermittent swelling and decreased range of motion of the right middle finger and the right knee. He had received the BCG vaccine at birth and developed ulceration at the BCG vaccination site with surrounding papule formation and swollen right axillary lymph nodes. At the time, the local clinic prescribed a course of antibiotics.

At presentation, he had a healing scar at the BCG vaccination site, a small single firm lymph node with soft tissue swelling in the right axilla, uniform soft tissue swelling of the right middle finger, and normal lower limbs. Radiology showed expansion of the proximal third phalanx with multiple ill-defined lucencies (Fig. 2a) and expansion of the second left anterior rib with ill-defined lucencies consistent with multifocal osteomyelitis. Right axillary soft tissue swelling consistent with adenopathy was demonstrated. Lung fields were clear, and there was no mediastinal adenopathy (Fig. 2b).

- **Radiological images of the proband's half-brother**:
	- a) AP radiograph of the right hand demonstrates expansion of the proximal third phalanx with multiple ill-defined lucencies consistent with osteomyelitis. There is associated soft tissue swelling.
	- b) AP chest radiograph demonstrates right axillary soft tissue swelling consistent with adenopathy. There is expansion of the second left anterior rib with ill-defined lucencies consistent with osteomyelitis. A lateral x-ray confirmed the absence of mediastinal adenopathy.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^114n6G2p]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anal fissure, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend eliciting a focused medical history, performing a complete physical examination, and obtaining laboratory tests based on the suspected associated illness to rule out other causes in patients with atypical acute AF.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and clinical management of cavernous malformations of the brain and spinal cord: Consensus recommendations based on a systematic literature review by the Alliance to Cure Cavernous Malformation Clinical Advisory Board Experts Panel [^113pjkdd]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of cavernous malformations, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the ACCM 2025 guidelines recommend considering the following diagnostic criteria for cavernous malformations:

- **Typical CM appearance**: The "popcorn" appearance with a surrounding "hemosiderin ring" on T2 MRI establishes a diagnosis of CM. The presence of an associated developmental venous anomaly or multifocal CMs further confirms either sporadic/solitary or multifocal/familial disease, respectively.

- **Clustered CM diagnosis**: Multiple clustered CMs in association with a single developmental venous anomaly can be considered as solitary (clustered) CM and sporadic disease.

- **Tumor differential diagnosis**: The presence of a growing CM and/or dense contrast enhancement raises the differential diagnosis of a tumor. This can be adjudicated by histopathological biopsy on CM excision.

- **Enhancement interpretation**: Contrast enhancement in CM lesions and capillary telangiectasias should not, by itself, imply a tumor.

- **Cerebral microbleeds**: Tiny hemorrhagic lesions without any associated typical CM lesions (the "popcorn" appearance with "hemosiderin ring") may be cerebral microbleeds rather than CM. These are more common with aging and vascular risk factors, typically without a family history. It is advisable to consider genetic testing to identify evidence of mutation in a CM gene to help resolve the differential diagnosis.

- **Family history considerations**: A family history of multiple affected relatives raises the question of FCM disease, warranting genetic testing for confirmation. Multifocal CMs without an associated DVA also raise the possibility of FCM, which genetic testing can confirm.

### Monkeypox presenting as a hand consult in the emergency department: Two case reports [^115FZkuc]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Patient B is a 29-year-old man with an 11-year history of HIV, who has demonstrated poor medication compliance in the past 6 months. He presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of purulent penile discharge and a gradually worsening ulcer over the dorsum of his long finger metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ; see Figure 3). Additionally, he reported a truncal rash that began 3 weeks prior. Employed as a dishwasher, he had been repeatedly picking at the ulcer over time. Over the past week, the area around the wound became swollen, erythematous, and painful, with vesicles appearing on the dorsum of the hand.

Physical examination revealed swelling and erythema surrounding the long finger MCPJ, as well as an ulcer with hypertrophic scarring on the MCPJ dorsum, exhibiting mild tenderness upon palpation. The examination showed no pain with movement and demonstrated normal strength and sensation throughout. Apart from penile discharge and hand pain, his review of systems was largely unremarkable.

- **Diagnosis**: Hand x-ray indicated some soft tissue swelling, but no signs of osteomyelitis were present. Laboratory testing showed a CD4 count of 319 and a viral load of 156,000. An excision of the lesion was performed at bedside and sent for pathology, stain, and cultures. A urethral swab was positive for gonorrhea but negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. Blood cultures were negative. Following the development of vesicular lesions on the patient's face and arms, swabs of the vesicular fluid were sent for PCR NAAT testing, confirming a diagnosis of mpox.

### Prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of anorectal malformations: Correlating prenatal signs with postnatal outcomes [^111oHhBK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). High credibility.

- **What is already known about this topic**: The reported prenatal detection rate for anorectal malformations (ARMs) ranges from 0% to 16%. Diagnosing ARMs prenatally would allow for prenatal counseling and contribute to optimal perinatal care.

- **What does this study add**: The assessment of the target sign may aid in the prenatal differentiation between simple and complex ARMs. In patients with ARM, abnormal findings can be seen on prenatal ultrasound, which requires thorough fetal screening with ARM included in the differential diagnosis.

### Hand dermatitis and lymphoedema [^114pYYt6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hand dermatitis is common, with lymphoedema of the hand and forearm being a rare complication. The mechanism of lymphoedema in such cases is poorly understood, making management challenging. To investigate the underlying mechanism of lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis and outline recommendations for management, we identified all patients with lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis referred to our lymphoedema service, a tertiary referral centre. Treatment outcomes were assessed by telephone interviews and through correspondence with primary physicians and therapists.

In total, nine patients, six with bilateral and three with unilateral lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis, attended our service over a 4-year period. Most had long-standing bilateral pompholyx eczema. Notably, three patients reported no signs of infection prior to the onset of swelling. All patients had episodes of infection after the onset of swelling. Lymphoscintigraphy, when used, revealed a failure of small initial lymphatics of the hand to absorb and drain lymph to regional nodes. Prophylactic antibiotics, together with aggressive management of the dermatitis, often involving systemic therapy, were required to reduce swelling.

Possible mechanisms for lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis include: obliterative lymphangitis from infection, an inflammatory effect of the dermatitis on local lymphatics, or a constitutive weakness of lymph drainage exposed to chronic inflammation, or any combination of the three. Treatment is only successful once both infection and inflammation from the dermatitis are managed effectively.

### S2k guidelines (consensus statement) for diagnosis and therapy of dermatitis herpetiformis initiated by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) [^116ozbY5]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for dermatitis herpetiformis, specifically concerning differential diagnosis, the EADV 2021 guidelines recommend differentiating dermatitis herpetiformis from the following non-autoimmune diseases:

- **Atopic dermatitis and other types of eczema**: Consider differentials that include common skin conditions.

- **Multiple folliculitis**: Other follicular conditions should be ruled out.

- **Nodular or subacute prurigo**: Examine for nodular skin reactions.

- **Scabies**: Exclude parasitic infestations as a potential cause.

- **Arthropod bite reactions (papular urticaria, strophulus)**: Assess reactions to insect bites, which may mimic dermatitis herpetiformis.

### Acquired lymphangioma circumscriptum of the genitals in an individual with chronic hidradenitis suppurativa [^115FwyiK]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of genital papules is wide, and lymphangioma circumscriptum (LC) is not often considered when treating patients with this chief complaint. The vesicles and papules of LC may exhibit verrucous alterations and associated hyperkeratosis, giving them a warty appearance. This often leads to a prebiopsy diagnosis of human papillomavirus infection. Histologic examination of LC shows superficial dermal multiloculated cystic vascular spaces filled with hypocellular fluid and lined by endothelium. Although LC was acquired in our patient, the condition may also be congenital.

In most cases of localized LC, there is a predisposing tissue alteration, such as Crohn's disease, radiation exposure, or cancer. A pre-existing pathologic process likely limits the subcutaneous lymphatic cisterns from completely draining into the general lymphatic system. The accumulation of lymphatic fluid and the contraction of smooth muscle surrounding these cisterns lead to lymphatic fluid being forced into surface vesicles. In our patient, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is the only pre-existing condition near the LC lesions. His long-standing and severe HS resulted in extensive scarring in the groin and buttocks. This case is an interesting presentation because HS has rarely been associated with LC of the genitals in men.

Depending on location, the differential diagnosis of localized LC is diverse. On the genitals, the vesicles may be misdiagnosed as molluscum contagiosum, pseudoverrucous papules (PP), condyloma acuminata, or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), leading to painful and fruitless treatments or apprehension by the patient.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^115unUpV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Bupropion hydrochloride tablets can cause seizures, with the risk being dose-related. The dose should not exceed 450 mg per day, and it should be increased gradually. If a patient experiences a seizure, discontinue bupropion hydrochloride tablets and do not restart treatment.

The risk of seizures is also linked to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, a prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or those undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Conditions increasing seizure risk**: Severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, severe stroke, and the use of medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g. other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids). Metabolic disorders such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia, as well as the use of illicit drugs such as cocaine or the misuse of prescription drugs like CNS stimulants, can also increase seizure risk.

- **Additional predisposing conditions**: Diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin; use of anorectic drugs; and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

### Risk factors and prediction model for persistent breast-cancer-related lymphedema: a 5-year cohort study [^1147QsQy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

All patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) recruited in this study were diagnosed, treated, and followed up at Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center, Taiwan. Follow-up protocols were developed by the breast cancer treatment team: all patients visited the oncologist every 3 months in the first 2 years after surgery, every 6 months in the third to fifth years, and once per year thereafter. During each follow-up, patients were routinely asked by a case manager whether they noticed arm swelling, indentations, heaviness, or firm skin. They were also examined by an oncologist for arm swelling and skin texture. Patients with either subjective or objective arm swelling were referred to a physiatrist experienced in lymphedema diagnosis and management. Patients could also visit the physiatrist directly at any time during the follow-up period if they noticed arm swelling.

The initial screening of the database, conducted between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2015, identified 488 patients with BCRL.

- **Inclusion criteria**:
	- Patients who exhibited a circumference difference (CD) in both arms of greater than 1 cm as measured by the physiatrist.
	- CD in both arms of less than 1 cm but manifesting pitting edema or subcutaneous tissue hardening, or displaying symptoms of arm swelling, heaviness, or tight clothes.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Among the identified patients, 146 were excluded from the study due to:
	- Stage IV cancer (n = 53)
	- Having chest wall or axillary local recurrence (n = 37)
	- Bilateral breast cancer (n = 34)

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111D73BA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anorectal abscess, the AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend considering imaging investigations (MRI, CT, or anorectal ultrasound depending on the specific clinical scenario and available skills and resources) for patients with suspected anorectal abscess in cases of atypical presentation. This is particularly important if there is suspicion of occult supralevator abscesses, complex anal fistula, or perianal Crohn's disease.

### Severe unilateral orbitopathy in a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis - a case report [^117UCSkL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Although unilateral exophthalmos tends to occur more frequently in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients, it is not a typical manifestation of thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO) and necessitates a broader differential diagnosis. In such patients, orbital neoplasms, such as lymphoma, benign tumors (e.g. rhabdomyomas, hamartomas), and metastases to the orbit should be excluded primarily. Additionally, specific orbital inflammation (e.g. due to sarcoidosis or systemic lupus erythematosus), orbital myositis, vascular malformations, infections, neuromuscular dysfunctions, orbital pseudotumor/non-specific orbital inflammation, cavernous sinus thrombosis, sphenoid meningioma, and IgG4-related ophthalmic disease require consideration.

Unfortunately, the patient's IgG4 concentration level was not measured, which represents a limitation of our report. However, our patient had a negative history of any rheumatoid disorders, no signs of involvement of other organs, and the MRI findings were not typical of IgG4 disease presentation (i.e. lacrimal glands were not involved). In fact, MRI is the method of choice in the differential diagnosis of TAO due to its great potential for tissue differentiation and its capability of multiple-plane imaging without exposure to ionizing radiation.
